"MatthewInSydney","8","166","191","14 April 2009"," Mary & Max - wonderfully unique and personal animation
","There's a constant stream of animated films these days, but mostly they're either glossy Hollywood product (Pixar/Dreamworks), or Japanese anime. For adults wanting something different we have to wait for the likes of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Waltz With Bashir, Persepolis, or Aardman's films to turn up. Mary & Max is one of these films that comes as a complete departure from all the others, both in visual and storytelling style, and sticks in the mind because of it. I won't repeat the plot here, so I'll just mention a few pros and cons. The cons are obvious. Some people will be put off by the almost constant narration (which took me a while to get used to), the rather numerous calamities (a lot more than you'd expect if you thought this was just a kids film), and the sadness within some of these people's stories. It's actually a little surprising that the film got made without the people financing it demanding a script that was more tailored to appeal to a wider audience. What we get is something that feels a whole lot more personal than the higher profile animated films. It feels personal, and therefore real, and the explanation is that it was written from life by a director who has a real feeling and sympathy for people who don't quite fit into the world, and feel alienated or are misunderstood by others. Mary was partly inspired by the director's own childhood (and there's a little bit of Toni Collette's Muriel Heslop thrown in I suspect), and Max is also based on a real person he's been pen friends with (but so far has never met in person). The way the film handles his Asperger's Syndrome just feels different to how you'd normally see such an issue handled on screen. There's a constant stream of humour (ironic, black, childish), and I really enjoyed the small perfect touches on growing up in an Australian suburb in the 70's and 80's, and the depiction of grey New York, as it appears to the easily frightened Max. The animation is constantly a joy to watch, and I highly recommend seeing it on the big screen where it can be properly appreciated in all it's hand-made glory."
"jon-larsen","9","54","61","31 October 2010"," Masterpiece!
","To say it short, this movie is about a friendless 8 year old girl in Australia who befriends an obese 44 year old male in New York by writing mails to each other.<br/><br/>I'm not a big animation fan, so I wasn't looking forward to see this movie. I am currently working on the IMDb Top 250 list and Mary and Max just entered the IMDb top 250, so I took a look at it.<br/><br/>I watched it with a small screen on my computer while chatting with someone on Facebook. But then I logged out because I got hooked by the fantastic but sad narration mixed with humor by Barry Humphries, so I watched it with a big screen. Thank God that I did that, because this is an unforgettable and heartbreaking cinematic experience! It got fantastic narration and dialogue that will make you laugh and cry!<br/><br/>PS.There are many scenes that will choke you up, so bring some tissues.<br/><br/>PSS.Don't watch this movie with your kids!<br/><br/>I hope this review was useful!"
"manicman84","10","81","96","22 March 2010"," lovely oddball and admirably complex
","Coming from Australia, Mary and Max is one of these few films you'll remember all your life. This amazing claymation touches upon an unlikely friendship between two pen pals: a young girl living in Australia and an aging Jew from New York. It's unbelievable what a precisely structured narrative this is. Director-writer Adam Elliot blends odd scatological, yet clever humour with poignant dramatizations to a splendid effect creating one of the best tragicomedies of the past few years. The fact that it's in the form of claymation only helps to enhance uniqueness of the whole experience. The movie was 5 years in the making and this is visible in its every frame. Elliot masterly captures the motion in an endlessly creative manner. Most importantly though, his lovably oddball characters are well developed and admirably complex with all their awkward traits and quirks. Due to its serious themes and dark tone, Mary and Max is an adult movie aiming much higher than its big studio counterparts. It happens to be more contemplative, and intelligent mimicking the real life with all its ups and downs. Calling Elliot's movie an extraordinary piece of art is certainly not an overstatement."
"ori_64","10","126","154","21 August 2009"," So excellent, that I couldn't recommend it more!
","It's hard to describe just how excellent this film is. The story is great, both very funny and touching. The art-design and animation are a delight, thoughtful, very rich in details, and very consistent in style. The music is great. The storyline and direction... I can't find a bad word to say, except that the story drags a little half- way through, but then picks itself up again toward the end. Truly, a must-see. If you like adult animation, this is definitely for you. I agree with those comparing it to Aardman films, Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis, but this movie's animation is so professional, that only Aardman truly compares."
"asphodelfilms","8","113","140","16 February 2009"," Witty, well observed and wondrous
","I went into this film at the Berlinale with mixed feelings. I knew that Adam Elliot's shorts were great but frankly the last few years haven't been great for Australian films and a number of short filmmakers have made disappointing first features.<br/><br/>But right from the opening frame, this film shattered any of my doubts. It's so refreshing to see a film told with such a strong unique vision and pulled off so effortlessly. This is made even more remarkable not only as it's made using stop motion animation but also because of the characters and subject matter it tackles.<br/><br/>Mary is an 8 year old outcast living in the suburbs of Melbourne. On a whim, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40's living in New York, suffering from Aspergers Syndrome. A friendship is born as the pair exchange letters over the next 20 years. offering each other support, advice and the chance to see life through another set of eyes.<br/><br/>While the world is painted in gloomy hues of brown and grey and the characters lead bleak lives, the genius of the script is that the characters never wallow or feel sorry for themselves. The tone is kept humorous and balanced allowing us to be moved by the characters as they stumble through life but also laugh at their foibles and observations of the world they struggle to fit into. Not since Muriel's Wedding has Australia produced so fine a comedy with such rich detail and I probably got even more laughs out of this.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the film would be some of its music particularly its use in one key scene of the Humming Chorus (already used so memorably in the finale of Heavenly Creatures). It meant that in a critical moment I was thinking of Kate Winslet up to no good instead of connecting with Mary & Max. But this is more a personal concern and if that's the weakest thing about the film, it's doing pretty well. I hope this film is seen by the wide audience it so richly deserves."
"Likes_Ninjas90","8","86","106","10 April 2009"," Refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved.
","In Australia in 1976, a young girl named Mary (voiced by Bethany Whitmore) is a lonely child looking for a friend. She lives with both her parents but her mother is a chain smoking drunk and a thief and her father, who works in a factory putting the strings on teabags, would rather spend time with his collection of dead birds. Mary remains curious about life and finds the address of an American living in New York. She writes him a letter to become his pen pal. The recipient is Max (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a severely overweight Jewish hypochondriac and full-time no-hoper. Gradually, as they send each other letters, Mary and Max's relationship develops and we begin to learn more about their past and their heartache and insecurities of being alone.<br/><br/>Following the short animated film, Harvey Krumpet, director Adam Elliot has constructed his first full feature claymation picture, displaying as much skill as many of the major mainstream studios. The film has been immaculately designed, with many tiny details and features placed into the sets, all of which would have taken many countless hours to mould. The lighting and colour scheme too are significant to the unique look of the film, ranging from highly saturated to almost entirely black and white, to reflect the self-depreciative and sometimes gloomy tone of the narrative. It is a film made of great patience and craftsmanship.<br/><br/>Yet the strongest asset of the film is the humour of the screenplay. Whereas many mainstream animated films such as Shrek and The Incredibles adopt a great deal of hilarity from their pop culture references, Elliot has an eye for the simpler things in life. From the way Mary and Max share their eating habits of chocolate hot dogs, to how Max describes his past jobs, including a street cleaner and a member of the Communist Party, the humour of the film remains truly original, bizarre and often very witty. Elliot excels in his ability write about the most normal things and then turn them on their heads, or degrade his miserable characters in the most hilarious way. Yet there are moments of poignancy too, such as where Mary describes her difficulty at school as she is teased for the birthmark on her forehead, that provide the film's screenplay with a subtext - no matter how simple â€“ about isolation and the need for friends.<br/><br/>The use of Barry Humphries' voice over to convey much of the story is initially highly annoying and intrusive. In the opening scenes it feels overly used and distracting from the story and the detail of the scenes. Gradually though, as the film moves from its opening exposition, the voice over is used slightly less and its scarcity achieves the storybook quality and poetry that it deserves. Barry Humphries reads his lines beautifully. The rest of the voice actors too are splendid. Philip Seymour Hoffman is again in fine form, adding a slight accent to his voice and the decision to model his voice with a character of a similar physique fits nicely. He is quickly become one of the most diverse actors in the world. Bethany Whitmore as the young Mary is equally impressive too and her voice has a real innocence about it. Toni Collette and Eric Bana also have much smaller roles too. It is a well thought out voice cast and while some of the minor characters verge on grotesque, there is still a real sweetness about this film that carries it.<br/><br/>Elliot has described his film as being suitable for everyone. This is rather optimistic. I don't know how particularly young children, who have been conditioned by the more mainstream animated titles, would appreciate the film. It is extremely funny for the most part, but there is also a real sense of gloom around these characters that might not be as appealing to children. And towards the end, the film, despite being well under two hours, begins to lose a bit of momentum as the characters wave in and out of their depleted lives. Perhaps the films message of learning to live with your flaws and accepting the path life has given you is something that children, even if they don't entirely understand now though, needs to be seen anyway. Regardless, it remains a mostly sharp and funny film that many will find refreshing and engaging given the home-grown talent involved."

","In 1976, in Australia, the misfit and outcast eight-year old girl Mary Daisy Dinkle lives in Mount Waverley with her alcoholic shoplifter mother Vera Lorraine Dinkle that is addicted in Sherry and her absent father Noel Norman Dinkle that works in the Earl Grey Factory attaching strings in the teabag and spends his leisure time in his hobby - taxidermy. Mary has absolutely no friends and is teased by her schoolmate Benny Clifford. She has a complex because of her brown birthmark in the forehead and she adores her favorite cartoon The Noblets that she watches with her rooster Ethel and condensed milk.

He frequently goes to the Overeaters Anonymous Meeting. Max does not have any friend, only the invisible Mr. Ravioli, and also loves The Noblets. His life goals are to have a friend, Noblets and chocolate. One day, Mary picks Max address out of an American phone-book and she decides to write to him to ask from where babies come in America. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship oscillates due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.<br/><br/>""Mary and Max"" is an unforgettable and heartbreaking bleak tale of friendship and loneliness. The story is bittersweet and witty, with an ironic black humor and provokes the most conflictive emotions in the viewers, funny in a moment, and depressive in the other. The excellent animation follows the dark style of Tim Burton and the screenplay is a profound insight in human behavior. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Mary and Max â€“ Uma Amizade Diferente"" (""Mary and Max â€“ A Different Friendship"")"
"d-b_tas-1","10","91","123","26 May 2009"," Great Movie
","I thought this movie was very well made. I can relate to Max's character, as i work with people who have Asperges Syndrome. The creator showed the audience what it is really like, in society, to have a mental disability of this kind. The use of gray colour with a splash of red when showing the scenes with Max, was very effective, and give the audience the sense of what Max was feeling. I saw this movie with work colleagues who also work with children with this disorder, and we were all curious to see how this disorder would be shown. We were all very pleased. <br/><br/>This movie shows the audience what people with asperges syndrome go through in day to day life, and how they don't understand things that most people would. As well as how they do/do not cope with some issues.<br/><br/>This movie is not for children. It is quite sad, but with some really funny parts. and for those who live in Melbourne, especially, you will understand some of the references.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10.<br/><br/>After 5 years in the making it is definitely worth watching"

"jvframe","10","83","125","23 May 2009"," It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.
","Oscar winning (and proudly gay) animation artist Adam Elliot's acclaimed clay-mation feature film ""Mary & Max"" is astoundingly rewarding wonderful entertainment on the big screen. <br/><br/>It's an intriguing tale, starting in the mid seventies, of the ongoing true friendship of two long distance pen-pals, younger Mary in rural Australia and older Max in the rat-race of New York City. A significant element of the story involves Max's experience of living with Asperger Syndrome, knowing painfully full well that he senses the world in a radically different way to most. I've never seen any other project deal so honestly and powerfully with that condition. It's a genuine celebration of the value of difference.<br/><br/>There's lots to laugh and think about - and the attention to detail is staggering. Australia's living legend Barry Humphries excels as the narrator. <br/><br/>I loved the soundtrack which strongly featured two of my favourite Penguin Cafe Orchestra compositions. I've ordered the soundtrack CD already."
"anthonyjlangford","9","59","90","4 May 2009"," And you thought Dial-up was slow....
","A couple of claymation misfits who are worlds apart, form an unlikely dialog, in a pre-Internet age where it takes weeks to get a reply.<br/><br/>There is a growing trend amongst publishers and in Hollywood, where the writer is strongly urged to rather show the story rather than tell it. This is fine for certain works, especially action films, but I personally believe that the aforementioned edict is a steaming pile of moronic dribble. People are more than intelligent enough to garner rich satisfaction from being provided a story in any form as long as the story itself holds interest. Its worked fine for all the classics in literature, most of which are still being read in droves, but many believe that audiences are stupid and need to shown everything and must capture their attention in the first five seconds. Indeed, most manuscripts are rejected based upon their first page, a ridiculous scenario.<br/><br/>In this case, there is much in the way of telling via the voice-over of the wondrous Barry Humphries and yet the visuals provide us with an extra layer on information, working with the voice-over rather than being hindered by it. Occasionally it goes on too long, but Adam Elliot is incredibly brave in wanting to tell this story his way. Aside from stylistic similarities to his earlier shorts, he has remained true to himself. He thanks a lot of people in regards to his script; its clear he has made the effort to get it right, proving the basic notion in screen writing, is to get right on the page first folks. The script is a gem, finding the humor in a rather grim tale, without ever being patronizing to the characters or their plight. If anything, he manages to reinforce their humanity.<br/><br/>The choice of music is ideal, setting a tone that is complimentary and yet as though these classical pieces were designed specifically for this wide, but often claustrophobic gray universe. I hope audiences embrace it on the big screen as there is glorious detail lurking in the background, providing an extra chuckle or irony for the keen eye. If there was ever a reason to leave the home theater, this is it. Mary and Max is a brilliant, entertaining work of visual art combined with depth and grace.<br/><br/>There was a couple of moments when I raised eyebrows at certain things that didn't fit correctly for the late seventies, such as the mention of Stephen Hawking as well as cigarette patches (which debuted in the early 90's) but otherwise this laugh out loud, tear to the eye unique celluloid experience is one of the standouts of the year."
"StrayButlerReturns","9","13","19","4 February 2010"," Sublime film of warmth, humour and power
","In this cinematic era of computer animation, the art of claymation (for which hand-moulded figurines are painstakingly photographed one frame at a time) is slowly dissolving. Aardman Studios (the guys behind Wallace and Gromit) seem to be the only ones who still possess the patience required to continue the practise into the 21st Century. It's therefore refreshing to witness the Australian film Mary and Max (the feature film debut of Adam Elliot, who won an Oscar for his short film Harvie Krumpet), which was created using this claymation method to tell a bizarre, sweet and mature story. Tremendously inventive, clever, hilarious and wise, Mary and Max is a sublime movie of warmth and compassion about life's dissonances. The animation is superb, the characters are endearing, the humour is abundant, and it honestly and thoroughly explores several topical themes. If American Beauty director Sam Mendes collaborated with Aardman Animations, the product would be something like Mary and Max.<br/><br/>Based partly on Elliot's own life experiences, Mary and Max is a feature about two people leading a mundane existence on the fringe of society; finding solace only in their heartfelt pen-pal letters to each other. Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced by Bethany Whitmore and Toni Collette) is a chubby, friendless 8-year-old living in the suburbs of Melbourne with her neglectful parents. One day, Mary randomly selects a name from the Manhattan phone book and writes a letter to him. She chooses Max Horovitz (Hoffman); a severely obese 44-year-old Jewish man with Asperger's Syndrome living in the chaos of New York City. It turns out they have a lot in common - beyond loneliness and a complete lack of friends, they share a love of chocolate and a TV show called The Noblets. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, with their friendship surviving more than the average diet of life's ups and downs.<br/><br/>There's plenty of playful narration (almost constant) courtesy of Aussie legend Barry Humphries which gives the film the feel of a children's tale, but Mary and Max is not for kids. The movie doesn't shy away from covering an array of mature, confronting issues, such as depression, sexuality, suicide, obesity and mental illness. Unlike most mainstream movies in which friendship saves the day and everybody is happy, Mary and Max is unmistakably dark - both physically dark, and dark in its depiction of reality. Max is never able to lose weight, and Mary can never escape the shadow of her parents. Mary eternally resides in her brown-tinged Melbourne suburb, while Max's New York City is depicted as a grey metropolis whose only bright colours are those that come from Mary (a red pompom, for instance). The predominantly colourless and ominous cityscape of NYC is clearly symbolic of Max's melancholy, mental distress and isolation. The ending in particular underlines the film's dark disposition; showing that in real life there may be happy middles, but happy endings are almost non-existent. But despite this, Mary and Max is by no means a highly depressing venture; it's a cinematic delight, with its downbeat content matched by constant laughs, a super- abundance of heart, and several deeply moving moments. Somehow, all of this is squeezed into an 85-minute timeframe, which at times feels longer due narrative simplicity and the occasional pacing issues. This is probably to be expected, however, as Elliot has only previously worked on shorts.<br/><br/>Even though a mere claymation short could take up to a year to create, old-school animators such as Adam Elliot and his team display a palpable affection for this approach. Mary and Max spent a total of five years in the making, with six dedicated animation teams working under Elliot's direction in a converted factory in Melbourne, and each team creating an average of 4 seconds of footage per day. A huge kudos to Adam Elliot and his claymation team for creating such a vivid, picturesque world here, with the grim landscape evoking a film-noir feel. Every one of the characters, created from plasticine, is intricately and lovingly detailed. The detail does generate the illusion that we're watching a computer-animated movie, yet the painstaking claymation process affords a look, feel and soul that has yet to be replicated through computers. One must have patience and passion to undertake a stop-motion feature of such scale, and these are two qualities Adam Elliot infinitely exerts.<br/><br/>Another tremendous pleasure of Mary and Max is the voice cast; a cornucopia of vocal talent from across the globe. Without a doubt, Philip Seymour Hoffman has proved one of the most versatile actors of recent years with his exceptional vocal work (Capote, anyone?), and he's virtually unrecognisable here. This is, of course, the true essence of voice acting - a viewer should not be given the chance to focus on the actor providing the voice, but instead the character they are voicing. Meanwhile Bethany Whitmore is effortlessly endearing as the young Mary, and Toni Collette is pitch-perfect as Mary in her later years.<br/><br/>Through an immense artistry as well as an evident maturity emanated by the makers, Mary and Max affirmatively and genuinely answers a potent question: is there someone for everyone? In adulthood, we understand that we're born into our families but choose our friends, and the 20- year friendship between these two vastly different yet curiously similar individuals proves the theory. Adam Elliot's ambitious first feature- length claymation movie is an absolute delight, merging witty laughs with heartfelt emotion to generate this genuinely moving slice of animation. Mary and Max is, at least for this reviewer's money, the best animated motion picture of 2009 (yes, better than Up). After the terrific Harvie Krumpet and now this, it's clear Elliot is a highly talented filmmaker one should keep an eye on in future years."

","Mary Daisy Dinkle (Bethany Whitmore/ Toni Collette) is an unfortunate 8-year old living in Mount Waverly Australia in 1976. Her mother is an alcoholic, chain-smoking kleptomaniac and her father is a reclusive blue collar worker who attaches the strings to tea packets. Mary has no friends. Despite having an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead and generally being teased and bullied by the other children at school, Mary is an incredibly curious child that is keen on learning everything she can about the world.<br/><br/>One day while her mother is out 'borrowing' supplies from the local post-office, Mary hits upon the idea of writing someone on the other side of the world to ask whether or not babies come from the same place as they do in Australia. According to her grandfather, who has recently passed away at the start of the film, babies come from the bottom of beer glasses, a fact that Mary is utterly intrigued by and one she is compelled to explore further. <br/><br/>After randomly selecting a prospective pen-pal in New York City, she sends her crudely scribbled inquiries to a Mr. Max Jerry Horowitz (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), as well as a bar of chocolate. Max is a morbidly obese, middle-aged Jew-turned-Athiest that lives alone at the top of a decaying domicile. He attends Overeaters Anonymous meetings and is prone to severe anxiety attacks. Plagued by his eccentricities and his inability to form meaningful relationships with anyone, Max is gripped by a sudden uncontrollable panic attack after reading Mary's letter. Eventually he responds to his new pen-pal and the two begin a correspondent friendship that last several decades.<br/><br/>I believe Mary and Max to be one of those rare treasures you stumble upon accidentally and never quite forget. Its an absolutely beautiful story rich in both the mastery and detail of the animation and also memorable character development. Elliot does a superb job of crafting characters that are ultimately shaped by their idiosyncrasies. Also the atmospheres he create for both Mary and Max make you fully appreciate the respective isolation felt by each title character. In one realm you have Max's noirish New York that represents his inherent pessimism and distrust. With Mary you have a muted Sepia feeling that represents parental neglect and abandonment.<br/><br/>It's a clever black comedy that left me incredibly refreshed and pleased with my Saturday Night.<br/><br/>Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website"

","""Mary and Max"" is a difficult movie to review.<br/><br/>A good place to begin is by pointing out that Adam Elliot painstakingly created a broken world here. The inhabitants of this world are, with few exceptions, wounded or maimed. It is a world not governed by a loving God, but by chance.<br/><br/>By chance, Max Jerry Horovitz has asperger's syndrome.<br/><br/>By chance, Mary Daisy Dinkle was born with a birth mark that looks like a poo stain, has an alcoholic mother, and stumbles upon a stray rooster.<br/><br/>By chance, the two become pen pals.<br/><br/>Mary and Max's lives and relationship with one another are at the heart of movie. Both have miserable/nonexistent family structures. Both are so alienated from society that two of their main sources of pleasure come from eating and watching a television show called ""The Noblets."" About halfway through the movie, I came to the realization that ""Mary and Max"" is really a portrait of contemporary, industrialized societies. War, poverty, alcoholism, bullying, obesity, mind-numbing careers, distrust, distorted body images, suicide, mental illness, loneliness, half-hearted self-help books - heck, even siphoning off charitable donations is covered in a quick 80 minutes.<br/><br/>One of Elliot's most impressive accomplishments in the movie is the pace: we feel the sluggishness and lethargy of the two main characters.<br/><br/>Yet, Elliot also treats us to many disarmingly hilarious scenes. One minute you'll be cringing, the next you'll be genuinely moved, and in a blink, you'll be grinning ear to ear. Sounds like a microcosm of life itself.<br/><br/>The quotation that closes ""Mary and Max"" invokes God in a surprising way. I honestly don't know what to make of it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Mary and Max"" is a work of high art and one of the finest movies I have seen in a long time. It will stay with you. A must see."

","I hate it when people assume that animation can only be for little kids. Why should an entire medium be relegated to a demographic unlikely to fully appreciate all the work that went into the detail and animation of this stop-motion world? That's not to say that children can't watch this movie - anything ""inappropriate"" will likely go over their heads - but it is a bit depressing. <br/><br/>I don't have a lot to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Everything from the animation to the voice acting to the story is absolutely fantastic and I would highly recommend watching."
"moviemanMA","10","22","41","29 October 2009"," An animated life
","In 2004, Adam Elliot took home Oscar gold with his animated short film Harvie Krumpet, a film about the life of a simple man named Harvie Krumpet who tries to learn as much as he can about life. He used stop motion animation, a form of animation that is most commonly linked with TV Christmas specials like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. The film is somewhat grim, funny, and heartfelt, something that this type of animation is rarely scene with.<br/><br/>Five years later, Elliot comes back with his first feature film Mary and Max. As impressed as I was with Harvie Krumpet I was doubly impressed with this one. He uses the same style of animation only this time his skills are much more precise, detailed, and effective. He tells the story of Mary Daisy Dinkle, a young girl living in 1970s Australia who has no friends except for her pet rooster and favorite television show. One day she decides to reach out across the world to someone who might be her friend. She finds a New York City phone book picks out a random name: Max Jerry Horovitz.<br/><br/>Max lives alone in his apartment with his one eyed cat and pet fish (who he needs to constantly replace). He is an overweight, middle aged man with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism. He too has no friends and is in need of some companionship, although he is somewhat afraid of the outside world and strangers. He finally decides to write her back, and the two begin their friendship across the sea.<br/><br/>The film is comprised of narration, by Barry Humphries, and voice over from Mary and Max reading their letters, voiced by Bethany Whitmore as younger Mary, Toni Collette as older Mary, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Max. Their letters and the in between narration is hysterical and incredibly clever. I like the little tidbits we are given like the way Mary's mother drinks her sherry and how Max eats chocolate hot dogs, his own recipe. They make the characters more interesting.<br/><br/>Elliot creates a vivid world filled with right and wrong. He uses colors to define the two different continents, giving Australia brown and earthy tones while New York is black, white, and everything in between, with the exception of a red pompom that Mary sends Max. Much like their separate worlds, they both blend in as if no one else would notice them. These characters are simple, average people who go the distance to make their lives a little more comfortable. It's sublime to see these characters grow up through the years and age and learn. We become so attached.<br/><br/>There is so much to love about this movie. The quirky little one liners to the incredibly detailed and well done stop motion animation. Each character has clearly defined features, unique movement, and like so many stop motion pieces, there is nothing jumpy or out of place about the animation. It is smooth, coherent, and compelling to watch. As impressive as it is the writing is just as good. You really get a feeling for these characters through the narration and their writing. If there was some way you could help them out you would. They are just so lovable.<br/><br/>This is one of the best films I have seen this year. It's a wonderful film aimed at a more mature audience. I don't know if it can compete with Disney and Pixar's Up, but I wouldn't be surprised to see this at least get a nomination from the Academy, as it has already been honored at this year's Berlin International Film Festival. It's a great achievement when a film can make you feel so happy the entire way through."

","Mary and Max are two individuals which are poles apart from each other, live in separate continents and have an age difference of more than 30. But there is something which makes them care about and think about each other. It is the great relation of friendship. We hear that our best friends are those who accept us along with our faults and shortcomings. Mary and Max are the best examples of that. Mary is a 8 year old girl from Australia and Max is a 40 somewhat obese guy from New York. Both have some things common such as they have no friends, love a particular Cartoon and have the fetish for Chocolate. They interact with each other through letters which reveals to the viewer their life story .Sorry, if I missed to mention that this is an animated movie - Not ordinary but clay animation. It is somewhat difficult to emote through clay animation but this movie does not suffer from that. The movie is filled with dark, satirical humor but you never feel offended by it. Along with it, it has it's 'cry buckets' moments which really move you. I will certainly call it a very matured animation movie by a newbie director. It is right up there in my list of favorite animations.<br/><br/>Rating : 8/10"
"Marjeez","8","7","11","23 July 2010"," Depression, Suicide, Drugs, Sex, Death
","Mary and Max is a well-crafted film for adults; it deals with depression, suicide, drugs, sex, and death. The plot is basic but the film is anything but. Mary lives in Australia and Max lives in New York. Both have lonely, depressing lives, until one day they become pen pals and their lives change for better/worse. I am excessively surprised how polished this low-budget film is. The attention to detail is unparalleled, and it might be one of the most unique animated film ever created, not based on the plot, but what occurs throughout the film and the themes you'll see. You will be wowed by their relationship and dialog and may even be able to relate to them. My only complaint is that I did not feel the emotion that many others felt. The creators did a poor job of portraying the sad occurrences in the film through screen; no need for tissues. Stop-motion movies are a rare form of cinema, and it is movies like Mary and Max that prove that stop-motion is one of the premier ways to tell a story."

","Simple and blunt, the 2009 animated flick, Mary and Max, is a fantastic film and cinematic accomplishment. A beautiful, funny and touching story that delivers on all fronts of meaningful film-making.<br/><br/>In comparable style to Wallace and Gromit, the film uses it's charming and silly style to great effect by relating two unique characters. A middle-aged man with social disabilites named Max Jerry Horovitz receives a letter one day from an inquisitive little Australian girl named Mary Daisy Dinkle. The two via letters relate to one another instantly, and an amazing bond of friendship begins.<br/><br/>About 2 hours ago I finished watching this flick and I'm still beaming. It's really a special, special film that just screams perfection. I feel bad for the people who'll look at the cover and dismiss it due to being animated, as this will most undoubtedly happen. But lucky for me and you, huh?"

It shows how irreplaceable and constant is the friendship of our human being, and shows how far-reaching is our relationship to us.

","One of my favourites of 2009, Mary and Max is a truly unforgettable film in all respects. The clay animation is just gorgeous with all the characters well modelled and the colours done in atmospheric shades, and gives a nostalgic and unique feel to it, and the music is beautiful and heart-breaking. The characters add a lot to the film as well, the title characters are sweet, emphatic and engaging, with Mary very cute and Max endearing in his own way, and the audience sympathises with them and their predicaments, while the writing is both funny and poignant and the haunting, affecting and personal story packs a real emotional punch on its own and is thematically quite deep. The voice work is top notch, Barry Humphries provides a both amusing and gentle narrative and Toni Collette(Bethany Whitmore as the younger Mary) and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann are brilliant as Mary and Max. What made Mary and Max other than the superb direction and gentle pacing was the adept mix of hilarious humour and poignant drama, there is evidence of both and both are done wonderfully. Overall, a beautiful, unforgettable film with a 10/10. Bethany Cox"
"alice_imk2005","9","7","12","12 July 2010"," Sad, but makes you smile
","It's interesting to see how a friendship can be so deep and so well outlined, without the actual meeting of the two main characters. Even though pen friends, the bound between Mary and Max takes shape quickly, due to the lack of friends that both of them struggle with. But we can easily understand that this is not because of them, but because of the society: they are both caring and willing to give their advice to whoever wants or needs it.<br/><br/>Brief, this is a story of two underrated members of two superficial communities who have the luck to find each other. The plot is sad and the ending is even sadder - but it makes you smile in the end, thinking that anyone can find a friend, exactly when they less expect."
"MartinHafer","10","6","10","1 January 2011"," After seeing his previous films, I just had to watch this one...
","Having already watched several of Adam Elliot's other films (""Harvey Krumpet"", ""Brother"", ""Cousin"" and ""Uncle""), I felt a strong compulsion to watch ""Mary and Max"". After all, these other films were wonderful and very original and you find yourself hooked when you watch them--though you probably won't know why. Now, with Elliot's latest film, I have a chance to finally watch a feature-length version of his wonderful and very strange work.<br/><br/>The film begins in Australia and concerns a very lonely girl named Mary. Her parents are completely inept at parenting and mostly she entertains herself. One day, on a lark, she rips a name out of an American phone book and writes to a ""M. Horowitz""--telling him about herself as well as asking him where babies come from in America. As Max Horowitz is a socially inept odd-ball, his response to her strange letter is amusing to say the least. And, through their ensuing letters to each other they become friends--an 8 year-old girl and a 40+ year-old man and the film consists of showing each writing and narrating their letters. <br/><br/>Where this bizarre business goes, you'll just need to see for yourself. However, without spoiling the film, I can safely say that I never, ever could predict where the film would go next!! Like all of Adam Elliot films, the film is just plain odd--with a delightful strangeness you can't help but like. And, even more than his shorter films, you can't believe how much time and effort he took to make this movie. It's amazing....really. And, fortunately, his work is totally unique and inventive. Aside from his previous shorts, I've never seen anything like it--and I am pretty sure you'll feel the same way if you try this delightfully strange film. Just don't try to understand or make sense of it...it might just make your brain explode. Oh, and do NOT watch it if you are feeling depressed. Although it's got lots of funny moments, the film is VERY, VERY dark--so much so that you should think twice before watching it. And, although the film looks like a kids movie, I would probably think twice before showing it to young kids."
"rasecz","10","9","17","28 May 2010"," Bittersweet animated story masterfully executed
","Clamation has become popular with the duo of Wallace and Gromit. Until ""Mary and Max"", Nick Park's creations were tops. Now this film has claimed the acme. It does it by a masterful combination of uncannily perfect story telling, imaginative self-deprecating characters, well-managed timing in plot development, a fair amount of humor balanced with endearing bittersweetness, and wonderful animation that serves the story's needs perfectly.<br/><br/>The story is one of contesseration by a young girl in Australia of a randomly chosen older man in the USA. It is based on real events, though the script writer almost certainly added embellishments and the kinds of twists and turns that make for a compelling story. Watching ""Mary and Max"" is like reading a book you cannot let go. The story is so unusual, so original, so endearing, so fascinating, that it grabs you right from the start and keeps you in its grip to the end. The events are so well timed, the surprises so well placed, that we never loose our curiosity for the characters, for the evolving plot, for the possible endings. It's constant fascination.<br/><br/>There is a good deal of humor. Some outright riots. Yet there are many bittersweet moments. It even succeeds in being a deeply felt tearjerker. It will make you laugh and cry at the same time. A rare and precious combination.<br/><br/>In short, ""Mary and Max"" is a masterpiece. Don't miss it!"

","Its been 24 hours since I've seen Mary and Max and find I've been deeply affected by the film. Its the story of a little girl who needs to know somethings so she writes a letter to a random person in America only to connect with an sweet man with some decided peculiar ways. What happens after that is a series of ups and downs that happen over the course of 20 years. A unique film its possibly the best animated film from 2009, and its one of the best films of the year. Rarely has a film left me so emotionally moved, certainly there are even fewer that have made me feel this way many hours after the fact. I feel as though I'm carrying the characters and emotions around inside me. And in a way I'm at a loss for words. A beautifully animated film with dialog that is witty and wise and wonderful, this is a marvelously made film. However its the characters where it shines. All of the characters, even if they are somewhat clichÃ©, are painfully real. We know someone like everyone of them. Your heart goes out to them and is carried by them because they are so real. Its the characters we remember and we return to and who carry the film even as the second half gets messy. A masterpiece."
"pere-25366","10","5","8","30 June 2016"," Mary and Max - A tale of friendship
","""The reason I forgive you is because you are not perfect. You are imperfect. And so am I. All humans are imperfect."" It is pretty rare to connect so deeply with an animated film. The animated aspect can often serve as a barrier that prevents people from deeply identifying with the characters they are witnessing on screen and therefore prevents them from deeply caring for them. With Mary and Max, this couldn't be farther from the truth. This is a film that I think I, and many others, will remember for a long time.<br/><br/>This film is a poignant clay-animation film that records the 20 year relationship between two social eccentrics. Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced by Bethany Whitmore as a child and Toni Colette as an adult), is a lonely 8 year old who lives in Austrailia who loves condensed milk, her pet rooster and a smurfs-like show called The Noblets. At school, she is teased because of having an unlucky birthmark on her forehead. Max Jerry Horowitz (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a morbidly obese, 44 year old formerly Jewish atheist who, due to mental and social problems, has trouble forming close bonds with people. Their lives both change when Mary fortuitously choose a fellow lonely soul to write to. The quirkiness that separated them in society ultimately links these two pen pals together.<br/><br/>The creative idea to use Claymation helps the audience in seeing the films protagonists not merely as characters but as fellow human beings. This is further established by the strong, and true to life, humanization this film creates of its characters. Upon viewing, it is clear that director Adam Elliot's masterful creation was a painstaking process, further solidified when the viewer take one look at the beautiful landscape showcased in each frame of this film. Every detail is manually drawn up with considerable care and beauty (according to Elliot, every detail!). Elliot calls his films Clayography, a portmanteau for 'clay animated biography', each taking 5 years to materialize.<br/><br/>In short, the story is a bittersweet tale of friendship that will have you in a mix of emotions come the movie's end. My simply writing about the enthralling animation and creative brilliance would not do this wonderful film justice; it is simply, to recite a common clichÃ©, a matter of experiencing it yourself to fully appreciate it. A film that can so deftly juxtapose its humorous and heartbreaking moments are so rare and Mary and Max seems to be able to pull this off so effortlessly. The witty dialogue, the majestic narration of Barry Humphries, the transient theme music - that almost reminds me of the Friday Night Lights intro song, in the sense that it takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that includes happiness, sadness, hope, regret in its short duration.<br/><br/>Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves a lot of praise for how he approached Max's character. His voice was tailored perfectly to that of Max's appearance, from the accent to the tone in which he spoke. He brought a certain poignancy and virtue to the character, giving life to one of the most memorable characters I can remember in recent animation. Even knowing it was him behind the character of Max, I couldn't wrap my head around it. He was truly one of the most diverse actors of our generation and he will forever be missed by many, whether it being his presence on the big screen or merely his voice.<br/><br/>It is a shame that the idea of animation movies might dissuade many people from experiencing this movie. At its core, this film is beautiful in all of its forms â€“ direction, narration, acting and, of course, animation. It manages to be humorous, melancholy, hopeful and a million other things all in one. It excels in staying true to the human condition and does not in any way try to patronize the characters or idealize their situations; it is, in simplest terms, real. My words cannot do this film justice; it was and will continue to serve as one of the finest animations brought to life. 10/10"

I think it's the best animation film I have ever watched, until today. <br/><br/>It's been 6 months since I first watched it, but I can still recall the strong emotions and feelings it caused me. This film has wonderful meanings about accepting differentiation in society and showing all those people the love every human being needs to receive. I think the movie didn't receive the publicity it deserved, unlike other animation films produced by bigger companies (and advertising budgets).<br/><br/>I was extremely touched and so I suggest that everyone should watch it and reflect on the matters it refers to."
"tedg","Null","7","13","15 August 2010"," Escapes its Poo-Faced Limits
","Gosh, another Australian project that knows what it is and successfully escapes itself.<br/><br/>The story is about a girl with structural limits: appearance, family, attitude.<br/><br/>The media is stop motion, which brings its own structural limits. These are severe limits, because they straddle what we know as real and what we accept as fantasy. How to work with this? The choices a filmmaker makes in this medium are fascinating.<br/><br/>Jan Svankmajer presents the result as moving museum art, dynamic dioramas. He can be too precious in that Eastern European way that produces needlework that frightens. <br/><br/>Tim Burton, and Henry Selick (""Coraline,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"") pretend we are looking at illustrated books the way a child would. <br/><br/>Nick Park treats the medium the way Walt Disney would, as a simple extrapolation from Donald Duck via way of Pixar. <br/><br/>These guys decide not to tackle the simple fact that it is near impossible to elicit real emotion via this form.<br/><br/>Only the Quay Brothers and Christiane Cegavske (""Blood Tea and Red String"") make the commitment to create worlds by allowing the characters to inhabit them in a way that inhabitants are worldcreators. They affect a bizarre Victorian metaphors but this is because Lewis Carroll is the genius of this technique and not because the era has any intrinsic advantage. There are powerful and worldchanging moments in these works. But the viewer is asked to make a commitment that few will.<br/><br/>All lucid stop-motion filmmakers face this set of decisions about how to overcome the limits of the medium. If you are writing a story while struggling with this, what is foremost in your mind? Especially if you are Australian, is a society that for some reason is introspective in art? You will produce a ""folded"" story: one where the subject of the story reflects the form of the story. <br/><br/>We have a girl in Australia who is obsessed with a successful TeeVee show, also stop motion. It is her fantasy world, the movie within the movie. She faces many challenges in simply surviving. She has a pen pal, and successfully writes her way out her limits, first by writing a book about her viewer's physiological limits. (More about this in a minute.) And then by getting a genuine expression of emotion from him in the form of a complete set of figures from the inner film. She triumphs, has child (all this is pretty overt folding) and finally visits the world of her pen pal to discover that she not only affected him, but was effectively his whole emotional life. The medium is mastered.<br/><br/>The two actors chosen are among our very few who understand folded characterization.<br/><br/>This half of the project is fascinating in the normal way that these nested, introspective things are, and is worthwhile. But it is the other half that is amazing.<br/><br/>Mary is our filmmaker, and Max our viewer. Us.<br/><br/>Half of the problem a filmmaker faces is the limits of her medium, and the other half the limits of the viewer. Most of us are emotional cripples, not inclined to work with an artist in a contract of world-building. We are afraid. Max is a citizen of the most urban and sophisticated city on the planet (in contrast to Mary's remote outpost). But he has Asberger Syndrome and is incapable of reading and processing emotion. <br/><br/>This characterizes us viewers pretty well; our movie experiences are often exercises in avoiding truth. I found it rare and thrilling to see it explicit in this nested work, which is superficially sweet but essentially damning.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"haematophiliac","1","36","100","5 December 2011"," The most depressing waste of time ever!
","Generally, should you ask anyone on the street what they think when you say ""animation"" the overall answer would be something along the lines of funny, cheerful, entertaining, even the synopsis suggests a sweet story about two pen pals. <br/><br/>However, the choice of genre for this film was completely off the mark, live acting would have suited this script far better.<br/><br/>This film is not only a bleak view into the lives of two very sad, very pathetic people, but also a disturbingly depressing story about how said two pathetic people never attain any tangible form of progression in their lives. What kind of message is there to this film, accept yourself for who you are, even if it means that part of that ""acceptance"" means being okay with your life when the power to change your circumstances is within your grasp? <br/><br/>I don't see why this film has such a high rating (in the top 250 animated films on this site), there is nothing profound about the story line, you don't take any important lessons from it. <br/><br/>Mary and Max is just another forgettable story which had a lot of potential, but was unfortunately lost along the way."

","This movie was just bad to the point of being unwatchable.<br/><br/>From the very first lines of the movie, I had a feeling that the movie would be extremely unfunny. My suspicions were confirmed. Nothing in this movie works. Not a single thing. It was as unfunny a film as I've seen, melancholy in every aspect, boring as watching paint dry, the characters were bad, and the story was just simply dumb. The only things this movie might have going for it is its musical score (which is alright), and that it is relatively short (so the torture ends quickly). However, even with its relatively short length, I was unable to watch the movie in one sitting. I have seen other reviews bring comparisons to Waltz with Bashir and Persepolis, but those movies had cool animation, political commentary, and interesting characters and story. This movie has none of that. Save yourself, don't make the mistake of watching it that I made. My hope is that writing this review will save at least 1 person from watching the movie. If it does that, then maybe watching this movie might have been worth the suffering I endured."

","I had never heard of this film until my friend told me about a clip of it he'd seen, knowing I was a fan of black comedy. So we sat down to watch the first 10 minutes at 3 in the morning and then we ended up watching the whole thing, neither of us moving from our seats the entire time, fixated. This film is a genuine masterpiece; a unique, stark aesthetic as framework for an engaging exchange between two incredibly complex and lovable characters, the socially awkward Mary and Max, who communicate via letter across different countries. <br/><br/>To skip to the meat of the issue; these characters are hilarious. Their world is hilarious. A universe filled with unexpected visual gags that range from innocent to pitch black. Often you'll not know whether to laugh or cry, as the story developments crush you but imagery on screen is side splitting. For these characters are not just funny, they are tragic. Their world is also tragic. It pleasantly reminds me of Forrest Gump, in the sense that we fall in love with these characters and their naivety because they make us laugh and feel elated, so that when misfortune befalls them the empathy coupled with drastic change of tone hits you like a wrecking ball.<br/><br/>Although many people claim there is no such thing as a perfect film, I don't believe so. To me, a perfect film successfully achieves exactly what it sets out to do with excellent execution that keeps us engaged and entertained. If a film does all this, and lacks any mistakes or moments where it unintentionally takes me out of the experience, to me that is as good as cinema gets for me. This is a perfect film. Whether you agree or disagree, appreciate the effort, charm and beauty that has gone in to this project. 10/10"
"oecobius","3","20","53","25 June 2011"," Disappointing
","Mary & Max sets out to be a thought-provoking film that inspires with its originality, but it is ultimately an unsatisfying production. The opening scenes establish the film's nonlinearity and its willingness to be blunt and grim with its protagonists' struggles--once you notice these features, you grasp the film's entire hook. The movie constantly maintains this tone but never leads it to a payoff or a twist; I appreciate the filmmakers' decision to make something so unconventional, but the fact remains that these few original elements cannot support an entire 90-minute movie. The creative animation is definitely the best part. <br/><br/>The film is in large part a dark comedy, but all the comedic elements are tepidly clever at best but never truly funny. The quirky concepts have potential, but they are intended to be funny in & of themselves, never building to any new surprising result. Max's descriptions of his jobs, for instance, aren't poignant or charming, they're just ""zany"" with some angst thrown in. The film relies obnoxiously on scatological humor--even though this is usually deadpan, the sheer number of butt jokes gets old very fast. <br/><br/>Through the events in Mary's life, the movie sets up what could have been a moving message about accepting your own flaws, but the impact is spoiled when they hit you over the head with the message, via narration by both Damien and Max. Towards the end, Max's lengthy letter about being happy with yourself is so heavy-handed that it eliminates any possibility of thought-provoking subtlety. The very end of the film was also cheesily melodramatic and unsubtle. I didn't feel moved by the characters' suffering along the way, either, because we meet Mary as a lonely, bullied kid... and then the movie describes over and over how she's lonely & bullied, which has no impact on us because we understood that from early on. The same goes for Max being lonely and awkward.<br/><br/>There is obviously great effort behind the animation, with impressive, detailed sets, and the art style is engaging. The ""Que Sera Sera"" sequence in which Mary reaches the depths of depression is artistic and very nicely-done, but the film's successes in terms of visual presentation do not compensate for its story or hamfisted theme, which fall flat in the end. If you just want something out of the ordinary, you can enjoy Mary & Max, but if you expect true depth (not phony depth where the filmmakers comment ""oh, loneliness sure is sad!"") or richness of writing, you will come away disappointed."

","This was going to be one of my favorite movies ever, right up until the unbelievably lame cop- out ending. My date and I were both dumped into a depression, so it's not just me. Back and forth the movie gives and takes away hope, then gives it back, and then you get to the end...and whiff. Somebody decided it would be too predictable to end on a happy note, so they got all artsy and clever and...predictable. I really wanted to punch the filmmaker in the face at that point. There is an implied contract if you take on someone's attention and emotions for this long a period of time (only 80 minutes? god it seemed like so much more than that by that point), and if you aren't going to play the game out until the end, then I think that's very rude and self- indulgent. It's like when Forrest Gump steps up to the microphone, and everybody is waiting to hear The Big Punchline, then the mic howls with feedback instead, and everybody cheers, and we get a fake airball instead of something worth the effort of the journey.<br/><br/>All that said, right up until that stupid stupid ending, what an incredibly charming movie, so full of absurd details and love for textures and the minutae of neuroses. What a waste that it ended on such a pathetic non-idea."

","I wasn't even sure I wanted to watch this film when it came on at 11:20 pm. I was tired and a little let down after having just finished watching Clear and Present Danger (had heard great things about it). But I decided to watch the first 5 minutes or so as the listing description claimed it to be an ""Adult Claymation"". I was intrigued as I do have quite an interest in claymation myself. The minutes rolled on by and soon half an hour had been and gone already. <br/><br/>Within that half hour I had felt happy, sad, sympathetic, uncomfortable, frustrated, confused the list goes on. This film has a marvellous ability to switch between moods in the blink of an eye in a way that doesn't seem obnoxious or intrusive. The subject matter made me squirm a little at first, however that is quickly accounted for and you are eventually put at ease. All I can say is give this film a chance. It drags on a little in places, well, it drags on throughout the entire film really. There is no action, only one particularly intense scene I can recall and due to the story there is very little character to character to dialogue. Yet somehow it is so gloriously intriguing you can get past that. <br/><br/>It's a bitter-sweet film that may leave some with a bit of a bad taste in their mouth having finished watching it. But to those willing to put a little effort in I can guarantee an enjoyable and incredibly deep watch. <br/><br/>It get's a 7 from me. Whilst there were no major issues there was also nothing that really stood out about this film other than the story. Animation was somewhat lacklustre even despite the gloomy setting of the plot, acting was a little frayed round the edges at times and I did find myself rolling my eyes to a few parts that were seemingly supposed to be emotional. However, it's a good all-rounder on all fronts bar the outstanding writing. If you are going to give this a go, make sure to have some tissues handy. You have been warned"

","An Australian stop-motion animated film about a dumpy little girl (voiced by Toni Collette) who randomly chooses a name in a New York phone book and writes him a letter. The man on the other side (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged Jew with Asperger's Syndrome. Neither of these people have friends in real life, and they soon become each other's only friends. This is a rather sad story, filmed in a very muted color scheme. The New York sequences, in particular, are almost black and white. The Australian sequences have a lot of brown in them. Writer/director Elliot (claiming he based it on a true story) injects a lot of quirky humor into the picture, almost making it seem like an Aardman product at times. The big difference between this and Aardman: the animators of Mary & Max go out of their way to make everything hideously ugly. There's a big mental disconnect between all of these elements. It wants to be depressing, it wants to be charming, it wants to be hilarious, it wants to be freakish. Fortunately, it does succeed enough of the time where it's well worth watching. At its heart, there's a very touching story. I do not think this deserves to be mentioned alongside the slew of wonderful animated films of the year, except maybe for a footnote."
"LovetheBombFilms","5","11","27","24 December 2013"," Very Depressing
","Mary and Max â€“ Review (12/24/13) Adam Elliot's 2009 animated film, Mary and Max, is a very unpleasant film. It mixes charming visuals with some of the most depressing characters I've ever seen. Mary and Max succeeds in capturing the feeling of complete hopelessness that its creators probably weren't intending.<br/><br/>First the good. Mary and Max has a very nice visual style. It's toned down coloration and spot on design and animation contribute to a rather evocative atmosphere. Unfortunately it evokes misery. Even the sound is good. On the whole Mary and Max has very good production value which is always nice to see in an animated film. Also there are some very nice images that have quality in themselves such as a frowning fish puffing bubbles on a cigarette beneath the sea. In addition to the visual style and production value Mary and Max maintains an involved, kinetic pacing that if you don't pay too much attention to should keep you entertained somewhat. This was the path I opted for.<br/><br/>Mary and Max is the most depressing film I've ever seen. It's not devastating, just depressing. It's more depressing than Paths of Glory and even The Ascent (both films which are more devastating than depressing). Mary and Max follows two sad and pitiful characters: Max and Mary. Mary is an unexceptional little girl who has uncaring parents, and no friends despite wanting friends more than anything in the world. She spends her days doing pointless things and routinely cries to herself. At one point in her life she has a loving husband and a nice job. It's not long till she trashes her career, resorts to alcoholism, and is left alone when her husband goes to live with his own gay pen pal. Then she almost commits suicide but doesn't. What a triumph. Mary is a pretty unsympathetic character. Why can't she make friends? Why is she so emotionally unstable? Everything about her character bites into me. Max is at least sympathetic because he has Asperger's. However his life is also very depressing. Like Mary, almost the only thing that he wants is a friend. His Asperger's prevents this from being a reality. Other than that he lives a tortured existence. He is looked down upon, horribly overweight with no hope of controlling it, molested by a class- mate, surrounded by stinky, doomed animals, and he lives in the most hellish depiction of New York City. Eventually he dies. The torture of these characters just makes me feel crummy.<br/><br/>Mary and Max knocks you down to your knees and teases you with false hope. The ending is like a worthless consolation prize when you should have won something. Mary and Max is a mediocre film ranging on poor, just because of the way it makes me feel.<br/><br/>18/40"

","I suppose, as I have never written a review before, I don't know if any of you will find this useful. I think this movie deserves a review.<br/><br/>So Mary and Max left one of the sweetest, but also painful marks on my chest I have ever come by. The characters were bought to life using stop-motion. Where did stop-motion go? It really adds to a film. Everything was very detailed and you grew to love the characters, because they weren't perfect. They were imperfect. And the imperfection, even though the story was narrated the whole time, was what really made me fall in love with the characters.<br/><br/>So much hurt happens throughout their 20 years of friendship, and a lot of it seems relevant even today. But the movie also shows that there are always things to live for. Even if it is only one person.<br/><br/>Australia has always made great movies and television shows. Most of them are always pushing the boundaries, and a bit of that humor shines though in this movie also.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone that will watch. It is certainly not a kids movie so don't get it for your kids! This movie will make you laugh, cry and give you all the warm fuzzies.<br/><br/>9/10"
"zemmiphobe","9","5","10","23 January 2011"," Extremely sweet yet rather depressing.
","Do not let yourself get thrown off by the brilliant, but rather cutesy animation; this is not a movie for children. It is, however, the perfect movie for a teenager or adult ready for an exploration into solitude, loneliness, and simply being completely misunderstood by everyone around you. It made me reminisce about times in my childhood - putting a new perspective on events and emotional states that confused me when I was young. The animation is detailed, yet often appears drab and dark much like a rainy day (this does fit with the emotions put forth by the film). Mary's world in Australia appears in mostly shades of brown whereas Max's world in New York City appears in shades of grey. Do not be expecting a cheery film, but be ready for an amazing piece of film making."
"Mightyzebra","9","5","10","7 October 2010"," A truly unusually brilliant film.
","I was tempted to give this film ten stars, but ""Mary and Max"" seems to give the message that Aspies and Autistic people shouldn't be ""cured"" in any way, which is not the case. <br/><br/>I was lucky enough to watch this at a pre-release screening in Scotland and I must say I am very glad I watched ""Mary and Max"". Not only is it well-animated, but the ideas presented, the ironic, black humour and the storyline are simply spectacular. When I saw an advert for this film the animation reminded me of Tim Burton animations such as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", but it is a totally different from anything like that. There are many adult themes and black jokes presented in this film, meaning I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of twelve, simply because it is too good to misunderstand. <br/><br/>I will continue this review by commenting on each of the aspects in turn.<br/><br/>Dialogue and storyline: This film is very well written. The idea of a young girl writing to a 40 year old man with Asperger's is one which is not only very unexpected, but very clever. It allows not only an intelligent, at times funny script, but it also allows the viewer to understand more about Aspies and the world in general. Some of the humour included is very funny, but at the same time this film also has very sad parts. Overall, this film is not to be taken lightly.<br/><br/>Animation and filming: This film is almost solely plasticine animation, which gives it an appropriately nostalgic style, along with the sepia and black and white filming. The life of the Australian girl is sepia, in browns like her birthmark and eyes. The life of the American is black and white, reflecting how gloomy most of his experiences are.<br/><br/>Themes: The themes presented include: Asperger's Syndrome, Depression, Alcoholism, Homophobia, Communism, Psychology, Processed foods, Sweet foods, Blindness and Suicide, among many others. Some of these may not be apparent to younger or even very Aspie viewers, to truly understand this view one needs quite a wide knowledge of the world. The themes are either dealt with in a comic or melancholy way, each leaving its own imprint on the film and making it more entertaining.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, the only thing that I disliked about this film is how the makers hint that people with Asperger's should be left pretty much as they are. Some Aspies can do with therapy or guidance in life to make sure they cope with normal people. The therapist that Max has in this film is shown to be a bad therapist, but now there are many different methods for teaching Aspies and Autistic people how to become more normal, while still appreciating many of their Aspie traits.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend this to anyone who wants more of an idea of people with Asperger's, Aspies themselves, or pretty much anyone over the age of 12 who can deal with a rather depressing film. I hope you find ""Mary and Max"" worth watching! :-)"
"akkoziol","10","5","10","27 July 2010"," Based on a trues story? Hmm....
","I thoroughly enjoyed this little gem. It's such a simple story but has a big impact on the lives of the characters. The stop animation has that new-generation of clean and smooth action similar to Coraline and it it very well executed here.<br/><br/>So the story in a nutshell is about a dumpy little girl in Australia whose life is made miserable by a Sherry-saturated mother and garage-dwelling taxidermy hobbyist father who by their lack of interest, leave poor Mary to her own imagination and devices. Meanwhile, in New York, we have an obese apostate named Max living a hermetic shut-in life of chocolate hot dogs, Overeaters Anonymous, and Aspergerian perplexity about the world around him. Mary, seeking answers to the questions of life, happens to write to Max after having ripped his address information from a US phone book during one of Mary's mother's ""borrowing"" episodes. And so begins their comedic pen-pal friendship through the course of nearly 20 years.<br/><br/>We see Mary grow and we see Max getting more and more obese. There are many moments, often funny, where Max and Mary are helping each other through their writing. I know it's just a story but how does Max NOT become diabetic? Sometimes the absurdity reminds me of Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit characters but a little more hip. While the story is not intended to be a comedy, there are some very original and funny comic elements, especially those of poor Henry the goldfish.<br/><br/>Anyhow, we later see Mary's futile attempt to understand Max's Asperger's through the lens of wanting to ""fix the world"", as many a young adult wants to do and we see a rift come between the two as Max, content to accept his life but resentful for Mary wanting to ""fix"" him, recedes into himself.<br/><br/>There is a resolution to their rift and the ending is rather touching. The story was very well delivered and is not made to be unbelievable. Look for this one to win awards very soon. Find any way you can to watch this one and get the bragging rights this wonderful movie deserves. Well worth you time."
"yingjoshua7","Null","9","22","11 September 2011"," I'm the only one who thinks this movie is not good
","I know I'm probably gonna be hated on for this, but I genuinely strongly dislike this movie, especially because of the ""oooh, so awesome"" reviews I read. The animation was pretty much intended for a childish audience, but some of the stuff they talked about wasn't funny and really vulgar- It was annoying in every sense of the word. Adult topics coupled with kid-like clay animation shut out their audience, which pretty much meant that it was appealing to no one. If Max has Asperger's as well as Panic Syndrome, along with obesity AND he's living alone, there's pretty much 0 chance he lived to that age. The only thing going for this movie is its soundtrack, which is pretty good. I would not recommend this movie, unless you have a twisted sense of humor and sentimentality."
"scarletheels","6","7","16","7 March 2012"," A complicated tale meant for adults
","Mary and Max is a multi-award winning animation that chronicles the relationship between Mary Daisy Dinkle (Toni Collette), a young, insecure girl in Australia who is the only daughter of an alcoholic mother and a neglectful father, and Max Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an overweight, panic-ridden man in New York. One day, Mary picks the first name she finds in a phone book and sends a letter, along with a chocolate bar, prompting a decades long correspondence of letters and chocolate treats. Although Max has longed for a real friend (his imaginary friend sits on a stool reading all day), Mary's sensitive questions propel him into anxiety attacks, one so severe he ends up in a mental institution. <br/><br/>Many years pass with no mail from Max. In between waiting for word from him, Mary becomes smitten with the next door neighbor boy, Damien (Eric Bana), and continues helping her agoraphobic neighbor, Len. Considering advice from his therapist, he finally writes to Mary and confides in her that he has Asperger's Syndrome which affects his social interaction. She decides to enter into university to study mental disorders and ends up penning a highly acclaimed book with Max as her case study. The news is not well-received by Max and he cuts off communication with her, which sends Mary into a drug-induced, drunken stupor (after shredding her hard work to pieces and damning her career). On the verge of suicide, she wonders if Max will ever forgive her. <br/><br/>Let me immediately point out that this is not for young children or tweens. Don't be wooed by the cartoon cover art or pictures of adorable Mary Daisy Dinkle with her clunky glasses and red barrette. It's a complicated tale meant for adults. If you are unable to process rather gloomy, disheartening material without being able to bounce back emotionally, avoid this movie. Aside from the celebration of enduring friendship, there isn't much to smile about. Alcoholism, mental illness, loneliness, pill popping, heartbreak, four deaths, overeating, involuntary manslaughter, schoolyard bullying... a small list of the obstacles the characters struggle to overcome. <br/><br/>The animation is beautifully done and the characters are a peculiar, quirky bunch with a myriad of flaws but endearing in their own ways. The stop-motion figures on the screen breathe life, full of raw, human emotion in such a profound manner, it can be a distressing, suffocating experience. That's balanced with some incredibly kooky humor. The storyline flows effortlessly but, ultimately, it won't appeal to a wider audience. High praise for writer and director, Adam Elliot, for having a unique vision and sticking to his guns. There has been mixed reviews on Barry Humphries' narration. Personally, I found his voice very soothing. <br/><br/>This film appeases two long-time love affairs, claymation and stop- motion. It tickled my funny bone at the right moments but it was too melancholy, even for me."

","I love this film and am still blown away by the music. Especially, Perpetuum Mobile by Penguin Cafe (Mary's Theme).<br/><br/>I understand why some people dislike it so much.

","Wow a little gem of a movie I rented this last night for my daughter(7) who unfortunately did not like this. I can't fault her for that because unknown to me at the time it's really geared for adults. Mary a lonely 8 year old in Melbourne decides one day to write ramdomly to a person across the world to find out where babies come from in America. She chooses Max an equally lonely 40 something jew in New York who has aspergers syndrome and many deep routed personal and social issues. An unlikely friendship that spans 20 years through letters evolve between the two. This film is totally charming you laugh you cry you become a part of it. I wouldn't recommend it for young children 11 and up would be the ideal age as it is full of dark and often depressing themes. Want to see something that has a little depth to it I would put it up there with Wall-E as one of the greatest animated features of all time."
"sharky_55","9","4","8","12 July 2015"," You are my best friend. You are my only friend.
","Mary and Max never lets the viewer settle into a preconceived idea of how the story and characters will act based on the rotund and plump clay figurines who waddle about in the gorgeous and painstakingly detailed world of Adam Elliot's. It's not as smooth as a bigger budgeted animation piece like Wallace & Gromit is but the clay- mation is nevertheless enchanting. The depiction of two worlds apart in New York City and Lamington Drive, Australia consists of hundreds of miniature props and set pieces and even a fully functional tiny typewriter in which Max composes his letters to. The character and set design is whimsical and the film's voice-over, which dictates the majority of the plot points and exposition, is punctuated with absurdities, dark humour and bits of everyday questioning. At surface level, the premise of a middle aged, obese and lonely atheist with Aspergers syndrome being penpals with an equally lonely and bullied eight year girl is simple and easily dissected. The film, unlike many animations, is not bursting with colours or rainbows, instead washed in black and white or a murky brown, with the odd bit of red in the tongues or pom-poms or hair-clips. So that it itself hints at the darker nature of the film. <br/><br/>Part of the charm and authenticity of the premise comes from the excellent voice acting from Max and Young Mary, by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bethany Whitmore respectively. Hoffman's raspy, matter-of-fact voice over is carefully punctuated by pauses in his speech that indicate a simple, if not, curious mind. It's simultaneously a man who feels like time is running out in his life yet has all the time in the world for his only friend in the world. This makes him a perfect correspondence for Mary, where Whitmore's voice feels like a genuine child's not riddled with clichÃ©s and over-age understanding. She stumbles on the spelling of certain words and adds grammatical mannerisms of her own to the characterisation of her innocence and curiosity. Much like Max, she also experiences loneliness, and it is through this common emotion they find their connection. <br/><br/>The soundtrack lends itself to both humour and drama throughout the film. Insignificant deaths like a mime being crushed by a air-conditioning unit or a careless father drowned at sea might be morbid in other films but become an eventuality in Mary and Max. The dark humour is created by the reactions of the characters, not by dialogue, but by clever sound design and facial animation which adds an air of absurdity to the scene. See the irony in the cuts between a whooshing falling air-conditioner unit and the soundless mime bracing for impact, or the outrageous cry of Max upon seeing cigarette butt littering, or the matter-of-fact way in which he admits guilt after farting in a public elevator. <br/><br/>Penguin Cafe Orchestra's Perpetuum Mobile is the perfect theme for the film, introducing us to the setting as well as chiming in here and there again to remind us of a moment of character growth or determined action. It's a beautiful composition which gives a sense of time passing, and of the juxtaposition between sad and happy moments. Another strong and emotionally resonant moment uses musical cues to great effect, being Mary's attempted suicide. It's one of the few instances in the film where the camera actually moves away from it's rather pedestrian positioning and where digital effects are used to portray the last moments of Mary's life and the surreal experience of the old clichÃ© where your life flashes before your eyes. Doras Day's old classic Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) adds emotional depth and subtext to the moment, linking back to Mary's negligent upbringing and conjuring ideas of adulthood failure and lost friendship. <br/><br/>Mary and Max's friendship is never face to face but shines throughout the brilliant screenplay which creates a connection through the bizarre, witty and oddities that they share. It's two remarkably curious perspectives of life and loneliness which bring them together. It's heartfelt and funny in it's dark humour (When I was young, I invented an invisible friend called Mr Ravioli. My psychiatrist says I don't need him anymore, so he just sits in the corner and reads); there's as much emotional resonance as there is comic relief. It treats it's darker topics of mental illness and suicide with maturity that often goes amiss in animation features. One might wonder how rapidly paced a friendship this might be had the film be set in more modern times with the accessibility of instant messaging and emails. Mary and Max however delivers a delightful little tale that's more than evenly paced."

The visual gags are good and often surprising, and the story enters areas usually left untrodden by animation.<br/><br/>The technical aspects themselves are below Aardman or Laika standard, but efficient; what keeps this film from getting a better grade from me is the drab colour palette and overall depressing tone - don't get me wrong, those are parts of life, too - but you can overdo everything and nearly 90 minutes are a bit much for my taste. So the re-watch value is not that high, for me at least."
"augurar","7","4","8","15 February 2012"," Woah
","This movie, like most things, had good and bad aspects. I will first enumerate the bad things, then the good ones.<br/><br/>One of the more off-putting things about this movie, for me, was its art style. People and animals are depicted in grotesquely distorted forms. I'm not sure what the purpose was for doing this. Another problem with the film was its tendency towards crude humor, lame visual gags, and slapstick comedy. As with the distorted figures, this aspect of the film did not seem to contribute positively to the work as a whole and I'm not sure why these moments of silliness were included. Perhaps the filmmakers were trying to avoid idealizing their subjects, but I think they went too far in the other direction. In general, I thought the film's explicit attempts at humor tended to misfire. For me, the humor in the film came from the characters themselves and not from things like watching goldfish be killed in a series of unlikely accidents. Another problem with the film is that its secondary characters tended to be one- dimensional, and most of them were killed off by the end of the film, either to provide ""humor"", advance the plot, or both. It seemed contradictory to me that the film explored the main characters' lives with such understanding and sympathy, yet treated the secondary characters as little more than moving scenery pieces.<br/><br/>Despite the complaints I have listed above, this film moved me deeply and I was actually in tears by the end. That's not something that happens often. So what about this film was so powerful? Its main characters. The letters the two characters write are extremely believable and yield so much information about each character. In fact, it didn't take long before I stopped thinking about Mary and Max as characters, and started thinking of them as real people. I felt that I could personally relate to both of them, and that was why the film had such a strong emotional impact on me. But the movie goes further than just creating convincing characters. Through the lives of the characters and the evolving relationship between them, the movie touches delicately on topics like loneliness, friendship, depression, disability, and what it really means to be human. (I think the film also tried to capture something of the scope of life's journey and the passage of time, but it was less successful at addressing this.)<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie tried to do many things, but it really only succeeded at one thing, which was depicting the evolution of the relationship between Max and Mary. But where it succeeded, it really succeeded. 7/10 stars."
"Red_Identity","Null","4","8","30 July 2010"," Honest and True
","Mary and Max is one of the darkest animated films I have ever seen. It deals with certain issues that are rarely dealt with in films, let alone animated ones. This is certainly not a kid's film, but it is a learning film. It tells the story of a lonely girl named Mary who lives with her problematic parents and who creates a friendship with a man named Max who lives across the world from her. The writing is incredible and it gives us so much insight into each of these characters' worlds. Thanks to the narration and the visually-amazing stop-motion animation, we are able to care deeply for these characters. By the time the final 30 minutes roll around, it begins to get darker and more sinister, simply because it shows us that it is the way the world gets as you grow up. The ending is very, very sad, but it rings a chord in every viewers' hearts I am sure. <br/><br/>All in all, this is an honest and very true animated film about the life of two uncertain people. It is better than most animated films hope to be, and it is better than Pixar's Up. See this film, but not simply for entertainment or humor because you will get more than what you bargained for."

","There was a small mention of this cartoon film on Film 2009 with Jonathan Ross, obviously it didn't have wide release, but hearing enough about it I was very interested to try it. Basically starting in the 1970's, eight year old Mary (Bethany Whitmore) is the little girl living in Melbourne, Australia with a terrible brown birthmark on her forehead, no friends, a mean alcoholic mother who has kleptomania (the frequent urge to steal) and a love for a children's television show which she makes models of the characters. One day, desperate to find a friend she decides to flick through the phone book and find a random name and write them a letter accompanied with a chocolate bar, and she chooses a guy from New York City. The reader who receives her letter is obese Max Jerry Horovitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who has a tragic past, a history of mental illness and lives with the disability Aspergers Syndrome, and feeling lonely himself he is very happy to write back to Mary. So begins a pen pal friendship where they send each other letters about their thoughts, feelings and something (object, food) that represents them-self or where they are living. Years later an older Mary (Toni Collette) still tries to keep in touch with Max, who has become bigger and more depressed over time, she has got married to Damien (Eric Bana) and graduated university, he has won the New York lottery, and that's about it. Max is infuriated when Mary tells him that she is writing a psychological book detailing Aspergers Syndrome, and in anger he removes the M letter from his typewriter, and in response she develops chronic depression. She becomes an alcoholic and attempts suicide by hanging, and her husband Damien leaves her for his own pen pal in New Zealand, but she didn't realise she was pregnant, she is saved by the man who feared going outside, agoraphobic neighbour Len Hislop. Mary receives a forgiveness letter from Max, and with her newborn baby she decides they should meet in person, but when she arrives he is dead, but she cries with happiness seeing all the letters saved on the wall. With wonderful narration from Dame Edna Everage actor Barry Humphries, the voices of Collette, Hoffman and Whitmore really bring the characters to life, the use of colour, black and white for New York and sepia for Australia is really good, and of course the stop motion clay animation is lovable, I can relate to Max living with Apsergers Syndrome myself, and Mary is lovable, it may be dark for children, but a most watchable animated comedy drama. Very good!"

","Mary and Max was everything I wanted and more. The story is about a girl named Mary who doesn't have any friends so she sends a letter to a random person in the phone book. The letter is sent to a man in New York. The whole movie is about their relashinship as each other's only friends. This film absolutely drained me emotionally. Their relashinship made me laugh and cry a lot. It really gives off the feel of a real relashinship with all of the ups and downs. In other movies friendships usually don't seem real and are predictable. In this film, their relashinship is anything but predictable. That leads to the rollercoaster of emotions. The best part of this movie though is the writing. Mary's writing perfectly captures the thoughts of a child. Max's writing perfectly captures the thoughts of a man just trying to make a friend. They never tried to go too houmerous with the writing as well. The characters say lines that are funny in context, but because of the excellent voice acting from Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Bethany Witmore, as well as Toni Collete the lines become more humerous because they don't talk like they're making the joke. It just sounds like they're talking like a regular person which makes the joke seem more real and not seem like ""okay, this is where they put the joke."" All the writing seems natural. I've heard complaints about the pacing of this film but I found it great. Nothing was ever too slow or fast. The last thing I want to touch on is the stop motion. It is absolutely stellar. This is some of the best stop motion animation I've ever seen, especially with the very smal budget this film had. There is so much detail in the environments, it's crazy. With all of this in mind, please do yourself a favor and see this film."

It is irreverent, but I think the overall message is one of hope and understanding.<br/><br/>I saw this on Amazon Prime. It was one of those gems that are buried away on the site. I found it by chance, searching the name of the film as it was recommended on Kermode & Mayo.<br/><br/>I do not know if this is unique to Prime, but the sound was off - with the narration way too low in the soundscape so that it could not be heard clearly or at all when there was music or background sound."

Philip Seymour Hoffman did the best out of everyone. The music was pretty good. The one complaint I have about this film is the same song they played 7 times in the film.

"RbDeraj","3","8","22","1 March 2015"," Depressingly Disappointing
","The concept of this film was without a doubt very unique. It explored a pen pal relationship between a lonely little girl from Australia and a mentally unstable man living in New York City. The story is narrated almost like a children's book, but it is quickly revealed that this is no movie for kids as it's subjects include very mature themes including a very serious main topic of mental health and Asperger syndrome. While I usually find stop-motion animation very impressive, I wasn't taken aback by the quality. Maybe it was the dull tones, or maybe it was simply an odd choice of medium for a movie about such subject matter. The beginning half, even though dark and gloomy, seemed whimsical and funny in a strange sort of way. As the story went along it became more lifeless and uninteresting, and as Mary grew up she became even more of a psycho than our deranged friend Max. The film seemed to reach too far for an emotion filled tale of gloom which made it lose a lot of its impact. Near the middle I was enjoying myself, but by the end it seemed like a drag and overrated disappointment."

","Just as it seemed that with the fall (or at least the decline) of the two most distinguished entertainment industries in the history of animated films â€“ The Walt Disney Company and DreamWorks Animation â€“ The Tale of Despereaux would have to last us for generations, here emerged a most remarkable offering of quality and taste that wipes out the memory of the mouse's tale and smashes Bolt to smithereens. Oscar-winning stop-clay animation magician Adam Elliot has dived deep into his collection of childhood memories and plucked out the pieces of a most fascinating story. It is these mementos and recollections that form the basis of his script. It is a story of many things, one being the extraordinary friendship between the two pen pals of the film's title that arises purely by coincidence.<br/><br/>Sweet little eight-year-old Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced splendidly by the carefully chosen Bethany Whitmore) lives in suburban Melbourne in the seventies with her inattentive and greatly flawed parents. Her mother (voiced superbly by RenÃ©e Geyer in one of the earlier scenes) is the most repulsive creature ever to walk the Earth. Apart from being a hideous old hag, a shifty shoplifter, a drunk, and a terrible smoke addict, she is a horrible mother who has hardly any love, care, or time for her daughter. Her father works at a teabag factory. For a hobby he stuffs dead animals he finds lying on the road, and when he is not working he sits in his shed with his revolting collection of preserved carcasses. He has even less time for Mary than her mother does, and the little screen time he is given is symbolic of his obscure involvement in Mary's upbringing. Poor Mary is also the subject of much torment at school due to the unsightly ""poo-coloured"" birthmark on her forehead. Her self-made action figures are all the lonely girl has in this world. The pitiful Max (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who is here absolutely outstanding) is in his early forties, and is equally as lonely as Mary. For a person with Asperger's Syndrome, New York is the worst place to live. As a result of his condition he is hypersensitive, clumsy, antisocial and absolutely bizarre to everyone else. Completely isolated socially from all humanity, he spends most of his time in his flat watching television and devouring one of his ""chocolate hotdogs"" after another. The lengthy, detailed and unbelievably forthright letters that Mary receives from this genuinely good-hearted obese man are incredibly insightful and one of the finest aspects of the film. The touching tale is topped off with delightful narration by Barry Humphries and a fun sense of quirkiness as well as a dash of intelligent humour to avoid things from getting too depressing. The animation is unique and complementary to the story, with a purposeful lack of colour and lumpy appearance. <br/><br/>Though the final scenes are a slight letdown in comparison to the charming first hour. The traumatic events that unfold after the final letter is sent to an elderly yet predominantly unchanged Max by a now successful, well-to-do and adult Mary (now voiced by Toni Collette) that apparently aggravates him, seem far too concocted to have been part of the true story upon which the film was based and vaguely even detract from the realism brought about by the earlier scenes. The many deaths however are for the most part believable and fittingly incorporated, but the inclusion of one or two of them seems questionable."

","Not sure what film everyone else watched but I found this film exceptionally boring and going nowhere and pointless. The animation was good but I never once thought I was believing any of it.<br/><br/>It only got a 3 vote because it had some funny one liners, but apart from a few cringy laughs the whole film was monotone and a waste of time.<br/><br/>The storyline was just highlighting the sad lives these two people were living and to me makes sad viewing, let alone in an animated world of freakish characters...<br/><br/>All in all a dull flat dreary film"
"ElMaruecan82","10","3","6","25 August 2016"," So many letters to define Mary and Max, and not enough words to describe them...
","Every once in a while, there's a movie you expect to 'watch' but what happens after the very first minutes goes beyond the idea of watching. I had ""Mary and Max"" pending in my watch-list for a long time mainly because of its presence in the Top 250. So, when I found it in the DVD store, I thought time had come to give it a shot. Well, let's just say that after five minutes, I was entranced by its beautiful ugliness and if I had one intimate conviction is that it would not disappoint me and that every second of it was to be savored like a tiny bite of my favorite chocolate.<br/><br/>That film is Adam Elliott's ""Mary and Max"", and it's so profoundly and deeply human that it drowns you into its story. It's about two persons who couldn't have been more opposite, age-wise and geographically, but they have in common a few things like their initials, their passion for chocolate, for Smurfs-like creatures named Noblets and last but not least, they're outcasts. Mary is a shy, insecure Australian girl with an odd birth mark looking like poo stain on her forehead, that she wears glasses and is a bit plump completes the ungrateful portrait. But the tone of the film never mocks her, she's not that way because she's supposed to incarnate a stereotype, her personality is the consequence of her insecurity which is a consequence of her appearance. Anyone who's been an insecure child can relate to Mary, and one who was lucky enough to meet beauty standards can at least feel for her, because people like Mary tend to develop a rare virtue in our individualistic world: she care for others, she's empathetic.<br/><br/>She's also extremely curious and naive like any child, and just to fulfill her curiosity, she opens an American phone book and rips a page that contains the address of Max Horowitz, a New Yorker, she sends him a letter, asking a few random question about babies and the stuff she likes. Little did she know that she had just started a twenty-year correspondence and one of the most beautiful on-screen friendships, and friendships are never as believable and solid as when they're slowly built by the passing of time, and step by step, the letters Max will receive from Mary will become an indispensable part of his life. And we're not even shocked that this is going between a little girl and a man in his forties because for one thing, their exchanges exude sincerity. Later, Max finally reveals he's got Asperger's syndrome, which finally explains why so many things make him irritable, including a few letters from Mary.<br/><br/>These letters occupy the most of the film, but they never, absolutely never, feel as fillers, they help us to learn more about the evolution (or lack of) of Mary and Max and the people who populate their world. Mary's father is an ordinary man whose work in a tea bag factory inspired Mary's dream to marry an Englishman named Earl Grey and live in Scotland with her nine babies. Mary's mother, an alcoholic kleptomaniac, is the kind of mother you wouldn't even wish for your bully, and if it wasn't for a providential slip, Mary would never have read Max' first letter and know how much they had in common, in fact, she would have never known him, period.<br/><br/>There is something very true to life in these letters, they tell you more than Mary or Max' lives, they're about the cathartic effect of writing, having someone we can share our problems with as a tool to overcome our own weaknesses. And many people with lamentable social skills have a tremendous capability for expressing their emotions, because they spent so much time in long introspection they know exactly what's going inside. In a way, Mary and Max' blessings came from their curses, and in some of the film's most heartbreaking moments, they both recall the worst episodes of their life, especially when they were bullied. There's a scene with a kid taking Mary's sandwich and peeing on it, and yes, kids can be that cruel. A victim of bullying will never understand the bully's delight in violence because of this empathy. And having discussed about bullying lately, the film sure hit a sensitive chord.<br/><br/>Max is a pacifist, but he's not much an empathetic man, more of the apathetic kind, he lives his life according to his nature and never questions his social disabilities, like anyone, he has a past with its burdens and its positive stuff, he regularly sees a therapist Dr. Hazelhof and tries more or less to give a meaning to his life, and what better than goals to achieve this. Basically, Max' got three goals in life: collecting all the Noblets, having chocolate supply for life and having a friend, not an imaginary one. This is the effect Mary has on Max and through an extraordinary reciprocity, even Max positively influences Mary. Well, by that point of the film, it either comes to go further and spoil it or just invite anybody who thinks he or she's seen all in movies to watch this magnificent little gem. I was shocked that it didn't make it in the Oscar nominations because it IS a powerful existential masterpiece.<br/><br/>It has the upbeat poetry of ""AmÃ©lie"", the dark humor of ""About Schmidt"" (which was also about an old curmudgeon venting his anger through a letter he sent to a little African boy) but the result is admirably original because the letters make the plot, they're not accessories to it and because the ending is just perfect. I'm not saying it's sad or it's happy, it's just that after one hour and half of this existential ride, we have an emotionally rewarding ending."

","Mary and Max is a story of two lonely people residing miles away from each other and become unlikely friends through constant letter writing. The kids may not find this animated movie nice as there are dark and realistic portrayals of what we encounter in our lives. The movie is mostly black and white clay animation with slight shades of red. I haven't seen many stop-motion animated movies but the best I recall was 'Coraline' also released in 2009. Well as much as Coraline was filled with fantasy this one far realistic.<br/><br/>The script is very good, giving us lessons we need to learn in life like moving on no matter what happens. The voice-actors also did fine job especially Philip Hoffman as Max. I liked the movie but it felt kind of repetitive after 1-2 conversations though the letters between Mary and Max. Also it tries to pity its characters a bit too much. What I did like is there were humorous moments popping up here and there despite the theme of the whole film being sad. If you don't like stop-motion animation or realistic films with not much excitement unlike what you see in your day to day animation films I suggest you keep away from this one.<br/><br/>RATING: [3.5/5]"

","Mary is a nerdy little girl living in an Australian suburb with her drug addict mom and bizarre factory worker father. She constantly calls herself ugly, especially concerning the large brown birthmark on her head.<br/><br/>One day, while her mother is ""buying"" envelopes, Mary finds a New York City address book and writes to Max, an obese Jewish man living in a skyscraper apartment. He writes back, reluctantly at first, and Mary's mom assumes the letter is some kind of pedophilia attempt and throws it in the garbage. Mary's beloved pet rooster retrieves it and she eagerly writes back to Max, learning that they both have a lot in common, like their love of chocolate and cartoons.<br/><br/>As the story goes on, it is implied that the film takes place in the 70's, when little was known about mental disorders and electroshock therapy and heavy medication was still frequent. Max has a breakdown and is lifted from his apartment in a catatonic state, featured in the news as ""retarded obese man lifted from apartment window"". He is put through eight months of harsh psychiatric treatment and Mary assumes he thinks she's ugly and tries to forget her friend. He writes back to her eventually, and she's overjoyed, but as she reaches adulthood her parents die and she goes to university, paying for corrective surgery to impress a boy (he turns out to be gay later on) and she writes and publishes a book on Asperger's Syndrome using Max as a case study. Max is horrified when he reads that she thinks Asperger's Syndrome is a mental disability that can be ""cured"" someday, and when he sends her the M key from his typewriter she falls into an alcoholic depression, contemplating suicide until her agoraphobic neighbor comes to the rescue with a new package from Max.<br/><br/>She goes to visit Max with her newborn baby, only to find his dead body on the couch. She sits with him and holds his hand, and then is startled and overjoyed to find tons of her drawings and letters taped to Max's ceiling, and she realizes that she was his best and only true friend, just as he was for her.<br/><br/>Max's portrayal of Asperger's is very accurate. I have Asperger's, severe depression and chronic pain syndrome but there is a varied range of types of Asperger's Syndrome on the Asperger's spectrum. Mine is more creating my own imaginary friends although I'm an adult, lacking social skills and only ever wearing one color, as well as an obsession to pollute the planet on purpose. It was wonderful to see Max showing that Asperger's isn't a disease or mental illness, that it doesn't need a ""cure"".<br/><br/>I loved the animation, and it was great to find something with a more adult theme instead of just Disney films and generic anime stuff. Mary and Max is original, creative and incredibly hilarious at times, as well as revealing about the ideology of the 70's. Nothing is ever sugar-coated, it is blatantly stated that Mary's mom is an alcoholic and a drug addict, and that the electroshock methods used in the 70's are wrong. There are some sex comments, vulgar language is used at times, prostitutes, condoms, babies, etc. are brought up occasionally and I have no idea why but various characters are always farting at random times in the film. It was unnecessary and sort of took away from the film, but otherwise: <br/><br/>Great soundtrack<br/><br/>Excellent voice actors/actresses<br/><br/>Original plot<br/><br/>Lovable and creative characters<br/><br/>Amazing animation <br/><br/>The plot vaguely reminded me of the 1989 film Babycakes, about the obese woman who works at the funeral parlor in New York City. It came out around the same time Coraline and the Lovely Bones did, and to be honest I enjoyed this story the best out of the three, mainly because it's honest.<br/><br/>This is one movie I'll always love, and I highly recommend it. I think it's the best film of 2009, maybe even the best film of the decade, forget all that Hunger Games trash and watch this because it's far more original than anything I've seen in a long time!"

","Mary and Max (2009) undoubtedly is a display of clay animation filmmaking prowess. It has spectacular cinematography, fantastic clay sculptures, lovely characters, wonderful voice acting and a genuine story that is just so good. To be honest, I do not know how to properly describe this animation film. The story, the art, the cultural significance. It is realistic yet unusual, which will appeal to the mass but it is also quite depressing as it is never shy to portray painful social issues such as but does not limit to abandonment, loneliness, bullies, suicides and accidental deaths.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Mary and Max is not a confusing animated film really, it is in fact quite enjoyable to watch and funny at times but it could leave us emotionally confused afterward if you decide to reflect on it like me. The obscurity of love, life and death, all can be felt in this film! It is definitely one of my favorite animated film. I only wish they would let us know the exchanges between Mary and Max while she's pregnant before the end. You should watch this if you haven't!"

This amazingly detailed clay-animated (Ã¡ la Wallace & Gromit with a grayish twist!), but QUITE adult fairy tale is one of those: Unhappy 8-year-old Mary in a small Australian town, writes a chance letter in the 1970's to middle-aged obese man, Max in NYC, USA - and so an unlikely pen-pal-correspondence begins... that is nothing but a marvel to share!<br/><br/>The biggest miracle this movie pulls off is to literally transport you into another universe of its own, where the surprises never stop coming. Through the lives and fates of two simply unforgettable characters, it takes a firm, heartfelt stand for The Outsider and dives head-first into dark places where, say Pixar rarely would dare to go (mental afflictions, alcoholism, bullying, family deaths etc). Almost guaranteed to move you to tears, (even a few more might be shed knowing that recently diseased Philip Seymour Hoffman provides the fantastic voice of Max) it also serves up top-notch black humor and is hysterically funny at times. <br/><br/>Yes, I am seriously in love with this wonderful film and can't wait until I get to watch it again.

Telling with great humor, warmth, insight, and a certain darkness, and above all a unique style, it is the story of a small girl in suburban Australia, who is desperately lonely and an outsider, who, by random chance, befriends as a penpal a middle-aged Jewish Asperger: Max.<br/><br/>This is not a charming film (though it has heart) it is a film about radical honestly, and a stark reminder that contact is what makes us human.<br/><br/>The fact that it is also a true story just tops off a truly original piece of work.

"yamaguchi-victor","10","3","6","31 January 2012"," A must-see animation
","It is interesting how animated features are mostly marked as 'children movies' â€“ something that started a long time ago with the first animations in the early 20's. Due to this fact, we see that the mainstream animations are made only by big Hollywood studios aiming in particular the young audience. Sometimes we see a film like Up(2009) or Wall-e(2008) that are not exclusively for kids, but for adults as well. However, we rarely see a true adult animation like Persepolis(2007) or Silvain Chomet's The Triplets of Belleville (2003).<br/><br/>Mary and Max is one of those 'rare' animations. It tells the story about Mary, a girl neglected by her parents who is very lonely and doesn't have any friends. She then decides to choose randomly someone from New York to write a letter â€“ she end up picking up Max's address. Max is a forty-something old obese man who is also lonely, sad, depressed and doesn't have any perspective on life. When he receives Mary's letter, he is enchanted by it and both start a friendship that lasts more than twenty years.<br/><br/>The story seems a bit silly, but the film story deals with a lot of deep issues such as anxiety, depression, suicide and even Asperger Syndrome - black-humor is also present. The main theme is, however, friendship and the film does a great work on it, being sometimes very sad or very touching and optimistic. In any moment the story or the characters fall into clichÃ©s.<br/><br/>The director also made an interesting use of colors - in the whole film, there are almost only two colors: brown and gray. They are used with the intention of being a metaphor of Mary and Max's vision of their own lives. Mary's life is brown because it is uninteresting and boring; Max's life is gray because it is depressing, sad and without any hope or perspective of getting better.<br/><br/>So, with no colored images and no happy characters, this is not the kind of movie to show to children â€“ most of them wouldn't understand it. However, it isn't for all adults as well â€“ this film require a more sensitive audience that is able to capture and understand the elements presented in the story and the meanings of it.<br/><br/>This is a must-see film for those who want to appreciate other styles of animation rather than just see the conventional ones."
"ajs-10","9","3","6","11 December 2011"," Well worth a look!
","I knew very little about this film before seeing it; I knew it was animated and that it was an Australian film. Someone had mentioned it online, stating it was pretty good and so I added it to 'The List' and waited for it to appear. It finally did and I duly recorded it expecting some strange Aussie humour. To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what I was going to see when I hit the play button. Imagine my surprise when I found a wonderful, funny and deeply touching story, beautifully animated with such great characters. I would even go so far as to say I loved it! (And I don't say that often!). Rather than give a summary, I'll give you a very brief outline of what the film is about.<br/><br/>Mary is a lonely eight year old girl who lives in the suburbs of Melbourne (Australia). One day she randomly picks a name from an American phone book she finds in the local post office. She writes to one Max Horovitz, a forty four year old man who lives in New York (USAÂ… that's just for balance). The unlikely pair strike up a friendship and write to each other on and off over the next twenty years. I really don't want to say too much more, but the film covers issues like loneliness, mental health, love and hate, it's all quite grown up, so not really one for the kids. I think I stopped just before the Spoiler Police wrapped me up and sent me to their pen palÂ… in Alaska.<br/><br/>The two main characters are fully rounded and you get a great sense of what they are feeling due to an excellent script and also to the voice talents of the actors playing their parts. So I must give praise to the voice talents of both Toni Collette as Mary Daisy Dinkle and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max Jerry Horovitz. Also, the narrator, voiced by Barry Humphries had a great part to play, so a big chunk of praise going his way too.<br/><br/>Made in the 'claymation' style favoured by the Ardman studio here in the UK (responsible for the likes of 'Wallace and Gromit' amongst others), I thought it was really well done. Lots of little visual gags in amongst the rather serious story that unfolds. It's witty, intelligent, charming, but there are also some serious messages in there. I found it quite touching at the end, but I can't really talk about the ending here. Over allÂ… HIGHLY Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 9.2/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 31,658 votes at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 94/100 (based on 54 reviews counted at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 90/100 (based on 17,282 user ratings counted at the time of going to press)."
"FairlyAnonymous","9","3","6","13 June 2011"," I finally watched it, and I loved it while being depressed
","This is a movie with a lot of themes and social issues. It has abuse, drug issues, rejection, bullying, divorce, death, people who are ""disabled"", and many others. This means this movie can move just about anyone, because it reaches out to so many subjects. Of course this means that the movie is very depressing, and can leave you really upset at times.<br/><br/>On a note: this is not a kids movie. Just because it is clay animated, and has a mildly friendly title does not mean it is a kids movie. It has many mature themes in it, and has some nudity. So just kind of saying that. There are some jokes that are very subtle, but are pretty mature. Especially how Mary's dad gets ""all the Teabags he wants"". At first I didn't think it was a joke, but they put a lot of emphasis on it.<br/><br/>The movie has a great soundtrack, while the main theme may be overused a little bit, it is still nice. This movie has a very nice visual appeal. Mary's world in Australia is shades of brown, white, red, and gray. While Max's world in New York is shades of black, white, and red. The movie keeps these colors except for only a couple of scenes. And the one scene in the movie that is in full color is arguably one of the saddest and most depressing scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is about a young girl who has no friends, her father isn't paid much and he spends no time with his daughter. Her mom is a bit abusive, smokes a lot, drinks a lot and is really not nice at all. Mary decides to make a pen pal with some random person, and meets Max who lives in New York. He is obese and has Aspergers. It is interesting seeing his view on the world, and sort of how he thinks. Kind of an eye opener. The plot revolves around their notes to each other and how their lives change because of their friendship with each other, so the movie does have slower parts about halfway through and can get a bit boring.<br/><br/>Either way Mary and Max is a beautiful film that will most likely depress you after watching it. The ending could be seen a mile away, but it was still good."

","Their friendship begins with a random letter and evolves to a close relation. Although it has some depressing scenes everyone can watch it. Because of it's emotional intensity it makes you feel different. The animation that has a pessimist atmosphere but the theme of Friendship can be worked up quite successfully. Sometimeswe can become entangled in contradictions just like Max. Director wanted to mention about this situation. Depressing scenes affected me too much. I was surprised at the animation because it was like real life. Musics between the scenes are really good and on time and well-advised. I noticed that there was little comedy item but it is considerably important for me because when we are extremely sad and in depression we need all of them because they help me. Mary lives in her own world and own designed toys that I really admired. She has desserts and cream and his own life that in loneliness. Max is really interesting man because of chocolate in the bread etc. Our characteristics can be changed and sometimes come to a halt and This situation can cause bad experiences in our lives. It is good to see this examples in animations. LOVE YOURSELF FIRST Mary and Max's common point was it. The thing that strengthen their friendship is that. They accepted themselves with their defects. Nothing is excellent in the life because life is defective. To be happy we must learn how to live with our faults.<br/><br/>The film's themes including childhood neglect, teasing, loneliness, autism, obesity, depression and anxiety. The funniest scene is that eating chocolate with bread and Max was the most suitable type and I really liked it beside this Mary's mother is an other fascinating character on the other hand her red lips and cigarettes support each other's features. I really recommend it everybody. My vote is 10/9 You won't be bored while watching it."

","Take one disillusioned Australian child called Mary and one mentally deficient New York adult called Max add to that a script that manages to be poignant, humorous and moving all at the same time and animate it as if Robert Crumb worked for Aardman making Wallace and Gromit for adults and you have 'Mary and Max'. A film so special and made with so much care and attention that not only is it one of my films of the year it has instantly become one of my favourite films of all time. Its not very often you feel such a strong attachment to characters in a film that spending an hour and half with them just isn't enough, its even stranger when they are not even real. But in that is where the genius of this film shines through, by taking two opposite ends of the spectrum on two opposite sides of the world it shows that space, age, distance and time actually don't make us all that different and problems are problems no matter who or where you are. In the accidental blossoming of their pen pal friendship the two main characters teach each other so much and show us the viewer the powerful nature of the human spirit. Bursting with ideas and an attention to detail that even extends to the colouring you can't fail to fall in love with this movie. In a sea of blockbuster dirge it's amazing to actually see a film this good could make it to the surface, my advice if you see one film this year make it this one, you will not be disappointed."

","Its my individual opinion with due apologies to all those who loved it.<br/><br/>i am sorry to say but director Adam Elliot has tried to make an animation movie, which is usually for kids and fragile minds, very depressing. non happy ending and a story more like a romance or long distance friendships which doesn't work. A topic more of an adult mind not of kids whose major aim is just innocent and innocuous fun . He should have casted Mila Kunis with Mel Gibson as Max and Mary combination and should not have been an animation.92 minutes were like an odyssey i thought my watch is broken why the hell is this movie not finishing.And you know why and when it happens when it bores the crap out of you.<br/><br/>Only good thing about the movie was that the guy was presented as a good representative of the symptoms of Asperger's disease.<br/><br/>Animations are supposed to be kept light and interesting and some thing to imprint a smile on face after watching it.

Good ones should either have fantastic picture or surprising story. At the first 1 hour, I seriously think it is boring cause the movie is just telling you that a shy Australia girl and a timid American man writing each other.

"johnnymonsarrat","6","13","52","13 February 2010"," Wasted creativity on a weak plot line
","You can't fault the artistry behind Mary & Max. Done in a claymation manner similar to Wallace and Gromit, but less impressively than Coraline, the film walks that comedic line, giving its characters off- beat personality traits that aren't too wacky to be believable, but are strange enough to make us laugh. It's cute, like a children's book.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's a dark undercurrent in the film, and without giving away the plot line, I found that the entire 2nd half of the film and its ending departed from this theme. Instead of lovable failings that we can all laugh at and identify with, the two protagonists end up making mistakes that are genuine and contain genuine pain.<br/><br/>Comedies can have a kind of cartoony pain where you know everything's going to turn out all right. They should not have genuine pain. If the film's early promise (from its first half) had been dramatic, rather than comedic, the 2nd half might have made some sense. But why build us up for a feel-good story and then leave us feeling bad?<br/><br/>By the end of the film, there's no sense that the pain will end.<br/><br/>Although I didn't like it, I appreciated the film's originality and its artistry.

"marcusmero","7","2","4","8 September 2014"," Mary and Max Review
","""Mary and Max"" (2009) is a stop motion animated film about two pen pals writing from two different countries. Mary is a nervous and embarrassed girl who wants nothing but to have a friend. She lives in Australia. Max is an obese man living in New York and has a disorder called Asperger's. Their friendship begins in the most random way. Mary finds a phone book, writes down a name and then decides to write to the name. What ensues is an odyssey of growing up and realism of life in excruciating detail and humor.<br/><br/>Now I went into this movie not knowing what it was or how it was going to play out. All I knew was that it was a random animated short film on Netflix but when the movie began we had a change in character from other such animated films. The jokes were very adult and themes that the film covers is very mature. Now all of this doesn't drown out the movie, however, it has heart. The film displays friendship between two different but utterly the same people. Some of the letters are funny, sad and informative and that leads to the character of Max having an anxiety attack. The film also goes as far to display suicide though the act never follows through. Overall this is a film for mature audiences.<br/><br/>I loved animation. Stop motion was something I loved when I was younger and that art seems to be lost except for the works of Tim Burton. The story telling was top notch and there are times when you laugh out loud. The ending was touching and basically put the icing on the cake. I guess my gripe would be the overwhelming amount of adult jokes and mature themes though this can be perceived as a good thing. There are parts you'd think would never make it into an animated film and there are many shocking moments."
"xodanielcasterox","7","2","4","12 March 2014"," Interesting, dark, witty and depressing.
","I wouldn't necessarily regard this as a great movie but for the most part I think it's pretty good. The clay animation is superb--which I swear they're using CG because the stop motion is so damn good--the voice acting is pretty decent although they could have just taken it easy on the narration but it does a little to let the moment sink in when needed but only narrate in the beginning and the end and let the emotions do all the talking. The environment looks depressing and a bit dark but that's a positive for me. I love dark movies. It doesn't push the darkness too far, it has some funny moments to lighten the depressing mood that the characters are going through and has some touching elements that cannot be ignored, in my opinion. This looks like another Tim Burton clay animation but for adults which I was hoping it would be but it's not. I wouldn't recommend this to children but I would say chance it for yourself. Oh, I almost forgot. It has a moral for everyone that we can all learn in life. About choosing the right friends even if there is only one in life, and that person could also be your best friend because he/she is your only friend. It tells you to choose and appreciate the friends you have even if there are few. Thank you for that, movie. Thank you."

Both of them are abandoned by life. In reality, they have no friends, but accidentally a letter conversation allows them to know each other and slowly become a better self, but later Mary has a little bit of Marx Too much, I feel a little betrayal of their friendship, but fortunately Mary got it wrong. The most regrettable thing about the film is that they didn't meet each other, but maybe imperfect is perfect.<br/><br/>The friendship between Mary and Marx is not present in this impetuous society. It is exactly the same sentence. In ancient times, letters were far away, the carriage was very slow, and I could only love one person in my life. Now that I have a mobile phone, it is much more convenient and fast, but there is a lot less communication. There are very few friends who can share new things every day. I used to have it, but I did n't cherish it, which caused me to miss a lot.<br/><br/>If you live a lifetime, you still have to focus on managing your offline feelings.

To feel isolated in the world, and yet to have an improbable friend in a pen-pal you've never met - just to know they're out there and to hear from them as you trundle through life - the connection is meaningful and beautiful.

","I always find stop motion movies very beautiful and cheerful. Well, this one is beautiful it his own way, but is far from cheerful and it is ok. The pure joy of imagine millions of plasticine dolls being made and manipulated in order to create a moving image is just amazing. I liked the way that the movie depicted Max's New York, all black and white, apart from that thing that he had in his Kippah, that was red. And the sirens, they had colour too. That, the think in his kippah, not the sirens, was meant to lead us to understand his state of mind. Apart from Asperger disease he has also a depression, and I can relate to that. When we are depressed, our world feels black and white. It does not matter if the they are sunny or not, our mind will depict it as rainy day, or if you lucky, a cloudy one.
In resume, I was not expecting to feel feels, but I felt them, and I am thankful for that."

","Some movies are just special and a want to think carefully before I review them. I've known of this movie for ages without knowing any details. I'm always fascinated by animation that is neither the family movie idiom or its polar opposite (Like, you know, Family Guy of which I am actually a big fan).<br/><br/>Describing this movie is hard, but that's partly because it's intelligence lies in the simplicity its idea, though this is not really a simple movie.<br/><br/>It's tempting to say that it didn't need to be animated but a movie more than the logistics of its plot, this movie has a style and tonality all of its own which more than justifies the work needed to stop motion animate it like a vintage kids show as this movie embodies that part of all of us that still feels like a small child trying to understand a challenging world.<br/><br/>Always visually compelling, the narrator is agreeable enough but I can't help but feel that they over use him; several times in the story we can see quite clearly how capable the movie is of conveying the narrative visually but the overall picture feels simply like an audiobook that happens to be elaborately illustrated as we see the hypotheticals, fantasies and fears of the characters as they describe them to each other. But since the narrative is all about a penpal correspondence and thus very internal, they can sort of get away with this more than the average movie could and very little of it is objectionable anyway.<br/><br/>A grotesquely but still beautifully painted in muted colors and grotesquely charming (but usually just grotesque) visions of the human form that made me feel like I was witnessing the human race like an alien would; unbiased by any local standard of beauty. Mary's waddling walk and the cartoonish proportions of the characters combined with the stylized vision of the foreboding inner city and the stark antipodean suburbs give an effect that is at once naive and sophisticated somehow.<br/><br/>it's a dark vision of a seemingly hopeless world. Everyone is ugly and destruction is everywhere, especially of the self. It gets so relentlessly unfortunate that it becomes comical and then bursts out the other side and becomes just dark again.<br/><br/>I never knew what this movie would throw at me and I was figuratively brought to the edge of my seat at least once. The shameless use of scatological detail and crass jokes make this a movie that is not aspiring to any particular standard of beauty and the small lifeline at the centre of the picture of two individuals who despite everything found each is like nothing I've seen before in any artistic medium. It makes you feel like laughing, crying and low key recoiling and each turn leads seamlessly to the others.<br/><br/>It's abuse of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra notwithstanding, this movie had me in tears and punches home with a remarkable honesty and humility that people are all basically broken and although I have a couple of objection to where ended up considering what this movie puts you though, I walked away from this with a greater capacity for empathy than when I begun it."

","Despite an occasionally 'mean spirit', 'Mary And Max (2009)' manages to actually be rather emotionally resonant - in its own, slightly irreverent way, of course. It's generally rough-around-the-edges but ultimately quite endearing, telling the tale of two long-distance best fiends with a heavy dose of 'edgy' humour and some moments of real darkness. It's perhaps because it's not afraid to be as serious as it is, or to present its world as harshly and as blackly comic as it wants to, that it's so successful; it creates a grounded but bleak reality filled downtrodden characters and then takes the time to show the small, yet incredibly powerful, moments of happiness they manage to find within it. The narrative is told mostly through narration - whether by Mary, Max or, well, the narrator - which creates a kind of 'storybook' feel. The lead characters almost never speak to anyone, either, which bolsters their loneliness outside of their all-important written relationship. For the most part, the picture balances its tone well enough. Sometimes, it gets a little too dark or a little too silly for its own good, however. It's aimed primarily at adults, that's for sure. Its pacing isn't quite as tight as you'd like, either. Still, the film is filled with tender, well-conceived moments and usually amounts to an engaging, entertaining time. Like I said, it's quite emotionally resonant, too. 7/10"

","Films like Mary and Max come along so rarely that when they do, they must be hugged tightly and treasured. For those with an aversion to gritty social realism, it is a tonic for the soul. It is a tale so delicate that it might shatter if nudged lightly, a whimsical take on how an eight year old girl and an autistic man find lifelong friendship through a chance encounter. Their decade and longer correspondence proves crucial to the power of the ending's revelation: we do not get to choose our warts, but we can choose our friends, and Mary and Max choose correctly. <br/><br/>The film has been branded as 'for adults' by some concerned viewers for its frank subject matter; anxiety, suicide, and mental illness to rattle off a few. Yet to do this is to miss the entire point. The warmth of the titular friendship is what carries the pair, radiating an unconditional love that lights up even the muddy browns of Mount Waverly and dreary greys of New York. It is a language that dogs and eight year old girls know all too well. <br/><br/>Max comes to the same conclusions. In a wonderful voice performance by the late great Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he breathes husky life into a man who refuses to be solely defined by his disability. It is a voice full of calculated whimsy and character, putting to shame every one of the celebrities who are cast for exposure (a recent worrying trend in animation). Close your eyes and listen to how he huffs and puffs his way to the ends of sentences. Hear how he pauses for commas, and how his inflection mirrors the way he observes life and its many tricks; as matter of fact. The sum of his reasonings are like punctuation in itself (recall the brilliant comedic timing of Max rattling off his favourite lottery numbers). Max looks all around him, and observes peculiar truths that unintentionally reveal the silliness of modern living. And along the way, we chuckle and realise we agree. <br/><br/>If you saw the Oscar winning short Harvie Krumpet, then you'll recognise Adam Elliot's distinct style of stop-motion animation, lovingly crafted through a painstakingly lengthy process (no one's really taking the time to do this anymore, except for Laika and Aardman, and even they struggle to capture a new level of appeal with flashier counterparts on surrounding screens). His characters have a startling way of showing emotion, as if they were one of those plastic squeeze toys. Their eyes bulge in panic, their whole bodies seem to vibrate with urgency. But their features are squished in and frozen - anxiety stops them dead in their tracks. You can feel the labour of love in the construction of the world. Oodles of fishing line become rain. KY jelly slops around as water. It's real life, re-imagined with crayons, squiggly lines and the brain of a child at play. Their letters contain many a metaphor packed full of flavour, and the world around them responds. <br/><br/>For the duration of its runtime, Mary and Max refuses to swoop down to the despairing depths that is expected of its subject matter. And why should it? Its own characters refuse to buy into the genre's typical ailments. Their lives are seemingly rubber stamped with endings, yet they never heed these calls. Elliot disarms any preconceived notions of how a story of mental illness should play out, because Mary and Max just don't see it that way. Some might call it twee or juvenile, but only because they've lost sight of how powerful the screen can be as a tool for hope. The film is a testament to the touching power of friendship and imagination. It is how the world should look like, according to a lonely eight year old girl, and his autistic penpal from New York. There's no need for a tonal cure."

It's sad from the beginning, but the end is the one who carries the most drama. It has some funny moments in contrast with the rest of the plot but unfortunately some boring sequences as well. It will make you think twice about the people you care, about those to whom you've been rude and even about yourself! A superb movie!"

With better music. etc. Still, I did recognize why people like this movie. It can connect with people experiencing loneliness and struggling to find friends. But even so, the characters aren't too likable. I don't know. I think this just isn't a movie for me. And that is all there is to say about it. I see some people loving some girls I don't find beautiful at all. So, we all have our own tastes. Nothing new here.<br/><br/>Why the high rating? I can only assume, only a select audience is viewing this. Real blockbuster audience would rate this 7.0 tops. <br/><br/>But I guess this is how it is. And that is why IMDb ratings can't be fully trusted. <br/><br/>My Real Rating 3.9"

The characters are pretty good. The narration is excellent. Every minute, though, there is another attempt at a poo joke, and these become impossible to ignore.<br/><br/>The script needed some work to cut this poorer material out.

","I can't say that this movie wasn't creatively done or didn't have some interesting thoughts to pursue with the principal characters. But to get there, you had to wade through such depressing topics as atheism, alcoholism, anti-Semitism, pre-teen sexual advice, self medicating one's troubles with drugs and booze, and suicide as a possible solution to life's troubles. And lest one can't figure out the film maker's liberal bias in dealing with these subjects, he throws in a slam at former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by calling the mayor in this story 'Ridiculani'. The 'love yourself' message, which is a good one, sort of gets lost in the hodge-podge of letter writing activity between Mary and Max, and since the correspondence occurred over a span of twenty years, the thought that kept springing into my mind was why neither one of them came up with the idea to visit the other before so much time passed, and then in the end it was too late. The picture held out so much promise when Mary first wrote and voiced those words in my summary line to Max in her very first letter. Too bad it had to end as such a downer of a story."

Was this a fluke or some hidden gem that has not received enough attention? <br/><br/>Indeed, it turns out to be the latter.

","Mary and Max features two different pen-pals suffered different dysfunctions from different continents some 30 years ago, but if the idea already made you yarn, let's be honest, you should see a doctor.<br/><br/>Just after the first viewing, I have already updated my top 5 animation movies with Mary And Max among them. The reason, it's a perfect illustration of the thousands of layers of life, keeping a high profile of those imperfections by symbolizing them but allowing the love among humans to flow to the last, warming the audiences indifferently. (Well, as long as you don't bash a film because of some improper contents for children.) Don't be freaked out by the weird art design. Actually, those sensitive ones should have already felt the underlying irony in those sad, agonized faces filling out the movie. From the carves on a mailbox to every adult alike in Mary and Max's world, ""beauty"" is but a word describing extinction. Mary's face, figure and everything alike had a deep feeling of asymmetric and depression while Max lives in a tottered balance so fragile but also so ironic, portraying a sick man in a sick world. Through their different but same pains they knew each other. And the whole experience is such an unbelievable flow of black comedy that blew Fight Club and Little Miss Sunshine away.<br/><br/>I have to be honest, that this movie is not intended for kids and really shouldn't be promoted to anyone under 15. Yes, there are controversial contents. And if again you hated it purely because of that, I have to express my sympathy for you as you are exactly like Max or any other paranoid people. (Poor Max......) Finally, I would wish Up and this movie to contend Oscar in different years since I loved both of them. But for this year I have to express my reverence to Mary and Max, a multi-layered, honest, inspiring, hilarious, light-hearted dark comedy.<br/><br/>10/10. Just give it an Oscar...please."

","Mary And Max is one of the most heartfelt, serious, honest and depressing films I have ever seen. It is unlike me to fall this much in love with a film, and yet, this film is just so dark and sad that I almost feel guilty for having it so close to my heart. The animation, the Australian references, the black humor, all combine to create one of the most sentimental films of all time.<br/><br/>Mary And Max truly is an original film. Never have I seen so many innuendos in a film that create so much comedy, yet so much sadness.

","I accidentally ordered this film on Netflix. How very serendipitous. This is one of the most creative and touching things I've seen. First of all, the creation of what could have been passed off as grotesques, begin to make their ways into our souls. Both Mary and Max are lost souls who have demons. They are also optimistic, given the hands that have been dealt them. Through circumstances, they have beliefs in the realities of humanity that are so innocent. For example, where to babies come from. Mary has never really had a friend and ends up making contact with Max when she tears his name off the bottom of a telephone book page. They correspond between Australia and New York. They have been bullied and pushed around their whole lives. Max has issues with depression and self esteem. Mary has a mother from hell. Of course, these are clay characters, but when bad things happened to them, I literally wanted to cry. There is no romantic angle, only two people that need each other desperately. Much of it is so funny, but ultimately a serious take on the human condition."
"Quinoa1984","10","2","6","13 May 2015"," the joy and pain of connecting in (friendly) love
","Mary and Max is like opening up a graphic novel, meant more for adults than children (not that it's explicit, just... adult), and finding something that justifies the reason for this medium to expand as it sometimes does. In other words, this is a film that takes animation, claymation in fact, and takes it to another level of possibility. There are a lot of funny things that happen in this story of two pen-pals - one, initially, a 7 year-old Australian girl, and the other a 44 year-old man in New York city - who first connect over a cartoon show and find they have some things very much in common. This is a story that is profound and moving for the depths to which it explores the fragility in human beings, how vulnerable some of us can get, and what being on the 'outside' really means in society, being on the margins as being a woman, or mentally ill, or ""ugly"" whatever that means, or unable to control oneself.<br/><br/>Something about this style of animation that Adam Eliot implements is fascinating to see unfold. Only occasionally do we see characters talking, with their mouths moving. Perhaps this was a challenge that the filmmaker gave himself and, especially, to see to what lengths he could take voice-over narration (usually a big no-no if you take a screen writing class, to which I wonder if Mary and Max would be thrown out as ""improper""). The film is mostly presented as the series of letters that Mary and Max are writing each other over the years - she starts off as a little girl with a dysfunctional family (well, more than others, though abusive more in the sense of neglect) and a sense of wonder about the world around her, and questions of things like being bullied and, frankly, what sex is; he is diagnosed later with Aspergers, but we can tell early on that something is 'off' about this single, lonely, dejected Jewish man who has an imaginary friend who for a while now sits in the corner reading self-help books.<br/><br/>Their relationship has its ups and its downs - a stint in a mental institution brings a time gap (Max sometimes, or, no, almost all of the time) freaks out and gets anxiety attacks at the sorts of questions that an adult has to answer truthfully to someone like a little girl - and yet the narration, both from a third-person perspective and then the letters (voiced brilliantly by Hoffman and Collette) really is exceptional work. We see everything that is being described on screen, so it's not un-cinematic, and at the same time the words being spoken provide a nice counter-point at times to what we're seeing, how Max may see things in his 'way' and Mary with her attention to her looks or that boy across the street who stutters and is Greek and has an interesting smell about him. It's the sort of thing that were this a graphic novel no one would question the structure. But as presented, it's really incredible how it all holds and unfolds with great pacing and attention to character and detail.<br/><br/>Much of this relies on both the humor in the writing, the voice work, and the exaggerated style in the animations. Mary's mother, for example, is one such a piece of work, a drunk who is kind of a harridan but fascinating to watch. Or that one older woman who sometimes cooks for Max (despite the hair, which he picks out). Some of Eliot and company's work here is nightmarish, garish, bringing out the fears and horrors of the characters to the forefront. And yet there was rarely a moment I wasn't completely, emotionally invested with these two people. So what if they're animated? When Mary is teased and goes through her hardships, it's difficult to watch (I almost felt tears welling up myself, mostly in the childhood scenes). This isn't simple manipulation - it's carefully, even spiritually, bringing us along into these character's level of awareness and how they feel things.<br/><br/>I wondered at times if this would work as well if it was live-action, which it could have been. I think the animation adds to this story and shapes Mary and Max into the unique experience it is, though one I wish would be done more in this medium. There are several visual quirks and possibilities given that it's stop-motion animation - water is depicted really Styrofoam bubbles - but, ultimately, it comes down to the truth in the characters, and yet... no, there is an extra element that it being this way brings, I'm sure of it.<br/><br/>Perhaps a certain innocence is evoked too? The fact that animated characters come together due to an animated cartoon in their world - and their hand-made and, later, collectible figurines? There's a lot to Mary and Max I hope to explore in further viewings - how much Judaism is satirized here to great effect, even as it's still a serious matter when a character is mocked for being Jewish, for example, or that neighbor of Mary's who can't get out of his house - and it's such a rich, harrowing experience that I can't recommend it enough."

"dfle3","7","6","37","23 April 2009"," Grungey odd-couple comedy/drama...but how true is it?
","This is a hard movie to rate. I do remember seeing posters, I think,  which stated that this movie was based on a true story. That wasn't  enough to make me want to watch this movie. So, when the TV show ""At  the movies"" reviewed it, and I saw some funny things, I decided to  watch it.  Watching this claymation movie, I had forgotten about the claims to  truth of this movie, which made me think that this was a very strange  movie indeed. It concerns the titular characters: Mary (voiced by  Bethany Whitmore for the child, and by ""The sixth sense""'s Toni  Collette for the adult), a young Australian girl, and Max, an  American middle-aged man (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman). Feeling  bored one day, Mary randomly picks a name out of a phone book and  writes to them...which is how she sends Max a letter. The movie airs  the contents of their letters over many years, and displays each  character's psychological state. Barry Humphries provides the narration  in the movie. That element doesn't work particularly well in this  movie, I don't think, as the story-book format can drag at times.  The clip I saw on ""At the movies"" was indicative of the quality of the  film...there are some genuinely funny exchanges between Mary and  Max...laugh out loud funny at times. However, forgetting that this  movie was supposedly based on a true story, I would think that the  content of the movie was very odd. It was quite dark at times. For that  reason, I don't think that this movie is appropriate for pre-teen  children, even though it is made with claymation (plasticine figurines  which are moved and photoed, to create the illusion of life in cinema).  So, as I said, this movie is hard to rate. It is genuinely funny at  times, but sometimes gloomily overwrought, which pegs it back a little.  If this movie bares no relation to reality, then I'd give it 6/10. If  there truth to it, I'd give it a score closer to 7/10. Did read an  interview with the movie's maker, Adam Elliott, in a local suburban  paper where I live (The Monash Leader, 14/04/2009, i.e. ten days ago),  where Elliott admits that the movie is based on his penfriend-ship with  an American when he, Elliott, was a child. On that basis, the high  melodrama that you see in this movie with Mary doesn't really seem to  be based on anything that Elliott himself experienced. On that basis  I'd mark this movie down a bit...it's gloom seems unmotivated. I'll  give it around 65/100."

Somehow all animated movies these days are pretty much a parody on the eponymous genre itself. All characters are completely over-exaggerated and ridiculous ergo unbelievable. Considering how one of the most important aspects of storytelling is the aspect of believability it's definitely not a good thing in this particular case."

","In essence the movie is about Mary a young girl with a cruel life becoming a penpal to Max a middle age man with diagnosed aspergers. In a movie like this you would expect there to be some kind of resolution, some glimpse of hope but the film just seems to get worse and worse. Tragedy after tragedy befall the hopeless pair. Even brief glimpses of happiness are marred by tragedy until in the end we are left with only tears, death and the half hearted sentiment that friendship no matter how intangible is maybe enough to salve deep scarring wounds.<br/><br/>To put it bluntly this movie is a downer. I think that the subject matter may not be suitable to claymation. Claymation usually offers something distracting, madcap, surreal.... but tragic? It's like the forms do not mix very well.

","The animation in this film is extremely fun to watch. The animation does a great job of luring the viewer into the film with animation that is funny and informative to the plot thereby making it so the viewer doesn't want to take their eyes off the screen for even a second. The problem with the film is the story. This little girl is being raised by neglectful and abusive parents. Max's Syndrome is severe enough that he should not be living alone unsupervised. Especially since he can become violent. By the time I was done watching this movie I was angry at the movie and it's makers. The animation was so incredibly entertaining and pretty funny, but it is belied by the gravity of what is actually happening. At the end of the movie I felt sick to my stomach. This movie has neglect and abuse, untreated and unabated alcoholism causing death, attempted murder, and attempted suicide. None of the characters get the help they need. I think to call this movie 'oddball' or 'quirky' is misleading. The ANIMATION is oddball and quirky, however, the themes and the plot are not. As an aside, the jab at Giuliani is dishonest and stupid since the mayor in NYC in the mid 70's was Abraham Beame. Giuliani was mayor 1994-2001."

","Mary and Max had been a part of my movie collection from the very beginning, having landed in the list because I was following the IMDb Top 250 back then. Anyway, it's the very first time I've seen this film & a part of me keeps wondering why I didn't check it out earlier for I could have gotten rid of it sooner & would've retrieved some storage space on my disk.<br/><br/>The story of Mary and Max follows the two titular characters: one is an 8-year-old girl living a lonely life in Australia, other is a morbidly obese 44-year-old man living in America who struggles to form close bonds with people & has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The plot covers the unlikely friendship between these two pen-pals who understand each other better than anyone else.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Adam Elliot, everything about Mary and Max is unconventional, from the way its story is narrated to the manner its themes are addressed. Even its animation is neither hand-drawn paintings nor computer renderings but makes use of clay, or claymation as it's called. And while a lot of it is worthy of commendation, it's not a film that's everyone is going to enjoy or appreciate.<br/><br/>The entire story is told in voice-overs since we barely see these characters communicating with anyone verbally. The script is brilliantly written plus the themes of loneliness, anxiety, depression, isolation, friendship, Asperger syndrome & obesity are beautifully depicted. The stop-motion photography makes use of separate tints for separate place, sepia for Australia & grayscale for America and the level of detail is impressive.<br/><br/>What I also liked is how wonderfully it captures the entire hypocrisy of the society we live in & it's extremely evident when seen from Max's perspective. Editing deliberately keeps a dull pace to reflects their lives but after a point, it becomes unbearable. And music manages to soar in few scenes. Also, the voice cast is wisely chosen & all of them end up doing a good job in infusing more personality into their respective characters.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Mary and Max is an art-house feature from Australian cinema that has a lot many great things going on and while the tone may seem depressing, it offers plenty of laughs along the way, doesn't matter if the humour is deadpan. The best thing about it is the two characters we have in Mary & Max plus the relaxed manner in which their friendship is progressed over the course of its runtime. Definitely worth a shot."

"Stompgal_87","9","1","3","18 July 2014"," A standout animated masterpiece with humorous and moving moments plus a character I could easily relate to
","I first heard of this film when I was doing research for a digital video project at college where I wanted to determine if African care staff had a sound understanding of autism and Asperger syndrome (which I have as well as Max in the film) and I watched the clip where Max reveals his diagnosis of Asperger's to Mary so I could analyse his traits. Two years ago I rented it and found it thoroughly enjoyable apart from being dissatisfied by the ending. Last year I discovered an Internet video review series called 'Jambareeqi Reviews,' which Jambareeqi mentioned on the IMDb message boards. I was intrigued and the first review of his I saw was for this film. Despite his review for this film being somewhat more favourable than mine, I was surprised when he said he had Asperger syndrome himself but reassured as well. When purchasing this DVD this week, I watched it and made notes on it, particularly those about Max's Asperger traits, in preparation for my dissertation on the portrayal of autism and Asperger syndrome in the media when I start back at university this autumn. I found this film slightly more enjoyable second time around despite noticing a flaw that I hadn't noticed first time around.<br/><br/>That particular flaw was with the opening music. While it is a beautiful, melodic piano and string-led piece, it was repetitive since it was used more than once throughout the film. Other pieces of music I liked were the same piece used for the theme tune of 'The Apprentice,' the piano-led piece played just before Max informs Mary of his Asperger's, the song 'Que Sera Sera' and the music played over the closing credits. Despite the slight musical weakness, this film has plenty of positive aspects such as its animation, its voice acting and its narrative. The stop-motion animation is similar to that used in Adam Elliot's other work 'Harvie Krumpet (which I saw a short clip of on a DVD I purchased several years ago to raise money for an appeal for the 2004 tsunami) and it is different from the style used for Aardman. There are also some segments of 2D animation that are used for Mary and Max's favourite cartoon 'The Noblets' and pictures accompanying what Mary writes in her first letter to Max. While the colour scheme may be a little on the dull side, I liked Mary's scenes being made in sepia tone and Max's being made in black and white to distinguish the difference between their worlds. There are a few bright red elements as well such as Vera's lips and Max's pom pom that Mary makes him. The narrative was engaging, especially when Mary and Max wrote to each other and the narration from Barry Humphries was simple yet effective. The voice acting was just as good as the narrative. As for the titular characters, I can definitely relate to Max in such ways as disliking crowds and loud, sudden noises and Mary is an adorable young girl who I deeply sympathise with and her adulthood was a nice surprise despite her heartache in terms of losing her parents and her husband leaving her for another man. While I was dissatisfied with the ending on my first viewing, I found it moving the second time around. Not only does the film deal with serious issues such as alcoholism, obesity, loneliness, depression, attempted suicide, bereavement, drug abuse, Asperger syndrome and mental health conditions but there is also the odd humorous moment.<br/><br/>In spite of the flaws regarding the music and the ending, 'Mary and Max' is an engaging feature-length stop-motion animation that ran at a steady pace, dealt with serious issues in a realistic and sensitive way, featured a character I could easily relate to and also featured some worthy side-characters such as Ivy and Mary's parents. 9/10."
"cleary-joshua","9","1","3","1 June 2014"," This is a dark, morbid and hilarious comedy all at the same time...
","People are often too quick to judge movies before they even know a lot about them. I suffer from this, and the number of times I've said something like ""Channing Tatum, I'm not watching that"" is extremely high. My own parents underwent a similar thing when I tried to convince them to watch 'Mary and Max' for what was my second viewing of it. And to be honest, it's a hard sell: Australian indie claymation film? No thanks. The main thing to remember here is that your instincts are often wrong, and the phrase 'never judge a book by its cover' applies here too. 'Mary and Max' is a dark, morbid and hilarious comedy about an odd friendship and mental illness, and took me completely by surprise.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Mary Dinkle, a young girl growing up in Australia with her alcoholic mother, who chooses a random name from the phone book and decides to write to them. She lives a relatively poor life, has few friends and is very naive about certain aspects of life. The recipient of her letter is Max Horowitz, an obese Jewish man living in New York, with various mental disorders and few friends. Their unlikely relationship is so heartwarming, as they manage to change, and eventually save, each others lives. Be warned it can feel quite depressing at times, and at around the 2/3rds mark you're sure that it can't get any worse for either of them, but it's worth sticking with, as the ending is both uplifting and beautiful.<br/><br/>The two main voice roles are performed by Toni Collette (who eventually makes an appearance towards the film's end) and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and the dialogue in the letters they send is constantly witty and endearing. They learn about each others problems and often offer solutions, with varying degrees of success. The other big voice role is that of the narrator, played by Barry Humphries (known to many as Dame Edna Everage). His part is a perfect example of how great the writing in this film is, providing crucial observations and character information. The film is made even better with the well crafted animation, making it feel like a grown up version of Wallace and Gromit. Visual touches, such as the black-and-white setting of New York, and sepia Melbourne landscapes, help to make the film even more clever and beautiful.<br/><br/>'Mary and Max' is a beautiful movie, whose only flaw is the occasional bit of dragging, which is understandable given the tricky medium that the filmmakers are working with. It's enjoyable and funny, and a continuing example of how much I respect the IMDb Top 250, on which this features. This is not one of the best 250 films ever made, but if it's appearance on the list makes sure that more people see this film, then it deserves to be there. It deals with a tricky subject matter but does so in a very watchable way."
"Aaron_West","9","1","3","26 May 2014"," A distinct, eclectic, charming and poignant animation.
","Mary and Max bring you into their world's with detail and character. The writing is inviting, sweet and very funny, but also allows for deep insight and raw poignancy. It truly is one of the best written animated films I of recent memory.<br/><br/>Essentially Mary and Max is a film about detailed troubled people searching for friendship. It takes a refreshing stance on life that I have certainly not seen in other films before. <br/><br/>The animation is beautifully characterive, and the soundtrack is stunning. But what I really like about Mary and Max is that it explores the lifelong questions of friendship, loneliness, anxiety and even suicide in a way that is as accessible to young teens as it is ground shaking for adults - it is rare that you find a film that is so honest and good natured.."

","The film is strangely, both depressing and funny. The soundtrack is very good at creating the mood the best track is Perpetuum Mobile(intro) as it uses a good mix of violin and piano to convey the mood of the movie from the instant you hit the play button... so now to the characters:- Adam Elliot's films follow a similar theme high lighting disabilities as with Harvie Krumpet (a short film about a guy who has Tourette Syndrome) and Mary and Max has a mixture of Aspergers, Agrophobia, social dysfunction, homosexuality, kleptomania and alcoholism thrown into the mix. These marginalized characters are from Adam Elliot's childhood and portrays their vulnerabilities and difficulties living life. The animation amazingly takes one week to produce two minutes of film and was shot over 57 weeks. The attention to detail is incredible and even includes a fully functioning typewriter. 2009 was a prolific year for animation films, but this film was outstanding in showing that you can have an animated film with serious subject matter."
"chrichtonsworld","9","1","3","17 February 2014"," A sincere, touching and very beautiful movie that deals with heavy subjects
","Mary and max is a clay animated movie intended for adults. For some this will be hard to understand because generally animated features are considered to be made for children. This is something I never quite understood well since this simply is not true. While a majority might be aimed for a younger audience there are quite a few that are meant for youth and adults or adults alone. This is important to realize since Mary and Max is an example of an animated movie that while offering laughs is dealing with very adult themes that can be very confronting. Let me first tell you that Mary and Max is a very funny film through and through. While very unrelentingly confronting you with death and depression it never skips on wit to make you laugh. The narration is brilliant as it helps to distance yourself or get involved when needed. I read somewhere that Barry Humphries' (most famous for his character Dame Edna) was found to be overly used and intrusive. Personally I think it has been key to keep things light instead of depressing. The wit and narration combo in my opinion is a genius way of telling a story filled with heavy subjects that otherwise would be hard to deal with. But next to the darker themes there is one beautiful one that most of the people will be able to appreciate and relate to. Friendship. If you have to remember one thing about a film like this then let it be the fact that here they show the beauty and value of friendship in life no matter how it is conceived and exists. Here the friendship consists of communication through letters. But is just as strong or maybe even stronger than a so called normal one. Here you get to see how much a simple and sincere letter can impact someone's life that proves to be beneficial for both. This film also shows that sometimes people react in unusual ways not because they are mean or evil but simply they view the world differently due to reasons they have no control of and don't know how to respond. I know it's hard and not always possible to have an open mind or be understanding but please do try since it does prove to be worth wile in the long run.<br/><br/>Max and Mary is a sincere, touching and very beautiful film dealing with heavy subjects in a way I have rarely seen before. It moved me deeply and it is one that deserves all the praise that it is getting. A must watch!"
"capuano-luca","8","1","3","5 November 2013"," Mary and Max
","'Mary and Max' is one of the best animated film ever made. It's the story of a true friendship, despite the two main characters never meet but only share their feelings through letters. But it's not only a story of friendship. The movie is so great that speaks about hard themes like teasing, loneliness, family problems, depression and the autism of Max, a 44 years old man (when the movie begins) that in several situations seems to see the world with the eyes of a child, the same eyes of Mary (especially in the first letters when, for example, they talk about the babies origins). It's hard to find a negative thing in this film and at the same time it's hard to understand why Mary and Max hadn't a nomination at Oscars for Best Animated Film. My rating is 9/10."
"Artimidor","9","1","3","3 November 2013"," Love letter to a friend - the best and only friend
","With the animation short ""Harvie Krumpet"" (2003) creator Adam Elliot made his points - that stopmotion isn't out, that you can make a serious, heartbreaking and at the same time hysterically funny film about Tourette's Syndrome, and that the results of such an effort are indeed Oscar worthy. - Fast forward to 2009: Do Oscar winner Elliot's established points work in a feature film as well that has been five years in the making? Yes, even more so. ""Mary and Max"", the unlikely friendship of a neglected misfit Australian eight year old girl and her middle aged pen pal from New York suffering from Asperger syndrome is definitely a highlight story-wise and animation-wise, and even excels oddball ""Harvie"" by a mile.<br/><br/>It all starts with chocolate being sent innocently across the ocean and a child's harmless questions being answered by a total stranger who doesn't have a grip on reality himself, but tries anyway. However, as this is no Pixar or Studio Ghibli film be prepared for the dark side of things to emerge when Mary grows older, Max fatter, and the relationship becomes strained and whole existences are being threatened. Fear not however, as form and content match the development beautifully and pull you in with charm, wit and pitch-perfect musical accompaniments that add flair and pace. The juxtaposition of the two different worlds is highly effective with New York in black and white and Mary's Australia in color but toned down. The latter appears more alive, Max on the other hand always follows regular routines: his life gets turned upside down only when a letter arrives, but deaths and lottery wins count only as footnotes. Not to forget: Phillip Seymour Hoffman (as the voice of Max) gives a first rank performance with side-splitting one-liners that could be enshrined for eternity. To sum it up: Elliot's second effort is bittersweet and complex, fluctuating between light and dark humor, but hilarious all around, full with well packaged social commentary, but most of all has a lot of warmth and depth, building up to an intense unforgettable finale. ""Mary and Max"" is a clearly adult themed animation pearl, an emotional roller coaster ride. Not the typical feel good animation fare, but one that will sweep you off your feet with its very own and rather unique means."
"rhaynes1974","8","1","3","6 July 2013"," Heart Breaking
","Mary and Max is the high point of what can be achieved with stop-motion animation. It's a beautifully and hauntingly constructed portrayal of loneliness that's incredibly realized by the directors very singular vision.<br/><br/>The film isn't an easy watch and I found myself weirdly uncomfortable with many of its very adult themes, but I couldn't take my eyes off it.<br/><br/>A wonderful melancholic score accompanies the sharp and very knowing script. Be warned though this one isn't for the kids at least in my opinion. <br/><br/>Mary and Max is a dark odyssey into the soul of human loneliness that isn't quickly forgotten. It's incredibly sad, quite disturbing and deeply affecting. Highly recommended for anyone looking for something a little quirky."
"daniel5892","9","1","3","23 March 2013"," Different, critic and funny
","Mary & Max (2009) is a different kind of stop motion animation, because it's a production destined to the adult public due to some elements that are present in it. An example of these elements is the absence of color that creates a dark ambiance. <br/><br/>The story is about a lonely and sad 8-year-old girl that lives in Australia. Her parents aren't the perfect model of ""good parents"" and she doesn't have friends. Her mother is a drunk and his father has some strange habits and this doesn't contribute to solve Mary's problems. <br/><br/>One day Mary decided to write a letter to a random person that lives in New York City. She takes the address in a phone list and writes a letter talking about herself to a 44-year-old American man called Max J. Horowitz. Coincidentally Max is a lonely and sad person too. After this a different kind of friendship is born. <br/><br/>The main element that differs this animation from the others is the way that it represents the reality of the characters, because there's no fantasy in this movie, only the reality. Mary & Max is the first feature film of the director Adam Elliot, an Australian director. So this production is an awesome option for those that are seeking for something different with a little of critic and fun."

","Mary and Max is an Australian clay-animated black comedy-drama film written and directed by Adam Elliot and produced by Melanie Coombs. The voice cast included Philip Seymour Hoffman, Toni Collette, Eric Bana, Bethany Whitmore, with narration by Barry Humphries.<br/><br/>The Academy Award-winning director of Harvie Krumpet returns to the world of clay animation with this simple tale of the innocent correspondence between a portly eight year old girl from the suburbs of Melbourne and a morbidly obese, middle-aged Jewish New Yorker suffering from Asperger's Syndrome.On the surface it would seem that Mary and Max would have little in common, but over the course of twenty years, the unlikely pen pals exchange letters discussing everything from taxidermy, trust, pets, religion, obesity, autism, agoraphobia, alcoholism, and just about any other topic that comes to mind as they sit down and put pen to paper.<br/><br/>The film's humor throughout is rooted in a general malaise that afflicts both characters.It is a lovingly crafted, startlingly inventive piece of animation whose technical craft is equaled by its emotional resonance.The animation style, done mostly in a gray to black palette with an overall droopy look, enhances the melancholic feeling that exudes from this intriguing story. Funny details, too, make it suitable for kids and it is a uniquely bittersweet film starring two clay- sculpted outcasts with a unique friendship."

At many points in the film I teared up; but it was the ending that truly had tears streaming down my face. Another amazing element of Mary and Max is the music. It perfectly fits the movie. I love everything about this amazing, perfect, flawless movie. Not only is it a triumph of claymation (possibly the best claymation I've ever seen) but also an amazing story that deals with just about every single human emotion.

The story is such an engrossing experience and sucks you in from the outset. While on the outside it comes across as a mere story of 'pen pals', it is so much more.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film is in the questions it raises. In the movie industry, animation is often seen as something secluded for kids only, but this is no kids film. It is an utterly mature film that highlights many things that, in modern culture we are scared to talk about. This film boasts an amazing defiance against social convention and isn't scared to discuss what we are.<br/><br/>The animation is unique in its own right and comes across as a mix between Fantastic Mr. Fox and Wallace and Gromit. Its a beautiful visual spectacular that uses colour and sound to involve the audience to an astonishing degree. I for one could not take my eyes, and ears, away.<br/><br/>A truly unique experience."

","It has been widely acknowledged from the general public around the globe that what only energy brings us to move forward out of darkness and fear is love,just love. What the indication behind this turns out to be like ""There's still love and hope besides grief and greed."" However,rarely had most animations create a more insightful perspective on the former notion about the theme of ""angel and demon"". Love is never simply a recession or just a side to defeat evil, but a comprehensive feeling which includes a peaceful mind and the courage to sacrifice every tiny and selfish emotion.Mary and Max just simply creates the love and compassion naturally, not from the dull speech or some psychological skills, but from the deeply-touched eye of Mary, gazing the ceiling with countless letters. Purity and love is born like a tree without any kind of purposeful sketch. Craftsmanship and psychology can only produce a emotion in a certain situation, what makes people deeply impressed, however, is the character and mood like a pond ,bringing a eternal value which won't be faded away."

","The winner of the Ottawa Animation Festival grand prize, Mary and Max was created by the Australian animator Adam Elliot. The film is about a pen pal friendship between little Mary living in a small dusty provincial town near Melbourne with her alcoholic mother and a corpulent New Yorker, Max who is suffering from overeating and Asperger's syndrome.<br/><br/>The characters are made from clay that makes them look like those in Wollis&Gromit, but almost everything else around is monochromatic. Two depressive and bizarre worlds hopelessly lock characters inside, but to prevent you from having a panic attack the despair is balanced with just the right amount of black humor. This artistic work is very detailed; it's not like a usual cartoon approximation: everything that happens on the screen is precisely interpreted into a rich visual language.<br/><br/>Everyday routine like drinking cups full of sherry or stuffing dead birds found in the garden puzzles little girl, so one day she takes an arbitrary address from a phone book and writes a letter to other side of the Earth wondering if everything is the same over there. This is a story about naive attempts to comprehend the strange and chaotic outer world, made with good taste and a sense of harmony.<br/><br/>""Mary and Max"" doesn't follow Hollywood strategy as, for example, ""Rain Man"" does. The protagonists do not reveal their hidden talents or defeat bad guys. They simply try to cope with routine problems and save their fragile relations. It's not likely that all people face such bizarre problems in everyday life, which Max does due to his disorder. But one can still encounter similar troubles; for example in the case of a sudden misunderstanding of the usual order of things, or a bitter quarrel without any reasonable cause.<br/><br/>The movie ""Mary and Max"" is like a friendly jest. It's easy to understand because everyone has some similar character traits, but it's still might be hard to accept such people as they are in everyday life."

","Two different people from two different countriesÂ… In your opinion, it is possible to cross their ways somewhere coincidentally? Or, another important question.Do you brave that you say everything which related to your life somebody who you did not meet before by letter? Mary Daisy Dinkle and Max Horovitz met by chance.They did not think to be each other's future. Max was alone and unable to communicate with people around. On the other hand, Mary also alone at home and school. She had an alcoholic mother and insensitive father. In my opinion, that's why Mary prefers to share her own happiness, trouble or secrets with Max. I like animation movies. A new one was added my favorites. The story is told so good that people are not bored and even if you can find the missing aspect, movie remains fully the positive aspect in mind. The part of the movie which impressed me very much is the end. Mary looked at the ceiling and saw all her letter which sends him while sitting next to Max's dead body. Do not need to see her or hear her voice for Max.She was so far away. But still he fell in love with a girl who just saw her picture. That is enough for him. If we think in terms of the Mary, knowing to be loved so much by someone must be very nice. But even though knowing it, as soon as you find that person, to lose.It is very painful. Something which thinks me throughout the whole movie is to share her own secrets somebody who did not meet before. I think, Trusting people who do not recognize should be much easier.

So before watching,I am open to prejudices. Yet, not only it just entered th IMDb top 250, but also my teacher gives advice on watching in our lesson. When I consider these,I decided to give up my bias against the animation. Fortunately, I watched because I am really influenced and love it.<br/><br/>Please don't think this movie is for children due to being animation, o the contrary for the adults because of its topic and scenes. Although it's animation, it harbors lots of dramatic ans mournful scenes.By the way, the music of the movie is very enjoyable. It glamorizes the movie so much. While you're watching, you feel the fascination in yourself. I think, th choice of music is really eligible. <br/><br/>In conclusion,even if not face to face,the basics of friendship can make if you want faithfully. A close friendship doesn't strike up thanks to seeing with each other every day. It is necessary to be honest and love. As you know,""having one close friend is better than one thousand of ordinary friends"".

","Hi I am Halil from Turkey.I think the movie actually has a clichÃ© story about feeling lonely but the expression of the movie is excellent.I barely watch the movie like this which is screened as animated but from this moment I got that I should break the prejudice.In general story of the movie is not that original which has not been screened in other movies but like I said before it has a so touchy narration.I think the main idea of the movie is all about approaching to the happiness no matter it takes even it is far far away from your own country and that is the thing what Marry (main female character of the movie)does in the movie.She wants to have both friend and happiness that she never has before even she effort for it so much in her life.And also this can be said for Max (other main male character of the movie) he also search for the happiness and tired of being lone in his life.Everybody can experience the moments like Marry and Max has and I love the way movie screened like that, I mean not supernatural or extraterrestrial can be experienced somehow in real life.The only thing I do not like in the movie that the scenes are so slow and that can be the reason for audience to make them bored when they watch the movie.I think the movie gives ""there is always way out"" as a message.I think everybody is beautiful no matter what the shape of them and whatever they say,I think words must not bring us down.You will approve these sentences after watching the movie.I really liked this movie and it will be in my bests.."

Next, and most importantly I loved this movie. It was poignant, deeply moving, visually stunning and made you laugh, cry, and think. What more can you ask from a film. This film is somewhat intellectual and takes on some very difficult subjects while having the look of a Wallace and Gromit cartoon. It is beautifully narated by Barry Humphries who is most famous for his Dame Edna character. It also has wonderful supporting voices from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Toni Collette. This is not a mainsteam film and if I find a following, I would hope they maintain a higher standard for their movie watching experience and seek this film out. I can rave on and on about this film, there was not one moment where I did not find myself completely enthralled.

","It is my favorite movie. It now tops Titanic, the notebook, The color purple. And even forest hump. Even I am amazed. I love chunky wonky appearance of everything, the Australian icons in the scenes are just terrific. The hills hoist, the tire swan, the bird fly wire door. The voices could not have fitted better and the words made up for this movie have now become ours. Confuzzled, love it. This movie will appeal to all ages and all tastes. Highly recommended. Mary dinkle and max is a beautiful tragic impossible friendship, unconditional friendship, that persists for many many years. It covers many of life's touchy subjects, too many to mention, it is a true masterpiece. Nothing like I have ever seen before. My ten year old is a avid fan also. If you watch this, I'm sure you will identify either yourself or someone close to you in these characters."

","***** TINY SPOILERS CAN BE FELT ***** <br/><br/>ITS clay... ITS Dark... the characters are NO superheroes or awesome looking people... Its just conversation... Its all that you don't make a movie with , yet Mary and max creates something so beautiful that when it ends u have a tear in your eye, a smile on your face and a movie you wont forget quiet easily. Communication has never been portrayed such realistically before before two generations separated with huge distance. The plot moves beautifully and gradually building the tempo. Some might feel its bit slow and boring at times but when you are talking about correspondence between two people for 20 years, not all moments can be equally cherished by every viewer.<br/><br/>Overall i would say. a Good watch on a nice clam day wherein you can smile and cry a little and end up feeling quiet good at the end of it."
"Eternality","8","1","3","27 March 2011"," Elliot's film may not rank as one of the finest claymation films ever made, but it certainly presents itself as a solid work in need of greater recognition.
","This sweet, heartfelt claymation (stop-motion animation using clay models) is lovingly directed by Adam Elliot, who previously won an Oscar for his animated short Harvie Krumpet (2003). Here in his first feature, Elliot charts the path to our hearts with a poignant tale of an unlikely friendship between a young Ugly Betty lookalike Australian girl called Mary, and an old and obese New Yorker called Max who suffers from a mental illness. Mary's curiosity about how babies come about in the US leads her to write a letter to someone randomly in New York. At first stunned and confused, Max, the recipient of that letter, eventually reciprocates by sending her a letter and some chocolate.<br/><br/>But all is not well as Max receives more letters from Mary asking him what love and ""sexing"" is. The tensions between a pubescent girl who has low self-esteem, and a mentally-ill old man who has no friends are played out excellently, even though they never really meet throughout the course of the film. Yet as viewers, we see them as perfectly compatible, complementing yet similar, and we want them together as friends. Elliot goes right into the psyche of a volatile and insecure man grasping with the prospect of friendship, an idea that seems alien to him, and parallels it with a girl's desire to make sense of the world.<br/><br/>Further, Elliot gives near-equal screen time to both lead characters, alternating between them not by cutting quickly back and forth, but by moving the plot along through big narrative chunks devoted to the development of each character's past and present, as well as laying the groundwork for their futures. I feel that Mary and Max is not a story about two characters, but of two characters sharing the same story. And that story is a bittersweet one. In one encapsulating moment, the Que Sera, Sera song is played towards the end, cleverly juxtaposing with images of an alcoholic Mary on the verge of hanging herself as she recalls her past.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Mary and Max is a story about friendship and forgiveness, and the need for redemption. Although the film ends on a quite depressing note, its lighted-hearted take on loneliness as a key theme is likely to fill the viewer with feelings of restrained optimism. Well- written, and conceptually unique, Elliot's film may not rank as one of the finest claymation films ever made, but it certainly presents itself as a solid work in need of greater recognition.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."
"Imdbidia","10","1","3","17 March 2011"," Moving and quirky adult animation movie
","A wonderful Australian independent plasticine movie that tells the story of a life-long mail relationship between an autistic old Jew Newyorker and a weird Australian girl.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for children as it touches subjects that are complex and could be disturbing or difficult to explain to a child (alcoholism, social failure, mental disorder, bullying, death, homosexuality, suicide, etc.), the same elements that make this movie a wonder for adults. It is mostly a sad story about social maladjustment, but also the story of a long wonderful -and sometimes troublesome- friendship.<br/><br/>The aesthetics and atmosphere of the film are wonderful, as so is the music. The main characters Max & Mary are really unforgettable and lovable, and also lovely the secondary ones. Especially funny are the animal characters, both pets and urban animals, which behave like animals but are very humorous. Moreover, there are so many little details and humorous winks to the spectator, that is just a pure joy to watch.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so special is the story told and the selection of marginal characters, who are presented in a normal accepting way. They are ""weirdos"", unglamorous suburban people, with mental and social problems who are wonderful because they are imperfect and human. The movie is full of emotion an the viewer feels moved and connected to Mary & Max almost immediately, and feels their failures, successes and worries as if they were not plasticine puppets.<br/><br/>Three things would have improved the film enormously. In first place, although plasticine animation and shooting is very time-consuming and hand-crafted, a little bit more of lightness in the movement of the puppets, and a little bit more of definition in their facial expressions would have improved the look and feeling of the film. In the second place, there is too much narration in second person in the film, while most of the characters' speech is very limited. Finally, and directly related to the second, is the third person narration, not only too much of it, but also done by the wrong person (Barry Humphreis) and in the wrong tone, which I consider confusing and emotionally misleading as this is not a movie targeted to children at all. It would have been great that part of the narration was actually incorporated into the animation and turned into dialogs and ""acting"" and presented in a less fable-before-bed-ish story narration.<br/><br/>Said so, I think is a terrific animation film, whose story moved me immensely. It was a hit at Sundance."

","Quite simply one of the best animated features I have ever seen. I laughed, I cried, I was surprised (and that is difficult to do). I've seen a lot of movies, but I was quite literally left speechless by the boldness of the story, the witty tongue-in-cheek narration and the spot-on timing from start to finish. I plan on recommending this movie to anyone who I think will appreciate the sly combination of dark humor and uplifting central story. As a writer myself, I know how difficult it is to walk the line between humor and drama without falling to one side or the other. I can't say enough about my feelings for this film. I've written very few reviews, but felt compelled to write something about this gem. My highest marks. Extraordinary film-making!"

"bootlebarth","10","1","3","26 January 2011"," Unbearably sad and immensely funny - a human and claymation masterpiece
","A few IMDb reviewers give this wonderful claymation film by Adam Elliott the thumbs down. They must be more severely disabled by Asperger's syndrome than Max, and completely incapable of normal human responses.<br/><br/>I don't want to seek words to describe how good 'Mary and Max' is. I don't want to think why others might object to some or all of it.<br/><br/>From start to finish, 'Mary and Max' is marvelous. Anyone who has a heart will love it, especially anyone who has a damaged heart and can't quite fit in with the regular world.<br/><br/>The most idiotic of the hostile reviewers are those who have a knee-jerk reaction to a pen-pal relationship between, at the start, an 8 year old Australian girl and a 40 year old American man. <br/><br/>Most of the words are narrated brilliantly by Barry Humphries. The claymation figures are grotesque but so skilfully manipulated that they evoke sympathy rather than revulsion from the viewer. The details are witty and charming, with many liable not to be noticed at a first viewing. Only Australians (fellow nationals of Adam Elliott) are likely to be familiar with the two most frequently recurring musical themes. Not many people beyond these shores will know 'The Waltz of the Wombat'.<br/><br/>In my IMDb reviews I normally give a plot outline, with the necessary spoiler warnings. My advice for 'Mary and Max' is to see it for yourself, without prejudice. If it leaves you unaffected, or hostile, I don't even want to start thinking about what you must be like in real life.<br/><br/>To repeat and expand, this is a wonderful, wonderful film. It hardly hits a false note, and I'm not going to highlight the few seconds that jarred with me. After watching it, I'm still in a daze. At the halfway point I thought: this standard can't be maintained; there's no way the loose ends can be satisfactorily tied. I was wrong. <br/><br/>I have to give up now. The immediate effects should have worn off, but I'm still overwhelmed."

","Mary, if you think she is a kid from old times and non-existing character: Adam Elliot with a stupendous way of narration puts us in a pair of little girl's shoes to walk around childhood in 96 minutes and successfully made people understand how young kids are getting abused without proper pampering. If a far-land caring-hand can encourage a kid like Mary, how explicitly we spoil a kid's life without rendering proper attention? <br/><br/>On the other way around, Max- the character which has to be applauded from the scratch. A grown-up deviant from world. How this society makes a person go mad in loneliness? How money, luxury and all comforts fail?

"SquigglyCrunch","9","1","4","2 December 2015"," A Fantastically Heartwarming Story
","I went into Mary and Max with some expectations, but I never really thought about the movie until I watched it. I'm happy to say that I was unable to stop thinking about it the day after watching. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple, and a little clichÃ©. That's not a bad thing, but oftentimes a clichÃ© plot is poorly carried out. Mary and Max is not one of those movies. It's very interesting, and I felt myself wanting to hear what each letter exchanged by the characters said. Which brings me to the next point...<br/><br/>The characters are fantastic. In a movie as clearly character driven as this one, they're expected to be. Each letter shed light on the characters, from the obvious traits to the smaller, subtler hints towards who they were. And when the movie stopped reading the letters to the audience I wasn't super disappointed because I already knew the characters so well. It's not hard to believe that this was based off a true story, considering how real everything felt (despite everything being made of clay).<br/><br/>Mary and Max is one of the few movies that has almost made me cry. By the end you really feel for the characters and understand why they feel certain ways or do certain things, and you feel along with them. <br/><br/>The tone, lighting, and coloring are perfect. There's a reason why certain things stand out and why others don't, and it adds a really nice touch to the whole experience. <br/><br/>Overall Mary and Max is absolutely fantastic. With fantastic characters and an interesting plot, it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. Almost flawless. I think that if this movie had been live-action that it wouldn't have had nearly as much charm as it did in clay-mation. The stop motion is all fantastically smooth as well. In the end I would not hesitate to recommend Mary and Max."
"grantss","9","1","4","8 October 2015"," Wonderful, heart-warming, thought-provoking movie
","Wonderful, heart-warming, thought-provoking movie.<br/><br/>It's 1976. Mary is an eight year old girl living in Melbourne. Her mother is an alcoholic (and a mean one at that) and her father is...distant. Nothing seems to be going right. Then she randomly writes to a stranger in New York, Max, and they become pen-pals. What follows is a wonderful friendship and journey...<br/><br/>Great movie with incredible warmth and depth. Sensitively explores subjects like depression, Asperger's Syndrome (and mental illness in general), loneliness and friendship. All this while delivering some sharp, often dark, humour. Not unnecessarily politically correct either - I'm sure there's enough in the movie to offend the humourless, dial-a-complaint crowd. Quite real and gritty.<br/><br/>Great, original animation. However, don't be fooled by the animation - this is certainly not a kid's movie. While it may seem suitable for kids initially, it explores some very dark themes towards the end.<br/><br/>Good voice casting too, with Toni Collette as Mary, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Max and narration by Barry Humphries plus a supporting cast that includes Eric Bana.<br/><br/>Superb."
"Gray_Balloon_Bob","10","1","4","6 February 2015"," Everything we could ever hope for in a friendship.
","Not everyone can find their voice through writing, find the right rhythm or pace or just the general ideas they want to express. But when someone can write, it's often the purest form of communication. This is a film about people who can write, and write to each other, because it's their consolation and fulfilment. Mary and Max, the titular characters, two disparate figures from separate continents share and understand the world from the beginnings to ends of their pieces of paper, as it's the only way they know how. But it's not a film about writing itself; writing is the beautiful catalyst for the most beautiful friendship, a bond that binds atoms together because these characters will it, and if they will it the universe wills it too. <br/><br/>""Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour of muddy puddles. Her birthmark, the colour of poo."" observes the narrator in the opening lines of the film, his clear, precise voice, like that of a television presenter, perfectly capturing the tone to come. It's a simple truth, both humorous and melancholy, because in life if you have one you often have the other. These are essential elements of her, she hates them but they're fundamental to who she is. She's a lonely pre-pubescent girl in a drained, sepia Australian suburbia, an environment of grinding routine, and she is most often alone to absorb and pour over everything in her own colourful inner- life, a cauldron of innocent wonder and a quiet, growing despair, which contains ideas such beliefs such as that in Australia Babies are found in the bottom of beer mugs, and her musing over where they are found in America (she deduces that although Americans drink much Cola, Babies wouldn't be found in the cans because they'd have no means of escape) prompts her to pick at random an address in the telephone book and pose this question. She couldn't clarify this with her parents because they are not present in any sense of the word, the mother a perpetual drunk and the father an extreme recluse. This is not a decaying suburban marriage but just one of a mutual desire to be withdrawn in their own world. Or perhaps they forget the other one exists. Each person is lonely, but Mary reaches out. She doesn't expect a friendship, but serendipity grants her one, and of course she deserves it. <br/><br/>Does this not sound immensely relatable? And thus enters Max, a lonely obese Jew living in a stark black-and-white New York City, almost a Noirish landscape. But not one of intrigue, one of melancholy, one of good and bad, black-and-white. When Max is in his apartment, indulging in his own adventurous recipes, watching his favourite television show, the world is good. Anywhere outside is bad, where the world to him seems to favour madness over operating on any logical system. It doesn't take long to see he may have Asperger's. People are immediately distant and judgemental of him (as when he is mocked for wearing a helmet) but when Mary begins to write none of this matters. Max doesn't question the fact and 8 year old is writing to him, because initially in their minds they are just following a logical and path and asking each other's questions, and then it becomes an opportunity to express all the things that have ever crossed their mind but were never able to do any more than that. Philip Seymour Hoffman is extraordinary, with his despondent, breathless Jewish cadence, and I had I gone into the film without any knowledge I wouldn't have known it was him. In fact, the reason for me watching this was as a sort of Hoffman retrospective, in light of the one year anniversary of his untimely passing, and I thought selecting a film solely of his voice-acting would display an aspect of him not yet seen, but I realised this voice is just one of his many, and every performance was some aspect, however slight, unseen, and so this is a real testament to his ability to inhabit the character, not to announce his presence but not failing to distinguish himself either. <br/><br/>The film has very little story beyond this friendship, and the people that occupy their individual worlds are more or less just figures to aid their development in the world and to provide them material for their letters rather than being fully-fleshed characters, but that's OK, because what is given through their exchanges than more poignant and witty and abrasive, and just damn real than most films could achieve through this concept. It's always convincing, and that's down to how honestly portrayed these characters are; Max doesn't understand social conventions, and tells Mary that he once worked in a condom factory but has never tried one on, Mary describes her neighbour's fear of the outside as 'homophobia', and although her older self eventually uses the correct term, the film doesn't need to show us her learning her error, she eventually pursues the naÃ¯ve idea that she can cure Max's Asperger's<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the animation, which is a beautiful clay style in which much looks bloated and listless and melancholy but also so lovingly and meticulously crafted that it's impossible not to admire. Clay of course is so malleable that it's almost infinite in its possibilities, and the film knows this and is able to capture every passing emotion with care. Although it's animation, this is not a children's film. It's a film of retrospect, as we watch Mary grow up - and even Max too, who grows to accept his position in the world â€“ we see in her ourselves learning and travelling through life, and we hope, or at least I do, that we can remain as warm and as eternally optimistic as this film, which I think believes as much injustice and tragedy as there is, we are capable of balancing it out."

","I never thought I would ever see an animated film targeted at adult audiences that wasn't juvenile and filled to the rim with nothing but shock gags and farts jokes, but this film proved me wrong.<br/><br/>The film focuses on two central characters, as the title is so appropriately named ""Mary and Max"". These two characters were so well developed and realized, I almost felt like they were real people who lived real lives. You watch these two characters grow up over the years and you really begin to feel attached to every bit of them, as they struggle through life's ups and downs. <br/><br/>The relationship between Mary and Max is very complex, due to the age difference and the vast distance between the characters. However this doesn't deter from the loving friendship the two pen pals share and will never make you feel uncomfortable. Every letter sent was a character study all on it's own, and really added depth to the characters that even most live-action films fail to do so.<br/><br/>The film is very much a dark comedy, making fun of life's tragedies but at the same time still resonating with you emotionally. <br/><br/>This film is definitely not for children for it plays with the themes of depression, mental illness, and alcoholism that are just too mature for most children to understand. It also contains some sexual references and jokes throughout the film.<br/><br/>This film will now forever have a place in my heart, and I am going to recommend it to everyone I know. It's sad, funny, and will most likely leave an impact on you before the credits roll.<br/><br/>This is more than likely the greatest animated film I have ever seen."

A hard balance, but they seemed to manage it well.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, it really starts to grab you by the scruff of the neck and slap you about. That's when you realise you've been suckered into thinking you're watching a children's story when really it was a pretty heavy adult dose all along.<br/><br/>The animation was extremely impressive. Like Wallace and Grommit on absinthe. While the lack of colour annoyed me a little, I understand why it was done that way given the ground it was covering.<br/><br/>Word to the wise: bearing in mind it has the look and feel of a children's animated film, personally I would most definitely not let children under the age of 14 watch this. Like I say it touches on some very adult/heavy themes and you could end up with some very upset, confused kids with some difficult questions for you afterwards!<br/><br/>All things considered, I was very pleasantly surprised with this surprisingly emotional wolf in sheep's clothing.

","I always say Australian films aren't great and as an Australian I don't really enjoy many movies made in my home country and I find mainstream actors like Hugh Jackman to be overrated in my opinion, sorry Jackman fans. But this film, made in Australia, is a rare one because I love this film period. The story of the film was great it shows the developing friendship between the two pen pals. The animation was incredible too with splendid smooth movement of the character unlike the clunky and weird stop-motion of Harviee Krumpt, which I do like. The music was nice and catchy too, especially the theme song as well. But if I have to choose my favorite scene, it has to be the ending when Mary found Max dead peacefully in his apartment room and when she saw all the mementos that Max kept from her all the way from childhood such as the pictures and the letters was emotional to watch, I nearly cried there at the ending.

"itamarscomix","7","1","4","14 August 2012"," Sweet and beautifully animated
","Adam Elliot's first full-length animated feature continues in the stylistic footsteps of his short films, on a larger, more ambitious scope, though the focus is still around similar motifs of loneliness and alienation. The quality of animation has improved, though, and the story is sweet and even moving; if you still need proof that animation isn't just for kids, Mary and Max is solid evidence. It could have easily been an independent tragicomedy by a director like Todd Solondz or Gus Van Sant, but the animation compliments the imaginative story and the colorful characters.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't quite do well with the long format, though; when compared to Elliot's Oscar-winning Harvie Krumpet (2003) it's easy to see why. The characters of Mary and Max are both too flawed, and they both do very little growth for this long a movie, and the viewer gets a feeling of treading water. Despite the fact that the movie keeps inventing throughout, it get dull, and I couldn't help but feel that it would have been better with a 40 minute runtime. For that reason it feels very fresh at first, but it can't maintain the feeling of surprise and originality that Harvie Krumpet had, but it's still recommended for animation lovers."

This does not mean that they do not happen, just that a disastrous moment occurs, and amends are, or not, made.<br/><br/>In the film, after almost twenty years of pen-friendship, the two, at first by a perfect whim of chance-choice and then by a perfect giving-and-misgiving course of things, where the two protagonists are never mischievous between them, even when things go bad and hilarious for them and for their relationship, finally meet in person, and Max is found dead by Mary. It sounds grim, but in the end it's, not quite uplifting, unless it is for the gaze which reads Mary's letters on the ceiling. That is the moment amends are made, even if they involve just Mary.<br/><br/>Attention to the whimsy of detail is intimate, almost saturating. <br/><br/>As with the constant field of reality we encounter every day with its seams of unabashed humor and unapologetic banality.

'Mary and Max' is a very dark movie, that shouldn't be funny, but somehow is. This creates a very unique film. 'Mary and Max' is one of my favorite animated films of all time, and an excellent example of how to make a stop motion film.<br/><br/>The film centers around the friendship of two people, a young girl named Mary (who lives in Australia), and an old man named Max (who lives in the U.S.). And in the film communicate through letters.<br/><br/>Let's start with the excellent animation, the clay animation is unique and nice to look at. Even if it's meant to look dark and depressing, you can't take your eyes off it. The look of the film, is truly a marvel to behold, as the darker shades of color, really contribute to the tone of the film. As it is a dark film, with many elements of comedy.<br/><br/>Now: the characters, the two title characters of the film, are two very interesting, down to earth, and relatable people. As they are two very depressed people, who see nothing but darkness, but over the course of the film, grow a bond even though they are so far apart from each other. And learn to see each other as a light in the darkness, and just see the world in a nicer light. The only issue I have with the side characters, they are just not very well developed in my opinion. If the movie dedicated more time to these characters, I would've liked them a lot more.<br/><br/>Arguably the most important element of a great film, the story, is executed with flying colors by this film. From the surprisingly funny comedic writing, to the still very real and mature drama of the film. And also, this film has one of my favorite movie endings, it almost brought a tear to my eye. And the film is also a very quick 90 minutes. My only issue with the story, is the over-reliance on narration. But with writing this good, I can forgive it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Mary and Max' is a film that shows animation doesn't necessarily have to be for kids. And this film is one of the best in its respectable genre of film."

","Years ago I had a chance to watch a dubbed version in Persian language. It was so touching that I watched it again the very same night.<br/><br/>Later I watched English version too, it was great, but I liked the Persian dubbed version more. The dubbed version was so sad, probably the saddest movie I have ever seen."
"cjs6547","10","0","1","15 October 2017"," The movie I go to when I need a good cry
","Don't get me wrong, I avoid tragic movies like the plague. Nothing puts me off more than watching the ills of society in gritty detail on the silver screen. Even so, once I started watching this movie, it pulled me in like a close friend I had known for all my life, and told me to let my tears flow and be content.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain what makes Mary and Max different from other tragedies or tragicomedies. For a start, while it is geared up visually and with a soundtrack guaranteed to generate tears, it does not milk emotions in a cheap way. The narration is delivered in simple factual sentences with some tongue-in-cheek humor. The characters are ALL complex, interesting and very human, and there is no entity that is entirely negative or a source of hate or contention. Instead, the source of the troubles of our protagonists are their own internal struggles as they stumble through life stages, trying to find happiness. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil what happens, because everyone should see this movie at least once. While the subject matter is definitely for adult audiences, its innocence and good will makes it a very comforting watch."

"quinimdb","8","0","1","27 June 2017"," Mary and Max
","The wrinkly and awkward design of the characters and settings, as well as the dry dull color palette in ""Mary and Max"" gives the film a gross, clunky texture, and I wouldn't want it any other way, because, like the characters themselves, the animation style's (intentional) imperfection is what makes it so charming.<br/><br/>The film's premise is simple, but the emotional complexity of the characters get the premise a long way. A 9 year old Australian girl sending a letter to a 44 year old obese man in New York out of curiosity, but mainly out of loneliness, and it just so happens that the very person she contacts is just as lonely and confused as she is. Almost the whole movie is done in voice over, much of it by a narrator and the rest by the main two characters, since all of their interactions are through letters and not physical dialogue, and much of what they are saying and thinking is animated to accompany the voice over. But even the narrator has a distinctive character to it, and Still, Philip Seymour Hoffman is able bring life into this idiosyncratic character of Max, fully embodying all his sincerity in every word, despite an inability to physically communicate his emotions. The effect of the visualization of the voice-over is a somewhat storybook- like tone to the film. But despite seemingly like a film intended for children on the surface, it reaches into the subjects of depression, childhood trauma, and living with a mental disability. While it treats these subjects with as much respect and seriousness as they deserve, at the core of the film is, of course, the sweet friendship between Mary and Max, and how they each serve as a solace; someone they can understand and depend on in a world filled with unpredictability. Because they each knew there would always be a friend that could appreciate them even with all their imperfections, they were both able to accept themselves for who they were, warts and all."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","22 June 2017"," Darkly humorous yet heartwarming tale about two struggling souls
","A movie such as this one is a rare treat. A completely original - albeit inspired by the director's own life - movie from a first-time feature-length director that completely blows you away with its uniqueness, wit and charm. Mary and Max tells the story of its titular characters. Mary being a lonely Australian girl living with her two dysfunctional parents. One of them an alcoholic and the other a complete shut-in practically living in the backyard shed. One day Mary, on a childish whim, decides to write to a random American person. Except that the person on the other side decides to write back. He's Max, an obese forty-something man living alone in New York and suffering from crippling mental health problems.<br/><br/>Sound creepy and depressing? Yeah, it does. And yet the thing is, this is one of the most heartwarming and sympathetic movies I've seen in my life. It's also one of the funniest. It is said that something cannot be funny without someone suffering. And boy is that true here. The film's humour is amazingly dark, drawing most of its laughs from the sheer dysfunctionality of its characters and their feeble attempts at improving their lot in life. <br/><br/>And yet... yet it is never mean spirited. Mary and Max suffer, that much is true, but they very rarely let it get to them. And when they do, it's a genuinely sorrowful moment because at that point it's more than earned. And thus the movie is about living your life and finding happiness despite everything standing in your way. It's about individuality, about human worth, about friendship and the purpose of caring.<br/><br/>It's also phenomenally well-made. It's stop-motion clay animation from start to finish with heavy emphasis being put on the use of colour, facial animation and stuff actually being there. And it looks gorgeous. A true testament to the strength of craftsmanship in this age of computer effects.<br/><br/>Mary and Max is a true masterpiece. A film juggling both light and dark, examining both the best and worse qualities of human existence, all with a kind voice and a gentle laugh. A film no one's going to regret seeing."
"lethal_smile","8","0","2","9 February 2017"," One of the best animation made
","This Aussie animation is one of the best animation made. It has humour, drama and a message. After I watched this I started looking for more films directed by Adam Elliot but unfortunately, he hasn't directed anything else apart from some short films which were funny too.<br/><br/>I love dark animation with adult humour and sadly there are not many out there. People do admire it, example is Family Guy but we need variety, different humour and this film delivers that. Hopefully Mr Elliot is working on a new project and there will be another animation to come as this film is far by one of my most favourite animation of all time as it makes you laugh most of the time, makes you cry and most importantly makes you think. Highly recommended !!"
"georgidianov","10","0","2","19 December 2016"," The talent of an 'unseen and innovative' piece of artwork
","The LumiÃ¨re brothers should be proud of Max and Mary (2009) - Top Rated Movies #179. At the end of the day, they created 'cinema' so that it develops to such a degree that it brings us masterpieces like this animation-comedy-drama. <br/><br/>In here, observers get satisfied with three components: the art of clay animation/ Claymation (1), the 'admirable and sudden' friendship between Mary Daisy Dinkle and Max Jerry Horovitz (2), along with all unexpected and comical idiomatic expressions (3), such as ""Mary Dinkle's eyes were the colour of muddy puddles. Her birthmark, the colour of poo."" or ""Butts are bad because they wash out to sea, and fish smoke them and become nicotine-dependent"". And, in addition to this, spectators are also able to enjoy the way in which these two characters cultivate their friendship following the antiquated ""letter-box-way"", without any kind of technology. Surely, the beauty of Adam Elliot's 92 minutes comes from the latter perspective.<br/><br/>It is intriguing to take part of the 'reading letters' connection between Australia (Mary) and the United States (Max) now that societies have changed their ways of communicating. Perhaps, if they have used Skype or WhatsApp, it would not have been as accurate as it ended being. It is undoubtedly much better the way they imagine the other with letters, pictures and sweets, than sending videos or sharing mobile calls. To put it briefly, this movie is like a book, and if it was made with the latest trends of XXI century, it was going to be like any Netflix series. <br/><br/>However, because of the fact that each of them is located in the back of beyond, cinema-goers are under pressure all movie long. Who does not want to see these two weirdos together? It would have been great, would not it? Notwithstanding, despite their unhappy and boring lives (we all have our own problems in this busy world) they find enough time to write and share their stories. Nowadays, the world is full of 'plastic people' and one never know if it is better to share some story with a relative or acquaintance than with someone in the boonies. As it says at the end of the film, ""God gives us our relatives, thank God we can choose our friends."" (Ethel Watts Mumford), which clearly means that sometimes it is even better to choose a stranger because of all the trouble one could receive and save from a closer friend. <br/><br/>To conclude, it should be pointed out that plenty of every-day-life personalities are shown during the movie. We all have met, or even are currently dealing with that elderly man or woman, that beggar, the presumptuous lady, the people at the bus station, the typical neighbour, and on and on. They are all pawns in our daily basis â€“ they just seem to be the responsible ones for some of our actions. Despite that, we truly need to concentrate in the ones that make us 'happy' and fulfilled, like it does Max or Mary, because we are all strange and the only thing we need is to find the ones that are ready to jump on the same train â€“ our soul mate. <br/><br/>P.S. My rating is 10 out of 10. P.P.S. ""Scent of a Woman"" (1992) was my favourite movie. P.P.P.S. Mary and Max it is now replacing its place."

At school, she is teased by her classmates because of an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead; while at home, her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, kleptomaniac mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened condensed milk; and a Smurfs-like cartoon show called The Noblets. One day, while at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a New York City telephone book and, becoming curious about Americans, decides to write to one.

The Animation is solid, the dialog is smartly written, the drama is rather well done, (most of) the characters are likable, and the story is quite unforgettable. However, the music/soundtrack can get quite repetitive at times, and if you don't like sad movies, Mary and Max might not be for you. <br/><br/>Overall: 9/10 Pros: +Great Story with tons of drama that is executed mostly perfect +Smart Writing +Great Characters +Excellent animation<br/><br/>Cons: -Forgettable soundtrack, with the exception of one song... that has been done time, and time again.<br/><br/>If you like claymation movies, check out Mary and Max.

","appears on screen: ""God gives us our relatives â€“ thank God we can choose our friends"". The simple, heartfelt sentiment of a longing for meaningful friendship, understanding and an outlet to share is a huge driving force that makes Mary and Max a cinematic gem one finds hidden in the cave buried amongst heaps of awful movies â€“ a gem one only finds every so often.<br/><br/>The Narrator (Humphries) lays it all out: Mary (Bethany Whitmore as a child, Collette as an adult) is an eight-year-old Australian girl, bullied in school, mistreated by her kleptomaniac, drunk mother and neglected by her factory-worker father. She has no friends. Max (Seymour-Hoffman) is an obese, middle-aged New Yorker who has Asperger's Syndrome. He has no friends either. When Mary finds the strange name ""M. Horowitz"" in a phone book and decides to write to him, it's the start of an unlikely friendship spanning two continents and twenty years and enduring countless hardships.<br/><br/>Directed, written and designed by Australian animator Adam Elliot, Mary and Max may at first seem inaccessible because of its art-house sensibilities â€“ there's a misconception that claymation is only ever used to make either films for very young children, or bizarre adaptations of Kafka's Metamorphosis. The delightfully whimsical style here is very comfortable, honest and real, raw emotions balanced with an appropriate sprinkling of black humour.<br/><br/>To get an idea for the feel of the movie, take the heartbreaking opening sequence of Pixar's Up and stretch that to 80 minutes. The movie's childlike honesty belies a large range of very real and mature themes, making this not ideal for very young children, but something that older kids will appreciate. Danny Boyle's film Millions, also about a young outcast kid making sense of life and the world at large, comes to mind.<br/><br/>Unlike such claymation films as Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline and Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Mary and Max doesn't derive most of its charm from being dark and grotesque. The characters feel so real that their appearances are the only thing remotely caricature-like. Through their letters to and fro, Mary and Max work through issues such as making friends, dealing with bullying and teasing, approaching relationships and so on. Just as Max mentors Mary, so the young girl has a thing or two to teach him. The film tracks as their lives progress, Max winning the New York lottery, Mary going on to study in university and get married, all the way up until they finally meet face-to-face in New York.<br/><br/>The film contains a heartfelt and accurate (at least compared to most movie depictions) portrayal of Asperger's Syndrome. Max decides that he likes being an ""Aspie"", that there's no point in finding a ""cure"", and that it's all about working around the anxiety attacks, sensory overload and social awkwardness that is part and parcel of the ""syndrome"". Max finds solace in order, routine and comfort foods like his invention, the chocolate hot dog. ""If only there was a mathematical equation for love,"" he sighs.<br/><br/>One feels as much for Mary as for Max, the young girl lacking the life experience, with tragedy and heartbreak heaped onto her. From having a school bully pee on her lunch, to being unlucky in love and unable to have a good relationship with her parents, let alone any friends, it's hard not to immediately want to give the awkward bespectacled girl with the birthmark on her forehead a great big hug.<br/><br/>I spent the whole movie fighting back tears â€“ partly because of how genuinely moving it was, but also how happy I was that here was a wonderful film that had got everything right. While charming and beautiful throughout, the movie isn't afraid to offer a real and unflinching perspective, and never once feels preachy or contrived. There are very few movies that can truly be called ""life-changing"" â€“ this is one of them."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","10","0","2","14 December 2011"," Mary and Max (2009)
","Difficult and mature film making, disguised as an animated film. The childish presentation of the film is important for its subject matter, but it always has a dark and artistic edge. Mary and Max is one of those rarest of films. One that I knew nothing about before seeing it. No trailer, no poster, no plot synopsis etc. All I knew is that it was animated and Hoffman did a voice. The film is a complex look at relationships, family, mental health, sexuality, and acceptance. All these themes pop-up, but are viewed through the eyes of a child, a man with Asperger's, and a woman suffering from depression. The film spans 20 years, and we are treated to the real highs and lows. Whether is be marriage, urinating on a sandwich, or the death of a mime. The film draws you in with its presentation, but keeps you hooked with its thoughts and emotions. Hoffman gives a tremendous performance. The kind that makes you think voice over work should be nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars. Mary and Max treats you to some incredibly funny comedy, and devastatingly saddening tragedy. This is a film that I will certainly watch again and again, and is up there with the best animated films of all time."
"malcolm-mcewen","10","0","2","11 December 2011"," this is a beautiful movie
","I don't think I've ever given a ten before but this movie really deserves it. The choice of animation works extremely well and facilitates the telling of a touching story in a humorous but warm style. Offering a unique insight into and a balanced appraisal of the attitudes towards mental illness the movie challenges the very notion of what constitutes mental illness. For Max actually likes being Max, he doesn't want to be cured! It is a great shame that a movie as good as this failed to get the promotion it deserved but its the kind that will stand the test of time and entertain and educate many more for years to come. Highly recommended."

","""Mary and Max"" is an excellent film.<br/><br/>Juts like in his previous short, ""Harvie Krumpet"" Adam Elliot manages to make a incredible combination of hope and bleakness, alternating black comedy with lots of heartwarming moments. Taking that in consideration, the plot can move from a light-hearted scene into a very dramatic one, but those changes of mood are never gratuitous or forced.<br/><br/>Instead of that, the plot from this movie flows in a fascinating, unpredictable way, were the light and the darkness are part of the same story, complementing each other.<br/><br/>I guess that some viewers will think that the characters from this movie are ""ugly"", but, personally, I found their ""ugliness"" appealing: The beauty of this movie is completely different to the generic stuff that you see in most of the recent (Animated or live action)movies, making them unique, and therefore, endearing.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it deals with many serious issues(Such as depression, suicide, death and solitude) and flawed characters, I truly enjoyed ""Mary and Max"". I loved the whole bittersweet aspect of it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"lotsee","Null","0","1","10 September 2011"," Humbly brilliant, with a sense of humor not all people would get.
","Mary and Max is a surprisingly funny movie, though I would understand that some people might find its straightforward humor offensive. There may be references to ""poo"" and some dark scenes of a slightly gruesome nature, but they are merely symbols of the honesty and transparency of the natures of the main characters. The people who are offended by the movie's humor are most likely also the very ""normal"" characters who reject the strange natures of Max and Mary in the movie.<br/><br/>It is a simple, touching story between the unusual friendship of young Mary and middle-aged Max, who in their confusion of the social taboos that bewilder them in their everyday lives, find a common solace in each others' letters. The film does not aspire to be grandiose any more than it should, which some people have mentioned they found boring. But the mood is only fitting for the message it wants to convey. Max and Mary, after all, are not the stereotypically ""exciting"" characters one would normally encounter. They are actually quite boring in the real-life standards the usual person would have. But the emphasis of the movie is how these two average, ""boring"" people could share something so special and personal that not even many ""exciting"" people experience.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an emotionally refreshing movie, with animations that are well-done and music that is very sweet. It is not something that many people would understand because it takes a deal of empathy in understanding an introverted shy child and a lonely man with Asperger's, but those who live up to the challenge will find a rare, maybe even tearful, treat."

","This stop motion animation is about the unlikely friendship between a young and unattractive girl in Australia, and a socially inept man in New York.<br/><br/>""Mary And Max"" is captivating and touching beyond my expectations. I never thought that an animation with bleak colours and unattractive characters would be so engrossing. The plot exposes in detail the emotional depths of both Mary and Max. It tells viewers their inner world unreservedly. Max may have an unusual personality, but his inner experiences undoubtedly strike a chord with many people. As for Mary, her loneliness and low self esteem are saddening. Her unhappy childhood evoke much sympathy from viewers. It's quite amazing that these two characters alone are so riveting and captivating, that they create waves of strong emotions. ""Mary And Max"" is an outstanding animation that serves as a testament as to what friendship is really about."

","Before watching it I thought that the film would be boring but it would not. It is the best animation movie I have ever watched. I frankly say that it is an excellent movie. Actually I do not like watching animation movie but this one is so different. The scenes, the art- design are so live that you can not understand that it is an animation movie or not. In the movie there are two main characters that have same attribution. Mary is an 8 year old girl living in the Melbourne. One day, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40's living in New York; he has the sick of Asperger syndrome. And then they started to help each other by letters. Mary is a very lonely and shy girl and her only friend is Max. She asks Max everything about life. And Max learns how to cry, laugh by help of Mary. During the movie it's by equal turns incredibly touching and laughs out loud hilarious. It is a wonderful story which rewards multiple viewings. You laugh at the characters but often feel incredibly sorry for them. I do not like bad ending so I wish the movie would have a happy end. During the film I guessed that Mary and Max would meet one day and would be very happy like a father and a girl. But I was bewildered when Mary got married. I would be happy, if it had got a happy end. And the last scene o film was really sad and tragic. Max hung all the letters from Mary his wall. It is really very romantic. You can fall in love a girl you never see, like Max. The last scene of movie gives the message that there is always pure love. The love of Max is really dramatic."

","Mary and Max is a feature film from the creators of the Academy Award winning short animation. It is simple tale of pen-friendship between two very different people; Mary,chubby lonely eight year old girl living with monstrous mother and taxidermist father.,and Max a 44 year old,severely obese,Jewish man.At the post office one day, she randomly picks a name out of a New York phone book. That name is Max Jerry Horowitz.They start writing each other, and continue to write each other throughout their lives, filling the role of, literally, the only friend each other has.it's honest about depression; it's extremely funny in places without falling into the slapstick trap.This movie recalls me ""Amelie"" movie with events at its beginning and conclusion.Her mother is drawn perfectly especially her lips.she has toys which she designs herself and she gets hook on a cartoon and whipped cream love.What I totally love about the film, is how each scene comes chock full of sight and verbal gags, that just begs for more than one repeated viewing just to take it all in. It tells you a lot about the labors of love from the filmmakers in stuffing every moment with something to take away from, and something new to discover each time you watch the film, enriching the previous viewing experience. There's also plenty of animation going on in the film, with sequences crafted full of humor each time any character thinks of something, or flashes back in reminiscence, confirming that there is no effort spared in really making this an animated film to remember.<br/><br/>For this movie words fail me, it is short of words.I enjoy so much Mary's theory about childbirth.I give nine out of ten to this movie.If you want to have a good time,you will watch this movie."

","It reminds of of The Royal Tenenbaums but in clay-mation. The movie more Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit than Corpse Bride. It's an Australia made film, so dark and quirky that I love it.<br/><br/>Although it is not for kids its storyline and etc are so well written and put together. Deep and provocative. YEAH, I went there. If you love Wes Anderson and or Tim Burton all washed up in the mysteries of being a child, you will truly enjoy this film.<br/><br/>It has the character narration like in Amelie and such a lovely story flowered with wonderful music.<br/><br/>:D"

","This really was one of the biggest surprises of the year. the film is just the right length but moves very quickly.<br/><br/>The film manages to blend both humour and drama very well. You will find yourself laughing out loud one moment and the other be very moved. Sometimes even both at the same time.<br/><br/>The story involves the interaction between a young girl in Australia and man in new york who start writing to each other about their lives. Both are extremely lonely. The quirky animation and script is spot on and makes for an extremely enjoyable viewing. Why this film was ignored at the Oscars for How to Train your dragon i will never know."
"doyler79","9","0","2","24 September 2010"," perverse and often immature
","In a perverse and often immature way, this movie deals with the mature issues of love, friendship, forgiveness and mental health. There's a<br/><br/>big white elephant in the room so this movie requires a mature audience.A bizarre and strange pen-friendship is formed through happenstance by two people who are separated by both age and<br/><br/>geography.<br/><br/>I loved the letter writing element of this film and it reminded me of ""84 charring cross road"". Worth a watch even just to see how the attention to detail in this movie makes it possible for us to feel something for clay figures."
