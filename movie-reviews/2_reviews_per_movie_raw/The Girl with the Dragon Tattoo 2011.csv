","After the announcement that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was getting an English-language film treatment, I decided that the hype had built up to a point where I just had to read the source material for myself. Though it is not without flaws, Dragon Tattoo is an excellent story with the important mission of raising awareness concerning violence against women. Mere days after finishing the book I watched the Swedish film. The hype train had me excited for an outstanding thriller. <br/><br/>The hype train let me down.<br/><br/>I was left cold and somewhat irritated by the Swedish adaptation. A ton of important plot elements were left out, some were inexplicably added (Blomkvist's memories of the island became far too important and contrived), and Rapace felt all wrong as Lisbeth. She was brilliant and violent, but lacked the quiet pensiveness of the original character. She did not come off as autistic and emotionally disturbed, just bratty and rude. Worst of all, I was constantly confused by the extremely rushed, strange new take on the story. <br/><br/>As a lover of foreign films, I normally grind my teeth when I hear that America is developing a remake. However, I found myself desperate for this one. I needed a movie that actually gave me the experience of reading the book for the first time, that made me care for Lisbeth and that truly disturbed me. Thankfully, the American adaptation (not a remake) delivered exactly what I was looking for. Those who say this version is unnecessary or a rehash must have seen a very different Swedish Girl with the Dragon Tattoo than I saw. The American take is jam-packed with scenes that were either skimmed or completely left out of the Swedish version. Yet, despite being more robust, the English- language Dragon Tattoo is incredibly paced, feeling less rushed yet hitting all the important plot points. The characters have time to develop and grow on you, the clue-finding makes more sense, and the killer is more horrifying. Screenwriter Zaillian knows exactly what to leave out and what to change (though the ending, which mirrors the book's ending, could have been arranged better). Craig, Mara, and even Plummer are spot-on in their roles and feel more fleshed-out as characters. Mara, in particular, inhabits Larsson's Lisbeth in a way Rapace did not. She captures Lisbeth's silent, borderline-autistic nature perfectly. Her fragile body and alien appearance even match the book's description. She allows herself to be vulnerable, but clearly regrets it over time. It's a captivating performance.<br/><br/>If someone were to ask me, personally, which version to see, I would have to say without hesitation that this is the rare occasion where the American adaptation is superior. I did not think it was possible to stay so true to the story under three hours."
"hyprsleepy","Null","223","328","22 December 2011"," Quick Comparison of both versions - both excellent in their own right
","Here is a rundown of the differences in the two movies:<br/><br/>-MIKAEL BLOMKVIST-<br/><br/>American - Blomkvist is played as more of a tough guy and not a good guy. His flaws are laid bare and he shows himself to be much more detached than emotional.<br/><br/>Swedish - This is the ""good guy"" side of Mikael. He is sensitive, caring, and smart. He shows a protective side when it comes to Lisbeth. Physically speaking the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look as sturdy as his American counterpart. He has a gut and appears to be quite a bit older than Lisbeth which can make the relationship between them more shudder inducing and probably accounts for why there are fewer sex scenes between them in the Swedish version. <br/><br/>-LISBETH SALANDER-<br/><br/>American - Perhaps because Blomkvist was made into such a strong character Lisbeth was then morphed into a more withdrawn and vulnerable girl so as to complement the new Blomkvist. She still has attitude, aggression, and rage but she also exhibits a quiet shy side that was not in the original as well as more of a romantic side.<br/><br/>Swedish - In this version Lisbeth is not shy, not gentle, and not nice. She doesn't chase Blomkvist - he chases her. She perfectly embodies everything you think of when you think of a strong female lead and has an unpredictability and edge to her that is exciting to watch. Her dragon tattoo is much, much better.<br/><br/>-OVERALL- <br/><br/>I liked the American Mikael and the Swedish Lisbeth. <br/><br/>While I may prefer a scene or two from the Swedish version, such as the ending, overall I enjoyed the American version more. <br/><br/>On the flip side, I can understand why some may hate this version because Lisbeth was their favorite character and she's been changed into something they don't like. For me, the modifications to Lisbeth's character weren't severe enough to put me off.<br/><br/>The Swedish version captured a cult following for a reason and I would recommend both to anyone who has an interest in darker gritty movies that have a raw intensity to them. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart and that's what I love about it!"
"eytand94","10","307","457","22 December 2011"," The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo: Another Winner From David Fincher!
","The lights dim, the movie begins with a brief prologue, and the zany and incredibly weird opening credits begin, set to a creepy cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song."" From the beginning, we are in for a wild ride as Stieg Larsson's incredibly popular novel ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is brought to life on screen.<br/><br/>Scorned journalist Mikael Blomkvist is called upon by Henrik Vanger, a very wealthy man, while writing a book. Vanger is in search of an answer to the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, which occurred over 40 years ago. He assumes that Harriet is dead, and that she was murdered. He looks to Mikael to investigate her disappearance and who killed her. Then Mikael gets assistance from Lisbeth Salander, a dangerous but intelligent 24 year-old punk who is an accomplished computer hacker and a great contribution to the solving of other crimes. Together, Mikael and Lisbeth go on a dark, eerie journey into a world of crime, Nazism, and corruption that will lead them to Harriet's assassin.<br/><br/>I walked into ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with almost no knowledge of Larsson's novel or the Swedish film made a few years before David Fincher's version. The end result is ultimately an extremely satisfying, brutal, and complex thriller thanks to great direction by Fincher (known greatly for his work on ""Seven,"" ""The Game,"" and ""The Social Network""), excellent writing, and an impeccably chosen cast.<br/><br/>After only a few years, the character of Lisbeth Salander has become an attention-grabbing heroine that is as iconic as Edward Cullen of the love-it-or-hate-it ""Twilight"" series. And we can understand why. After all the truly awful and hideous things that have plagued her life, Lisbeth doesn't take any crap from anybody. She may be angry, violent, overtly sexual, demanding, and perhaps a little crazy, but she is a genius at what she does, and has reasons for all of her actions, no matter how gruesome they may be.<br/><br/>The mystery surrounding the film is sophisticated and white-knuckling, adding to the intensity and mood of the story and its characters. We're not sure of who is Harriet's killer, or if Harriet is even dead, until the last half hour of the film, and when we do find out the twist, it leaves a stupendous impact.<br/><br/>After cementing his reputation in brutal crime thrillers, and surprising us with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and ""The Social Network,"" David Fincher was the right man for the director's chair. Every film he makes, even a drama like ""The Social Network,"" sets up a tone of genuine suspense, tension, and fear for the characters. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" isn't any different as Fincher adds his signature touch to the movie.<br/><br/>Of all of the people they could have chosen to play these roles, the casting director landed in a pot of gold. Daniel Craig does a wonderful job as Mikael, showing us that he can play characters other than James Bond. With the amount of screen time she has, Robin Wright is also very good as Blomkvist's business partner Erika Berger. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsg√•rd also turn in great performances as Henrik Vanger and Martin Vanger.<br/><br/>The person to really watch out for, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Getting her big break in the underrated remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and later starring in Fincher's previous film ""The Social Network"" (giving a dynamite performance in the opening scene), Mara has sealed her future with many more promising and exciting roles because of her portrayal of Lisbeth. This is not an easy role to play, knowing that Mara is the second person to play the character. She must endure two shocking rape scenes and a torture sequence, and there is a hefty amount of nudity involved. Mara embodies Lisbeth, immediately bringing immense intimidation, danger, and fury every time she comes on to the screen. Her eyes are wide and emotionless, almost as if you can see right through her. And with everything that has happened to the character, we understand that Lisbeth has a right to be that way. She may be smart, but she is not interested in attraction or friendships with another human being. Overall, Mara gives a sensational, fearless, dedicated, and electrifying performance that guarantees an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Being released during the cheery time of the holidays, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is not a feel-good film, by any means. It is a harsh, gritty, and rough cinema trip that answers the question of leaving the kids at home with the babysitter. Also, if you're squeamish, you will not like it. However, those who have read the book, and those who have not read it, should check it out. Even without having read Larsson's novel, I left the theater completely satisfied. It is a movie experience that you don't commonly get. Fincher has done it again. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a must!"
"ferguson-6","7","166","248","20 December 2011"," Comes forth with the Thaw
","Greetings again from the darkness. The character of Lisbeth Salander absolutely fascinates me. That's true whether we are discussing Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy novels, the Swedish film versions, or this latest film version from director David Fincher and a screenplay from Steve Zaillian. It's also true whether Lisbeth is played on screen by Noomi Rapace (Swedish films) or Rooney Mara. She is a brilliant character hiding in plain sight from a world that has fiercely mistreated her, and now misjudges and underestimates her. She is the oddest heroine I can recall ... and I can't get enough of her.<br/><br/>Let's start with the source material. Stieg Larsson's books are far from perfect, but addictive just the same. The first book (on which this film is based) is, at its core, a simple who-dunnit presented in a manner that is claustrophobic, paranoid and eerie. Moving on to this particular film, we find the director and screenplay holding the basic tone while making a few changes ... some minor, others more substantial. These changes may irk those fans who are a bit more loyal to the books, but Fincher surely wanted to offer more than a simple re-telling of the story.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist hired to solve the 40 year old mystery of the disappearance/murder of Harriet Vanger, niece to Swedish millionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). To research, Blomkvist must dig into the Vanger's rotten family tree of Nazis, anti-Semites, sexual predators, anti-social fanatics, and a few just plain loony birds. You can imagine how excited this rich and once powerful family is to have someone uncovering long buried secrets. Circumstances allow for Lisbeth to assist Blomkvist in researching this.<br/><br/>Unlike many mysteries where assembling the clues is the most fun, the real heart of this story is the odd, somewhat uncomfortable developing relationship between Blomkvist and Lisbeth. This latest version allows this to develop relatively smoothly, but it nonetheless rattles our senses. We see the subtle changes in Lisbeth as she slowly opens up to the idea of a real friendship based on trust. Fear not mystery fans, the Vanger clan still provides more than enough juice to keep any film sleuth happy.<br/><br/>It's truly impossible to avoid comparisons between the two movie versions and the respective casts. It's quite obvious Mr. Fincher was working with a substantially greater budget than Niels Arden Opler had for the first Swedish film. While they are both enthralling, I actually lean a bit towards the rawer original. That takes nothing away from this latest version. Same with Noomi Rapace vs. Rooney Mara. Ms. Mara is excellent in her performance and I was fully satisfied, but Ms. Rapace brought a rougher edge to the role ... one that made it even tougher to crack that shell. The biggest difference in the casts is Daniel Craig against Michael Nyqvist. Mr. Craig is just a bit too cool for the role, while Nyqvist captured the insecurity and vulnerability that Larsson wrote about.<br/><br/>All of that is nit-picking. Both film versions are sterling entertainment and hopefully the Fincher version will bring the story to a much wider audience. I would encourage those that are interested to check out the Swedish version, as well as the Larsson books. Maybe that will explain my fascination with this creature known as Lisbeth Salander."
"lbabe29","10","374","578","18 December 2011"," The best adaptation imaginable with an intoxicating, Oscar-worthy performance from Rooney Mara
","Chilling, haunting and relentlessly thrilling, director David Fincher has created the definitive film adaptation of Larssons best seller whilst at the same time improving on the source material. A brilliant performance from Rooney Mara only elevates the film to greater heights <br/><br/>The Review:<br/><br/>Ill cut to the chase: this is everything fans of the books could have hoped for, its miles better than the already good Swedish film, its more faithful to the novel, in some places it actually improves on the source material.<br/><br/>With ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" David Fincher has put his trademark darkness to fantastic use. Whether its sweeping shots of freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect. With Fincher i've learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and this is no exception, within this film are some of his greatest images. Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes, Fincher is wise enough to show them in all their horror but doesn't stop to linger or exploit.<br/><br/>The performances are perfect all round, Its clear Fincher and the casting production went to great lengths to pick not only great actors but those who embody the very essence of their characters. Of note in the supporting characters are Yorick van Wageningen who plays the sadistic Bjurman with unsettling believability and the always great Christopher plummer who is note-perfect as the desperate, loney grandfather Henrik .- As one part of our central duo Daniel Craig puts in his finest performance, normally cast as the tough hero Craig is more subdued here, he has Blomkvist easy charm down to a T but also captures the weak, submissive aspect of his character. - Lisbeth Salander is a character unlike anything fiction has ever seen¬Ö.broken,pierced, clade in leather with short black hair and a body so slight the wind could break her, she is horribly victimised but refuses to be one. To sum it up she is one of the most interesting and difficult characters an actress could ever play. I could honestly write a whole review on the brilliance of Rooney Mara's performance, she is the very essence of Lisbeth¬Öas if the character just walked off the page. Mara commands every scene with a mixture of silent burning rage and a deep rooted venerability. Her eyes are the heart of the film, her reactions are the reason myself and the others around me laughed, gasped and even cried. The character requires an actress who can internalize her emotions yet at the same time convay a wide range of feelings. Mara does this such perfect skill, every glance is charged with deep feeling as if you're looking directly into her soul. A brave performance, Mara bares all in the nude scenes and goes to frankly horribly dark places in the now informous scenes of sexual violence. Watching Rooney Mara is witnessing the birth of a star, this is the best performance of the year and if the Oscars fail to reconzie her i will lose all hope in their judgment. <br/><br/>The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is perfect, eerie and unsettling. It is as good as their Oscar winning score last year if not better, its more understated and does what every score should do....improves the scenes not overpower them.<br/><br/>This is by and large a perfect adaptation, my main issue lay with one singe sequence. There is a shot that seems to be there solely for the purpose of showing off, it serves no real purpose within the story. <br/><br/>The most touching scenes of the film come from the characters themselves, this is a character driven story and none are more powerful than Lisbeth and Mikeal themselves. Fincher makes their relationship the focus and it pays off, they are the heart of the books and Fincher rightfully recognises this. <br/><br/>Proving that sometimes ""american"" adaptations can actually be for the better this is a film nobody should miss...its everything the novel is, plus some. More than anything i was impressed by the humour that is added through-out, this film will make you laugh, it will break your heart and it will make you want to take a shower."
"Chris_Pandolfi","5","205","312","21 December 2011"," She's Not as Interesting as Her Swedish-Speaking Counterpart
","Watching the original Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon  Tattoo,"" I was actively engaged with its dual story lines, but I also  found myself pondering which of the two was the more important. Now  that David Fincher has made an English-language remake, I find myself  pondering what went wrong. Here is a mystery thriller so cold, so  distant, and so lacking in energy that it feels neither mysterious nor  thrilling. It follows the plot of the original film fairly closely, and  yet it makes a number of small changes that drastically affect its  credibility. I'm also stumped by the curious decision to retain the  Swedish setting. If you have gone to the trouble of casting  English-speaking actors, it seems only fitting that you should change  the story's location to somewhere more appropriate, say America or  Britain.  Adapted from the novel by Stieg Larsson, the title is a description of  goth chick Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an emotionally walled-off  computer hacker who works for a security company. In the original film,  we got only scraps of her back story, and yet just enough was given to  pique our interest. We were challenged to read her. Who was she? What  had she gone through? What led up to a disturbing watershed moment seen  only in flashback? In this remake, her back story doesn't even amount  to crumbs. That watershed moment is altogether removed, as is a  significant chunk of her family history. Because of this, we're no  longer compelled to probe her mind, to try and understand why she is  the way she is. All we see is a girl in her early twenties in serious  need of an attitude adjustment.  She was hired to investigate a former reporter turned magazine  publisher named Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who lost a libel case  against a powerful billionaire. Although he must pay a serious amount  in damages, he insists that he was set up. Lisbeth is inclined to  agree; her investigative work turned up nothing incriminating. Not long  after the trial, Mikael is hired by a man named Dirch Frode (Steven  Berkoff) on behalf of his employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher  Plummer), the former CEO of a family industry. Now retired on a  family-owned island off the mainland, he asks two things of Mikael: To  write a memoir about the Vanger clan and to investigate the case of his  great-niece, Harriet, who disappeared in 1966 when she was only a  teenager. Henrik is convinced she was murdered, and that her killer is  a member of his family, with whom he does not get along.  Needing an assistant, Mikael is directed towards Lisbeth, who has just  worked her way of a particularly nasty situation with her new guardian,  a sadistic sexual pervert (Yorick van Wageningen) who kept strict  control of her finances. As she and Mikael dig deeper into the mystery,  they must make sense of a series of numbers Harriet wrote in a  notebook, all of which are paired with initials. What do they mean? How  do they connect to a series of murders spread across time and distance,  all involving young women? And in what way does Henrik's family factor  in? Watching the original film, I anxiously awaited the moment the  mystery would be solved. That's because, as contrived as it was, there  was at least the sense that the filmmakers were interested in their own  material. The same cannot be said about this new film. There's no  urgency about it.  I think much of the blame rests on the updated screenplay by Steven  Zaillian, which awkwardly intertwines dark and twisted scenarios with  an undercurrent of dry wit. When Henrik first meets Mikael, for  example, we find that the former is almost jovial ¬ñ not at all  appropriate given his sad situation. Certain scenes from the original  film were intense, and yet they always felt as if they were character  driven. That's not the case here; most of the intense scenes, including  when Lisbeth spontaneously decides to have sex with Mikael, are  overproduced, as if the intention was to be sensational. The most  glaring misfire is the inclusion of a stray cat. I don't need to spell  out what happens to it. I will say, however, that this plot device is  so overused that it has long since ceased to be symbolic. Now it's just  cruel and disgusting.  Little touches, such as Mikael's affair with his magazine coworker  (Robin Wright) and his relationship with his religious teenage daughter  (Josefin Asplund), contribute absolutely nothing to the story apart  from a surplus of characters. And then there's the ending, which is  really more of an epilogue as it involves events unrelated to the case  of Harriet Vanger. In the original film, it was a brief couple of  scenes that tied up a few loose ends. Here, it goes on much longer than  it should. I'm usually the first to give remakes the benefit of the  doubt. It's certainly not my style to make endless comparisons between  old and new versions of the same story. But in the case of ""The Girl  with the Dragon Tattoo,"" I just can't help myself. I'll make this easy  on you: See the original instead of the remake. Quite simply, the  original is better.  -- Chris Pandolfi"
"aliensbishop","4","142","216","22 December 2011"," Dangles the carrot but doesn't deliver
","David Fincher's remake of TGWTDT has enough to keep the film steady on its feet, but lacks a horde of specific qualities from Oplev's excellent effort. <br/><br/>Firstly, in a basic mystery story, there is a need to present a series of twists and discoveries that lead to solving the mystery. Fincher's film fails to present this trail of bread crumbs in the same enticing way that Oplev's did. Instead, we get a fast forward hyperspace logic jump when Blomkvist's daughter (out of nowhere) points out the vital clue that breaks the case, and then all related info is collected by Lisbeth in 5 minutes. <br/><br/>Secondly, the following characters were shadows of themselves in the Fincher version: 1. Lisbeth Salander 2. Henrik Vanger 3. Martin Vanger 4. Bjurman The actors weren't horrible, but they were not as good as the ones in the Swedish version. <br/><br/>Lastly, there were key omissions and changes which, for me, were completely inexplicable and confusing. 1. Lisbeth's past, father, etc. was one or two lines of dialog. 2. Harriet Vanger in London? 3. Vanger does not tell Blomkvist that he knew Harriet.<br/><br/>It all adds up to a disappointing attempt to recreate the dark energy of Oplev's film. And the opening sequence was like a Tool video mixed with bad James Bond."
"llsee","4","192","297","31 December 2011"," Another Disappointing American Remake
","I checked the spoiler box, but I find it hard to believe that anyone interested in this movie has not read the book, or seen the Swedish version. And, frankly I can't understand the glowing reviews from critics and praise for Rooney Mara's performance. Did they read the book, or see the Swedish version? First the good. I did like the ending better than the Swedish version. It was closer to the book, and necessary to set up Lisbeth's antagonism toward Bloomkvist in the second book. But I wonder if they were even thinking about a possible second film, because they dragged at least 2 key scenes from the second book into this film, one being Lisbeth's confrontation of Bjurman about the possible tattoo removal.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. As created by Larsson in the book, and as portrayed by Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version, Lisbeth was an angry, fearless outsider, determined to live life on her terms. As portrayed by Mara, Lisbeth is a waif, unable to cope with life, making her outbursts of violence both puzzling and unexpected. In the book, it is clear that Lisbeth was the stronger character, but that's not the way Mara portrays her. That is the crux of the problem with this movie, and probably the reason for the glowing reviews. A waif-like Lisbeth is much less threatening to the male reviewers, than a strong fearless one.In the book, Lisbeth took charge in tough situations, she certainly didn't need to ask permission from Bloomkvist. The portrayal of Lisbeth, as directed by Fincher, and as portrayed by Mara, is a huge disappointment, and not true to the character in the book at all.<br/><br/>There were other missteps in this version as well. Daniel Craig seemed removed and dis-interested. He seemed to be walking through the performance giving little emotion. Maybe Craig just can't play a role that makes him subordinate to a woman, or maybe Fincher can't conceive of a film like that. In the Swedish version, Bjurman was a frightening character who exuded an aura of threat. In contrast, the character of Bjurman in Fincher's movie seemed more of an overgrown adolescent, who relished his position of authority.<br/><br/>Both versions played freely with the time-line of the book, and by dropping or including different subplots. But, the dropping of the ""Kalle Bloomkvist"" nickname that was so prominent in the books is curious. Again, Lisbeth used it as an ironic nickname to express her disdain for Bloomkvist, something that the waif Lisbeth couldn't do. Granted it didn't play as big of a role in the first book, but if you were thinking of a trilogy it was needed to set up the later films. I also didn't understand the inclusion of a daughter for Bloomkvist. It served no purpose, and was not in the book.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are a fan of the book, and liked the way Lisbeth was imagined by Larsson, you will be disappointed by the movie. If you feel threatened by a strong independent woman, then you will appreciate the way Fincher has castrated his version of Lisbeth. This was not as good as the Swedish version, which presented a film much closer in tone to the book."
"noggindoc","5","77","117","7 January 2012"," Swedish (2009) Version is Superior
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo just adds to the list of crummy American remakes. First of all, what is with the opening credits? Are we watching a James Bond movie? Just because Daniel Craig is in it? The opening credits are completely disconnected from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Then the accents are entirely messed up. Daniel Craig kept turning on and off a ""Swedish"" accent and then mixing it with his real accent. However, I think Craig made a good Blomkvist in the end.<br/><br/>Noomi Rapace is a far better fit for Lisbeth than Rooney Mara. Mara is just not as convincing in her character portrayal. I lost count of the number of times I had to see her naked during the film. This is what really cheapens the movie for me. The nudity in the Swedish version is tasteful, this film is anything but tasteful. And I'm not complaining about the rape scenes, those are important plot points to the films and books. However, unnecessary nudity is entirely pathetic. Mara's accent is bizarre too, it sounds like she has no nose.<br/><br/>Please don't make the other two, just..don't."
"tskogstrom","5","84","130","29 December 2011"," Most expensive subtitle removal ever ?
","I cannot see how all the Hollywood money was used? I must have been the most expensive removal of subtitles in the history. Camera and light felt a bit better than the Swedish original version, but the end result felt too similar to the previous one. I also questioning reviews' sanity when they claim 'Rooney for Oscar' - she did nothing out of expected performance - in my opinion. Still the movie is better than general Hollywood movies, where 'actors' only scream f**k to each other.<br/><br/>The story around rapist Nils Bjurman was probably the poorest part, it made a flat impression, perhaps because of the scenes coming to close to each other 'First forced oral ... a few minutes ...then rape ... a few minutes ... then revenge'. in the Swedish version, and in the book, more happened with the character between these scenes. It should have scored six but I feel the failure of keeping up to the expectations reduce it one score."
"Jona1988","8","155","250","22 December 2011"," Great movie that more than well lives up to the book!
","I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books and seen the Swedish movies. The Swedish version of The girl with the dragon tattoo(M√§n som hatar kvinnor) was very good but I feel it is somewhat overrated. Nothing particularly weak about it but still not as good as some claim. When word came about that David Fincher would direct the new one I was just overjoyed. My maybe favourite director working right now filming one of the best books I had read in years. With thrillers like Se7en and Zodiac to his credit he was the perfect choice. And he doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The big question for many have been will Rooney Mara live up to Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander? The answer is She does! Who is better is difficult to say because they actually play the character quite different. Noomi is older and seems more secure and determined character while Mara feels more fragile and emotional. I feel Mara is more like how Lisbeth is described in the book. I like this movie better but regarding Lisbeth Salander it's a draw. Daniel Craig is great as Blomkvist, and it's good that even if he is a big star(James Bond) he plays the role really down to earth, the person the character should be. It is and should be Salander who is the main one and he lets Mara be the star. One actor who really surpasses his predecessor is Stellan Skarsg√•rd. Considering his character has such a big role this is a big plus for the American version. Christopher Plummer should also be mentioned. As I'm now on the actors I should also mention the relation between Salander and Blomkvist. Craig and Mara are brilliant at creating chemistry. Not only does one focus on the mystery but at the end maybe even more about them. Do they really speak with a Swedish accent? Some of them yes and I admit it felt a bit strange a first but one gets used to it like with most other things so some time later in the movie I didn't mind anymore. <br/><br/>Steven Zaillian deserves praise for the script. The original movie, even though it was not much shorter the plot at times felt rushed. Especially the ending where it went so quick and simplified. Zaillian succeeds in fitting the story without making it to fast or simple. Even if one hasn't read the book you can follow what is going on. Very impressive and perhaps what lifted this movie above the Swedish. So there are some changes but for me, unlike how some feel about adaptations, the book isn't something holy and changes don't have to be wrong. Stieg Larsson's novel was not without flaws and the changes they made make sense, necessary and some better. Fincher is a master of suspense and shows it again here. The atmosphere and tone of the settings fit the story perfect. The movie is brutal just like the book and also that is handled great. Neither reduced or overdone. <br/><br/>The music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is as expected amazing. Almost as great as for The Social Network. I loved the opening credits set to the tones of the Immigrant Song cover. Some may feel it's a bit out of place but personally I loved it. <br/><br/>So are there any weak points in it? Well the last parts of the movie the story slows down somewhat but thats because Stieg Larsson's novel was like that and those parts are also needed for the continuing of the series. And even if I really like the Millennium trilogy, the story is not perfect not as complicated as some might expect. Doesn't mess with your head like Se7en. <br/><br/>If I'm to rank David Fincher's detective thrillers The girl with the dragon tattoo is below Se7en and Zodiac but it doesn't mean it is a weak movie, definitely not! I don't think I can find much they could have done better. The Swedish movie was good but this is much better. It lives up to my expectations as a fan of the book. Also works great as a thriller on it's own."

Made for TV, but containing unfiltered images of the sex, violence, and perversion from the thriller, the original trilogy was a great tribute to a now passed author. WHat's that Hollywood? You know what's good for us? This isn't a review of the originals, but they do bear mentioning since the Fincher feature is intended (and being hailed) as a superior version.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist is a simple investigative reporter ‚Äì he wants the biggest names in corporate corruption to fall. When he gets raked through the courts for a huge financial loss, he slips out of the public view taking a job solving a long standing murder for a strange wealthy family living on an island in north wherever. He soon figures out there's more to the single incident and employs the services Hot Topic poster girl Lisbeth Salander as his chief researcher. She's unhinged, but has the uncanny ability to hack EVERYTHING using the Mac OS ‚Äì a feat worthy of praise, for sure. Mystery unfolds, solves, and it only took 2 hours and 40 minutes.<br/><br/>In typical Fincher fashion, everything was grass-growing slow. It's a thriller, but even the climax contained long, riveting scenes of Lisbeth flipping through old records, getting coffee, walking, walking, walking, riding elevators¬Ö there's pacing and then there's self-indulgence. Thankfully Queer had graciously tossed me a free large soda coupon, so I filled my time by drinking, eliminating, and refilling several times. Choosing the flavoring for my soda = most exciting part of my evening.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig really could have been anybody. It's not really his fault, Mikael isn't a very complex character. He's thoughtful, passive, and likes his little trysts (don't we all?), but never really has any intentions other than the ever-noble seeking the truth. Rooney Mara got the real gem ‚Äì Lisbeth Salander with her stormy past, violent nature, and unfettered lust. Through the talented (and, funny, English- speaking) Noomi Rapace, the character has some maturity and more control in the crazed moments. Rooney Mara never broke from a sullen, pouty demeanor until the absurd final minutes of the film where she suddenly goes all Tin Man and finds a heart telling a brain-dead old man ""I made a friend!"" Rapace was a terrifyingly unhinged woman, Mara was a pouting teenager.<br/><br/>It's more than just the dull pacing and flat characters that made this movie boring as dirt, it was the entire experience. The Trent Reznor score sounded like someone leaning on a keyboard, the locations had zero deviation from the original, the accents fluttered somewhere between Swedish and British, and product placement overran the screen at all times. Far from the gritty source material, the film spewed out the watered-down, pretentious Hollywood version of edgy.<br/><br/>The one positive ‚Äì first film I've seen shot on RedOne that had a beautiful cinema look to it. Too bad everything else couldn't match the picture quality.<br/><br/>Critics may fawn over Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and probably the subsequent two films, but I think I'll be taking the Twilight route and skipping the rest of the series having had the taste of the first."
"shanebeacham","9","156","259","20 December 2011"," My Review For ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo""
","I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to it. Now normally I'd be angry at the fact of a foreign film being remade, having seen and loved the Swedish version of the film, but I made an exception with this one because of the cast and crew for this film. Fincher, who directed films such as Fight Club, The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, and most recently The Social Network (my favorite film of 2010 and what I thought should have won over The King's Speech), has a fantastic eye for filmmaking and has always impressed me with his movies, save for Se7en which I wasn't as huge a fan of as everyone else was and even on that film I enjoyed a good bit. You throw in the writer of Schindler's List and Gangs Of New York, add actors like Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and so many others, a score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who also scored The Social Network), and base it off the best selling book by Stieg Larsson (that's right, this isn't a remake but rather a re-adaptation), it all equals out to, in my opinion, the best film of the year by far.<br/><br/>Now the first thing I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance. She knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander. She captured the mystery, the strangeness, the darkness, the out-of-the- norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic and I'm gonna be shocked as hell if she does not get an Oscar nomination. And she really makes you feel for her in the darker parts of this movie, which we'll get to in a moment. And all the other performances are great as well. Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer, as little as he's in the movie, does a great job as well, in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.<br/><br/>Another thing that a lot of people have been talking about with this film, as it was with the book and the Swedish film, was the moments where sexual violence appears on screen. And while there are some really uncomfortable moments in the film, that's the reason why these scenes succeed. They shock you and make you want to look away. And that's good, especially when the themes of this movie as well as the source material were about this sort of thing, and the movie conveys it perfectly. And while these scenes do linger in your mind, they never distract you from the basis of this movie, which leads into my next praise for the film.<br/><br/>The story is really engaging. Even though I had seen the Swedish movie and knew how the story as a whole was going to play out, I was able to be really engaged in the movie and not focus on other things. It really sucks you in, and Steve Zaillian, the writer of this movie, structures the film in a way that is both similar and different to the Swedish version, therefore doing what I hoped this film would do, which was taking something that I already knew about and had watched before and made it to where it was still interesting and there were changes made to where I didn't know how it was going to turn out. And that's great.<br/><br/>And everything technical about this movie succeeds. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is fantastic and really sucks you into the tone of the picture. Jeff Cronenweth, who worked with Fincher on both Fight Club and The Social Network, delivers fantastic cinematography. The editing, the direction, the shots, everything about this movie succeeds, making it a near perfect film.<br/><br/>Now one small complaint I have about this film stems a little bit from me viewing the Swedish version, in which they reveal a little more about who Lisbeth is and one of the things she did in her past that made it so troubled. And they didn't use that here which kind of threw me off a little. However, the more I think about it, the less it becomes a concern because 1.) You can't compare the two films and 2.) there are bits and pieces shown in the films climax that shows that Lisbeth deep down does have a soul. So the movie manages to overcome that obstacle, and overall, I have nothing to say bad about it.<br/><br/>Overall, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a masterful film, it's one that you should definitely check out and I'll definitely be checking it out sometime soon. It's directed, written, and acted well, and succeeds in all that it sets out to do. You feel the emotion and darkness of the film, Rooney Mara blew me away with her performance (and that body, damn), and overall it lived up to my expectations. So out of ten, I got to be honest, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a 10. Go see this movie NOW."
"Ramascreen","8","132","218","20 December 2011"," A superb and chilling thriller
","I've never read Stieg Larsson's millennium novels, so I can't say how  faithful this film is to the original material, but I am a big fan of  the Swedish adaptation by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev. Now, I  know the fact that Hollywood is obsessed with remakes annoys the hell  out of us, but I think there can always be room for different  interpretation, different vision and approach and that's what David  Fincher's version excels in. It's more detailed, more curious, and more  unafraid. It's a superb and chilling thriller with an astounding  performance by Rooney Mara. Whether or not this version is better can  be argued but it certainly is a solid film¬Ö   Rooney Mara, with her skinny body and goth hairstyle and excessive  piercings and tattoos and her attitude, I think Mara manages to give a  more complex Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. But it's  mostly thanks to screenwriter Steven Zaillian who covers information  that the previous adaptation would simply skim or just talk about  instead of exposing it. Fincher and Zaillian want to seriously show how  dark, troubled, but motivated Lisbeth is. And some may consider this  approach to be too brutal or unnecessary but I think it's no more  brutal than Fincher's previous thrillers like Se7en. This is after all,  in its essence, a movie made solely for Fincher's fans or those who are  comfortable with his style. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography work is  fantastic by the way, it plays on how much you can handle. It goes  along with the script that tends to be explanatory. Whatever loopholes  or gaps that the previous adaptation had, Fincher's film fills it and  explains it in its own way.  Lisbeth Salander to me is a rebel, she lives by her own rules, but  she's also by herself, this version wants to instill in her mind the  idea that perhaps she could be sociable or she could be considered  normal if she just gets that attention that she never did, and that's  what warrants a different ending. Mara is absolutely phenomenal as  Lisbeth, it's a defining role for Mara, she's made it her own. She's  fierce, highly driven, but there's a sense of innocence to her as well.  She thinks her anger and actions are justified and the film  successfully encourages us to agree.  All those tattoos and piercings are like 'keep off' or 'stay away'  sign, perhaps because of years of rough background, going from one  guardian to another, so when somebody genuine like Mikael Blomkvist  (Daniel Craig) comes along, he represents the safety that desperately  longs for but would never admit to. I think it's smart that Fincher and  Zailian shows the estranged family side of Blomkvist, they see it as  important for Blomkvist to be able to relate to Henrik Vanger's  (Christopher Plummer) dilemma and I think that's a smart move. Craig is  the weakest link because his accent keeps going on and off, I'm not  sure if he even tries to sound Swedish at all, it's quite the  distraction. But he works with what's given to him, keep in mind that  the title is not Blomkvist with the dragon tattoo.  Of course nowadays you can't talk about Fincher's movies without  talking a bit about the unconventional score by Oscar winners Atticus  Ross and Nine Inch Nail's Trent Reznor. In fact, the movie pays an  amusing homage to NIN. Those of you film score aficionados would  probably find Ross and Reznor's tunes for this film rather eerie and  chilling, which it then pretty much serve its purpose. Having said  that, at times I find the score a bit forceful and it's like the same  soundwave echoing over and over again with the intent to hypnotize. I  don't think the opening graphic credit is all that impressive, it's an  interesting take but it looks out of place, it looks like it should be  a separate music video and it doesn't necessarily introduce the tone of  the film that you're about to see.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is definitely not a movie for the faint  of heart, it's a movie that would rattle your comfort cage, and I think  audiences will be divided, you'll either truly love it, or truly detest  it, but there will hardly be a middle ground."
"IonicBadger","6","44","68","6 January 2012"," Not as good as the Swedish movie
","I really was hyped too see this as David Fincher is one of my favorite directors, but this movie seemed pretty unnecessary to me.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much a re-thread of the Swedish movie same plot, except that the ending dragged on more than the Swedish movie.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara is good as Lisbeth and so is Craig as Blomkvist but they don't have the chemistry that the actors in the Swedish movie have.<br/><br/>The dialog seems pretty forced at times and I think this movie might have been better if it have been set in the UK or in the US, instead of having mostly British/American actors speak with awful accents.<br/><br/>My biggest question is why does this movie even exist it is completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>This movie falls in the same trap as many Hollywood adapted movies, it builds up a more hype and falls flat.<br/><br/>My verdict if you have not seen it go see the Swedish version, it's way more stronger as a whole."
"eltechno","3","356","631","24 December 2011"," Why?
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is pretty popular at our house. The trilogy has been read and all the three Scandinavian film versions have been watched. So it was with both anticipation and dread we watched the Hollywood version at the local cineplex yesterday. We walked away feeling puzzled as to why $100 million had been spent to make a movie that had already been brilliantly made only two years earlier. So tonight, we watched the Swedish version again for comparison which only re-enforced our opinions.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the new version is that it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It was filmed in Sweden. Larsson was Swedish. Etc. Yet the Swedish elements that give the story coherence have gone AWOL in the latest incarnation. I guess this is not especially surprising considering that director Fincher wondered in a Swedish interview after filming in the north how anyone could live in such a climate. If someone is actually confused about THAT, not much else about Swedish society is going to make much sense‚Äîespecially the complexities that allow that society to not merely survive but prosper.<br/><br/>The biggest problem centers around the casting of Daniel Craig as journalist Mikael Blomqvist. Blomqvist is supposed to be a Swedish idealist working for a lefty Stockholm rag. In the Swedish version of the film, all the nuances of such a person fill every scene so well it sometimes provokes a laughter of recognition. Craig, on the other hand, seems utterly clueless about how to play such a character. The man makes a great James Bond‚Äîa Swedish intellectual, not so much.<br/><br/>Because Craig doesn't get his character right, the whole relationship between Blomqvist and Lisbeth Salander never develops properly. This is a women who has a bunch of issues with men yet grows to trust and eventually love him. But instead of character development, we are left with the unspoken assumption of ""what woman wouldn't have the hots for Daniel Craig?"" While this is what makes Bond movies work, it is bizarrely out of place for this plot.<br/><br/>And then there are the missing details that were included in the Scandinavian version. The nature of the Vanger family Fascism. The hints at why Salander is so screwed up. The role of computers in their search for the bad guy and a believable explanation for how things got done. The details of how people actually DO cope with the cold‚Äîold Henrik Vanger knows how and when to wear an expensive parka in the Swedish version.<br/><br/>Of course, what is really missing from the Hollywood version is the politics of modern Sweden. Most people think of Sweden, if at all, as this lefty, sex-crazed, micro-society that was defined forever by the Social Democrats. What this picture misses is the role of the Swedish right wing. This may be the country of Gunnar Myrdal and Dag Hammarskjold, but it is also a country of wealthy industrialists with global connections and ambitions. The trilogy goes into extensive detail about this reality and this whole movie is about an industrialist with a bunch of Fascist siblings. Yet except for a few lines, this social tension barely makes an appearance in Fincher's telling. For example, in the Swedish version, we learn that one of the Vangers was killed fighting as a volunteer in Finland's Winter War with USSR. This detail explains volumes but it is missing in the Hollywood remake.<br/><br/>Fincher makes a good movie but he cannot get over the contradictions of making a movie set in Sweden that has been stripped of all Swedishness. What remains is an adolescent action movie with a real James Bond in the lead role. So a $100 million was spent to make a new movie with roughly 15% of the intellectual content of a brilliantly made movie that is only two years old. I suppose it makes sense. If you are making a movie targeted at an audience that is too damn lazy to read subtitles, I suppose it is a good move to eliminate much of the intellectual content of the books and the original movie.<br/><br/>Who knows‚Äîmaybe this thing will make money. My guess is that in most markets‚Äîespecially those where both versions must use subtitles anyway‚Äîthe Swedish version will be far more popular because there is so much more movie. It has more details and that makes it more believable. In the end, that should count for something."

","David Fincher's adaptation of the Stieg Larsson novel is an embarrassment. Fincher manages to reveal all the wrong details at all the wrong moments, effectively destroying any mystery or suspense to the story of the missing girl. Which, despite being the center of the book, is merely glossed over and instead we get unnecessarily graphic rape/sex scenes and a jumbled storyline. Nearly the entire cast give sub-par performances, particularly the main character. Mara Rooney couldn't be less believable as Salander. It was garbage. I can't believe this unoriginal piece of trash managed to get nominated for multiple Oscars. What a shame."
"argee727","6","44","72","22 December 2011"," Disappointed, but not surprised
","I was thrilled when I heard that this wonderful book, translated from the original Swedish, would be made into a movie. My husband and I both were fans from the get go. I expected some omissions and can forgive the omission of Blomkvist's affair with Cecilia, but cannot forgive the change in the end of the story ... another Hollywood thinks they are better than the author fiasco. Why oh why does this happen to all great books? Why do they have to dumb it down? Of course, they will make another and another. How will they screw with the next two? One can only imagine. I do however recommend you see it. Make sure you wear a sweater, it is cold throughout most of the movie and it is winter you know."
"guslee","1","50","85","8 February 2012"," A complete waste of time and money
","The main story of the movie, at least based on screen-time and storyline, is discovering the killer in a supposed murder committed 40 years ago, however there's a lot of time dedicated to Lizabeth's life that leads to nothing, especially the ugly rape scenes, that after seeing the ending of the movie, I found completely irrelevant to the story, if the idea was to show her past and all the mess that was her life, a couple of minutes of a review of her files would have been enough.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews that I have read claim that on the book, Lizabeth's life and his will to make a stand against violence against women was the main story of the movie, if that's the case then the director made a mess of the story and the movie is worst than I have rated it, because there's no way to get to that conclusion after watching it.<br/><br/>Also I still don't get the first ten minutes of paint and Trent Reznor's music, totally out of place."
"aharmas","6","37","61","21 December 2011"," This dragon doesn't soar
","For starters, why did they have remake this one? I would have loved to see the reactions to a remake of ""Casablanca"" in 1945, or what about ""Gone With The Wind"" with another beautiful actress who lacked the fire Leigh brought to the role. Could I even picture ""Titanic"" with another Kate? There was something iconic about the way Rapace's performance in the original ""Dragon"". She raised the bar to the point she might never be able to match the complexity of that performance, an organic, complete, involving role that consumed her and hypnotized the audience. The new film tries very hard to recreate the experience, and it does a decent job in some aspects, but the first film was more than just a performance. It emanated from troubled relationships, from flawed nature, from the way expectations were toppled one after another. In the recent film, changing the ending doesn't quite work; in fact, it hurts the film quite a bit. <br/><br/>There are some very good elements in the new film, especially the score, something that permeates the film with much needed energy, and there is something fresh about the way some of the scenes were opened up, particularly near the end. However, it is what has been done to the main character that is painful to watch. In the novel and the first film our protagonist has a troubled background. It interferes with the way she develops her relationships, and it makes her a survivor. She has enough scars and pain in her past to be alert and in a defensive mode. She doesn't trust others, and it is not a good idea to challenge her intellectually. She could be an impressive adversary. Fincher's Lisbeth is mostly style and pouts very well. There are flashes of her strength, but it is not consistent with the source material. Additionally, Fincher has added some touches to the movie that emphasize the ugliness of her world, sometimes it tips the feel of the movie, going a little too far. It becomes too graphic, too lurid, and it cheapens the story.<br/><br/>There is also an issue with the way the film is a little too long with the way some of the characters are introduced, and some situations are detailed to the point that it seems to question the audience's ability to make deductions. Did we need to go into a shopping spree to set up the big scene near the end? <br/><br/>Once again, I'd love to hear an explanation for the ending? Why?"

"gelman@attglobal.net","4","14","21","1 April 2012"," Poor imitation of the Swedish version
","This film might as well have been made in Cleveland as in Stockholm. There's nothing remotely Swedish about the two main characters, Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomqvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Craig is his generic-action-figure self and Mara lacks the edginess that made Noomi Rapace so distinctive as Lisbeth -- attractive and repulsive at the same time. Only Christopher Plummer is really suited to his role.<br/><br/>The makers of the American film have tampered with the plot in some ways, simplifying it at the expense sometimes of confusing what is clear in the first novel of the Stieg Larrson' trilogy. But that's considerably less of a problem than the failure to evoke the atmosphere and the context of the original. <br/><br/>It will be interesting to see what becomes of Robin Wright as Erika Berger in later episodes. Her position as Mikael's lover having been reduced in this telling, it may prove difficult to establish her central role in the plots of the two remaining parts of the trilogy.<br/><br/>A word more about Noomi Rapace. It's been said that she was unwilling to reprise her role as Lisbeth in the American films. I'm inclined to believe that she might have changed her mind if enough money had been offered. Certainly, the role in which she is expected to make her American debut will make much less of a splash than she would have made as Lisbeth. Rooney Mara is okay as Lisbeth and may one day be a star. Rapace was as memorable on film as Lisbeth was in the trilogy. As for language, I assume that like every Swede I've ever known, Rapace must be able to speak English and, if she has a Swedish accent, so much the better. At least one of the characters in the film ought to have seemed Swedish.<br/><br/>I have just seen this film for a second time, and, it is so memorable that I didn't remember having seen it the first time. My reaction this time around was the same as the first. Christopher Plummer is an outstanding addition, Craig and Mara aren't good substitutes for the characters in the Swedish film, and the plot simplifications obscure the story. I wish I could react differently because it's a hell of a good story."

Also, we are given a significant clue as to who is the murderer very early on in the film. What is the point!? The character of Salander is destroyed by the director. She opens up way too much and shows a significant amount of emotional weakness, which we shouldn't see until the next film at least. The film artistry itself is hugely lacking. We are under the illusion that it is a film of incredible beauty and depth. I'm afraid not, this is just the Swedish countryside - possibly the only good thing about this film. We are soon met by lack-lustre screenplay writing and subsequently unnatural and contrived scenes with every character. I'm not easily offended but the unnecessary use of swear words (where no normal person would use them) and lengthy portrayal of rape and sex in this film was just not called for. It is awkward and a huge indulgence on the director's part. Stick with the original Swedish version if you want good, solid, artistic film making.

","The US remake of ""Dragon Tattoo"" is inferior to the original in every aspect of film-making: script, acting, directing, cinematography, music, editing--even credits. Fincher puts the story together with the energy and creativity of someone painting by the numbers. Daniel Craig, with his absurdly tight clothing, registers no emotional, intellectual or sensual qualities of the male hero. Rooney Mara has the stare of Salandar, but nothing else.<br/><br/>My wife and I looked at the original right after seeing the Fincher version on screen. Danish director Niels Oplev captured the characters beautifully, and his cast gave their characters distinct and rounded qualities. Fincher's version was also soft on Nazism compared with the original, weakening the political insights and critiques that are the skeleton of Larsson's works. Rapace makes Lisbeth as fascinating as she is in the novels; Mara succeeds in making her only weird and sullen.<br/><br/>The cobbled-together editing and crutch-like flashbacks make one wonder why Fincher decided to disrupt the original's great flow, energy and clarity with such ineffectual modifications, modifications that sap the story of its power. The annoying, modern- mechanistic soundtrack of the U.S. version, like the oily black credits, betray a desire to say ""listen to me!"" and ""look at me"" rather than to work organically with the story.

","The girl with the dragon tattoo is perhaps Finchers weakest effort with a cut and paste rendition of the Swedish original that couldn't hold my interest either. Although beautifully shot in the lavish Finsheresque style, the story of a talented young investigator who teams up with a journalist to unravel a 40 year old mystery belongs in an episode of Inspector Morse rather than in a 3 hour long attempt to warp time.<br/><br/>From the completely out of place opening sequence up, I was thoroughly annoyed that the film couldn't grab and hold my attention for even more than 3 consecutive scenes. It in stead annoyed the hell out of me with the incompatible soundtrack compiled from the left-overs of Trent Reznor's previous soundtrack for The Social Network. Perhaps even more annoying are the two completely unconnected stories that take forever to intertwine and didn't spark an iota of interest in the outcome of the story or the fate of the protagonists.<br/><br/>There is Zero character development, a totally forgettable scenario combined with a a far too linear, thin and familiar plot culminating in an inescapable conclusion which all the same didn't make any sense unless the killer wanted to be caught.<br/><br/>Watching this, I had trouble resisting the urge to do the laundry.<br/><br/>3/10"

","If you are going to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film, watch the Swedish version that came out in 2009. The Swedish version is much better, with a good plot development and character development. If you go for the U.S. version expect to be bombarded by Coca-Cola and McDonald product placement. It's pathetic that U.S. audiences have to endure all this advertising. The U.S. version also seemed to add all the very violent and sexually-exploitive scene without developing the plot. The Swedish version has better suspense. Also the U.S. version did a horrible job of developing the story of Harriet. In the end I can't believe I paid money to see this movie again, as the U.S. version was truly of lesser quality than the Swedish version. Also the U.S. version was a bit less gory and sexually explicit."

","I was excited to see Finches version of this fine movie. I was extremely disappointed after watching it. The acting was good...but I must say the script treatment was not as sophisticated as the original. It seemed not as smooth as the original and a bit forced in some places to get the story to flow faster. It suffers from the same sickness as most Hollywood remakes of already good movies...the sacrifice details in favor of shock, but such is the stuff of McMovieland. Everything about the movie was acceptable and on par with the original EXCEPT for the script treatment. You remember Let the Right One In? Hollywood remade that one too and to me it sucked compared to the original. Both remakes lack the ability to emotionally connect me to the characters and their goals. A bit clinically and technically treated, as though someone was in a big hurry to capitalize on the Tattoo series' success. Shame on Hollywood."

","Watching Fincher's remake was so much like deja vu that I wondered if the director had simply employed CGI artists to superimpose American and English faces over Swedish ones. I also wondered how Hollywood gets away with this level of grotesque artistic plagiarism. Niels Arden Oplov must surely be outraged because this is more his film than Fincher's. This is a remake with absolutely no creative effort put in-except for those appallingly unnecessary and unconvincing faux-Swedish accents. Why even bother? All I can think is Fincher was under contract to make his film identical to Oplov's, but using English language."

","Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo suffers from the same inanimate feel about it as did Panic Room from 2002. And although both attempts were admirable, it does seem that Fincher needs more intricacies in the subplot and less obviousness in the screenplay than both Panic Room and the film in review had to offer. <br/><br/>As it is, the film just barely manages to make you care about a tale involving a wrongfully convicted journalist and a female hacker who looks too preposterously edgy/angry/victimized to be anywhere near believable. The multiple stories they tried to cram into one film, which probably is the fault of the source material, seems highly incompatible. Either make a film about the brutalized and haunted life of a young woman, or make a whodunit. <br/><br/>By the time the two main stories came together, I had lost all hope for the film to become less derivative and kooky. Even the soundtrack by Reznor felt completely fake as it was a mere echo of his previous work on his Oscar winning score for the Social Network. Really nothing in this film concealed the true intentions of the producers with the box office revenues in mind.<br/><br/>In this, the film is every inch as bad as The Mysterious case of Benjamin Button in which Fincher also managed to thoroughly overproduce a flimsy idea with no real interesting story behind it. It's time Fincher made a new deal with Andrew Kevin Walker and create another Se7en. Being a producer's wife is a sore waste of his amazing talents as a director.<br/><br/>51/100"
"catherine-c-powell","1","13","20","6 May 2012"," HORRIBLE movie version of the book (no big spoilers in this review)
","Enjoyed the book? You will NOT enjoy the movie. There were so many unnecessary changes and edits. First of all, the storyline was changed and watered down. You never really get a feel for how important the research is that Blomvkist is doing, or rather how important it becomes to him and to Salander. You don't get a feel for what life was like for Blomvkist in Hedestat, especially in regards to the relationships he built while he was there (namely Cecelia). The ending is very different from the book and SO boring in comparison. Also, the sequence of events was changed, all of them pointless changes. Also, there was no depth to the whole Wennerstrom affair, so the beginning just seemed random.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are not like the characters in the book. They changed the personalities of Dirch, Harald, and even Salander. Dirch was rude and unfriendly; Harald come off somewhat pleasant instead of mean, rude, and insane; and they did not make Salander rude or antisocial enough, which was one of my biggest disappointments. In the movie she actually delivers an apology for something, which I found extremely disappointing as that completely goes against her character, Salander is not an apologetic person. She does what she does and doesn't give a damn what anyone thinks. Blomkvist's relationship with Berger, and even with Millennium, was was not prominent enough in the movie. His ""romance"" with Salander seemed completely forced and extremely weird since Salander seems so obviously not to be Blomvkist's type.<br/><br/>So much was edited from the book that would have rounded out the characters and made the movie flow and easier to follow. The movie barely scratched the surface of the characters and their relationships to one another. The editing was choppy it always seemed like something was missing.<br/><br/>The ONE highlight, which actually wasn't even in the book had to do with Salander and Advoket Bjurman. That part was actually a good addition, and funny. Salander rocks.<br/><br/>In closing, it seems like those involved really did not take time or care in telling the story. I just finished the book so everything was fresh in my mind, and needless to say that I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I fell asleep almost a dozen times because I grew so irritated while watching and then my irritation grew to boredom. The movie does the book NO justice, it's actually insulting. Why turn the book into a movie and make so many changes? I've heard that there is a foreign movie version that is much better, but I don't know how to get my hands on a copy.<br/><br/>(A MUCH better job has been done with the Twilight series; those movies are exactly like the books, which I knew fans of the book really appreciate.)"

","Disappointment<br/><br/>Well, first of all, I didn't expect too much but, still, with the rating that higher then the Swedish version, I was surprised of how mediocre American version was. I was disappointed by almost every aspect of the movie. Even with the photography. As English is not my first language, I'll be brief. Craig ‚Äì better than I expected, yet too polished. Nyqvist was so much more convincing¬Ö Mara ‚Äì boring, with just two tones of voice through entire movie. I suppose, this monotony should convince us that she was cold and unattached, appearance ‚Äì OK. For me, Rapace was Lisbeth. Skarsgard ‚Äì exceptional Storyline ‚Äì didn't like the changes (compared to the book) and hated the rhythm as it kept too many details from the book; as a result, the movie looked like a photo album, hopping from one picture to another in fast pace.

"bassrourke","9","64","123","13 December 2011"," A Better version, don't mention the 'DIFFERENT' ending
","Not long out of a screening and I am still thinking about this English language version of the mega popular Swedish Millennium films GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST derived from the brilliant bestsellers. Purists may be up in arms, but think outside the box, what I witnessed was an almost perfect movie.It does, however, have an ending that will divide the audience, different from the foreign version but good enough for me to want to see the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. Anyhow all I will say is you will not be bored in the 2.5 hrs of grim proceedings. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice as the journalist Mikael Blomkvist disgraced for libel but takes on a memoir writing case to escape, only to be drawn into a web of secrets and family weirdness. His new partner is all the talk and so she should be. Rooney Mara I predicted big things from the second I saw her in Youth in Revolt and she carried the otherwise ordinary Elm Street remake long before her cameo in Social Network. She's also very good looking, holds her poise, strikes like a cobra and walks with complexities unknown to the common man. Christopher Plummer, Steven Berkoff and Robin Wright are unique fillers on screen but not as effective as the great Stellan Skarsgard who is despicable to the point of exhaustion. Mara is a standout as the tough motorcycle riding computer hacker with a actual heart, Lisbeth Salander. Magnificent shock tactics are not overblown as Lisbeth carries out proceedings on a dark missing persons case. Original scenes have been lifted from the source, but tweaked. The music is a standout, typical Direction magic from David Fincher seals the deal to make thus unmissable. GIVE ROONEY MARA an Oscar nomination please, she engulfs Salander as did Noomi Rapace."
"Meven_Stoffat","3","29","51","24 December 2011"," Wasted potential
","For those of you who have been out of the loop re the Millennium series recently, it was announced as far back as January 2010 that Fincher would be attached to the American Dragon Tattoo film. This sparked a mixed reaction, from people who even love Fincher like there's no tomorrow. Well, it looks like people are still high off their wankery over The Social Network, another mediocre and spectacularly overrated movie. So it seems obvious the circle jerk would continue in the wake of the recent Dragon Tattoo adaptation.<br/><br/>Problem is, there seems to be Two David Finchers. The one who made amazing movies Like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Zodiac. Then there's the Fincher who gave us the horrid Benjamin Button, the overrated above mentioned Social Network, and now this.<br/><br/>Thing is, I for one wasn't too opposed the idea of an English language adaptation. I mean, sure it wouldn't be as authentic as the original Swedish version, nor the book. But it could still work. Craig still had the face and Mara has very striking facial features. Reznor has a unique way of scoring a film, and Fincher has a great eye for a shot, hell, he practically made a whole career our of that kind of thing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the Swedish movie. And here's why.<br/><br/>The Swedish movie does a good job at staying close to the source material, however, it doesn't just mindlessly piggyback off of the source material- it perfectly balanced everything out. Those who haven't read the book would be able to follow it and find it entertaining. It took its time too- it had a nice, steady, easy going pace. It was 2.5 hours, but the movie was so interesting, it went by fast and you couldn't tell.<br/><br/>The Yank version is pretty much an exact adaptation of the book, yes. Pretty much 98% of the book was in the movie. That's NOT a good thing; to me it came off as nothing more than desperate to please the fans. It was like Zallian said ""Alright, we have to mindlessly piggyback the book. I'm super scared of pissing the fans off, and so let's not edit anything down. There is no such thing as 'What may work on page doesn't necessarily work on film.'"". Except... there is.<br/><br/>Let me explain why.<br/><br/>Niels' film showed RESTRAINT and SUBTLETY, the two things this film lacked. It focused more on the characters than every single tiny little plot device of the book. This film felt rushed and blew its way through everything. For example, the opening scene. In Niels' film, it's very powerful. The way he looks at the plant then breaks down is simply... stunning. Here? We got a half assed phone call and a shot of the plant.<br/><br/>The opening credits, however, are class. Pointless, overly flashy and a bit gimmicky? Yes, but class, and the images fit very nicely over the Immigrant Song. I loved the shout outs to the sequels too.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it stops there, the writer Zallian is so obsessed with capturing every event that he senselessly skips over CHARACTER DETAILS!!!!! We get no hint to the fact that Lisbeth is possibly autistic. Instead we get a scenery chewing girl who we want to punch in the face every time we see her. The whole libel thing goes over our heads completely too.<br/><br/>And that's just the beginning.<br/><br/>Several of the scenes are over before they even begin. It's frustrating. The rape scene was underwhelming even. In the book it was a disturbing and powerful scene. Here it's just a ""lol wut"" moment.<br/><br/>As for the acting. Noomi Rapace simply cannot be replaced. She played Lisbeth exactly how the books describe her. Tough as nails, arrogant, and dangerous to herself, but with an air of special childlike innocence. Mara? She confuses good acting for chewing the scenery. She always glares and says every line like someone asked her the square root of an insanely large number. Nyqvist not only played Blomkvist just like Larsson wrote him, but he also LOOKED like the book described. Here, Craig just seems to be stuck in his Bond phase. Nothing special whatsoever.<br/><br/>Also, for parts 2 and 3, someone needs to hire a better dialect coach. I lost count of all the times they went from American to British to a Europeanoid accent. What a joke.<br/><br/>I wish I could recommend this, but it's a big mess. Avoid if you haven't watched the Swedish and just watch that instead.<br/><br/>Fincher, thou hast ruined Lisbeth Salander for me."

","I will start out writing that I never read the books or watched the original movie. I'm writing this based just on the film that was presented and nothing else. That being stated, this film was a tedious, convoluted mess of nonsense, graphic rape-torture, and mostly stereotyped uninspired casting.<br/><br/>I am not going to give a detailed synopsis, you can get that elsewhere. All I will say is the plot has something to do with an industrialist who hires Daniel Craig to find out who killed his niece. <br/><br/>The graphic rape-torture scenes make you feel like you are watching a snuff film. The casting of the rapist was almost laughable. A fat, creepy looking Yorick van Wageningen plays the rapist. The reality is rapists look like everyone else. I'm surprised he did not have an eye patch and a scar on his face. <br/><br/>Another point, what predator (Wageningen) would pick a would be victim who he knows has a history of unpredictability, violence, and works for a security company!

"loco_73","Null","15","24","10 May 2012"," Oh Fincher...why oh why???
","David Fincher is for me one of my favourite directors around. Gems like ""Seven"", ""Zodiac"" and established favourites like ""Fight Club"", ""The Social Network"" (probably one of the most relevant movies in the past couple of years), have confirmed his movie-making capabilities! So, I was surprised when it was announced that Stieg Larsen's ""The Millennium Trilogy"", comprising of ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" and ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" was going to be re-made, barely two years after the Swedish adaptation of the movies had been filmed and released worldwide to great critical and financial success. I was even more surprised that Fincher had agreed to helm such ""revival"".<br/><br/>From the beginning this whole endeavour seemed more than fishy, it reeked of desperation, something which speaks to Hollywood's current predicament to find material fit for screen. The situation must be really bad if they can't even wait a few more years before cannibalizing a trilogy of movies that was literally just released.<br/><br/>Hollywood's risk aversion to new material, original ideas and concepts, is breathtaking in its stupidity and narrow-mindedness, and crippling to its creativity and longevity. If it wants to continue surviving, Hollywood needs to invest in a greater variety of movies, not only blockbusters with superheroes, natural disasters and alien invasions! <br/><br/>I went to see the movie, against my better judgement, only because I really like Fincher. Was I disappointed? No not at all! What I was...I was utterly indifferent to the movie! Fincher succeeds in all the technical aspects of the movie with his usual talent and vision. Besides Rooney Mara and Christopher Plummer the rest of the cast is easily forgettable and even sub-par when compared to the actors in the Swedish movies. Now, though Rooney Mara did a good job, I do not wish to overstate her acting job. Noomy Rapace absolutely OWNS Lisbeth Salander, she IS that character...I'm sorry but Mara's portrayal couldn't hold a candle to Rapace's. Michael Nyqvist, the actor who plays the lead as Michael Bloomqvist, leaves Daniel Craig in the dust...<br/><br/>I know this probably won't be a very popular view of this adaptation, but I'm sorry, my biggest problem with this movie was the fact that the American version wasn't really needed. It does not add anything new to the story that has already been told, there are no new angles or revelations. Except a few tweaks here and there, and Rooney's more domesticated Salander, this movie is pretty much a high-class, and pretty expensive, study in irrelevance!"

","I haven't read the books, I have watched the original Swedish trilogy, and I've read with interest many of the reviews here.<br/><br/>It comes down to this: the Tattoo. It doesn't appear for long in either version, so pay attention, but it says everything about the movie: The Swedish version was a huge dark scary beast with its claws ripping out of Lisbeth's flesh. Pain and anger and danger and defiance, all there.<br/><br/>The US remake was more like: She's down at the Tattoo Parlour - I want a tattoo, what's in the catalog? Maybe a butterfly. Oh, that dragon looks alright, let's have it.<br/><br/>Or more to the point, the people with the job of supplying the tattoo for this movie pulled out Dragon#3 from the nearest catalog of temporary tattoo decals.<br/><br/>While at the same time everyone else on the movie did a good, solid, workmanlike and uninspired job of the whole thing. They did to the character of Lisbeth what the artists did to the tattoo - watered it down, weakened it, trivialized it.<br/><br/>So, despite the content - replayed quite closely - the result hasn't got the punch.<br/><br/>Two examples (here's the Spoilers, spoilers for both versions so stop now if you haven't seen both):<br/><br/>************ SPOILERS ******************** The final chase, and the killer's demise. Lisbeth asks ""Can I kill him?"" No way, that's way out of character. And when he crashes, there's the Hollywood Car Crash Instant Explosion instead of the major plot point where she has the opportunity to rescue him, but instead chooses to stand and watch him burn. Which of course ties into her backstory (which is much understated in the US version).<br/><br/>And lastly - she buys the guy an expensive gift, then chucks it in a dumpster when she sees him with The Other Woman. Please..... That's so out of character. Much better the original, where her parting shot is the Gift of all the information he needs to nail his nemesis, and a rapid, shy, don't-look-back departure.<br/><br/>Perhaps Hollywood will remake Butch & Sundance with the final scene changed so they crawl out thru the drains or something, cut to kangaroos in the sunset...<br/><br/>Or Patrick Swayze washes ashore in New Zealand...."

","I wish that I could write up a long review elaborately explaining the things that I disliked about this film, but honestly it just comes down to the fact that I found it very dull. There's a little stretch in the middle where I was mildly interested by it, but the large majority was just a tedious experience for me. I wasn't on board with the tone that David Fincher was trying to achieve, mostly because I felt that there was no tone to it. I don't really understand what happened here, but it honestly felt like there wasn't a shred of enthusiasm from anyone involved. It felt like none of them really wanted to be there and they were just phoning it in.<br/><br/>I'm a pretty large Fincher fan and was devastated by the utter lack of innovative style here. Even in his big misses like Panic Room, he's always been a director who can at least make things look good even if the overall product isn't so much, but here I didn't feel any of Fincher's technical prowess on display. The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whose work in Social Network I loved in it's unconventional appropriateness, felt totally out of place here and really grated on me quickly.<br/><br/>With that slick, well-designed opening credits sequence accompanied by the very impressive cover of ""Immigrant Song"", I thought this was going to be a pretty exhilarating journey but two hours and forty minutes later I realized that those opening credits were the best thing about the film. For me, it was just an uninvolved exercise in needlessness. I thought that Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara had a decent bit of chemistry together as actors, which made their few scenes together slightly less unbearable, but Mara's performance as a whole is one of the big disappointments of the year. It was all visuals with no soul.<br/><br/>Mara made the part look right but that's all she did; it's an impressively aesthetic work with nothing going on underneath. Perhaps she's just not an experienced enough actor yet, because on a technical level she did everything right but she didn't let the character breathe at all. She focused too much on getting all of the appearances right, but wasn't capable of truly sinking into the character beyond that. Overall it's pretty firm in it's standing as the biggest disappointment of the year for me. There was nothing offensively bad about it, but nothing to praise or really remember either (except maybe Daniel Craig's wardrobe, which was excellent). I feel like by tomorrow I'll have completely forgotten about it, which will be a blessing."

"adrongardner","6","19","32","23 December 2011"," Merely sufficient
","Plain and simple, without Lisbeth Salander, the book would be on the bottom shelf next to the $.99 value bin at Wal-Mart. The writing is sloppy, sensationalist and the story largely predictable, on top of that at least 200 pages of fluff. Even Lisbeth Salander, an abused hacker, bike riding, 88 pound ass-kicking badass is the product of massive lonely male goth fantasy. One gets the feeling Larsson stole the heroine from Peter H√∏eg's Smilla's Sense of Snow and then punked her out. Agatha Christie has at least a dozen books better than these.<br/><br/>So having read all the books years ago, the story itself really never did anything for me. It's really all about Salander. Fincher did a competent if procedural job. The main complaint here is he rushes through the flat pages of dialog with no pause or rhythm at all. Many scenes involve the actors simply going through motions reciting their memorized lines with few touches of humanity. <br/><br/>Neither movie is more than a cheap Saturday scare and to sum it up, put the cast from the Swedish film in one directed by Fincher and you've got the real deal. The most telling contrast in both movies that show where they stand is in the scene where Salander and Blomkvist are lying in bed toward the end and the writer muses to his ass kicking hacker about what she has been through. In one movie, the scene is quiet and human and the other movie, it's simply filler to the next scene. I fault Steve Zaillian's simplistic screenplay more than anything else. The Swedish one wisely compresses and simplifies many of the novels blatant flaws, while the Gringo version keeps all the boring warts.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara does a good, if robotic job playing Larsen's motorcycle driving Goth, hacker, sex pot, but I kept looking for the one and only Noomi Rapace at every turn. Hard act to follow. Either in writing or how she was directed, Mara's Salander plays more of a young girl in love with older man, than the distant cautious (and damaged) Salander of Rapace - which is rightly or wrongly, more in line with the book and frankly more realistic. i'm not taking anything away from Rooney Mara's work, she was brave and really good. I just prefer Noomi Rapace's interpretation.<br/><br/>Also WTF? with the James Bond intro? Wrong movie Fincher...Is Daniel Craigvrequiring this in his contracts now?"

","As much as i respect, and in fact appreciate David Fincher's work, this film was really disappointing.<br/><br/>This film is disrespectful to the people from Scandinavia who really did a great job with the adaptation of Stieg Larsson's books. And disappointing because i expected a different and necessary adaptation, once this is a film made shortly after the Scandinavian.<br/><br/>Excellent interpretations from almost everyone in an extraordinary cast. But scene after scene, the feeling of d√©j√† vu is intense and unfortunately accurate. All the key scenes are desperately similar to the ""older"" film.<br/><br/>If there wasn't the other film, this would be a masterpiece."
"sddavis63","3","12","19","22 February 2012"," Fine Performance From Rooney Mara In A Strangely Incoherent Movie
","The highlight of this film is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Lisbeth is an investigator who gets involved in what becomes a serial murder mystery from many years before. Lisbeth is a complex character. She's troubled and mysterious, deeply vulnerable and yet surprisingly strong at the same time; qualities all brought out effectively by her appearance (strange hair styles and multiple piercings) and by an often distant look about her - a sort of detachment perhaps quite believable for a character with her history. Mara captured the contradictions of the character perfectly. Although I have to admit that I wasn't that taken with the movie as a whole, I was drawn to Lisbeth; I cared about her. I hurt when she hurt. The scenes between Lisbeth and Nils (Yorick van Waginingen) - both those in which she was being abused and the scene in which she took her revenge (and even the brief later scene in the elevator) - were powerful and disturbing. I've not felt that attached to a character in a long while, so kudos to Mara for drawing out such a reaction - especially since, as I said, she managed to do it in a movie that just didn't appeal to me very much.<br/><br/>The overall story was not unlike the character of Lisbeth - strange and confusing and complex and mysterious, but on the whole it failed to connect with me in the way the character of Lisbeth did. And, as much as I was drawn to the character, part of the problem with the story was that so much of it revolved around Lisbeth. The rape/revenge scenes may have been powerful and disturbing, but they didn't really seem to connect that well with the main point of the movie, which was the search for the serial killer's identity, and the one victim of Harriet in particular. To me, it seemed almost as if director David Fincher realized that the story he was telling was almost totally lacking in coherence. That basic incoherence (or even unattractiveness) was well summed up by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Speaking with Mikael (Daniel Craig) - who he's asked to look into the disappearance of his niece Harriet many years before - he explains the bewildering nature of his relatives (a bunch consisting of some Nazis and neo-Nazis and some who won't speak to them because they're Nazis and neo-Nazis) and when Mikael tells him that he's having trouble keeping everything straight, Henrik responds, ""Soon you'll know us all too well, with my apologies."" A point for honesty I guess. There's little in this story or in its characters that's either pleasant or attractive so Fincher seems to have chosen to over-emphasize Lisbeth's troubles (the one strong part of the script) - the problem being that this one strong part of the script wasn't essential to the story. Very strange to me.<br/><br/>In any event, the movie really lost me right from the start with a bizarre opening sequences and musical score that lasted far, far too long, and it never really drew me consistently back in. Kudos to Rooney Mara for a fine performance, but the movie overall was quite lacking. (3/10)"

","Huge spoiler alerts by the way so tread cautiously. I also had to re-write this because I'm only allowed a max of 1000 words. If you didn't read the books, you won't understand what's going on and why and if you did read the books this movie will only annoy the living hell out of you. The Lisbeth Salander character was stripped down so badly that I didn't recognize what Fincher or anyone was going for. Her physical demeanor was just plain wrong to the point of skittish. The most offensive part is they didn't build her up to be a girl/woman who's been through way more than most, and is obviously a fighter, and then attacked by her second guardian, they just said, here's a weird looking chick and while we're at it here's a rape scene that we could of just left with the idea when the door closed because everyone knew that was going to happen, no we'll just show the whole thing. The first 10 minutes of the movie was just a huge ""What the hell is this?!"". The<br/><br/>The Mikael Blomkvist character was bland, charmless and just seemed like a guy being led around by his nose the entire time. Not one ounce of drive came out of him that should have been there. He was a pointless lump. Also, somehow they attempted to cram the first two books into one movie. Huge mistake they left so much plot out doing it, the movie just looked like a series of 5 to 10 minute unattached movie scenes. Martin Vanger didn't have an accident, he killed himself. Mikael never went into Martins house he was brought into it buy gun point. Lisbeth never told anyone she was insane, never told Mikael herself that she had a guardian or burned her father. Harriet was never under everyone's nose during the entire book. Mikael actually had a weird relationship with one of the Vanger women, instead that plot point just went to hell.<br/><br/>This movie is so far off the reservation from the books and characters that I just sat there realizing that if I hadn't read the books I would have no clue what was going on. Because I read the books I was so unabashedly horrified by what was done to the books I couldn't believe it. If Fincher and the writers were going for an art film to put out for new adults with no attention spans, mission accomplished. If they actually meant for anyone that read the books to care about the characters, they must have been off somewhere patting themselves on the back having a sandwich. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone even if the movie was a ""loose take"" of the books, if it was just a good movie in and of itself, but it wasn't. As a movie alone and as a movie based on the books, it's terrible. No character development, the plot was lost in clips. I'm just going to tell people to read the books and don't bother wasting your time on the movie until it's free on cable because at least you can turn it off and not feel cheated."

","Had I not read the 3 books and seen the Swedish releases I would not have understood the plot. Much of the audio was inaudible mumbling. Important plot elements were changed and/or omitted: jail time; first contact between the principals Mikael and Lisbeth; the coterie of fellow hackers; finding Wennerstrom and giving his location to his criminal associates; putting the missing woman in London -- where it is implausible that she would have escaped discovery -- instead of Australia. <br/><br/>The trail of evidence -- the real genius of Larsson's book -- was given short shrift, much neither shown and even more not explained. This story is about ""Men Who Hate Women"" (Swedish Title) two generations of homicidal Swedish Neo-NAZI misogynists. Almost all of that was left out.<br/><br/>Much of the sex was gratuitous, unnecessary to the plot and more like HBO soft porn. The movie should have been X-rated. Even more detrimental was the total shift of focus from Neo-NAZI misogyny to action scenes, with the protagonists ""responding"" -- in the police sense -- to invisible stimuli. <br/><br/>If the film editing were responsible for the inclusion of so much sex and the omission of the evidentiary links, then the Academy Award was a stupid mistake. <br/><br/>Ms. Mara did an adequate job as Lisbeth, but often did not let her native intelligence show through. It may have been poor direction, but she seemed to be without a center, displaying relaxed charm and social poise in some scenes after appearing wooden and autistic in others. Ms. Rapace, in the Swedish release, presented a more coherent, more irritating character. <br/><br/>Dragon Tattoo (2011) is a sex and action film created to exploit a hugely successful Swedish novel and film. Unfortunately, in its execution, most of what you get is a little low-grade porn. Watching Tattoo (2011) was in no way an uplifting experience. Thank goodness the film fared so poorly at the box office that the butchery will end here and no sequels will ensue."
"Einarr01","1","17","29","18 March 2012"," A disgrace - go for the original
","I was quite enthusiastic about seeing this title, thinking that Hollywood did make a successful remake this time around. God I was so terribly wrong. The movie starts with an intro in an extremely trying-to-look-artsy way, that is so much more than simply boring, than it shouts ""uninspired"". Yet I sat back, thinking that I haven't seen the real thing yet, thus I must not be all that critical from the beginning. What a mistake. As usual for an American remake, this one is not an exception. The acting by both Craig and Mara was extremely uninspired, just like the intro of the movie, that I mentioned above. I must admit that they did make the effort to actually go and shoot the ""thing"", meaning the movie in Sweden (yet I failed to understand why did they show the Swedish news in English though). Apart from that Craig looks kind of lost in his part, while Mara's way of recreating Lisbeth was so, so plain. Overall the movie was a huge disappointment for me, yet so boring, I did even fall asleep, right before the hours-mark, when I actually stopped even bothering myself watching it further more. If you did like the novel, or have somehow heard nice things about the original( or even about the remake) just try not torturing yourself with it, but instead go for the real thing. Rapace does pull off an Award winning performance in the original, while the whole movie itself is not to be even compared to the remake whatsoever."
"antontjechov","1","16","27","19 June 2012"," A very boring and very unnecessary remake
","I can't see any reason why David Fincher decided to make a remake of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", because the original from 2009 is an excellent movie with lots of action, a great story and actors who really knows what they're doing. I wish I could say the same about this version, but Finchers version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is just very boring and tedious - and I think the actors seriously should start thinking about changing career! Not even the good actors (Robin Wright and Stellan Skarsg√•rd) gives any great performances like they normally do! <br/><br/>When I first heard they were going to do a remake of the 2009 film, I thought that it might be good - maybe even better than the original. But I was wrong. The original is much better and it's a movie I would ratter watch than this one."
"AlukardsCastle","10","37","71","18 December 2011"," Pure Fincher. Great adaption.
","Anyone who knows David Finchers work knows he is one of the most creative and talented directors of this generation. He blew everyones mind with his adaption of 'Fight Club' almost 15 years ago, and again with his masterpiece of a film 'Se7en'. Speaking of Se7en, this is probably Finchers best effort since that film. All of his movies are amazing in their own respect, but this one will be one of the films that everyone will remember him for. The opening titles use Trent Reznors(amazing man from the one man band Nine Inch Nails)reinvented version of Led Zeppelins 'Immigrant Song' with Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer on vocals (I think?). This will remind many people of Se7ens creepy beginning. One more comparison to Se7en, is the forensic CSI type detective work done throughout the film. Truly a great homage to himself.<br/><br/>Now like many have said, this is not a remake. This is an adaption of a book. I kind of dislike when people get those two mixed up. If I adapted Bram Stokers Dracula into a film, would it be a remake of the hundreds of previous Dracula movie attempts? I digress.<br/><br/>David Finchers version sticks closer to the novel than the Swedish version did. I do however love the Swedish version and didn't think I would love an American version more, which I do. There were only two American directors I would have voted for the job, and they were David Fincher or Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Now for everyone thinking this is a Hollywood adaption and that all of the rawness of the Swedish version is toned down then they couldn't be more wrong. This is at times more raunchy and sadistic than the Swedish version. It is even slightly longer since it incorporates more from the book. There are more sex scenes (for the people who didn't read the book and like that kind of thing in a movie). There is a lot of detailed smart and important dialog. Most of the film relies on the talking and conversations between the characters. Many will find this boring, but dare I compare it to Se7en again? Yeah its like that. The actors and actresses do a nice job and are all believable. Daniel Craig pulled off the role perfectly. If you think about it, he kinda looks like the actor that played in the Swedish version. Rooney Mara made art with her performance as the now infamous Lisbeth Salander. I didn't think anybody could beat the performance from Noomi Rapace from the Swedish version. Both were amazing but Rooney slightly surpassed Noomis performance. I just hope she can work with it again in the next films of the series. Rooney has already gotten Golden Globe recognition and I hope to see her name at the Oscars. I hope this movie gets recognized with the directing at the Academy too. The visual style of this movie is pure eye candy movie art. The Cinematography is also worth mentioning. Even if you haven't read the book or haven't seen the Swedish version, this film is a near masterpiece.<br/><br/>The rape scene is there and it is as vulgar and uncomfortable as ever. It will surely have trouble staying in some theaters because of some of the nastier and darker graphic scenes. The way a lot of the grotesque makes you have to use your imagination is also used. This movie will make you think and hate people that abuse women or any type of helpless human being. Many people will walk out on the abusive scene. It is definitely one of the most graphic scenes being released in wide release in the U.S.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a great adaption that stays true to the novel and doesn't use gimmicks to make money. It is raw and realistic. I ask that if you haven't read the book and have the spare time that you use it to read the book. I'm not saying to let it get in the way of your life, but it truly is an experience worth it."

","My wife and I had read all three books, and saw all three Swedish movies. We had been so excited about the new ""Hollywood"" movie, and went to the Tuesday night first showing. <br/><br/>The opening credits, while very unusual and visual, were totally unrelated to the movie. If anything, it was disruptive, and like watching the credits of a James Bond movie. <br/><br/>Having watched the sub-titled Swedish movies, we were looking forward to the English version. However, so much of the dialog in this movie is spoken so softly or mumbled, covered with intrusive background music (or noise!), such that we were wishing for sub-titles in this one! Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara have perfected talking without moving one's lips.<br/><br/>The story was not nearly as well explained as in the Swedish movies. If one has not read the book, I daresay he will feel very clueless as to what happened to Mikael at the beginning, and will struggle to understand what is happening.<br/><br/>Our theater was packed for the opening show. I found it interesting that when it was over, the crowd simply got up and left, without the kind of excited conversations one hears when people have loved the movie. I sense that most of our audience shared our feelings....what was the point of making this movie, when such a wonderful movie had already been done."

I have quite liked the book; unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the film. The first thing which really annoyed me was the fake Swedish accent. It was horrible and it made me switch on the subtitles. I know that it is impossible to have in the film everything that was in the book; however, some very important things were left out. As a result, Mikael & Lisbeth look rather shallow. They are there, they do things but the viewers do not really know why. Actually, just like all the other characters. Also, some things were completely different from the book (not just slightly) and it did not help the film. I do not understand how this film got such good reviews. I just hope the Swedish version is better. Although, now, I'm not quite sure I want to watch it."
"alex703","6","19","34","21 December 2011"," A bit disappointed in Fincher
","Coming into ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", I had not read the book nor had I seen any of the Swedish movies. However, I had seen almost all of director David Fincher's movies, and I was excited after his last two, ""Zodiac"" and ""The Social Network"" thrilled me.<br/><br/>However, this movie does not quite live up to those standards. The story, a reworking of Steig Larsson's original book, involves Mikael Blomqvist, a journalist who has recently been found guilty of libel (Daniel Craig) and who is looking to escape the public eye and reinvent himself. Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a sickly old man who lives on an island in northern Sweden, seeks out Mikael's services in an attempt to unravel his family's past and solve a murder.<br/><br/>At the same time, Lisbeth Salander's (Rooney Mara) caretaker has recently had a stroke and she is switched to another one, named Bjurman, who repeatedly takes advantage of her when she asks for money. Don't worry, he gets his come-uppins. Eventually, she teams up with Mikael to solve the mystery and his personal life.<br/><br/>Mara does the character justice for the most part (although there were times where I thought her tenacity did not match that of the acts she was performing), but I take issue with how her character was presented. Without knowing more about her background, I had trouble caring when bad things happened to her. In addition, the viewer never doubts that she is going to succeed eventually in everything Salander undertakes, and so does not care all that much when bad things happen to her before those successes.<br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed Craig portraying a decadent, down-and-out Mikael. His use of deadpan, self-depreciating humor is excellent, although he is occasionally made to look a bit too incompetent in the scenes he shares with Salander. All of Craig's actions, from his incessant coffee-making to the way he sucks on his cigarettes, help create an image of Mikael that the viewer sympathizes with and wants to help. Well done.<br/><br/>The main problem with ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"", then is the story. Fincher does his best to gussy it up, with some fantastic shots of Sweden making it seem as if something or someone is always lurking around the corner. Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor do a brilliant job as well, and the use of sound was by far my favorite part of the film. However, neither of these details stops the story from being clunky and a bit bland. After getting almost nowhere for about half the movie, the second Mikael teams up with Salander, suddenly everything seems to fall into place, her incredible Google-search skills teaming with his ability to ask questions leading them to the villain relatively quickly.<br/><br/>It would have been quicker, however, if they didn't stop to have sex every two scenes. I have nothing against sex scenes, but this one is so out of the blue and against what Salander's ethical makeup had been up until that point, that the viewer almost feels deceived. It felt as if the movie had to fulfill some sort of heterosexual sex quota, character development and plot be damned!<br/><br/>Mikael finds the killer (well, sort of), Martin Vanger (an excellent Stellan Skarsgard), who, in typical bad guy fashion, talks to Mikael instead of murdering him, giving a speech that actually would have been brilliant if he had followed through afterwards. However, the speech gives Salander enough time to solve the mystery on her own and save the day. Woo.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is much to like about this movie. The acting is quite good, and there are the usual Fincher-ian touches that make it more than just the average thriller. However, it hits so many pit-falls, both in terms of plot and in terms of characterization, that it is just barely more (than average)."

There seems to have been a deliberate attempt to mislead Bond f ans into watching this. The title sounds like a Bond movie (its very different to the original book title)and the title sequence is like something out of a Bond movie. Actually the title sequence for this is far better than those of the last few Bond movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately after the titles it deteriorates quite rapidly. The early parts of the film are tedious and seem to take forever.The character played by Daniel Craig looks terrible. He is too old to wear trendy ""fashion victim"" type clothes. he looks far better in tailored clothing like the suits in Casino Royale or the beginning of Dream House.<br/><br/>Its difficult to comment on the story. Its basically a murder mystery that I didn't care if it was solved. The running time is too long and the film should have ended before it did.

Just as you might suspect, it's a sick book, in which vile and sickening violence against women (and men!) is wrapped in a thoroughly ridiculous whodunnit. <br/><br/>I can understand that the book's American publisher did not think the original title would sell very well, so it was changed to something which, outside of the book itself, has no significance whatsoever. <br/><br/>The title change also attempts to change the focus of the book. In Sweden, the book was about men who not only hate women, but about men who hate women so much that just killing them is not enough. In America, the focus turns to a geeky girl who rides a motorbike and uses computers, not knives, to hack her way through complex crimes. <br/><br/>The whole Vanger family thing was overdone. I kept visualizing Saturday Night Live doing a parody of this book. A door opens and it's the 2nd cousin once removed and his 3 children.

The noise, so called music, distract from the dialog, making it impossible to hear in some instances. Evidently actors no longer find it necessary to speak distinctly. Surely they weren't taught that in their training. It has become the norm to mumble, and slur words,particularly when speaking softly. Scenes with ""whispering"" are totally incoherent. A few years ago we attended the holiday concert of a 200 +/- man chorus in Boston. One of the pieces was totally pianissimo. You could understand every word.

"locatejp","6","13","22","31 January 2012"," Disappointing in comparison to original
","My wife and I went to see this movie recently, having thoroughly enjoyed the original, but it didn't really stack up very well. First of all, casting an action actor like Daniel Craig in the male lead was unbelievable. In the original, Micke is fairly awkward and Lisbeth is constantly having to bail him out of situations. He is a highly competent detective, but a bit of a nerd when it comes to physical activity.<br/><br/>However, the two main draw backs for this film were the way Lisbeth is portrayed and the fairly wooden and contrived acting throughout. Lisbeth, in the original movies, is a strong, independent and emotionally withdrawn character. She is also quite hard to like, especially in the first film. In this remake, we hardly see her for the first hour and Micke ends up doing most of the detective work himself, whereas Lisbeth actually played a much bigger role, which is pivotal to the plot in the next 2 movies. The remake also implies that Lisbeth acted out of necessity, not out of malice towards certain characters, but her character is not that nice! She hates men who hurt women and goes out of her way to humiliate them. This, again, is essential to her character, especially for the final movie. The remake also develops the relationship between the protagonists too conventionally. In the original, it was a lot less easy for them to trust each other, and Micke actually didn't approve of a lot of Lisbeth's behaviour, whereas he seems to condone it in the remake.<br/><br/>It seems that for the American market to like this film, it had to be sanitised and Lisbeth had to be a bit more clich√© and a bit less flawed. Micke also had to be a bit tougher and more masculine. However, one of the great things about the original is that it it turns gender roles on their heads and allows the strongest character to be a woman. Sadly, this remake has reverted to the Hollywood rule that female leads should always be weaker than and subservient to their male counterparts. <br/><br/>Verdict: a well made film with strong visuals, let down by poor characterisation and screenplay, as well as fairly wooden performances."
"mirwais-orbit","4","12","20","31 January 2012"," Disappointed
","As I expected: David Fincher's American version is cleaner than Niels Arden Oplev's Swedish version, and that's the huge difference between them, also that's the huge difference between what is produced in Hollywood from what is produced outside Hollywood.<br/><br/>My review is ONLY about the movie itself and not as an adaptation, so doesn't matter for me right now which one is more faithful to the book or not, but instead, which one of them has a better development since both are using exactly the same source.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this is not an occasion like Capote (2005) and Infamous (2006), I mean, the same story but with open possibilities for several point of views. This is just and only another disposable product like dozen of others Hollywood adaptations of much better foreign movies.<br/><br/>I do admire David Fincher, really. He did amazing works that became references. He gave another dimension to a genre that was stuck, he kinda recreated the serial killer genre formula and the word ""suspense"" got another depth in movies such as Se7en (1995), Fight Club (1999) and Panic Room (2002), movies that had become responsible for some changes about the way thrillers are produced since then.<br/><br/>Making an American version of Stieg Larsson's novel (or maybe a remake of Niels Oplev's Swedish version) seems a little vain in Fincher's hands. There are no big differences in the story development between both movies, but there are huge technical differences. You can't avoid comparisons because this is not just a low budget Swedish movie versus Hollywood production, this is all about art. In one hand you have a Swedish movie that, despite its low budget, is a part of a successful well written, produced and directed trilogy. And in the other hand you have just an expensive sugar water.<br/><br/>Swedish version was not afraid to be shocking, and as I said before, American version is cleaner, softer and also more didactic, truly a version made for those ones who do not like think too much while watching a complex movie, as another one said ""Hollywood dumbs things down, making everything transparent and easily digestible for 10 year-olds"". Swedish version is a lot more crafted and demonstrates interest only for the most important facts that were efficiently tied from the beginning to the end in a full circle story that flows without efforts in an amazing script, a very timed edition and a direction that understood perfectly its source and what to do. Also the acting, Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig did a great job. Both are the closest we could get of Lisbeth and Mikael if Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist never existed. Rapace and Nyqvist shows a chemistry that never happens between Craig and Mara.<br/><br/>Fincher's opening is an extremely, incredibly and unnecessary loud thing. He stated that the opening is just an expression of what happens inside Lisbeth mind. That makes sense, it's effective and an amazing music video for Trent Reznor and Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Imigrant Song"", but for me it was just a way to complement and excuse audience for the lack of shocking audacity, roughness and realism of the character that was so well explored in Swedish version. Even her tattoo seems softer, or better saying: forgettable.<br/><br/>Fincher also stated several times that he did not watched Niels Oplev's version. There are scenes so similar between both movies that call them IDENTICAL wouldn't sound entirely an offense. Seems that Fincher did some changes here and there just to say it's different and call it his own. So let's believe that what he stated is true, in that case he should have watched Swedish version before just to figure out how this movie should have been made.<br/><br/>While Oplev's version is suspenseful and holds your attention from the beginning to the end, events and subplots are tied linearly and brilliantly never forgetting the importance of both characters, Fincher's version is boring and his storyline seems disconnected. The way he shows how Lisbeth and Mikael get connected to each other is so superficial and seems so unimportant that if there's something that Fincher succeeds is transforming Lisbeth into a mere supporting character. Also Fincher ""manages to reveal all the wrong details at all the wrong moments, effectively destroying any mystery or suspense to the story"" as defined by another review.<br/><br/>I'm completely disappointed mainly because Fincher's version is receiving better ratings than Swedish version instead. There are no reasons for the existence of this remake, there is not even a great and relevant particular point of view. A waste of time and money, a shameless and bad made copy of Swedish version, and the most revolting thing is that Fincher's version will become more popular and called original, believe me.<br/><br/>Those ones who are claiming this to be an ""amazing adaptation"" or the ""best movie of the year"", clearly haven't watched the Swedish trilogy or even cared for that.<br/><br/>Leaving the theater I realized how Gus Van Sant's version of Psycho (1998) now seems so good."
"bob the moo","Null","10","16","19 March 2012"," Solidly told story that builds well and has a real visual impact thanks to direction and cinematography
","I'm probably one of the few people left who came to this film knowing nothing about it whatsoever. I never saw the original films even though I knew I should and, while I was aware that the story was some form of mystery with roots in history, I had more of a ""Dan Brown"" type story in my mind and I wasn't sure if I would like it. The opening credits of the US version threw me even more as I wasn't sure what these visceral figures were about or if they were indicative of the film to come. Fortunately after the impact of the credits the film does settle down somewhat and more of a story begins to be told.<br/><br/>I had been told that the film was hard to follow and I agreed with Blomkvist when he comments to Vanger that he will struggle with all the names, but the latter was correct when he says soon enough you'll know them. Accordingly the story does flow well throughout the film with the mystery unfolding in a way that takes the viewer with it rather than pulling it out of the blue towards the end, or demanding the audience do too much work. It does help that it is fairly superficial as a story when you boil it down to its basics, but it is presented with a lot going on and a sense of danger and darkness that I enjoyed. It is probably longer than it needs to be but it doesn't ever really drag; there is some time at the end of the film after the mystery has been solved that could have been reigned in, but in fairness they extend the character of Lisbeth so it wasn't time wasted. Similarly although the sexual material between Lisbeth and her new guardian is secondary to the mystery, it is worth it because it informs us on her.<br/><br/>Having made Social Network, Fincher seemed to be a good choice for a plot that involves a lot of computer searching and pouring over old records ‚Äì and indeed he was, to the point that he is the real selling point here. He directs with a real good touch along with Social Network cinematographer Cronenweth. There is little action but the shot framing and the feel of the film gives it a tension and an edge that suits the superficial feel it does have. This isn't a great aspect of the film but it isn't a major problem either since I felt that the delivery of the story does rather cover these weaknesses. I was fortunate to come to the cast without the need to compare with the original (having never seen it) and perhaps I liked them more for this. Mara is good but I never shook off the feeling of her lacking an edge and too often I didn't feel like this character was fully fleshed out in her hands ‚Äì still good, but that feeling stuck with me. Craig is strong in the lead as he plays quite a bookish type. The support is deep in faces all doing good work ‚Äì Plummer, Skarsg√•rd, Berkoff, Richardson, Wright and others.<br/><br/>Overall Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a solidly engaging mystery that is a little bit too long but mostly unfolds well thanks to strong delivery in the superficial aspects. The cast, the cinematography and the direction create a sense of darkness and danger that is effective at taking the viewer along. I'm not seeing the brilliant film or story that millions other around the world proclaim it as, but I did enjoy it for what it did well."

You people can talk your philosophical crap about how amazing were the actors, sound or whatever you're talking about, but it is what it is. The first 90 minutes are awful and boring as hell. The only interesting scenes were the rape, the blowjob scene and the blackmailing one and i say interesting only cause actually something was happening (the people on screen were moving and others even running!!!). And for God's sake stop being fanboys. I don't care what book or comic this movie came from or if it's a Swedish or Romanian remake, trilogy or else. The fact of the matter is that this movie is boring. The only good thing was Daniel Craig and the acting and if you like a boringly annoying plot and good acting, well....this movie is for you and you will enjoy it.

","I saw the movie last night. First of all; I admit I was biased going in ( in favor of the original Swedish film; why remake a movie made only 2 years ago? ), but they seemed torn between the native language for the scenery, and English for most of the computer screens. And I admit it has been a while since I read the book, but they could have spent a little more time on how Lizbet go they way she was.<br/><br/>Like the book ( and the Swedish original ) it was a little distracting bouncing back and forth between Blomqvest's story and Salander's until they merged, but the plots ( plural ) were very well done.<br/><br/>And other than to save a little money, I' not sure why they left out the part about Australia ( I'm putting this intentionally a little vague to prevent a spoiler for those who have not read the book ). <br/><br/>Others seem to prefer this to the original; I am not convinced the acting was any better. I have to recommend the original Swedish film on DVD."
"Danusha_Goska","1","42","89","23 December 2011"," Pretentious, Misogynist, Christophobic, Torture Porn
","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a series of scenes of sadomasochistic torture. The most graphic scene depicts a large adult male violating a female who has the body of a pubescent girl. There are other, less graphic scenes where males are subject to sadomasochistic torture. There is a series of still photographs of women who have been subjected to sadomasochistic torture. Audience members who are attracted to that activity, or fantasies of it, will very much want to see this film. They will be rewarded by it. The film will inspire some to pursue the opportunity to violate women and girls. The filmmakers will profit from others' pain. <br/><br/>A flimsy, utterly vanilla murder plot ‚Äì a plot out of a C-grade episode of ""Columbo"" ‚Äì is the excuse for the exploitation scenes. A girl named Harriet disappeared forty years ago from a rich family's private island in Sweden. If you're at all curious as to what happened to Harriet, do yourself a favor and perform a google search of the film's title plus the word ""spoiler."" You'll soon discover how vapid the plot is. <br/><br/>The biggest mystery of the film is why all these people ostensibly living in Sweden speak English with variations on Scandinavian accents, accents that roll around unevenly between Helsinki and Vienna. Robin Wright's accent is best. Christopher Plummer's is worst. Daniel Craig doesn't even try (memories of his uneven Polish accent in ""Defiance."") <br/><br/>Harriet is being pursued by Daniel Craig, a reporter, and Lisbeth, the eponymous heroine. Lisbeth is strictly a male fantasy who could never exist in real life. She is less real than the blow-up doll Ryan Gosling fell in love with in ""Lars and the Real Girl."" Lisbeth has superhero powers on a computer, with weapons, on a motorcycle, and in international finance, but she is helpless when men attempt to assault her. Make the woman powerful and then violate and humiliate her: a classic motif of misogynist porn. Lisbeth has the body of a pubescent girl, and you get to see every inch of it. For the gentlemen's club crowd, Lisbeth does girl-on-girl action, but, in the end, her job is to make the male lead, and viewer, happy.<br/><br/>As part of the film's pretentious overlay, there are lots of interior shots of Swedish furniture and exterior shots of snow. Chair. Snow. Wind. Torture. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. <br/><br/>The film is boring. The attempts to create tension are pathetic and hackneyed. A character is alone in an archive at night. Suddenly a door is heard closing. OOOO boogedy boogedy! I'm really scared now! Evidence is pieced together and suddenly one realizes who the antagonist is. And the antagonist is creeping up upon the hero even at that very moment! Be still my heart. A killer talks for a really long time before dispatching the victim, thus potentially giving a rescuer a chance to arrive. Wow, I've never seen THAT done before! <br/><br/>There is a completely pointless series of scenes tacked on at the end relating to high finance. So much for narrative tension and drive. Trent Reznor's score is endlessly irritating in its neediness: ""Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm doing something really edgy here!"" I kept thinking of Bernard Herrmann's amazing shower scene music from ""Psycho,"" music that seemed to just be the natural sound that scene would make, music that was a seamless part of the terror. No such moments in ""Tattoo."" <br/><br/>What else. Rich people are bad. Nazis are really, really bad. Rich Nazis are really, really, really bad. Fat people are worst of all. The Bible causes people to become serial killers who hate women. Interestingly, boring, pretentious torture porn, apparently, does not cause people to become serial killers who hate women. Every other Swedish home has an extensively equipped torture chamber ‚Äì you missed that at IKEA, didn't you? Well, the stores ARE really big. Torture is such a popular national pastime in Sweden that you have to wonder how they make time to prepare their famous meatballs, never mind Volvos. Tourists traveling to Sweden must learn to say, ""Don't tase me, Bro,"" in Swedish, and should never, ever drop the soap."

"rudebuzztard","5","11","19","21 June 2013"," Americans must be stupid
","I have watched all the Swedish parts of the movies. Haven't read the books though. So I am not going to compare books with movies.<br/><br/>For me, the Swedish adaptation of the girl with the dragon tattoo was more suspenseful, less macho and made Blomqvist look like a real investigator. The way Craig finds out things in this movie is really ridiculous. Like the scene were his daughter says ""be careful with catholics, because there are bible text at your desk"" its just too stupid for me to handle.<br/><br/>The love story doesn't make any sense, the characters have little emotion towards each other. It's way too obvious Martin did it (you hear women screaming the first time Craig is at martin house, for crying out loud). The part were he visited ""anita"" and the fact it takes ages for him to figure out she is Harriet is annoying. And what happened to Anita? oh yeah she died?. In the Swedish version it has been told right at the beginning, how come Craig's Blomqvist forgot about that?. It's just all too stupid this remake.<br/><br/>The fact it takes place in Sweden and people talk English is maybe the worst part about this stinking piece of film. The accents are horrible and tend to fade away during the movie (its always hard to keep up accents, so don't do it if you are a shitty actor). All the extra budget is spent on useless flashbacks of people searching for Harriet and showing car crashes at a bridge and stuff that doesn't improve storyline or suspense. Just for making some cool images.<br/><br/>But i guess it works, this movie gets a better rating than the original despite the fact all the characters have been made a lot more stupid investigators than the originals. Blomqvist is a wining journalist, that hesitates in taking on the job and doesn't want to spoil his Christmans dinner (while you know he is going to take the job anyway). The girl is a lot weaker and more ugly than the original actress, and here dragon tattoo is weak too.<br/><br/>I definitely hope there are not going to be more remakes of the Swedish movies. But there probably will because there hasn't been an original idea around in Hollywood since the 90's and the only way they make money nowadays is by making weak adaptations of movies made with way less money somewhere else in the world.<br/><br/>If you really think this adaptation is better than the original, your either a blind US patriot, or a flawed movie fan who is easily distracted from a good storyline and character building by some pretty pictures."
"chaos-rampant","Null","11","19","27 January 2012"," The Exploited Sex Pistols
","I have not seen the Swedish film so cannot tell you what this does by contrast. No, I came to this after feeling spent from some recent heavy duty viewing and looking to unwind with slick pop darkness and gratuitous mystery: looking for a detective film where the detective did all the work for us and we just sat back and appreciated the mechanics. A film very much like Seven then, with its own type of abrasiveness.<br/><br/>This is Fincher's job in Hollywood, to be our current Billy Wilder. A perfectly efficient working hand who can subordinate himself to what a story demands so long as he gets a few spots to exercise his game. <br/><br/>Superficially the thing is written around three girls, each one coveted in some way and in turn some part missing.<br/><br/>One is the young heiress of the company and beloved sister long presumed dead and the trigger for our movie: we visit the place, a remote island with suspects arranged like pawns on a board game, and begin to unpack a narrative that happened long ago and is thought to reveal shady foundations of an entire Swedish society. Bits and pieces from photos are animated like films that we swoop in to follow; but disjointed or parts of a whole? And true as we see or misleading testimonies?<br/><br/>Another girl is the daughter, preppy beautiful and smart but apparently very religious. This is meant to baffle a little, as though something may be wrong with her. Daddy issues, we presume. But she gives us the one half of a clue that eventually clicks everything together; Bible quotes.<br/><br/>The other half of the clue - Jewish names, so possible Nazi involvement - we get from what is by now the most widely advertised aspect of the film. Another investigator but this time young, eccentric, visibly tormented but a sharp mind. Pierced through with pain from, you guessed it, daddy issues. Of course our man feeling guilty for not spending time with his daughter, he makes it up to this girl her age. We're meant to understand that she is very much the product of that first violence we are investigating, and having to grapple with gross but official injustice that still goes unpunished to this day. <br/><br/>So this is the thing that wraps the whole; each of these girls as a mirror to the others and all of them together a mirror of an abusive society. Simple but sold well. Designer hurt for the girl as a grownup's idea of what would appeal to a young demographic and on the other end contemporary political implications tied up with the one thing the Scandinavians have reason to be ashamed of - Nazi ties - to appeal to the parents. The writer has written himself in the thing as reflecting his own investigations in right-wing groups.<br/><br/>Now Fincher's game is usually a psychological dislocation diffused into the architecture; Pitt's house by the railroad tracks in Seven, the Narrator's house in Fight Club, the entire house with a hidden room and cameras everywhere in The Panic Room. Usually he weaves some dark fiction around this, gratuitous, eye-popping stuff, but he's at his most adept when evaluating human interiors in spatial terms.<br/><br/>I presumed here that a lot of power would be derived by the bridge setting, initially introduced as the main setting of a film-within. The complex of grey two-story homes. The main set-piece takes place in one, starting up and going down in the basement, but it's not a patch on the famous scene from Zodiac and is tritely resolved with a chase and a fireball. Nothing interesting to see, as it turns out. Maybe because Fincher is just a better filmmaker than the original writer is a writer."

","Yikes. What was all the hype about with this film? First off, it felt so dated - maybe in 1985-1995 this would've seemed relevant. And s - l - o - w. If you're a film buff, you find yourself going - Ah, this feels like the original Wicker Man (isolated island ...is it going to be a pagan cult murder pact?), and that feels like The Ghost Writer (isolated enclave, rich people, modernist architecture), The Vanishing (creepy northern European sadist), a sprinkle of Hostel (control and intent to torture and murder), with the gimmick of a pierced, tattooed Gen-Xer waif girl as a co-protagonist. <br/><br/>The story unfolds along parallel streams and it's nearly halfway through the film that our male writer protagonist finally partners with Pierced Girl. Nothing is terribly interesting or new - you have seen it all before. Bits and pieces were put together from other films for this film. There is no actual suspense at any point in the film, and while visually pretty, it is nothing groundbreaking. Fincher, the director, went with this washed-out blue-grey color palette for his visual undertone and it is bleak but lends nothing. Gratuitous nudity and sex pop up again and again and never once is it necessary to propel the story. <br/><br/>The girl is supposed to be near-feral and it just doesn't wash. How would such a street-smart hacker chick who is so clever she gets hired by a powerful law firm to do background checks get herself in a vulnerable position with a sex-hungry fat slob of a social case-worker who controls her money? If her intent all along was to appear vulnerable so she could gain the upper hand and extort this guy it didn't sell - the movie played as if she was compromised somehow. And a tough, feral chick like that hasn't already done anal sex? The shots of her walking painfully after the anal rape and in the shower bleeding and defecating from her anus were real emblems of how far filmmaking has fallen.<br/><br/>Oh, and we get a cute kitty cat chopped up into pieces which connects to ... nothing. The ""mystery"" of who's in the pictures and who took the pictures and so on is completely without tension or suspense or interest - we yawn as the process unfolds without any profound reveals. <br/><br/>The kicker for just how stupid this film is when Pierced Girl suddenly morphs into super-spy and drains the awful subplot billionaire character's money from his accounts. She had those skills yet needed to suck up (literally) to her coercive social worker for paltry checks? And the real clang of just how dumb this story and movie is during the final scene when she gets all sad because hero writer man has a girlfriend already and so she tosses the fancy leather jacket she bought him and sweet card into the garbage. Is this not the same girl who ""knows -him- better than his closest friend do?"" because her back-grounding on him was so thorough? <br/><br/>Save yourself a kick in the head and avoid this bad film and instead watch the original of The Wicker Man, The Vanishing, and The Ghost Writer and see what Girl With the Dragon Tattoo tried to do."

I'm a Fincher fan, and he handles the material well on certain levels, but this is not one of his best movies, and is probably one of his worst. The locations and cinematography were the best components, along with Mara and Plummer's short screen time.<br/><br/>Outside of that, this film is mostly a predictable bore.

They had a hard time linking all the different part, but they did a good job in some few parts, like I preferred the photograph of the parade, I believed more into the setting of the parade or of the bridge accident and stuff. I've started the second movie, it's really horrible. The girl they picked to play Myriam isn't even a little Asian. After 5 to 10 min, it was so boring I stopped it. <br/><br/>Then, I've watched the American version. I was immediately mad about the casting. OK, I get it, you need big movie stars and all. It's fine for Craig, I don't care that much and even though he has a big part in the story, his character personality isn't as marked as the one of Lisbeth. BUT WHY, WHY DID THEY CHANGED LISBETH? Rapace speaks English AND she is the PERFECT actress to play the part of Lisbeth. In my mind, when I read the book, the face and body I had in mind was almost exactly alike. Mara is just so generic in her strangeness. And she's SO dull! Lisbeth isn't suppose to look or be shy, she's suppose to be asocial, there's a big difference. Maybe it has something to do with her acting skills, I don't know. I pray that they switch it up for the 2 movie that still remain, but I know I'm wasting my time. Such a waste when you have an actress that is just so totally perfect for the role. I prefer almost all the cast of the American version better though, except for her (obviously) and for Plague, the hacker, who's just... he's too clich√©. <br/><br/>The story, the respect they kept for the original book, it's so much better in the American movie. But maybe a little too much clean, too much ""high budget"", it somewhat distracted me sometimes - too much American overall even though they kept the Sweden scenery and stuff. But it was OK for the setting of the island and the houses of the Vanger family (is the Swedish version, the houses are not fancy enough, it's just a little weird)... <br/><br/>The best movie would have been a mix of both, the American version could have been awesome if they just understand how important the casting of Lisbeth is (for those who did not read the books, you'll see what I mean in the next 2 movies - I really feel like she is much more important then Blomkvist in the trilogy)."

(In reality, the original version may be a better adaptation. John Huston had a Dashiel Hammet book to work from. Steig Larsson's work is transcendentally awful, on a level not even the purple pronouncements of The Bridges of Madison County descended to.) However, late one empty night, the American version showed up on cable and I decided to watch it. It's not bad, only slack and uninspired. The screenwriter and director hewed somewhat closer to the book but to no obvious purpose. And there are at least 4 narrative choices (spoiler alerts won't cover them, I'm afraid. You'll have to trust me--they didn't work.) that damaged the momentum of the film and the chemistry of the two main actors. And finally, David Fincher wasn't able to find an actress to match the ferocity, killer grace and awkward beauty of Noomi Rapace. Rooney Mara is a fine actress (catch her in Soderbergh's Side Effects.). But she's simply too faceless for as vivid a presence as Lisabeth Salander. She's like the 3rd Goth girl at the table, pale and unremarkable. Daniel Craig does a fine job as her partner. But the other actor choices are uninspired if professionally handled. It would have been better if Fincher and co. had done a wholly revised version, set in the US or England with different villains (imagine an African American Salander and the KKK, for example) rather than this dull work."

Rooney, while learning the mannerisms and portraying Lisbeth to the best of her abilities just simply doesn't have the right look at all. She looks like a soft small child playing dress up rather than a worn abused yet tough young woman that Noomi Rapace portrays so well. Noomi has the sharp angular features that give her a tough serious look while Rooney is softer and sweeter looking. I probably won't watch the other U.S. versions once they come out.

","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is not a kiddie movie, but a fell-fledged aberration from what is acceptable in modern culture. Tons of nudity, sex, and violence, infiltrate the senses within the two-and-a-half hour runtime of David Fincher's adaptation of the bestselling novel, of a hacker enlisted to solve a fifty-year-old cold case. The senses are barraged with so much of what is typically not seen as socially acceptable, that it is often hard to find a grasp as to the story and the purpose of why our senses were barraged to begin with. Not only that, screenwriter Steven Zaillian gets a bit carried away with the adaptation, with so much of the story focused on Lisbeth Salander, the titular girl with the dragon tattoo (who is played well by Rooney Mara), rather than focusing on Daniel Craig trying to solve the murder. The thing is, Salander plays no real importance to the plot till halfway into the film, and that first half could have easily been shortened had so many scenes of Lisbeth not been included that did little to add to the story or to her character, but simply add to the barrage on our senses. Well acted, with moments of genuine suspense, but is filled with too much excess to find any real traction to keep one engaged in the story or its characters.<br/><br/>I give The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo a 5 out of 10!"

","Fincher has once again consistently failed to accomplish a credible work to my taste.<br/><br/>This time, given a bigger budget and the advantage of being able to analyze its Swedish predecessor, unfortunately does not make up for the still many faults in this movie. Although I come to understand the plot is more faithful to the novel, the poor editing and the awkward pace had only succeeded in messing up the flow of thought by the lead characters and their actions, subsequently, appeared distorted to the audience...thus giving the effect that some of the conclusions or deductions arrived at were abrupt and lacked ample reasoning, and some of the actions were nonsensical (because they happened too quickly or lacked proper follow-through), all of which were more clearly explained in M√§n som hatar kvinnor.<br/><br/>I am not even going to credit acting performances...yes they SHOULD be better than the 2009 version, given the fact that the actors have the privilege to improvise from the first movie, but aside from Mara who did a great job dramaticizing the role of the main character, the rest are just mehhhh.... Actions are so unrealistic and sometimes inconsistent. For example, the ending (which i understand is altered from the novel)...is she too dumb to not be aware of that?"
"Christian_Dimartino","9","8","13","31 March 2012"," The rare remake that is just as good as the original.
","Director David Fincher is an excellent director. Not quite one of my favorites but a great one. He's a director who typically sticks to thrillers, and has surely made some of the best thrillers of all time. Alien 3 aside, he made the richly brilliant Seven, the mysterious puzzle of a movie The Game(my personal favorite), the darkly funny Fight Club, and the clever thriller Seven, which focused on the characters more than the crime itself, which more of the films above have done. These films make him perfect to re-adapt The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the remake of the Swedish film of the same title, based off of the late Steig Larsson's incredibly popular book series.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Mikael Blomkvyst (the perfectly chosen Daniel Craig), a shamed journalist recently committed of libel. Despite this, a man(played by Christopher Plummer) asks him to solve the mystery of a family member who went missing 40 years ago. Meanwhile, Lisbeth Salander(played by Rooney Mara, almost too well), a badass computer hacker, is researching Blomkvist, and the two eventually team up to solve this mystery.<br/><br/>Mara and Craig are perfect. Perfectly casted, and they are just perfect. The film is similar to the 2009 original, despite a few minor things. It's a little less extreme, to be perfectly honest. But at least it didn't avoid the territory that Sweden brought to them. It goes there. The rape, the lesbianism, the whole sha-bang.<br/><br/>Mara's Salander is just as tough and badass, but she's not as sexy. No offense to Mara, who is brilliant here. But Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth is sexier. Rapace, who is starting to make a name for herself over here, was hot as Salander. In real life: Not as much but still pretty, and same goes for Mara. Craig is the best choice, honestly. And so is Mara, aside from Rapace.<br/><br/>TGWTDT is just as good as the original, but how couldn't it be. They're very similar. Both dark, brooding, and complex, and incredibly entertaining. Also, Oscar Winner's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' dark tune flows well. I also like the camera shading. I like how the film looks the way it does. TGWTDT is definitely worth seeing, one of 2011's best.<br/><br/>A-"
"bob-rutzel-1","10","8","13","24 March 2012"," On Par with the Swedish Version
","Part owner of Millennium magazine, Mikael Blomquist (Daniel Craig) is convicted of libel, but has some time before sentencing and is hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to find out what happened to Harriet, his niece, who disappeared 40-years ago and is believed deceased. Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to help with his investigation. <br/><br/>I believe most movie goers have seen the Swedish version of this movie and are busy comparing notes of what was similar, different and so on. So let's get to it.<br/><br/>For my part, I have also seen the Swedish version and it was excellent having watched via sub titles, but I must go on record as saying the US version is just as good but perhaps, more clear regarding the story line. The Swedish version had too many sub plots that had one memorizing them to see what impact they would have on the main story. None is the answer. <br/><br/>Differences......there are some. The setting is Sweden, but the currency is not touted in Swedish Kronas, but USD; no accents were heard and they were clever enough not to show us traffic direction signs that were in Swedish. In the Swedish version I do not recall Henrik Vanger purchasing controlling interest in Millennium magazine. Where Harriet is discovered is completely different in this version. Does it matter? No. There were no lingering shots of the landscapes as were in the Swedish version. Pity, I missed them. <br/><br/>One big difference is that in this version Mikael tracks down Lisbeth to help in his investigation whereas in the Swedish version it is Lisbeth who hacks into Mikael's computer to give him clues re the disappearance of Harriet as she knows what he was hired for by Henrik. Then Mikael feels she can help him. Does this make any difference to the story? No.<br/><br/>Now for the question I just know you have: Who was the better Mikael? Michael Nyqvist or Daniel Craig? They were both excellent and no one outdid the other. <br/><br/>But, let's get to the real question: Who was the better Lisbeth Salander? Noomi Rapace or Rooney Mara? Both were excellent, and could have been interchangeable, but¬Ö¬Ö..this story made the Rooney Lisbeth softer, more giving. But, we cared more for the Noomi Lisbeth because we wanted her to be softer, more giving and she wasn't. But we still cared more for her. See? Also, the Swedish version had more story face time with Noomi than with Rooney. <br/><br/>Both versions had the sex scenes between Mikael and Lisbeth but the US version showed them 2-times whereas the Swedish version only once. In this version, Lisbeth orally servicing her Guardian was shown more graphically and the rape scene seemed to go on longer here than in the Swedish version. More total frontal nudity was shown in this version. <br/><br/>Both versions are very good and quite engaging and the differences do not hinder the story, but in the US version things become clearer without the non-important sub plots that were in the Swedish version. If you didn't see the Swedish version, this version will do. But, if you want to compare notes¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö..<br/><br/>Now for the question that still remains: Is there another country that will do a remake of this story? England? India? (hey, India makes more movies than the US. Why should they be left out? Huh?) And, yes there are two more stories to this trilogy. Any takers on the horizon? (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 2-times. Nudity: Yes, frontal too. Lesbian Kisses: Yes. Rape Scene:Yes and quite graphic too. Language: Yes. four F-bombs were counted. <br/><br/>Rating: A"

","The Swedish version was much more well-written, orchestrated, and directed. There was a sense of suspense, emotion, and realism to the movie that the Fincher version simply lacks. Lisbeth's past is seldom explored, and when it is, it's poorly placed in the movie. The emotional connection between Mikael and Lisbeth is 'forced' at best, and quite awkward at certain moments. There are so many interesting facets about Lisbeth's personality and character that could've been explored a lot better, and you simply don't leave the theatre with the same sense of 'wow' that defined the Swedish version. The more positive thing about Fincher's version though, is Rooney Mara, who played Salander nicely."

"rangerbagel","2","10","18","4 June 2012"," Ambitious American project misses the mark yet again
","Spoilers:<br/><br/>While the film itself is beautiful and the performance by Craig is strong, there are a number of critical mistakes that alienate this film from the heart of The Millennium Series.<br/><br/>While Rooney Mara is compelling, she and Fincher simplified Salander's character extensively by allowing Mara to be an emotional performer. One of Salander's most important traits is that she is externally made of stone. She reveals no emotion for she embraces a simple lesson from her stroke-stricken Guardian to weigh risks and consequences. This is one reason that people assume her to be retarded or crazy. Being underestimated is one of Lisbeth's strengths. Mara provides too much seething. She gives in to the melodrama of her Method approach and the writers revealed entirely too much about Lisbeth. It's unfortunate, but it's definitely gotten Mara attention.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, the producers, studio, writers, whoever, have butchered the true heart of the book by excising all of the politics. The word ""left"" never enters the film even though Blomkvist is a leftist journalist and Millennium Magazine is concerned with matters of the left. The film is also an indictment of the Swedish Welfare system, as is expressed by Lisbeth's violent rape and torture -- which is offensively whitewashed if you ask me. (The word ""Sadist"" is left out of his tattoo. Why? I don't know.)<br/><br/>This film has reduced a brilliant story to yet another serial-killer mystery. Who cares. They're a dime a dozen. But The Millennium Series is unique in its success of blending stark political arguments against Capitalism and the failings of the Swedish Government with mystery and character study.<br/><br/>This film simplified and made banal a brilliant story and brilliant characters. Why? Perhaps they felt that American audiences would be turned off or confused by issues plaguing the Swedish government and political system. Perhaps they felt minimizing Salander's brutal rape wasn't minimizing of how exploitable the Swedish Welfare system is by predators or minimizing international rape culture. Perhaps they felt it was fine eliminating Larsen's larger points in favor of hand-holding the audience through the mystery because it would make them more money.<br/><br/>Seems that they were right. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and read the books. Do yourself a favor and legitimately examine Larsen's indictments of his government (and then extend that to every government) and the corrupt. After you do that, enjoy the Swedish film trilogy for its performances, and view this film as something you'd find on adultfanfiction.net."

","THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011) **** Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Stellen Skarsgard, Robin Wright, Joley Richardson, Steven Berkoff, Yorick van Wagenigngen, Goran Visnjic. Filmmaker extraordinaire David Fincher's highly stylized techniques meet their match with the Americanized adaptation of the international best-seller by Stieg Larsson's novel (skillfully orchestrated by vet scribe Steve Zaillian) about disgraced Swedish journalist (Craig nicely underplaying the bookish Mikael Blomkvist) who teams up with troubled yet tenacious researcher savant/cyber-punk hacker incredible Lisbeth Salander (Mara in a truly audacious Oscar worthy performance; one for the ages) after being enlisted as a detective/writer for hire by industrialist magnate Plummer to investigate the mysterious decades-old disappearance of his young relative, a girl who may have met her demise by a nefarious cabal ‚Äìtheir family. With a knotty plot involving rape, Nazis, torture and other-things-that-go-bump-in-the-collective night, Fincher keeps a sharply clear-eyed viewpoint : the inhumanity humanity inflicts upon itself in the vicious circle of life's evils unleashed. To wit: one of the most harrowing on screen rapes and the subsequent vengeance thrust upon her attacker, Mara's Lisbeth Salander becomes an iconic character with her ingenious plans and underestimated resilient intelligence. From its relentless Trent Reznor cover of Led Zeppelin's ""The Immigrant Song"" with its post-BONDian title sequence the film gets its tenderhooks in you..and.never.lets.you.GO!

"mli-618-454454","6","13","25","18 January 2012"," Commercial and forced Hollywood remake of Swedish hit
","The Girl with a Dragoon Tattoo is another best-seller title taken by US/UK filmmakers and adopted for Hollywood standards. High budget, celebrity actors and big big commercial campaign to pump up cinema views. I am a big fan of the whole trilogy and beside second part I've drown completely in the story and in the characters. Being curious of new, commercial adaptation I wanted to check by myself if all these critic's reviews aren't just another cinema campaign. And sadly I can say- they are... which is really frequent nowadays.<br/><br/>First impression- main plan characters:<br/><br/>Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist- I didn't like him as a new James Bond for that, that he looks like and act like Russian gangster not a British spy-gentlemen and I can say that also in GWDT he lacks of a style and doesn't fit for a soft role of journalist. Couldn't really feel his pain for loosing trial, nor even his fear to die at the last scene. He really is a great fit for relentless characters (eg. Cowboys and Aliens) but not for a emotional ones. Mikael Nyqvist was much much more natural in his role.I think even Sean Bean would fit better here. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander- gosh, when I first seen her I thought she's a ghoul. Noomi Rapace beside that she was self-confident outsider, angry on whole world, hating all the man for what she came through in her childhood- she was also dragging attention- pretty hot punk girl. Full of emotions, building interest and questions who she is. In Fincher's film- Rooney Mara looks unnatural and not attractive at all so I simply don't care (maybe it's chauvinist point of view but it is how this world works). With all this punk-sadomasochism style- yet again she lacks natural expression and her role looks a bit artificial and flat. <br/><br/>Scenes: Like a characters- whole film looks for me artificially- I think the reason for that is that makers were following a Swedish script and were interlacing English actors with Swedish ones and Swedish world. I really would much more appreciate a brand new story based on the book but in the new realities and new world (for sure watching Swedish version strips the film of novelty). Film seemed to be a cover of a popular album- playing the same song with a new, foreign artists. All like original but without a freshness and with dose of exotic accents. Background music was really pompous and was only covering the silence. Couldn't feel that it was building emotions to the scenes. <br/><br/>Was it worthy going to cinema then? Yes. Despite all the acting and photography, script- it's still a good movie- emotions are rather built on the investigation progress- and even if it feels like the action goes too quickly ahead (because of lack of ""interaction"" with a characters) you still feel excitement with a new discoveries. It is definitely not as good as an original and not as good as you can read on the other reviews... but I don't regret going to cinema- rather because I have seen another adaptation of very good film, not because I have seen very good film."

","I know when the announcement came that they were making an English version, groans began over the disregard for the Swedish originals. I can't say I blame them, how many times have I liked a series only to hear that they're completely rebooting the films. The cycle seems never-ending and it only gets worse when you see the remakes and they're just not as good, plain and simple. Thankfully with this new version, it isn't the case. <br/><br/>I've been a fan of David Fincher's since Fight Club but more recently with The Social Network. He just has this way of capturing moments that not only look beautiful, they feel really raw and emotional. This film is the perfect example of that as it follows Lisbeth Salander through her investigation of a multi- decade mystery. Not only is the film perfectly cast, with relative newcomer Rooney Mara, it's a pretty faithful adaptation to the literary version as well, with only a few minor changes and one major alteration fans may not expect. <br/><br/>Mara knocks it out of the park for me in this one. I know praise is deserved for original Noomi Rapace but I can't help feeling Mara really embodied Salander. Someone who wasn't a goth but a lost soul who can't connect to others. Daniel Craig plays off this perfectly as the charismatic reporter leading the aforementioned investigation. Unlike the Swedish version which stared Michael Nyqvist, I could really see Craig as the ladies man he often portrays on screen, but it's a hard contest for anyone, so no disrespect toward Nyqvist fans.<br/><br/>In short, the movie from start to finish is the perfect combination of great directing, story telling and acting. Is it hard to watch at times? Yes, but Fincher wouldn't be doing the book justice if he didn't include the good, bad and at times, the very ugly that made up the series. The story after all is in some ways more about Lisbeth's journey then the mystery itself. The journey from the powerless to the unknowingly powerful. My advice for any viewer would be to give the movie a chance, even if you're a devoted fan of the originals. <br/><br/>This one might just surprise you."

","I regret to admit I fell victim to my previous experience with this title. Unfortunately when you come to the point of evaluating something you can not simply discard expectations, attitude, emotional state and finally comparison. I am a huge fan of Daniel Craig and I was eager to see his performance, which in my opinion was... decent. Rooney Mara was OK. Unfortunately ""OK"" is not enough in that case. <br/><br/>Everything felt like different parts were stitched together with no consistency. It lacked fluidity and at some parts there were gaps in the logic of the story. I don't really know who to blame. Is it the director's fault, is it the screenplay or both, but most of the time the actors were so confused about their roles as if they were waiting for someone backstage to remind them it is their part now and they should act and speak. The movie failed at capturing this really dark, perverted and deranged atmosphere I felt while watching the Swedish adaptation. This was in parts because of the aforementioned leaps from one episode to the other and also because of the shallow character development. I was waiting to be tossed into some deep emotional and psychological aspects of Lisbeth's personality and I am still waiting long after the end credits but to no avail. Noomi Rapace's acting was so intense it was almost violating. It makes you experience whole plethora of extreme emotions and crave for more. I felt nothing like this here, no compassion or rage, no sympathies, empathy or curiosity...it was if Rooney Mara's Lisbeth was just passing by to say hello. This was no interpretation as many of the comments here claim, it was a complete rip-off. Exact same scenes, angles, but hollow and irrelevant. I don't find the ""James Bond"" beginning even amusing. <br/><br/>Reading some of the reviews most of the people pay credit to David Fincher, but in my opinion he is the main weakness of the film... obviously not in terms of the gross income it generated, but in the interpretation. It was the first thriller murdered by its own director. He managed to murder the story and the characters quite easy. The halo effect around him and the cast compensates the total inability to understand and represent certain social and cultural aspects embodied in this dark Nordic story. <br/><br/>Fincher is most certainly the next Uwe Boll."

In another, this same main character is raped and sodomized in handcuffs against her will. Later this same character returns to her perpetrator and sodomizes him in revenge...all in extreme graphic detail.

Leaving the movie, I felt like I needed to take a bath and I'm a married man in my mid 40s with children. I did not believe that the level and amount of graphic sexual content added to the movie. If you could take away these several scenes, I'd rate the movie higher, but it was a complex and long ""who done it"" involving sexual misbehavior in a family that should have received an ""X"" rating.

The first book in the series was published a year after his death and marketed as a classic sent from beyond the grave. Furthermore, as critics and fans began to delve into the past of this mysterious dead author, his career as a feather-ruffling investigative journalist gave the series a heightened sense of authenticity and depth.<br/><br/>Having already produced an award-winning Swedish film outing, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has now received the full Hollywood treatment. With David Fincher, director of films including The Social Network and Fight Club, at the helm, this no-expense-spared remake seemed poised to do full justice to the novel while giving the uninitiated a chance to experience Larsson's world without needing to pick up the hefty novel or bother with pesky subtitles. Whereas Fincher does well not to cleanse the narrative of its difficult moments, however, there is something painfully amiss at the centre of this adaptation.<br/><br/>Other than a few minor changes and the relocation of some of the action to London, Steven Zaillian's screenplay sticks pretty closely to the original story. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a disgraced investigative journalist, who loses a libel case against corrupt businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m (Ulf Friberg), after publishing an expos√© on his dodgy dealings. Soon after, Blomkvist is asked by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a retired businessman himself, to investigate the disappearance of his niece Harriet, who he believes was murdered by one of his malevolent family over 40 years ago. With the promise that Vanger will provide him with the dirt he needs on Wennerstr√∂m to overturn the libel case, Mikael accepts and enlists the help of punky private investigator Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara).<br/><br/>As a straight-up society murder-mystery, this film works rather well. Set in the desolate northern reaches of Sweden on Vanger's private island, Mikael and Lisbeth discover a web of dark family secrets, complete with old Nazi uncles and torture chambers hidden under hilltop mansions. Fincher's glossy style lends well to this material, and he provides us with a conventional but pleasurable whodunit.<br/><br/>As with so many detective narratives, however, the psyche of the investigator is as important as the mystery itself. In Larsson's novel, it is Salander rather than solely Blomkvist's character that is subject to this exploration. This is something critically lacking in Fincher's adaptation. Having grown up under state supervision, Lisbeth suffers constantly at the hands of abusive and vindictive social workers. It is her hatred of the sort of sadistic men who take advantage of her that fuels her efforts in solving the case of the murdered Harriet. Unfortunately, Fincher buries the pathos of her character in his characteristically slick aesthetic. As a result, she becomes little more than a cartoonish badass with a difficult past, who swaggers around spouting one-liners and smoking endless amounts of cigarettes. Whereas Mara is at times remarkably intense in the role, it becomes incredibly difficult to take her seriously as the film wears on.<br/><br/>Despite the often-sanitising effects of Hollywood financiers, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo really doesn't pull any of its punches. The central, graphic scenes that defined the murky tone of the novel are all here, yet unfortunately the crisp styling renders them emotionally inert nonetheless. The few who will go to see this film without any preconceptions may well find it an enjoyable, if somewhat dark, mystery thriller. Yet anyone even slightly aware of the legend surrounding Larsson and his trilogy will walk away thinking the film has been over-hyped."

","First the good news, Daniel Craig is better as a Swedish journalist than as James Bond, and, Christopher Plummer is still an imposing character actor at age 82. Now the bad news. Having read and enjoyed the book and Swedish movie, I waited to see this film on pay-per-view, which is kind of good news considering ticket prices these days. Unfortunately, my familiarity with the story was of little help as I spent over two and a half hours scratching my head watching a complex mess that bore only a slight resemblance to the novel or foreign film. I felt sorry for anyone who had neither read the book nor seen the movie, and sorrier for those who had. Swedish names and towns with double-digit letter length and difficult pronunciations only made following the dialog and story more difficult. I have not watched many foreign films with English subtitles, so, if you haven't already read the book or seen the American film version, I highly recommend the Swedish movie."

","I waited anxiously for the opportunity to see this movie because I really liked the original, which I have seen three or four times without getting bored. I was disappointed because this version is vastly inferior to the Swedish version.<br/><br/>Summary of just a few of the failures: Bjurman in the original was a portrayal of psychotic evil. Bjurman in the remake indicates that he is remorseful and that his bad behavior was an aberration. Boring.<br/><br/>The revenge scene against Bjurman in the original was powerful and riveting. The new scene is lacking the tension. It is more emoting than acting. Boring.<br/><br/>Lisbeth by Noomi was edgy, isolated, autistic, and thoroughly interesting. It was one of the best film performances I have ever seen. Lisbeth by Rooney is more like a Valley Girl gone Goth. She's way too close to being a normal, functioning person. Boring.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig could have phoned in the performance (except maybe the sex scenes, which were inferior to the original).<br/><br/>Martin's demise in the accident was much more interesting in the original, where Lisbeth refuses to save him from the fire. In the remake, Lisbeth approaches the car with the intent, we believe, to shoot Martin, but the car disappears in a (boring) Hollywood fireball.<br/><br/>I don't think there was any reference to Lisbeth's problems with her father, which is the key to her behavior, in the new version.<br/><br/>The pacing and editing intruded with, rather than propelled, the story in the new version. Distracting and....boring.<br/><br/>The artsy opening credits didn't add a thing to improve the experience of watching this bomb.<br/><br/>Which begs the question I always ask in these circumstances: What is the point of remaking an excellent movie?<br/><br/>Or maybe it's just me."

","I stumbled upon the ""Millennium series"" in 2010, while I was browsing through internet. The cover of the book looked interesting enough for me to place an order for it. By the time book had arrived I had gained some information about the author and his rather unfortunate demise. It seemed quite mystifying to me that author died shortly after handing his manuscripts to the publisher. <br/><br/>Any ways, as I started reading it; I knew that I will like it for sure. As it happens with most readers, I too had a mental picture of how Lisbeth would look in real life.<br/><br/>For me she was a real character, a real person, whom I dreamt of meeting one day and telling her how awesome she is. As u may have guessed, by the time I finished reading the first book I had ordered the next two instalments already.<br/><br/>Then I heard about a movie series based on the trilogy. The problem was where I could find them. Finally I caught 20 minutes of the ""The girl who played with fire"" Swedish version on HBO.Was the movie good enough?Did Noomi Rapace justify the character of Lisbeth Salander. From what I could make out of 20 minutes of movie,the answer was ""yes"". Of course I had imagined Lisebth Salander a bit differently but she was close enough. I had also expected Mikael Blomkvist to be a bit more charming. <br/><br/>Then came the news of English version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" directed by David Fincher, starring Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander about whom I had never heard before. I was Excited and why wouldn't I be. After all Daniel fitted into my image of Mikael Perfectly but I had my doubts about Rooney. <br/><br/>Finally the day came when movie released but to my utter disappointment its release in India was delayed. Date of its release was set as 10 Feb 2012.So I was looking forward to that day and reviews about the movie only added to my anxiousness. But fate wasn't on my side. Movie was cancelled in India due to some images in movie which"" Indian censor board"" found disturbing. What can I say other than, I hated them for it and I even wrote them an e-mail expressing my utter disappointment. Somehow I got my hands on its Blu-Ray version from someplace. <br/><br/>Finally came the judgement day. To tell you honestly, how did 2 and a half hours went by, I Don't remember. It was like reading the book again but even better. Lisebth was exactly what I had imagined her to be. Everything was just ""PERFECT"". The acting, screenplay, direction, music,everything was top notch. I have nothing but only good things to say about the movie. It was an experience worth having. Rooney Mara played Lisbeth Salander perfectly and Daniel Craig left no stone unturned. It felt good to finally see my mental image of Lisbeth take shape flawlessly. <br/><br/>I have rated the movie a 10/10 in IMDb, because it accomplished its purpose and much more. I felt so deeply moved after watching the movie, that I sat down and Wrote this review. I am really looking forward to next instalment in the series. <br/><br/>Finally I would like to end my review with these lines from the movie... <br/><br/>Dragan : ""She is different""<br/><br/>Dirch:""In what way?"" <br/><br/>Dragan:""In every way!"""

","OK it may be sacrilege but what ever, sue me! I have never read the book(s) or watched the Swedish version of this movie. My review is from the point of view of, ""I wonder what movies are playing, ooh that one looked decent in previews, lets check it out."" OK now that that's out of the way.<br/><br/>The opening of the movie is in my opinion, just plain awesome! Good music and an interesting visual sequence of dark fluid forming/reforming into/over human form. I enjoyed it and it really got me interested into the movie before it had started.<br/><br/>The movie opens up basically telling us that the main character just lost a case as a journalist for writing bad things about some big time hot shot and it cost him his entire life savings. That's it in a nutshell, so he's pretty much down and out. He eventually gets a job opportunity from a rich old guy that wants to find his niece whom went missing like 40yrs ago.<br/><br/>We then get introduced to Lisbeth who is straight up rough cut and looks like the type of chick you stay away from. I'm a motorcycle guy so she scored huge points with the motorcycle and her helmet was awesome!(though I don't see how she could have a perfect mo-hawk after taking off a helmet..). We find out at this point that she's a VERY good investigator type that watches people and gets information.<br/><br/>Lisbeth to me is amazing. She shows this rough outer edge and you can tell she's always ""scheming"" in her head, always in control, always 2 steps ahead. Even during the most cruel scene in the movie, she still had the guy, even though it didn't seem that way at the time. you'll read other reviews where people say she was too soft, I don't know where they get that from. Lisbeth DESTROYS a guy that tries to take her purse, Lisbeth is the one that dominates our main character through the entire movie, she calls the shots, directs him and even saves him. The man who violates her, nearly urinates himself every time he saw her after that, not a strong woman?? My Butt!! I really enjoyed this movie, it was nice for once to have a different plot and a entirely different flow to a movie. I have to say the ending surprised me but the more I thought of it, the more it made sense, it's reality and that's all. I felt bad, but it definitely made me want to see a sequel.<br/><br/>Go see this, it's an awesome movie! Unless you're like a die hard original person and you only like the Swedish version."
"CubeRic9000","5","11","21","31 December 2011"," A bridge too far, especially so soon
","I have seen the Swedish film, now this English speaking version, but never read the book. At first I was reluctant to see this version, as I enjoyed the Swedish one, but David Fincher was enough to convince me it would be worth a try.<br/><br/>There were a few standout points, namely the style and cinematography. It really is a wonderful film to look at, and has Fincher's acclaimed attention to detail throughout. He really has put a lot of work into this, and it shows. And with this type of story, it is hard to think of a current day director that would be more suitable. The opening credits are also worthy of a mention. It's like watching a Chris Cunningham music video, spawned from the mind of H.R. Giger. Not sure if it gels with the film entirely, but was impossible to look away. The score also is one of the best points. Trent Reznor does a magnificent job, creating a mood and intensifying a scene. Combined with a well produced sound design, it is great for the ears. As for performances, I thought Daniel Craig came across well.<br/><br/>Whilst watching this film and since leaving the cinema, I have found it impossible to not compare this English version to its Swedish predecessor. Even when consciously trying to watch it with a clean slate, you can't help but consider comparisons. So with that in mind, I have found Fincher's version to be a disappointment. I did not get hooked in at all, and as great as it was for the eyes, I was urging the credits to roll.<br/><br/>Firstly the character Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara. I thought she was so much less engaging than Noomi Rapace's portrayal. At times I actually found her character to be quite overstated in certain scenarios, particularly the over-choreographed bag snatch scene on the escalator. With Noomi's version, there was an eerie undercurrent and imperfection to her character, whereas with Rooney's, being bad seems too perfect in its execution. This type of overproducing, and trying so hard to make it sleek, really took away from the realism of the characters and more importantly the story. With the Swedish one it was gritty, dark, and real. They were far from perfect characters in situations out of their depth. With Fincher's version, the characters tend to feel too exaggerated.<br/><br/>The narrative also was slow at times, then way too quick at others points. For example it's partly a study of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist current lives for the first half hour to an hour, and does tend to drag. Even still, you learn nothing as to why Lisbeth is the way she is. So they don't know each other, then bang, they are working together. We do see how they get introduced, but the processed is rushed through. I remember the way they come across each other in the Swedish version as being rather important and enjoyable to watch unfold. Their relationship in the Swedish version also grew in a believable sense, and was genuine, however with this English version, it seems so forced. Especially the intimate scenes, they just seem to occur for no good reason. They are quickly squeezed in, then back to the mystery.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the Swedish version, Fincher's version would probably satisfy. It may be closer to the book, this I am unsure. And perhaps Rooney Mara's turn at Lisbeth Salander would impress. But for me, I have to recommend the original Swedish film by a long way. I think the script has a lot to answer for here as it seems unbalanced, and even with a long duration, it still feels like there are important points that are left out or glossed over. I know it can be somewhat clich√© to state it, especially in a scenario such as this, but I can't help but think that in a lot of ways this story has been distorted by the Hollywood system. The product placement is a testament to that, and as for the Nine Inch Nails shirt, for some reason it annoyed me more than it ever should (surely Reznor didn't suggest this?). Nevertheless his contribution was worthy of note, and Fincher has made a good looking film here, and really undertaken a courageous act in making this story around two years after the highly successful Swedish version. The comparisons were always going to be part and parcel of how this version was received. Unfortunately, for me, it just does not come close."

","I am a big fan of David Fincher's movies but this one,Not a winner for David Fincher. Roony Mara - no match for Nooami Rapace. Not to blame her as an actor but the way , the main character was portrait was disappointing. The make up and hair styling was to make fun of her. Gothic look was incomplete.. missed the Black lipstick, The eye brows could have been darker - should go with the hair color.

Also the Guardian - in the -ve role was not up to the mark - that of his counter part in the original movie. Hats off to Daniel craige - he was flawless.

The movie was in fact incredible, with all the suspense and vast intelligence of the book and 2009 film this remake has easily made itself a contender for the best film of the year. The script was incredible, location and shooting was beautiful and the cast was absolutely incredible. As a lover of Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsgaard I expected great things and was not disappointed, but both had to take a back seat for the lifetime performance by Rooney Mara. Easily one of the best performances I have seen in a very long time, you could see every part of her being and soul went into playing the amazing Lisbeth Salander, Noomi Rapace should be proud that her amazing performance in 2009 has been carried on to the same excellence with this astounding remake."
"macktan894","8","18","39","20 December 2011"," Not really better than the original
","Why do an English language version of a stunning foreign film? There are all sorts of reasons to do so and good ones. Perhaps the foreign culture got in the way of Americans appreciating the story fully, or perhaps the film was not well distributed in English-language countries. The North American market is huge and there are plenty of dollars for a film that probably played mostly in art houses (e.g. Pour Elle became The Next Three Days--practically duplicates). Tattoo, however, had a robust DVD viewing, so it's not like it lacked exposure. And sometimes a director has a particular point of view that he or she thinks will enhance or illuminate the story -- perfectly reasonable. <br/><br/>But I really cannot say why David Fincher took on a redo of this film. He brought nothing new to it. It's a copy tweaked here and there and not near as gritty as the original. And I'm not all that enthusiastic about some of the changes he made in Lisbeth's or Blomquist's character or in the story wrap up. <br/><br/>The first hour is quite slow--I even nodded off for a few minutes. It picks up when Lisbeth and Blomquist finally begin working together, although this Lisbeth is somewhat more into Blomquist. Despite Lisbeth's severe goth look, it's not as hard and realistic as Rapace's. Rooney Mara is Hollywood Lisbeth. Rapace has more street cred,she wasn't pretty & looked somewhat boyish. <br/><br/>I love David Fincher, think he's one of the best storytellers in film today. But I can't see compelling reasons for his efforts in this film. In any case, you'll enjoy the movie...again. But you won't leave the theatre in shock and awe."

","On the plus side this movie was 99% accurate based on the book. As a person who has read the book and seen the Swedish version of the book, I really felt this movie had a pace that didn't do the book justice. The movie has a feel that all the events took place in the course of few days or couple of weeks. If you read the book or watch the Swedish version you will know what I am saying.<br/><br/>Another plus to this movie is that it touches on certain scenes that were apart of the book but left out of the Swedish version. However because you only have a few hours to summarize a book it felt like they only grabbed the exciting elements of the book. The Swedish version is very slow paced and I almost stop watching it in the beginning but it really picks up and makes that first hour feel worth it. I felt like I was watching it forever and on the other hand the American version zoomed through. Which is funny considering the American version has a longer run time.<br/><br/>As a reader of the book I recognized the full story behind things they only glance over and I would have felt better about this movie if they were left out. for example the merger of Millennium and Vanger is a big plot point in the book and if your not going to use that storyline then it should have been left out of the movie.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 5/10, good acting and actuate for the most part but lack the scope of the book and the Swedish version."

You can answer these questions for yourself, but I just wished I had been forewarned before the people behind this film got some money out of me.

I am not saying the movie is bad but considering the book, it is just fine (even at the edge of fine). The character development phase is ultra lame. I watched the movie with couple of friends and at the end they had a lot of questions in mind. Considering the length of the movie, one can easily judge how bad the script was. There were so many useless details (and yeah, I read the other two books as well. I know what I am talking about). If you sum up the time spent on details neither necessary for this movie nor the rest of the series, one could use that time to tell the story properly. Lets talk about the positive sides as well. The script follows the book in an OK manner (but towards the ending I guess the script writer got bored). On the other hand, everything is so rushed. I must say, the scenery is well portrait. Lastly, I need to warn you about the adult content as well. This is simply not a family movie. As a conclusion, an OK movie but not a masterpiece or what so ever."

Daniel Craig was his usual flat self (missing what all the fuss is about him too but I'll save that for another time.)

"Will_Malone","7","5","8","4 May 2012"," Confusing, unless you have read the book first.
","OK, so here is a quick question for you. Is there anyone out there who has seen either version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo without having read the book first? If so, did you actually understand what was going on? My adventures with Lisbeth Salander started with the original book, I then moved onto Fincher's screen version before finally finishing with the original Swedish film. I loved the book and devoured it in only a few sittings. I loved the raw power and determination of Lisbeth, which when coupled with the sheer single bloodymindness of Mikael Blomkvist was a potent, unstoppable force. I admit I found the plot reasonably complicated in parts mainly due to the complexities (for want of a better word) of the Vanger family tree, Lisbeth's back story and just what the hell had actually happened to to poor Harriet. However Steig Larsson guided the reader through this maze in comfortable fashion and when you got to the inevitable 'what Vanger are we talking about now' you could always flip back a couple of pages and catch up.<br/><br/>Therefore, it was with some excitement that I sat back to watch Fincher's version. By the end of the film, I was slightly uncertain about what I thought. At first I thought I had I really enjoyed it, but there was a nagging doubt at the back of my mind. It wasn't the actors performances as Rooney Mara was simply astonishing as Lisbeth, fully deserving of her Oscar nod and Daniel Craig brought a certain ruggedness and depth to Mikael that proved again that there is more to him than simply Bond. It wasn't the direction as whilst not Fincher at his best, it was still visually very appealing. So what was left? To ponder this some more I turned to the script and it was here that my nagging doubt found a home. There is no doubt that Larssons's story is a complicated one and hard to fit into a comfortable viewing time. Screenwriters just simply don't have the luxury of open ended time that novelists do. And a lack of time is clearly evident in the screenplay. The complications within the story which had been so deftly handled by Larsson, are simply not given the time they deserve or arguably need, so leaving the audience struggling to keep up. Great swathes of the back story and the history of each character seem to go by in a blink of an eye and vitally important plot points feel extremely rushed, occasionally crow-barred in and often delivered through pretty forced sounding dialogue. However when I watched the film the first time, none of this really bothered me. Why was this? Had my previous knowledge of the plot smoothed over these writing issues without my knowledge, so actually giving a false level of enjoyment? It was with this thought firmly in mind that Mrs Malone and I snuggled up on the couch on Saturday night with Fincher's version, for the good lady's first ever introduction to Lisbeth. It took less than 2 minutes into the film for my suspicions to be proved correct. Mrs Malone (who has five degrees so is pretty good at figuring stuff out) reached out for the pause button to ask the first of many questions. This happened nigh on ten times throughout the film before eventually arriving at 'which bloody Vanger are they talking about now'? Suffice to say this spoilt the show somewhat. We couldn't simply go back a few pages and read it again, as the information on the screen was so slight, it wouldn't have mattered how many times you repeated it.<br/><br/>Therefore at the end we walked away with two distinct different experiences. Mrs Malone was confused, cheated and even a little bit cross whilst I still found myself fully caught up in Lisbeth's world, despite what had been on the screen. I realised I was experiencing and enjoying the combination of the book and the film together, Mrs Malone was just stuck with the film."
"iStej","6","5","8","3 May 2012"," What's the point?
","First off I should say that I have not read the books, so I can't really say which version is more faithful to the vision of the late author. I've watched the original Swedish film however and as a movie it's infinitely superior and more exciting to watch as a mystery. Simply put, the original movie is more entertaining.<br/><br/>In the Swedish version the plot unfolds brilliantly, allowing the viewer to really follow the investigation and get enthralled in the story. The Hollywood adaptation is basically 2.5 hours of Daniel Craig talking here and there without much coherence. Most major twists and turns happen through logical leaps within moments that you can't really follow.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig's performance is not bad however, the writing and the pacing is what makes this movie bland and uninteresting. And then you have Lisbeth's character which is so overwhelmingly amazing in the Swedish version that there isn't any comparison really. Again, Rooney Mara's performance is not bad at all, the character just isn't as brilliantly written unfortunately.<br/><br/>Which really begs the question, what was the point of this remake. The original is just 2 years old and is superior in every way imaginable. I suppose if you are a native English speaker that refuses to watch subtitled movies it might appeal to you, but if -like me- you get to watch both of them subtitled, there is really no reason whatsoever to watch this version."

","(Spoiler alerts throughout) This film appears to offer a story of consequences and revenge; at least that is how it first appears. What it really offers is a platform for relentless gender assaults against men. (Spoiler Alert)For instance: after experiencing sexual molestation, the girl with dragon tattoo then visits the molester's home and when that turns out to be a mistake, returns a third time to affect revenge and to brutalize the molester. Does she see that justice is done? No. What she does is return to torture the man and release him right back out into the world where he can continue his behavior where she can then continue to brutalize him. The first time made him a villain and a fiend. I get that. The second time makes HER stupid and reckless while the third, premeditated visit, makes her a villain as big a villain as him.<br/><br/>A short time later she comes onto Daniel Craig's character and then literally jumps on top of him against his wishes. No means no. Right? Not if your the girl with dragon tattoo. That's a double standard folks. Be smarter than this movie. <br/><br/>Through the course of the story there were no men who were not emasculated or vilified. Frankly, I was horrified, as much by the gleeful reactions of some viewers as I was by the piteous actions of the story's unlikely protagonist.<br/><br/>A far as the actual story telling. It was uninspired, milling back and forth between TGWTDT looking at her lap top and DC staring at photos. The problem is, who really knows what they were looking at and seeing. It was just boring. I know, you will say it was clearer in the book. But you know what? I didn't drop $10 to watch the book. I dropped the cash to see the film. I wish I didn't. I hope you don't either. If given the choice, watch Sharktopus instead. At least you will not be surprised by the quality."

","An open letter to Hollywood - STOP turning popularly artistic foreign movies into your big budgeted box office cash cows! Why? Simply because you have the tendency to flip, add, delete, re-arrange, water down, etc the original material to fit the average American movie-going audience's intelligence and attention span. Case in point, Let The Right One In - a beautiful Swedish movie but horribly re-made into an Americanized version with 30 minutes lopped off.<br/><br/>Now you have sunk your greedy hands into another Swedish film - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Thank the blessed goodness that Stieg Larsson isn't alive to see how you have flipped and watered down his work ...adding WAY too much and leaving out too little than its Swedish version. PLUS you have revealed TOO before its time.<br/><br/>*sighs* If you have seen the Swedish original and/or read Larsson's books, SouthSide seriously advises that you stop reading this review now ...or suffer the agony knowing what they have done. If you're currently reading the Millennium book trilogy - stop now. It's not going to help you while viewing the movie. HOWEVER, you haven't read and/or seen the Swedish original - this movie was tailored for you because you wouldn't have a clue as to what was added or subtracted.<br/><br/>Sadly this version is missing the mystique behind the disappearance of Harriet Vanger but focuses more on Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara, an okay replacement to Noomi Rapace) and Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig a stale replacement to Michael Nyqvist). The way TGWTDT was filmed you would have thought the writers were studying the cliff note version of Stanley Kubrick's guide to flipping a novel into a movie without the use of a script. The screenplay (by Steven Zaillian) jumps around like a hot Mexican jumping bean snagging bits and pieces from the book thus smashing them together during the beginning that the plot doesn't become fully clear and concise until slowing down at the middle. Even the rape scenes between Bjurman and Salander did not frighten or make this reviewer squeamish (or even arouse her kinky fetish side). They totally missed their mark. There was no subtle seduction from Bjurman over the ""vulnerable"" Lisbeth ...it played out like some poorly made American porn. And then that's when the many movie mistakes kick in ...like isn't that dragon tattoo suppose to be down her back NOT alongside her left side ...or isn't she suppose to tattoo ""I'm a SADISTIC rapist pig"" on her guardian Bjurman's chest instead of ""I'm a rapist pig""? There are many more but this reviewer shall not reveal them here. Then there's the TWO major mistakes made in which totally changed the outcome of the entire movie far differing from the original Swedish version and Larsson's book.<br/><br/>And a word to the dialect coach - please teach your actors (Daniel Craig included) to stick to one accent, please. This reviewer had a hard time distinguishing if Blomkvist was Swedish, British or American or all three at the same time with everyone changing their accents throughout the movie. It felt like watching The Prince of Persia all over again.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor, SouthSide believes Nine Inch Nails want their front man back ...asap! You do not have the gift for composing movie music ...you should have taken some lessons from Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman ...or even Chris Carter. Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song?!?! Seriously, dude, what does that classic epic rock song have to do with the movie especially the opening credits (that looked like someone did as a Graphic Design project for Flashpoint Academy ...and it wasn't even good). The music throughout the movie didn't enhance or heighten the action or plot ...sometimes it was too loud and boisterous or the scene didn't call for music. OR sometimes there was no music to be had when it called for it.<br/><br/>*sighs* It is this reviewer's honest recommendation - wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray version. At least you can press stop and then play when you get to a confusing scene that doesn't make any sense."

","Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson's story is immensely successful. Much of that is due to the tightly woven screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (with a bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson's 'Lux Aeterna') and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long length doesn't seem long enough!<br/><br/>Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants Mikael to leave. The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsg√•rd), a brief but impressive Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc. Every role is cast so carefully that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.<br/><br/>For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO this English version will surely satisfy. They are different but for this viewer the English version is far more memorable. There is considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there. Kudos to all concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

As Larsson's popular novel was made into a decent Swedish film two years earlier, was a Hollywood remake really necessary? Everything is overdone, starting with the ridiculous opening credits. It is poorly paced and goes on much too long, yet the plot is a bit murky at times. Craig does better in the role of the journalist than Nyqvist in the original film. As for the Lisbeth, the edge goes to Rapace, who wasn't particularly good in the original, but Mara is too robotic here. However, Lisbeth is such a one-note character that it would be difficult for any actress to make her anything more than a caricature."

It didn't need any and it didn't really got any, so Fincher is right to appear bored as the whole effort basically is only necessary so people don't get confused by Noomi Rapace, who does look terrifying in the original, which was kind of the point. Now while this is certainly not the worst movie ever, I don't quite see where I could start praising it. Americas version of the not quite ingenious, but nevertheless somehow outstanding Scandinavian original is generally unintense, the performances are mediocre at best, the accents suck ass (if already converting it, why not start by putting it into America??), Trent Reznor Music is off, the Fincher look is unnecessary and the whole movie just appears pointless without it's human edge which was kind of the only real thing to the original.

"angie_l","5","4","6","27 October 2012"," Dull
","Dull as dishwater and kills the meaning and intentions of the book, Stieg Larsson is rolling in his grave. Dull, Dull, Dull... <br/><br/>The book was originally called 'Men Who Hate Women.' Stieg Larsson, the author, was adamant that the name not be change. Sadly he died before he could complain about the renaming of translations. The book is a strong statement about violence against women which is somewhat watered down in favor of more typical cinema.<br/><br/>My biggest problem was how they wrote Lisbeth Salander. In the book at one point, Blomkvist actually thinks she may be some form of high functioning autism, I didn't get that from this Salander. Movie Lisbeth was a girl who had just been hardened by going through a lot of crap and is a bit walled off and lacking social niceties but still has a level of normalcy. Book Lisbeth is exceptionally awkward, even more closed off and much harder, even militant. Blomkvist never finds out Lisbeth is a ward of the state in the first book. In fact Lisbeth would never tell anybody this fact about herself, she is very guarded of this secret. So her laying in bed talking about it with Blomkvist would never have happened. That is a far too normal an interaction for Salander. To make the scene worse, he asks why she's a ward and she tells him about setting her father on fire when she was young. Again, another guarded secret she would never talk about. If you were thinking of reading the books, major spoiler alert, her lighting her daddy ablaze is actually the big reveal at the end of book 2, The Girl who Played with Fire. Another problem is the end scene where Lisbeth asks, ""May I kill him?"" Some reviewers were disappointed seeing this as Lisbeth being passive to Blomkvist which is a big problem since the book is quite feminist but I didn't see it that way. What I did see was Lisbeth deferring to Blomkvist out of respect: she values Blomkvist more than hunting down Martin. In the book she just says I am going to kill him and takes off before Blomkvist can say a word: killing Martin is more important than anything. While I wanted to understand book Lisbeth, movie Lisbeth drew little intrigue.<br/><br/>They took out how some of Blomkvist's exploits. I wonder how people would have perceived the movie differently if he was shown having an affair with Cecilia Vanger. <br/><br/>The crime story is the plot of the novel but not what drives it. The character's drive the story. The mystery really wasn't that exciting to read about. Since it wasn't that exciting to read about, it was even less interesting to watch. It's just not a riveting story line and not what I took away from the book. The problem is the character's here lacked the depth and complexity to carry the movie as they did in the book. Some of the important character interactions are also cut for the so-so crime story.<br/><br/>The Wennerstrom affair was incomprehensible. We hardly know why Blomkvist got convicted of libel and little insight into him taking down Wennerstrom in the end. Also the tangent where Lisbth stealing billions in Wennerstrom's Kronor is too long and serves little purpose. It could have been done more carefully in far fewer scenes. (Lisbeth asking for the money from Blomkvist and then Blomkvist seeing her on TV in the blond wig (which in the book he sees her on TV, recognizes her and knows she stole the money) would be enough.).<br/><br/>To make the movie work, they needed to be more adept at stream-lining the plot. In the end, it amounted to an incredibly boring movie that was often incomprehensible. Dull, dull, dull, that's all I seem to be able to say about this movie."

","""What is hidden in snow, comes forth in the thaw."" Swedish proverb<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is indeed a girl's movie, for it is about misogyny and the revenge women can sometimes get. In between is a standard thriller, albeit classy and European, so there's much more investigation than shooting. It's an American product, based on the Swedish film of the same name in 2009, itself based on the Stieg Larsson novels about a wildly eccentric 23 year old woman, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who has the investigative skills of Sherlock Holmes and the prowess of La Femme Nikita.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig plays a disgraced journalist, Mikael, engaged by a powerful family to answer one of its darkest secrets and at the same time get revenge on his courtroom antagonist, who caused his disgrace. He enjoins Lisbeth to help the investigation.<br/><br/>With women the victims in both parts of the story, the investigations have parallel themes of revenge and feminism. Lisbeth is one of the most complicated women ever on screen. Alternately kinky and remote, tough and vulnerable, she also is ultra modern navigating both technology and sex.<br/><br/>This iteration has all the plot points of the original and an enhancement of the relationship between journalist and assistant. In the end all is tied up, with an anticlimax that could have been left behind although it is interesting to see how the criminals receive their just rewards.<br/><br/>Overall the film is stylish and decidedly brutal (a rape scene is shocking but still watchable) with a cerebral overlay complementing the base acts that include incest and Nazis just in case rape were not enough for the audiences on both sides of the pond. That the American version could so soon after the Swedish compel viewers and stand on its own is a tribute to director David Fincher and novelist Larsson.<br/><br/>""Evil shall with evil be expelled.""

"secondtake","8","7","13","8 April 2012"," It's long, it's intense, it's abusive, it's fascinating, and it has some acute acting
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)<br/><br/>It's hard to just take this movie straight up--it's a very close and really excellent remake of an excellent and probably slightly more incisive Swedish original movie by the same name, and based on a book (three books actually) that a lot of people have read. But in one sentence, let me try. <br/><br/>The newer ""Girl¬Ö"" is a tightly made, well seen, well acted, beautifully situated historical crime drama hampered by a little too much complexity, leading to too much explaining and not enough plain old happening. <br/><br/>The best of the film is brilliant stuff, fast and vigorous, compelling as much as the first version. The worst of the film repeats some problems of the first version, including abuse of the characters that borders on the sadistic. <br/><br/>A couple comparisons will help even those who haven't seen the 2009 film. Daniel Craig is a more handsome and a bit more polished an actor than the Swedish leading man, Michael Nyquist, but Nyquist is frankly more believable, more Swedish (of course), and a genuine original.<br/><br/>The two women who play the title character are an interesting parallel, their names even with odd echoes--Rooney and Noomi. Rooney Mara (a New Yorker with a pretty good accent) is the 2011 girl with the dragon tattoo, and her tattoo may be less impressive, but her intensity is in place. She gives the movie its ultimate edge. Noomi Rapace, a native Swede though of mixed background, has some edge in personality, a slightly quirky violence and a more believable detachment from people around here, going beyond simply refusing to shake anyone's hand. Rapace's performance is completely memorable, and as good as Mara is (and she is really good), Rapace is better--more distinctive, more beautifully awkward, and even, in the end, more convincing. Check it out--the first movie of the Swedish trilogy only, however.<br/><br/>There is something frankly weird about Fincher's whole enterprise when the Swedish original is so good, and so Fincher-esque already. Yes, Fincher adds more atmosphere, including some very ""Seven"" inspired rain and music (Trent again, with a Led Zeppelin twist over the astonishing and deflecting visuals in the opening credits). But what really is to be gained by remaking the movie so soon, and with such little original input? It's almost a grad student exercise with a superstar's production budget. (The answer, sadly, might be that they wanted to cash in on the phenomenon of the trilogy before it was too late, remembering the American public's aversion to movies with subtitles. It has made $100 million in profit so far.)<br/><br/>So we end up analyzing Fincher's ""Dragon Tattoo"" indirectly. It was made to echo the Oplev version from just two years earlier, and it does. Scene by scene, you'll find overlaps, and interesting shifts, and there must be a web page out there that compares the two movies. For me, having seen each movie once, the really big differences are: 1) a more taut, spare (and Swedish?) relationship between the two leads in the first version, which is really the core of the movie beyond the sensationalist Nazi/rape/money plot, and 2) a highly different ending in both feel and significance (which I won't give away).<br/><br/>Let's say you haven't seen either film. What to do? Well, if you love Fincher already, you'll want to see how he's doing. But if you want a movie with a little more space to it, a little less glitz and a little more honest intensity in the characters, see the Swedish one. If you see both, which isn't really necessary (they're incredibly similar), you might note the American version cost $90 million to make and the Swedish only $13."

","From the terrifying , but fertile mind of Stieg Larsson, arrives this unusual, dark Gothic story from which the strange black novel was created. Having read the book, then seeing the visual adaption, one can see why director David Fincher did not adhere too closely to the murder/mystery story. This is one of those interesting films which attracts you because of the main star, Daniel Craig who plays disgraced novelist Mikael Blomkvist, then entertains you with scenes which are not for the faint of heart. The story begins as a film of a writer who writes an expose on a wealthy individual and fails, only to have himself dragged through the courts and ruined. He is soon recruited by a wealthy industrialist who hires him to write a biography of his strange family, and in doing so, to investigate a 40 year old mystery. When he needs help Mikael employs a superb cyber hacker who furnishes him with information which takes him far beyond where he began. Although a mystery movie, the film becomes a journey through a nightmarish world of intrigue and murder. Rooney Mara is superb as computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Martin Vanger add mystery and intrigue to an otherwise great movie. Indeed, in time this could very well become as Classic!. Well done. ****"

","This was the first film I watched after seeing The Hunger Games, and it may sound weird, but in comparison this felt like a ""real film"". I haven't read the book or seen the Swedish version, but this film definitely made me interested in seeing it (and its sequels) which is all you can really ask for in an adaptation. In stark contrast Hunger games didn't give me any interest in reading the book, strengthening the quality of this film.<br/><br/>Fincher made some brilliant choices in this film that could have easily gone unnoticed, for example when Lisbeth is about to be raped the camera pulls away from the room and fades to black. In a lesser film this would be the end of the scene, but Fincher throws us right back into it by cutting back into the room and forcing us to witness the rape. It's a great way to manipulate the audience expectations, and it reminded me of something Akira Kurosawa said: ""The role of the artist is to not look away"". In this scene alone Fincher proves his artistry.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the story is a bit slow paced in the beginning but it does a nice job of luring you into the two story-lines. Hopefully they will make the other two films."

","I love this haunting, beautiful movie, it is one of my all time favourites and I can't wait until it is available on DVD. Having watched the Swedish version first, I was very impressed and surprised by how good this American adaptation actually is.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is excellent as the journalist Mikael Blomkvist and plays the understated leading man role to perfection. Rooney Mara is compelling as the dangerous and damaged computer hacker and, strangely for an American movie, plays the role with even more perversion than her Swedish counterpart, something I didn't think was possible. <br/><br/>The opening credit scene and score is amazing and will stay with me for a long time."
"notchjonson360","10","7","13","3 January 2012"," Brilliant film - I've seen it twice already and may go a third
","Firstly I want to say that prior to seeing this film I had not read the book or seen the original film, so I can't be too much of a judge on how it relates to either. However, I have now seen the original film.<br/><br/>I want to quickly say that it appears that most of the negative reviews are coming from die-hard fans of the original film, or people seemingly offended or upset by some of the harder-hitting scenes in the film. I would advise that if you are easily distressed by graphic/violent scenes then this film may not be for you.<br/><br/>As for the die-hard fans of the Swedish version, by all means go and watch the film, but think about what you expect from it and also think before you share your bias opinion in a review which may influence whether a reader watches a great film. <br/><br/>The big issue with the remake for many is the matter of Rooney Mara versus Noomi Rapace. I personally prefer the way Rooney Mara portrays Lisbeth. I like how she doesn't give a f*** about what people think about her. Excuse the language, but in relation to the character there really is no other way to put it! I like her insane side, which is obviously a consequence of her difficult life. I like her appearance more than I like Noomi's. Mara's Lisbeth is less conventionally attractive which helps to give the effect that she is not a socially ""normal"" person. <br/><br/>Overall she seems more ruthless in this version, I don't care if this doesn't ring true to the original or to the book, it's the type of character I prefer. I love when revenge is at the heart of the plot, some of my favourite films are Taken, Man on Fire and the 24 series. While the main plot isn't focused entirely on this, there are moments where getting ""justice"" is prominent. Fans of the original may hate me for this, but Lisbeth is a bad-ass and makes a great character this way.<br/><br/>Craig also makes a better Blomkvist in my opinion. The interaction between Mikael and Lisbeth is clearly an effort for the both of them, but in this version there are moments of dry humour which I think improves the relationship between the characters. Again, this may not be true to the book or the original, but I think by now you will have gathered that I do not care much for the differences with either, just that this is a great adaptation. <br/><br/>Another reason I liked the film is that it definitely didn't pull any punches. Although both films are given a 18 certificate in the UK, the remake is much harder-hitting. I think this is because if you put a rape scene in any film it is likely to warrant an 18 certificate. The remake just took it further and made several scenes more graphic. Now before you brand me as some kind of sadist, I did not get any pleasure from the rape scene in either of the films. However, it is much much much more powerful in the remake than it is the in first, which just enhances the tone of the film and also makes you consider more the effect it has on Lisbeth. She doesn't sit around and cry for the rest of the film, which understandably would seem to be the ""normal"" reaction, but Lisbeth isn't normal. She goes out, gets a tattoo (presumably to remind her of the incident, which makes you think even more about her past and her other tattoos) then gets cold-blooded revenge.<br/><br/>What helps to make the scene so effective is the music. The soundtrack to this film is brilliant in my opinion, it helps to build the atmosphere of the film so much, which I feel it didn't do in the original. The exception to this of course being the opening credits, which where hugely out of place considering the tone and pace of the opening of the film.<br/><br/>A lot of criticism seems to be coming from the direction that there are differences in the plot that don't make sense for fans of the original, such as why Henrik doesn't explain to Mikael that he knew Harriet from his childhood. In the original it gives him a reason to stay, he has a prison sentence to be serving in 6 months, without that personal element to the assignment it may not seem plausible for him to stay, as the only rewards for him would be financial and satisfying his own curiosity. But of course in the remake he only needs to pay compensation, so the money he would receive from Henrik and also the information on Wennerstrom are ample incentive for him. Any inclusion of a personal matter would have affected the character that Fincher was trying to create in Blomkvist. <br/><br/>At this point I will recognise that I do not speak Swedish, so a certain amount of the chemistry and interaction between the characters from the original would have been lost on me. However, that for me is reason enough for there to be a remake in the first place. That is also the reason that I prefer this film, the language issue is too large to be ignored, and the remake was naturally going to be my favourite because it makes the film and the characters so much more accessible. I'm not denying that the original is a great film, I will be buying it soon and without a doubt watching it several times, but I just preferred the remake much more. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, the film is brilliant and if certain people can't see past the differences to the original then that's on them, I'm sorry they couldn't enjoy the film."

","*****MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO******<br/><br/>I was watching this movie on a Christmas night. I had a long day and I wanted to relax and enjoy a movie with a large crowd. I do not know if I can say that I enjoyed this, per say. It was entertaining when they got to the mystery of the girl. But, I did not care much about the back story of the Girl with the Dragon tattoo. Don't get me wrong, Rooney Mara could not have been better, but I just did not like her character. I am one of those people who have not read the book, so I can not base it on how it was compared to the book. However, I can still judge the movie as it is, without comparing it to the book. <br/><br/>It was a lot longer than it needed to be. There was about an extra 20 minutes of footage after the mystery that was solved, as it felt like it was trying to be longer than it needed to be. Daniel Craig was good as the Swedish mystery solver. I did not care much for his accent, though. It seemed as if it was going between a British and Swedish accent. Or, as I call it, a Switish accent. Rooney Mara, as I said, was brutally good in this. But there was something else brutal in this movie, that I thought was really unnecessary-The sex scenes. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara is forced to have sexual relations in order to get money. One time she is tied down on a bed, while getting raped. Full nudity included. That scenes especially was so graph that I could not stand to watch it. It was so explicit that it basically seemed like porn. You see the man licking her behind, sticking his nose into her buttocks. I usually do read the parental guidance before going to see this movie, but I made the mistake of not. I did read, however, that the nudity was graphic, but I did not know that it was this graphic. This was NC-17 material. The scene felt like went on forever. Way longer than needed. <br/><br/>I do not think that this is David Fincher's best in my opinion. I thought both the Social Network and Zodiac were far more better and entertaining. I thought this movie had potential but fell a little flat. I do not know whether I would have felt this way if I read the book or not, but I did not. So this was my end result coming out of the movie."

Actually the movie could have been better if it didn't contain this incest part. The mystery is all about the incest and that's why Harriet, the missing girl, disappeared 40 years ago. Nothing too much for a thriller. The mystery could have been something other than sick incest and then it would have been more entertaining. Howon earth this movie can be watched sitting right beside my daughter? - No you can't. It's so embarrassing. Besides, the movie needs to be edited to shorten it's duration.

","I really-really wanted to like this movie. After watching the trailer I expected to see a great suspense movie, with a complex and intriguing story. Well, to be honest, this movie is worth watching for Rooney Mara and the intro song..otherwise this is a mediocre movie, way too long, way too slow, lacking thrill and suspense..The story was pointlessly complicated-sometimes I wasn't exactly sure what's going on or where the story was going (ex.: Why did Lisbeth start sleeping with Mikael? That left a big question mark in my case... Not to mention that it practically came out of nowhere..) The ending was horrible-it wasn't even an ending, it was like David Fincher got bored of shooting the movie, and suddenly stopped with it..As I mentioned before, Rooney Mara was the main reason to watch this movie-her acting was terrific, she was very well chosen for the role of Lisbeth Salander. She managed to impersonate this vulnerable yet tough girl, full of rage and anger. She did a great job, considering the fact that this was a pretty difficult role, because of the amount of nudity and the rape scenes. I loved her character, although it wasn't necessarily likable. One of my main disappointments regarding this movie was David Dencik's ridiculously short screen time-it was like thirty second..!!!He's an incredibly talented actor, with loads of potential, so why give him such a minor role? All in all, I was disappointed-it's just another overrated (8.1?!) big budget pretentious cr*p from Hollywood..."
"dierregi","4","9","18","5 February 2012"," Serial killers should stop using Bible references
","It is difficult to review a movie with such a dense narrative and multi-layered references. As almost everybody knows, the story is based on a best-selling trilogy of novels, written by a Swedish journalist. Based on the novels, Swedish TV produced a mini-series of six episodes.<br/><br/>I saw the whole thing and was underwhelmed. Enough to put me off from reading the novels. Theoretically, the author aimed at glorifying his strong heroine, Lisbeth Salander, who manages to thrive despite the physical and mental violence she has to endure. In the Swedish series, Lisbeth comes across as an unpleasant weirdo bent on revenge (even if most rightfully so) and not so much as a role-model for battered women.<br/><br/>This movie summarizes what in the Swedish series is two longish episodes. Inevitably, much had to be cut off. Unfortunately, I doubt I could have followed the movie without having previously watched the series.<br/><br/>The first part of this long story deals with introducing unorthodox leading lady Lisbeth and her partner, disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Their meeting is catalyzed by a weird investigation on a missing girl. Unfortunately, this investigation is not much more than a rehash of the ""closed room"" investigations from many thrillers of the past. To make things more ""modern"" we have rape and serial killers thrown in in what is a very trivial background.<br/><br/>Forty years before the beginning of our story, a young girl named Harriet Vanger, disappears from a small island. The island belongs to the Vanger family, each and every member being on it the day of her disappearance, to increase the number of suspects. Her uncle Henrik seems to be the only one upset by her disappearance, but he still waits quite a long time before reopening the case.<br/><br/>Henrik Vanger assigns the investigation to Mikael, after having had his background researched by the company that employs Lisbeth as an ""investigator"" and hacker. In turn, Mikael asks for Lisbeth help to solve the alleged murder mystery.<br/><br/>The mystery revolves around the"" usual"" serial killer who goes around leaving clues based on the Bible. I lost count on how many times I saw an investigator solving a case by ""finally"" deciphering obscure numerical clues by cross-checking the Bible. This is sloppy narrative. Unfortunately, also the other main point of the movie ‚Äì the battles of fierce Lisbeth against abusing men ‚Äì is equally disappointing.<br/><br/>Compared to its Swedish counterpart, this American version is much more opulent and visually brilliant. Interiors and exteriors are sleek, polished and expensive-looking. Both main characters are played by actors a lot better looking than the Swedish ones. However, they lack credibility. The Lisbeth played by Rooney Mara is accurately styled as a post-punk heroine, wearing trendy clothes and jewelery. The one played by Swedish Rapace, was more a Joan Jet of the poor, looking disheveled and not styled at all.<br/><br/>I am sure many will appreciate this movie as a stand-alone thriller, because of its sleek visuals and recognizable basic plot (the Bible serial killer), missing completely the intricacies, plot twists and convoluted heaviness of the whole series."
"nazztrader","4","9","18","6 January 2012"," Verbose, ornate, scattered, and unappealing, but otherwise...
","It seems as though the idea was to cram as much into this film as possible, with predictable results. For example, was there a need to appeal to people who like ""Mission Impossible"" type movies? And mysteries that go back to Sherlock Holmes, if not beyond that? And Lara Croft kinds of things? Are you into S&M? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Did you enjoy ""The Boys From Brazil?"" What about Abby from ""NCIS?"" You like her, right? She's in here too !<br/><br/>Because of this muddle (though it's quite stylish), it's hard to feel much for the characters - it's just not realistic to have all these elements come together at one moment in time. I would have liked some backstory on Lisbeth, and I would have given up the murder mystery, the social worker who was a despicable torturing rapist, and a few other things, to get it. Then there are all the sex scenes, because I guess the ""soft core"" crowd needed to get their ""beaks wet"" too, right? And then there is all the talking. It's almost like the director wanted the audience to begin to nod off before the next ""exciting"" thing happened, so that they wouldn't realize what a ludicrous concoction this is !<br/><br/>The sad thing is that it appeared that everything was available to make an excellent film here. Why not focus on the Lisbeth character? Oh, then the ""masses"" wouldn't be satisfied because it wouldn't be a ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" film, right? Are you sure? I think times might be changing, and if so, this might be regarded as a kind of cinematic dinosaur in the near future ! I often find myself hoping that reviewers would explain what he/she would have done differently if that person doesn't like the film.<br/><br/>So, here is my idea: I'll take the basic idea, though make the ""bigger story"" one of simple government corruption, not an elaborate murder mystery. Lisbeth can keep her motorcycle, tattoos, nose rings, etc., but she is not a computer genius. You'll see flashbacks of how she was abused during her childhood. Though she is living as a lesbian, she finds herself drawn to Blomkyist, and there is at least some sexual component to it. There is obvious tension about this, and that is the major thought-provoking aspect to the film. That is, she finds a man (I'd cast someone a bit younger) who is the opposite of what she is used to, and she reconsiders her sexuality. I would have created an ambiguous ending, but in the DVD age, I'd also create a few others and let viewers make what they wish of them.<br/><br/>Note: I did see the original too, and perhaps because it felt more ""foreign,"" the believability issue seemed less noticeable, but I also thought that it needed to be ""slimmed"" down and given more focus. This screams out for mini-series treatment, but I guess there's a lot less money involve in that kind of project."
"inspektorr","10","10","21","30 December 2011"," Epic cinematic misery that will keep you grabbing the armchair
","Two years after seeing the original Swedish films, I couldn't wait for the Girl with the dragon tattoo to hit the theaters. Ever since that incredible first trailer burned into my retinas, I had a feeling this remake wouldn't fail. And not only it didn't fail, it delivered with style, grit and dark edginess I was hoping for. The cast is pretty much spot on. Daniel Craig, with a few extra pounds, gives an impressive and convincing role of a journalist Mikael Blomkvist. Compared to Michael Nyquist from the original trilogy, which performance I enjoyed very much, Craig is definitively up to the task.<br/><br/>Of course, all eyes are on Rooney Mara playing Lisbeth Salander - an incredibly complex, solitary and traumatized hacker, who is hired to help Blomkvist solve a 40 year old mystery. Mara is simply amazing in portraying Lisbeth, both visually and emotionally, it's such a believable performance that after a while you simply cannot imagine her not being Lisbeth in real life.<br/><br/>Cinematically, Fincher leads the movie with strings of superbly done shots, great dialogs and occasional shocker scenes that will get the hair on your neck stand up. While the run-time of 2 and a half hours may seem long, the time simply flies by and you end up wanting the movie to never end.<br/><br/>I only have two small complaints: first is casting Sarsgard as Martin Vanger. While I love Skarsgard and have seen many of his movies, for someone who's even slightly familiar with his work, there will be no doubt about what happens at the end. Second is about Lisbeth Salander character. While I can not praise Mara's performance enough, I have to say that Noomi Rapace in the original movie was more ""manly"". I know that it may not make much sense, but little details in walking, expressions and gestures made Rapace even more detached from any feminine characteristic. Rapace's performance made me feel that Lisbeth was so troubled and traumatized that she had lost almost any feeling of connection to humanity. For example, I loved the fact that Noomi in original movie had unshaven armpits. It was such a small detail, but it instantly made you realize just how messed up her life is. While Mara is astonishing as Lisbeth, there's no mistake that she's a woman - albeit damaged, but still feminine enough.<br/><br/>Many have mentioned violence and some other ""tough to swallow"" scenes. Honestly, they will make you feel really uncomfortable, but that's the point. They are not gore, they're not glorified and are certainly there for a good reason. Ommiting them would be a big mistake.<br/><br/>One more thing - the intro scene is pure audio-visual orgasm. I can hardly think of anything I enjoyed watching more on big screen then those first few minutes.<br/><br/>Overall - 10/10. And watch the originals as well."
"Foxbot","10","10","21","27 December 2011"," A Highly Entertaining, Smart, Fast-Paced, Dark Murder Mystery
","I have seen the Swedish films, yet not read the books. The US version is not a remake of the Swedish version; it is simply another adaptation of the novel. I must say I was very impressed with the pacing and over-all style and raw feeling of the US version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The story, whether from the books, Swedish version or US version is quite a dark and winding journey. If you have not read the books or watched the Swedish versions I recommend now starting with the US version of the film. This US version will be the first of the trilogy; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.<br/><br/>The opening credit sequence, as I'm sure many of you have heard is quite amazing. I loved it and all the work they put into it. It was very Bond like yet encompassed the dark complexities of this story and the film. This film is much more speedy than the Swedish versions. I found the Swedish films to be a little slow at times, which yes builds tension however the pacing of the US version is much more my speed. Very fast and smart.<br/><br/>It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.<br/><br/>When it comes to the characters, I found that Rooney Mara played a much better Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace. And the interactions with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) were great and at times quite funny. The two of them working together when they seem to be opposites was very entertaining and Daniel and Rooney pulled it off perfectly. As a huge fan of the new Bond reboots I have grown to love Daniel Craig and enjoy seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give the audience what they want. Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Christopher Plummer and Robin Wright also did a great job, as well as the other cast members. Each character was very carefully cast and bond perfectly to the heart of this film.<br/><br/>The story, the acting, the directing; everything was perfect and I must say that director David Fincher is at the top of his game. For those who do not know, he directed Fight Club, Se7en, The Game, Zodiac, The Social Network, Alien 3, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Panic Room. The music, the ambiance, and the over-all dark feel to the film was so well done I couldn't believe it. I could not have asked for a better-crafted film. I am quite anxious to see the rest of the trilogy."
"threenails10","10","10","21","20 December 2011"," David Fincher crafts yet another masterpiece
","Right from the start of this films opening titles, I was taken back to when I had first watched 'Fight Club'. The opening title sequence for this film was even more exhilarating to watch than that of the one opening for Fight Club. The rest of the film was a journey into the greatness that has made Fincher films almost a household name by now. <br/><br/>It is easy to say that this was better than the Swedish version of this film, and partly thanks to the performance by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. I can't say that I have ever been more attracted to a character on film than in this one. Even though, she is quite the bad-ass and about as tomboy as they come, I couldn't help but be engaged by every scene she was in. <br/><br/>On another note, this is not an easy film to watch. It does contain a scene of rape and a couple acts of sexual assault on top of that. With all these coming together to form something almost as disturbing as the scene from the lesser know film by Gaspar Noe 'Irreversible'. <br/><br/>Everything is perfectly shot here as well, and really does have the 'David Fincher' touch, although, this film felt about the least Hollywood-ised of all his pictures. Fans of the Swedish Trilogy will not be let down here. This is about as intense as crime thrillers get, and for those who call this a remake, for them, this is without a doubt the best remake I think I have seen on screen. Nothing falls into place like you think it will, and as the film ends, I felt a knot in my stomach, and wished I could know the character Lisbeth in real life. <br/><br/>The score here done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is again Oscar worthy after winning last year for their work on Finchers other film, 'The Social Network'. It does have similar tones here, but all in all comes out totally fresh in every scene.<br/><br/>Overall, this is easily one of the best films of the year. This could have also been easily predicted coming from me, considering my likeness for David Fincher films. Fincher was responsible for me partly coming to love for films back in 1999 with his film 'Fight Club', which took 1/3 of the reason why I came to love movies in the first place (also in there, Stanley Kubricks 'Eyes Wide Shut', and Sam Mendes', 'American Beauty' ‚Äîall from 1999) and this film shows that Fincher is indeed one of the best filmmakers in the business today."

I believe this is a very capable franchise, and since the books themselves were so great and well read it would be very easy to give us more into the world of these fascinating characters. You may need to pay close attention to understand it, but it is without a doubt a classic, one of the few that is put out during the yearly one hundred or so crap films. That being said, to the writers and director, PLEASE MAKE MORE. Thank you, from a satisfied movie fan."

He just doesn't have the depth and complexity for this part. <br/><br/>I generally like Fincher's stuff but this one is just a yawn."
"basilisksamuk","4","6","11","26 September 2012"," Not the Lisbeth Salander we know and love
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is visually pleasing as you would expect from David Fincher. The music is very good if you like Trent Reznor's soundtracks, and I do. (However, the cover of Immigrant Song for the titles, not to mention the Bond visuals seemed totally inappropriate to me.) <br/><br/>From there though it all goes downhill rapidly. Every clue you need to work out pretty much the whole solution is given in the first 24 minutes and yes, I did check. So instead of giving the audience a satisfying puzzle to solve everything is signalled and removes any tension. There are plenty of other concessions for the hard of thinking too. For instance, all the suspects' houses are visible from Henrik's house and the chief suspect's house perches atop a cliff making it look like a modern version of Frankenstein's castle.<br/><br/>Although I like Daniel Craig's work, especially as Bond, he is wasted here and comes a poor second to Michael Nyqvist in the original film. The same is true of Rooney Mara who can't match Noomi Rapace's portrayal. All the important beats from the original film and book are mangled ‚Äì Blomvkist's prison sentence is ignored, his relationship with Erika isn't explained, the dire straits that Millennium finds itself in is skated over, the importance of hacking is treated trivially, Plague isn't featured as Lisbeth's friend. And on and on it goes. Most fatally there is a failure to better explain Lisbeth's background and character. She seems like a subsidiary character in Fincher's version and she should be at least as important as Blomvkist. Often she comes over as rather weak here and the line ""Can I kill him now?"" would never be uttered by Lisbeth as conceived by Stieg Larsson.<br/><br/>I don't believe that movies should just follow the books they are based on but I do think they should keep to the spirit of the original characters. I'm always prepared to give remakes of foreign language films a chance but here, once again, it has turned out to be as pointless as I feared it would be.<br/><br/>Stick with the original"

","One of the biggest things with this remake, was if Mara could play this role made iconic by Noomi Rapace. You'll have to answer that one for yourself, if you're even willing to watch both versions. If you ask me, it was tough watching Mara at first, because she went in a completely different direction with it, than Noomi did. But as the movie progressed, I started digging what she was doing with the character. It still would be tough to name a ""winner"", I'd say I like both women and both characters they showed on screen.<br/><br/>Overall and after watching the original Swedish movie again, in the longer TV cut this time, I have to admit, I think Fincher improved on the Swedish film. Of course you can always try to argue with his choices (like why not change location, why let the main actors talk English most of the time and other things), but that wouldn't be a good way to spend your time. It's better to watch it and enjoy his version of the movie (though ""enjoy"" might stretch it at times, because the movie does not pull any punches!).<br/><br/>Having said that, I'm curious why there is no connection to the original movie showing up here on IMDb. Is it that obvious that no one thought of putting it in the details? I'm not sure what happened there, though I'm sure someone will change it (it's almost April 2012, let's see how long it'll take).<br/><br/>Comparing the two adaptations of the novel (which I haven't read), I can tell you that there are differences. Smaller ones (plot points and other things), but also time framing and character points. I can only recommend this, because it is a great thriller indeed!"
"mesowetodit","5","6","11","27 March 2012"," Good in parts, Not Great as a Whole, Worse than the Swedish version
","This is my first review, as it is my first complete going over of the three items related to this story; The book, the Swedish film and the American film, and in that order of consumption. The book was absolutely a blast to read. Highly recommended to read the book, skip either of the movies, unless you are curious to put the face to the characters like me. Great intrigue, details, character development, etc. <br/><br/>The Swedish film was dry, perhaps the subtitles? The actors did not portray the characters as well as the American actors. For the American version, I felt as if it was incomplete altogether. The film left out/skipped a lot of details, although it was not important for the over all story, I felt the parts skipped was important for background and character development. If you did not read the book, one would find it strange why Lisbeth can warm up to Mikael so quickly. There were many parts like this that would confuse a person who did not read the book, and leaving little room for a movie viewer to feel any emotions towards the character. Mikael and Lisbeth were my favorite characters in the book, but I did not get the same reactions from either movie. They were just empty vessels carrying the story along. <br/><br/>Perhaps there were too many details and it would make the movie too long...unfortunately I do not see a directors cut in the release, so its clear to say for movie goers, this is pretty much it. As for the actors, the most impressive of them all was Rooney Mara. She portrayed Lisbeth much closer to the book character than the Swedish film's actor, Noomi Rapace. Rooney was pale, skinny, dark, sad. Daniel Craig and Michael Nyqvist(Swedish) was just plain old boring, with Nyqvist a bit more emotions displayed, where as Craig's acting was the same old 007 look throughout the entire movie. The other two American actors that made great contributions to this version was Christopher Plummer, splendid as always in his role, and Stellen Skarsgard, whom always fit the villain part deliciously.<br/><br/>Each important part of the movie was well done in both movies. The information necessary for the viewer to understand how the resolution of the mystery came about was filmed well. However, the ending of the American version did NOT follow the book, for which I was a bit disappointed. Steven Zaillian, screenwriter for this movie felt: "" ""I wasn't trying to do something different or trying to fix something,"" says Zaillian. ""I just thought it was a good idea. when I read the book, I thought, 'Why are we going so far afield for this mystery to be resolved? Might it be a little more interesting if it's solved a little closer to home?' That's all there was to it. I kind of felt it was right for the character.""<br/><br/>(from: http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/12/25/dragon-tattoo-movie- changing-ending/)<br/><br/>With this particular ending...I am not sure how or if they will continue with the filming of the next two books. Personally I thought it was rather important how the booked ended it. The Swedish version's ending kept with the book. Thanks for reading, hope this helps."

","The girl with the dragon tattoo is by far one of the best films I have seen in years, many years. It felt as if I was watching 2 movies at the same time. Crime detective work with a feel of a documentary all mixed together in such a way that I truly couldn't wait to see what happened next. I found myself playing along, wondering who was the killer, who was the hero and who in the family were the sociopaths.<br/><br/>When the story focused on Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig) at the beginning I felt as if I was watching a true crime thriller in which there was an obvious foe in which this story would revolve around. Very shortly I was enthralled with Lisbeth Salander(Rooney Mara). I suddenly was watching a docudrama that sucked me in even deeper. I couldn't help but feel pure joy when she confronted her foe. I was feeling emotions that I rarely have felt watching a movie. Never before have I felt so emotional for a character, not just feeling sorry and sadness but excitement, happiness, pleasure and surprisingly a massive adrenaline rush. It was pure. It was jealousy. I wanted more.<br/><br/>Once the two ""good guys"" teamed up and the story had thickened even more I got pulled in even more, so much so that I didn't want this movie to end. I cheered, literally cheered out loud when they got together. I felt as if this wasn't just a story being told in a movie by some actors but as if they were real people, living, breathing, real people.<br/><br/>Towards the end when Mikael was caught and taken to the ""pleasure room"" the suspense of it all was truly vicious, so vicious that I was actually sitting on the edge of my seat. That moment when Lisbeth came in I surprised myself by feeling relief, relief that her love, the guy that was going to fix her life and give her back all the things her father stole from her as a girl was safe, safe because of her.<br/><br/>Of course however there is one thing that held this movie back from being in the top 3 all time favorite movies of mine. What is it you may wonder and I shall tell you. The End. Yes, the very end of the movie, the last 15 seconds of this movie enraged me, saddened me, just plain broke my heart. I have loved and lost and the pain I felt in the aftermath came back, hit me right in the chest. Even now as I type this I still feel sadness for Lisbeth AND Mikael for they had what few rarely get. TRUE LOVE. The last 15 seconds turned an amazing crime thriller/docudrama into nothing more then a tragedy, as if it was something straight from William Shakespeare himself.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours about this movie and it will definitely will consume hours of my life in the near future when I discuss it with my brother.<br/><br/>In closing I give this movie a 9 out of 10. It captured me and truly made me feel as if I was a part of this story. It allowed me to feel what I haven't felt in along time, and that folks is what a good movie should do."

","I don't usually watch Hollywood remakes but since it was directed by Fincher I thought why not! I was a little disappointed with Fincher's version of Girl with a Dragon Tattoo. Sorry to say but I think the original Swedish version is way better than this, the characters, performances, the story line and everything else. Niomi Rapace was much better than Rooney Mara, she was convincing and you begin to like the character and feel sorry for her once you get to know her in the movie, didn't feel the same way about Rooney Mara. What's with the stupid haircut and shaved eyebrows, did she really have to look so silly & unattractive? Also the relationship between Mikael & Lisbeth is somewhat strange in this version, couldn't make much sense of it. Again Nyqvist was more convincing in that role than Mr bond with no real expressions. Henrik Vanger, one of the main characters in the film only appears in the beginning and then in the end, was Mr Plummer busy shooting another film? At times it appears like American characters placed in Sweden. There is nothing surprising or intelligent about this version and there is no depth in rest of the characters. The only thing I found convincing was Lisbeth rides a Harley Davidson instead of a dirt bike, being a goth n all.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched the Swedish version or read the book then you might like it but I would strongly recommend the original. I am a Fincher fan and loved his previous films seven, fight club, Benjamin button and also the social network but didn't feel the same about this one. sorry finch!"

","The 2009 version had a much better story and was far more raw, rugged, and compelling. I was incredibly disappointed by this Hollywood retake. The acting in this version was solid which is to be expected from the 5 star cast on display here. However this story really lacked by comparison, it dragged on and on to the point of boredom. In this versions its characters didn't interact into this film story much during its course. They were given little time outside of its main two characters, Rooney and Craig who interacted with each other to much. Also a lot of the elements here seemed to be cut out and were made differently. This took away a lot of the edge and mystery of the original film.<br/><br/>I am curious on how Fincher takes the next two books in the trilogy, although with this film the original 2009 version was better.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10"
"cuteasfunk","6","6","11","1 January 2012"," Not as simple as it might appear
","I have now seen both films but haven't read the books. It would be so easy to dismiss the US film with caustic comments about Hollywood redoing international films for the worse, but I think this is more complex than that.<br/><br/>The first film had flaws, maybe not of pace but of character development. This version does provide some exposition of the principles and their behaviour. But the Swedish film tells the plot better and more intensely. I remember the scenes revealing the murders elsewhere in Sweden, far better in the original rather than Fincher's which were almost impressionistic. <br/><br/>I liked the development of Lisbeth in the final scene. It is irrelevant whether it is accurate with the books because in context it is more reasonable that Lisbeth feels something for Mikael because he doesn't demand anything of her...and entirely plausible when she reacts by throwing the leather jacket away and driving off.<br/><br/>Fincher's film is more beautifully shot for sure. But was that worth the enormous budget and is that not the greater travesty, that the studios and the directors believe that we need sumptuous visual spectacle to follow an original disturbing story? I appreciate both visual presentation and challenging story line and plot development, but one very rarely gets it....because a true original yet disturbing story would not usually attract such a large budget.<br/><br/>Go see this film it's not perfect but if you are so dumb you can't watch sub titles then this film might just shake you out of your intellectual torpor"
"agmoldham","5","6","11","30 December 2011"," I wanted to enjoy this more than I did
","I have read the Millennium books and seen a couple of reviews saying the film was quite different to the books. Although there are a couple of plot changes these are quite minor and I thought the film was pretty faithful to the book. The slight problem you have when you read the book that a film is based on is that you have already imagined what the characters and scenes should look like. You therefore can't help but go through a check-list as you watch the film. <br/><br/>In terms of the lead actors there's no doubt that Rooney Mara is excellent playing the role of Lisbeth. She has had a very traumatic upbringing which will be expanded upon in the next couple of films. Daniel Craig is reasonable as Mikael and the supporting cast are also reasonable. There are some very difficult passages in the book and true to form Fincher hasn't shied away from these in the film. I noticed a few people in the audience were a little uncomfortable with some of the graphic sex scenes. The overall tone of the film is very monotone/dark and there's no doubt that this isn't accidental.<br/><br/>Overall I quite enjoyed the film, but couldn't help but think that I should have enjoyed it more. The film would have been better if they cut out 20 minutes or so during editing. The ending in particular was a little bit weak."
"DICK STEEL","4","11","24","31 December 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","There are remakes, and then some. Hollywood has been raiding cinema from around the world for creative inspiration. When all else fails, buy the rights and remake the movies for the US market, where chances are its mass audiences haven't chanced upon the originals since we all understand how popular the reading of subtitles is. not. Some remakes offer something a lot more than the original when set in the US context, such as Martin Scorsese's The Departed (adapting from Hong Kong's Infernal Affairs), or horror films with almost shot for shot remade with Matt Reeves' Let Me In (from Sweden's Let The Right One In), and now the psychological thriller The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo directed by Niels Arden Oplev being remade by David Fincher.<br/><br/>I am a fan of David Fincher's works, but alas I can't say with the same level of enthusiasm that his remake of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deserved any acknowledgement that it's much better than the original. Far from it, that's just hyperbole. Oplev's film had all the right elements that made it a great edge-of-your-seat ride, with Noomi Rapace bursting onto the scene owning the role of the social misfit Lisbeth Salander, with a sprawling narrative kept tight with interesting twists to the entire plot. Some remakes manage to turn what's great into something better, or at least met the benchmark set by the original, but David Fincher's derivative remake only managed to barely do so.<br/><br/>To those who have said that it's great, I think they do have to recognize the contribution that the late novelist Stieg Larsson had in coming up with his Millennium trilogy of novels and creating the characters of Mikael Blomkvist (now played by Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (in a role taken over by Rooney Mara), crime-busting partners who spend the first third of the story in separate arcs to establish them, before coming together as crime busting duos, with a predominant female being both the brains - photographic memory, great computer hacking skills - and the brawn between them. The romance is perfunctory to satisfy primal needs, although Fincher's version did try to provide a level of emotional attachment especially with the final scene.<br/><br/>Apart from the Bond-ish looking opening credits set against the music by Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song, and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score being one of the limited highlights of the film, this remake will bore the wits out of those who have seen the original. In other words, skip it and you won't be missing anything. I've watched my fair share of original movies and their remakes by Hollywood, but this remake somehow had its soul sucked out from it, resulting in a lifeless entity going from scene to scene that one will already know of, in how the story would develop, and what red herrings get strewn around. Minor tweaks got made but they're really no big deal, and the Nordic-accented English adopted by the characters will irritate as it tries so really hard to be authentic since the setting in Sweden didn't change to some US locale.<br/><br/>But to those who have not seen Oplev's film, then David Fincher's version will set to wow. You will marvel at Rooney Mara's rendition of Lisbeth who is very much unlike any heroine seen before on the big screen, but not to take away her efforts put into her role, should you compare her take and that of Rapace's, you will see that the former is just trying too hard, unlike Rapace's who came off with a natural spunk. Even Daniel Craig looked the meeker version of Michael Nyqvist's take as Mikael, with the updated Hollywood version looking like a very clean and polished product as compared to the grittier version of the original.<br/><br/>I sure would be interested to know how David Fincher's first cut of the film, reported to be three hours and seven minutes long, would have changed the mood and feel. Those scenes could have been the saving grace in making it distinctly different from the original, and value adding in terms of characters and plot. If the final scene here proved to be the bulk in spirit of the extra scenes shot, then it would be worth a watch. Otherwise if given the option to watch The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo for the first time, then stick to the Swedish original since the remake can't really beat the real thing."
"meechiganman","10","9","19","31 December 2011"," Rooney Mara and Lisbeth kicks ass and rocks out.
","NOTE: There's been a lot of discussion about comparing the Swedish and American versions, but all I will say here is that they are different creatures with different intended audiences and should in no way be held up against one another. <br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (GWDT) is a stark and gritty movie that stays very true to the source novel by Stieg Larsson while making some minor changes for movie-making limitation purposes. All-in-all, I would say that Fincher and Steven Zaillian do a good job of keeping, adapting and removing the various parts of the story from the novel in creating the movie. The dialogue is natural and flowing with just enough of the characters stepping on each other's lines to add a sense of authenticity to the conversations. Visually, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth does an excellent job of lighting and blocking the scenes, giving us viewers plenty to look at and providing sufficient visual cues to set the tone of each scene. The score/soundtrack is a wonder in itself, with brooding, haunting music that paints a picture for what we are supposed to expect without giving too much away. Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross weaves multiple layers and sprinkles in some dissonance to subtly affect how we feel about the characters and settings. GWDT is a feast for the senses! <br/><br/>Rooney Mara gives a tour de force performance as Lisbeth Salander, convincingly portraying a woman who has lived outside the norms of society and has no love for convention. Lisbeth is goth enough to have street-cred, but precise enough to be a talented geek. Rooney does an amazing job dancing the fine line between tragically defiant and certifiably cracked. I'm sure if/when Mara gives her Oscar acceptance speech she will give a nod to Noomi Rapace for first giving life to Lisbeth and setting the standard for her portrayal. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig plays a driven Mikael Blomkvist who is trying to regain his investigative mojo, and at the same time, rescusitate his reputation. Craig embues Blomkvist with charm and a sense of self-depreciation while at the same time showing us that Blomkvist is relentless and unyielding in his pursuit for the truth. <br/><br/>There are many good performances by a talented and well-chosen cast, with a laundry list of great character actors who all give spot-on portrayals. Christopher Plummer is a sparkling Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsgard creeps me out as Martin Vanger, Yorick Van Wageningen disgust us with his depravity, and Robin Wright (! looking good) is perfect as Erika Berger the lover and business partner of Blomkvist. <br/><br/>I've read the books, I watched the Swedish versions, I have listened to the soundtrack for weeks ahead of time, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed the American version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I can't wait for Lisbeth to kick some more ass!!<br/><br/>-----SPOILER------ One of the caveats that I would give to anyone interested in seeing GWDT is that there are some scenes that walk up to and maybe even step over the line between R and NC-17. The rape scene of Lisbeth by Bjurman and then Lisbeth's revenge on Bjurman are brutal and unnerving. Most of the violence and assault are implied and not seen, but there is enough to disgust some people and I know more than a few viewers either turned away or even left the theater. However, I feel like those scenes are not gratuitous and are an integral part of pushing the story line and character development. Just be warned."

I admire Rooney Mara's very different portrayal, but this film is otherwise a sad shade of the remarkable first installment of the Swedish series. I pity the fool who thinks otherwise. Plot elements resonant with meaning in the original are here passed over or utterly dissociated. I'll not provide examples in this forum for fear of displaying too much information. Viewers can decide for themselves. I see nothing in this movie but greed. People can't be bothered to read subtitles?

","I've never read the books or knew about the Swedish movie versions so I had no idea what this movie was about only that Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer were in it. It moved very slowly and was quite boring as it fleshed out the characters .One particularly nasty scene of anal rape left me thinking what else can they do and before long the rapist himself gets stripped naked ,violated anally, painfully tattooed and beaten. OK now I get it ,this movie is dark violent and masochistic. One particularly unbalanced violent girl and a man who is hired to find out about a missing girl from 40 yrs ago come together and we have some unpleasant sex and violence along the way. Most of this movie is quite boring and quite frankly a waste of time. It takes a good hour or so before the 2 main protagonists even meet and by then I was yawning. The actress who plays Lisbeth I will say is amazing -for a really dark disturbing character she nails it even if the movie itself is crappy. She is smart and doesn't take crap from anyone ,a shame her character is not given much to do for the second half of the movie. I did not like the ending either ,it is abrupt and leaves you wondering about that 9 bucks you gave away to the theater cashier. I hope Rooney Mara gets nominated for something as she is the only thing good about this movie in a really underwritten role. Her performance is a 9/10 while the movie itself is a 2/10 ."

","Let me start off by saying that I went into this movie knowing next to nothing about its plot. I have never even picked up the book, and I never watched the Swedish version of the film, despite hearing enormous praise for both. With that being said, I was blown away with this movie.¬†<br/><br/>First and foremost, whether you like him or not, David Fincher makes good movies. You'd be hard-pressed to find a director that is more meticulous and intricate than he is. In the first hour of this movie, Fincher's extreme attention to detail is almost overwhelming. Not having any background knowledge of the story, I found myself struggling to keep up. I was lost with the story, I was confused about who these characters were, and to put it bluntly I felt totally in the dark. But the story reached its climax and Fincher shed light on it all. The story came together, I understood the nature of the characters, and I was impressed. All of a sudden, a story that I knew nothing about, made sense to me and I loved it. After the plot's unravelling I was totally glued and did not want the film to end.¬†<br/><br/>This isn't like most movies. Yeah, it's a murder mystery. Yes, it's a psychological thriller. And of course, it is ridden with gratuitous violence and sex. But it is also a love story. I went home and immediately watched the Swedish version, and I didn't feel the passion that I felt from Fincher's. It's true, Mara is not as ""strong"" or aggressive as Rapace, but that's what I loved. She's vulnerable. It was a remarkable performance on her part to capture the cold and ruthless side of Lizbeth, but at the same time expose the soft side as well.¬†I think Mara has turned in the best female acting performance of the year, and I hope she receives the credit she deserves.<br/><br/>I hope they complete the series because I'm riveted. I went again to only further appreciate the film's intricacies, and I can say that I'm hooked. This movie is well-acted, well-produced, and phenomenally executed. You will not be disappointed."

","I came across an interesting review of the Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" here: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/ The Swedish version is less annoying than the American version which unfortunately is formulaic. The review I read is spot on in reviewing character analysis and other artistic aspects. The American Dragon will undoubtedly appeal to newbies to the trilogy or those who don't like the pacing of foreign films. Still the Swedish original is usually the best place to start and the review that I suggest could get many more people interested in bothering to see the American version or even get people to take another look at European and other foreign films which are currently experiencing a renaissance. This will provide a good synopsis: http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/"
"MosHr","6","11","25","20 December 2011"," A bit disappointing for someone who has read the book
","First of all, why does Daniel Craig keep his British accent while everyone else in the movie does a Swedish accent? This gives the movie an Englishman in Sweden feel, instead of a wholly Swedish story feel. Maybe Daniel Craig got dropped into the movie at the last minute and maybe for that reason also, he never manages to quite capture Blomkvist properly, he's not the tired, financially ruined reporter whose career has just been destroyed escaping his problems, but he comes off as an strong, athletic, physical presence, headstrong and determined.<br/><br/>I admit that I finished reading the book right before seeing the movie and probably for that reason the movie felt more like a PBS re-enactment of the book rather than a feature film. The movie felt like it lacked style and when it did apply style, it felt grossly out of tone. For example, the James Bondesque opening ""immigrant song"" sequence which seems hardly appropriate for a sleepy murder mystery that aims to explore themes of sexual sadism, Nazism, anti-Semitism etc.<br/><br/>The original book is not without its faults, while brilliant in places the author filled in gaps with tripe. Nothing characterizes this more than Lisbeth which the author Larsson made into an Asperger's syndrome inflicted super-intelligent super-human. The movie version of Lisbeth is sexy and cool but cartoonish. There is no effort to elucidate Lisbeth and her actions, she just is cool and smart and that is all we get about her.<br/><br/>Having read the book probably puts me in a different category than a large portion of the audience for the movie. While it's never possible to tell a 400-page plus novel in a three hour movie, I really wished for style and focus rather than a quick retelling of the story. It's disappointing that the movie just aims to tell the story rather than take risks and explore themes and ambiances while visually telling the story. Finally as a side note, for those who read the book, the movie version eliminates the Australian sheep station, which leads to a change in the tone of certain characters from the book."

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. WOW!! Watched it 3 times today.

The snubbing of it for Best Picture at the Oscars vs. The Artist is as outrageous as Apocalypse Now in 1980. The snubbing of Rooney Mara vs. Meryl Streep in Iron Lady is as outrageous as snubbing Crowe for Denzel in 2002. Granted Denzel is great, but not against Crowe on that day. Granted Meryl is an all time great, but Iron Lady can't compete with a new type of character never seen before in cinema, and made very believable by Mara. This has happened before when movies are made specifically to win someone an Oscar, i.e.- Streep in Iron Lady, Denzel in Training Day, and Nicholson in As Good as It Gets vs. Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights which is a very similar scenario in which a never before seen character is made believable by a young actor. Between Best Picture and Best Actress snubs, this rivals the snub of Hitchcock for Best Director in Psycho."

"h-t-greeley","3","10","23","22 December 2011"," When Shocking becomes Storytelling
","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is poised as an enigmatic mystery-thriller of real cinematic and storytelling potential, with a superb cast and gripping performances to bet on. Filmgoers used to David Fincher, with similar titles such as ""Seven"" and ""The Game"" to his name, are all in a fuss to see what is next in the Fincher oeuvre. What we know of David Fincher, is that although he's created such classic films, he's always done it with a paintbrush not so famously modest. While we've always appreciated this granular and physical realism of his films, whether it was the violence in ""Fight Club"", or the crime scenes in ""Seven"", its appreciation was only served by its storytelling. Out of context, many scenes appear as almost manufactured gratuity, seemingly made just to shock audiences. Unfortunately what has happened in the ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is just that. The storytelling, narrative, and dialogue from the onset, follows through the film in a clumsy, nebulous, and poorly-written mess, making everything written seem just as bookends to a number of highly shocking scenes. These scenes, while may be factual to the original story, are what the director seems to have focused his creativity on. And all that comes out of it, not mincing words, is purely shocking rapist-pornography. If I were to write off the film for these scenes, which I think is enough, it would be too easy. Lisbeth, one of the central characters, whom is the victim in these disturbing scenes, is depicted from the onset as an almost completely unsympathetic character. She's introduced as an antisocial, mute, even creepy prodigy of her investigative craft and leaves the film just as cold as she came in (The last scene, although narratively intended to be sympathetic, didn't change the character's complete lack of pathos) Her emotions, even though apparently warm for Mikael (Daniel Craig), are not particularly warming for the audience, as her emotional depth, personality, and sexuality on screen seems more dark, twisted, and expressionless as the man who rapes her. The film successfully depicts her as a ""mute creep"", and a completely unlikable and unsympathetic character. While you may hear groundswell rumblings for a best-actress nomination for Lisbeth by passionate fans of the film, it's my impulse to remind that those usually nominated, and those that win, normally have one of two things in common: Sympathy or Empathy. Many ""heroes"" may have Sympathy. And many ""villains"" may have Empathy. We don't feel fellowship or pathos for a ""villain"" (i.e.: Sympathy), but we might understand their motivations and emotions (i.e.: Empathy), as however their successfully displayed (i.e.: Macbeth). The tragedy of Lisbeth is that she's depicted as a ""hero"" under the guise and manner of a particularly mute ""villain"", with the result being that she lacks either really any Sympathy or Empathy. The film, luring audiences as a potentially great and classic Mystery-thriller, with Fincher's exquisite eye and style, is nothing but barely a facade to shock audiences. <br/><br/>I feel personally terrible for all the families and children who could be going during this Christmas season to see it, under the impression that whatever R-rated scenes in the film will be negligible for what is successfully advertised as a possible classic-in-the-making of a very well-written Mystery. These scenes are X-rated material, I personally find it hard to believe they've received just an R rating."

"wewilsons","2","6","12","24 March 2012"," Barely a shadow of the original
","The original screen play with Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace, even with subtitles was riveting throughout. I cannot recall any movie that I was unable to put down like I found the first movie to be.<br/><br/>This movie did endeavor to be different. Maybe it was closer to the book, I did not read it so I do not know. It had some great names in it and much larger budget but it was very unfortunately a typical mediocre Hollywood product. Neither controversial or memorable. A centrist effort to gain a predictable market return. <br/><br/>I give good credit to Daniel Craig and especially Rooney Mara. He gave a credible effort and Rooney clearly put her all into the role. Where this movie failed was the screen play (dialog) and directing. Rooney and Daniel were constricted by poor dialog and inconsistent personality development. A shallow and obvious presentation where the original movie was a subtle and complexly layered plot and character relationships.<br/><br/>The biggest absence was the development of the relationship between Lisbeth and Mikel. For half they movie they do not even meet. None of the interplay that introduced Lisbeth and Mikel in the original was even attempted in the remake. After a brief time together the both say ""how they like working together"" ?? What? How obvious and hollow. Mikel's daughter earlier blurts out that the codes are Leviticus passages. Lisbeth's superior brain looses the opportunity to figure this out. Lisbeth didn't even kill Martin in the end, we do not know if she would have. All the dumbing down of the key heroine and smoothing of the rough edges made the remake a sad and sorry shadow of the original. <br/><br/>The remake was not as much a Hollywood capitalist venture as much as it is a statement of how arrogant US film makers have become to remake a movie not two years old. DO ignore the glowing reviews that were conspicuously offered FIRST. They must have known they needed to stack the deck to make some money from this mess. <br/><br/>It wasn't as bad as I feared it may be, it was worse. I hope to never have to see it again, even by accident."

","I can't figure out why all the good reviews. The original was so satisfying I wonder why this version was made at all. Does it take a lot of talent to copy another movie so exactly. Another question I have is how Daniel Craig was picked to be the lead. My opinion of his talent is very low. His bland portrayal is maddening. I can't understand his popularity at all. It is hard to see the edgy relationship between Lisbeth and him, that was so important in the Swedish Film. Daniel Craig reminds me of the dull- visaged Channing Tatum. I guess it all comes down to what makes a director copy another film. If he or she intends to bring a new interpretation to a movie from a book, that's fine, but if the director simply copies another film, spending a few million in the process, why bother. It is hard to believe that this copied film got Oscar nominations. Rooney Mara, nominated for an Oscar, copies Noomi Rapace's character step by step, how can this deserve a nomination?"

","first of all i have to say that i read the book one week earlier than watching the movie. i can't say it is a badly written book, but the plot seemed to be simple, even if the intention was to complicate it.after all, the clues to the case were found through some photos and newspaper articles.<br/><br/>secondly, the movie is an unfortunate combination of sequences taken out of the book. despite the fact that it is lengthy enough,the characters were nearly at all developed. for example in the book Cecilia Vanger, Martin Vanger, Dirk Frode are much more stronger characters than in the movie, where they play easily forgettable roles.<br/><br/>and lastly, the ending of the movie is simply disappointing compared to the book. until i read about the mysterious escape of Harriett in Australia, i thought it is an average detective novel, but this element really surprised me by its originality. it's a pity the movie hasn't reproduced it."
"freeist","5","6","12","8 January 2012"," Cigarette commercial. Too long, unoriginal, but not bad.
","Though you might have read synopses, I'll give it in brief: the movie, like the book, is set in Sweden where a disgraced reporter, Mikael Blomvist (Daniel Craig) is hired by a wealthy family to investigate an unsolved murder in their history, and is then teamed with the investigator who shamed him, an eccentric, antisocial young woman Lisabeth Salander (Rooney Mara) .<br/><br/>I have to hand it to director David Fincher. Though not overly suspenseful, the movie also isn't boring, and the plot is never confusing, though it's complex with a lot of characters. This is no small accomplishment for Fincher because it's also bloated with many unnecessary scenes. It could have lost close to an hour's worth without losing anything on plot or characters.<br/><br/>The story starts with a parallel structure, Mikael's being one, Lisabeth being the other, then they converge. At least four scenes at the beginning seem to serve only as back story for a rape, which means that scene can accurately be called gratuitous, and not from being graphic, which it is. They could have easily dropped it and instead started with the next encounter between those characters, which told you everything you needed to know about Lisabeth and what previously transpired. Mikael's side of the plot similarly belonged in the back story that should have been started later.<br/><br/>Then at the end, the movie continues for another twenty minutes after the story is over. The whole point of this seemed to be to set it up for the sequels, but it was so rushed. They could have made a whole sequel based on those scenes alone. Abbreviated like that, it's pretty unsatisfying, especially to an audience waiting to leave.<br/><br/>Despite the title, Mikael is in so many of the opening scenes where the story takes shape it's easy to think he's the protagonist, whereas Lisabeth is. The title should have tipped me off, but I knew nothing about the story coming in, and didn't know if The Girl would be the murder victim, MacGuffin, the protagonist, the antagonist, or part of the set decoration.<br/><br/>A lot of the other things in the movie were very standard. I not only called the final plot twist twenty minutes into it, but I called it as the least satisfying conclusion that wasn't downright dumb.<br/><br/>Also, and this is not a spoiler as much as a general observation that every movie-goer knows: when a family has Nazis in it, it does narrow down the list of suspects considerably. I was hoping this part of the film would be a tease, or background. I know Nazis were 20 million lives worth of evil, but the Hitler mustache has also been out of style for close to seventy years. Surely there are more modern brands of evil writers can think of. Like even Neo-Nazis? Though that does require a movie to be original, relevant, topical and clever, things Hollywood definitely won't go near.<br/><br/>Making Lisabeth a neo-punk with her tattoo doesn't ring true for a Asperger's savant and social outcast to me. Not in an age where seventy percent of people under thirty have tattoos and piercings, but it's Hollywood's perception of what an outcast looks like. A much more accurate, if comical, portrayal of an outcast was, ironically, in Fincher's earlier movie, ""Fight Club"": Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer.<br/><br/>The whole cast is good. The only one that looked questionable is the rapist, but that's because he's stereotype only in retrospect. Rooney Mara has received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal. Problem is, for most the movie, she isn't supposed to show any emotion. I'd have to watch a few scenes again, but I'll say I'm not sure it was that good unless GG were grading on a curve. She did well at the parts she was required to show range, but, for me, she also didn't steal any scenes.<br/><br/>Hollywood, and apparently the book's author, have a very exaggerated picture of what hackers can do. At one point Lisabeth sneers at Mikael's encryption like it was no problem to crack. And I thought, as the Lisabeth said, ""Oh, plu-ease!"" The reality: even with inexpensive encryption programs, it's not possible cracking it was easy unless he had a weak pass-phrase. Otherwise, does she carry a pocket quantum computer? <br/><br/>Finally, just how much money did the tobacco industry plow into this movie? I know it sounds like an unfair criticism or pet peeve, but it isn't. It effects the way the film is handled. An opening scene goes out of its way to show a character buying cigarettes and asking for a brand name (not a fictional one, as movies usually do). I wouldn't object, except the scene had no other point. From then on, characters, especially the protagonists smoked in about 75% of the scenes, and Fincher starts at least two scenes, not with dialog, but with a character lighting up. At the end, Mikael says he has quit (just like that, because anybody can quit smoking just like that at any time). I know realistically, people smoke, but this was something other than adding realism, and it was very distracting. It's a fair question to ask whether sponsorship and product placement weakens this film, tobacco being a bit more insidious than most.<br/><br/>Fincher did much the same thing in ""Fight Club."" But if it were paid for there, and it likely was, it did fit. The characters were hardly heroic, and it added just enough realism without making me too suspicious that the movie was made as a cigarette commercial.<br/><br/>This all being said, I did enjoy the movie enough, though I'm not going to recall it frequently my whole life. It's competent, but nothing great or original. It's standard, and not stupid. However, it is far too long, and you should bring your nicotine patch."

","Saw both films and read the trilogy.<br/><br/>I was skeptical adaptation about a Hollywood adaptation of the novel after having seen the Swedish film and loving it. However, Fincher has crafted a film that is outstanding in its own right.<br/><br/>And after falling in love with Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander I didn't think that I could see anyone else in the role, but Mara nails it and creates an interpretation of Salander all her own.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that Blomkvist as played by Daniel Craig is better, but the novels continually describe how handsome the character is and how many women he beds. I never believed that Michael Nyqvist inhabited those aspects of the character even though his performance in all other areas was admirable. Craig as Blomkvist does possess a charisma that his Swedish counterpart did not.<br/><br/>Hopefully this film will perform well, as I would like to see this team continue with adaptations of the rest of the trilogy."

","Isn't it nice that you don't actually have to choose which version is ""better""? They're both outstanding. They're different. They have different strengths. The Swedish version does a better job showing Salander's background; the American version does a better job showing the relationship between Salander and Blomqvist. The Swedish version does a better job handling the Wennerstrom subplot; the American version does a better job handling several aspects of the central Harriet Vanger mystery. <br/><br/>As far as the ending is concerned, neither version follows the book completely; the book's ending is a kind of composite of the two. Or, more accurately, the two directors chose to emphasize different aspects of the book's ending.<br/><br/>Take my advice. Don't choose between them and don't waste time arguing which is better. Appreciate the strengths of each.

He transformed the simple clue in the movie to have deep ramifications to the story.<br/><br/>The story is centered around a Sweden journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) in order to find out what happened to a woman named Harriet (she is part of the Vanger family) who was missing for 40 years. During his investigation, Mikael is aided by a young woman Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) who has psychological problems and generally unsociable and who happens to be a computer hacker.The suspects are the members of the family itself, where Mikael and Lisbeth must dig every corner of their past in order to find the one responsible for her disappearance.<br/><br/>The more we advance in the movie, more the story gets complicated while the spectators are eager to know what will happen next, that in addition of the clear evolution of both of the hero's characters through out the movie.<br/><br/>The acting was really great, Daniel Craig was amazing like always, Rooney Mara did a great job she presented her character like she suppose to do and even more, where she made sure that every move will look genuine and unique to her character. the rest of the cast did a real good job too with some good emotions and good acting.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was awesome, the plot has its twists and turns before the grand finale which no one will be expecting it.

OK, in term of special effects, camera angles, you know setup, this movie is way better but then if you compare the thriller in this one with the original version I think that this version is way under. I'm not saying, like I've seen here, that you should definitely see this one because of Daniel Craig's acting, or just give you the classic stereotype ""oldies but goldies"" regarding the Swedish version. I'm just saying that if a movie is born in some culture, Nordic in this case, you should at least let go of the American felling when you rate it. For me even the Swedish accent makes it more mysterious and more thrilling than this one. But both are great and if you've seen it with Daniel Craig you should also try it with Michael Nyqvist."

The film only differs from the original in that it offers a laughably cheesy intro filled with meaningless MTV-style graphics and a ludicrous version of Led Zeppelin's already overblown (but great as it is) ""Immigrant Song"". The score, by Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and partner Atticus Ross is better than average, but this minor addition does not justify remaking a million dollar movie.

"Red_Identity","Null","7","15","29 December 2011"," Rough, thrilling, and a classic mystery
","I'm a big fan of David Fincher. All of the 5 films I have seen from him range from great (Se7en) to masterful (The Social Network, Fight Club). However, when I learned he was doing another version of the Swedish original based on a novel, I wasn't exactly thrilled. Having never read the novel, I could only base it on the Swedish original, and that one never rose above just good. The story sounds great, it just never left me really hooked. Fincher's version accomplished more with the same source material.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the film is excellent, as everyone has already said. It's the best opening of the year. Then we follow Michael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. Very similar to the Swedish version, but also executed differently. Basically, pretty much what one would expect from Fincher, although there is a big difference. I expected a very cold atmosphere, and that same atmosphere although works can also be off- putting. Yet, while the film does have that, it also plays a lot with different colors. It's atmosphere stands out from the Swedish version's, and overall it's much more involving and thrilling. The different settings changed in the film, as well as some of the interactions and such. This version is more thrilling.<br/><br/>Then we have Rooney Mara. I had expected good from her, and then I heard raves for her performance. Yet, I didn't really see her expanding on what Rapace did. Somehow, she's given more material to work with, and she expands on the complexities and the hidden feelings that her character has. This is an excellent performance, and she managed to surprise me with how much she does with just a still face. It's even in the small moments as well. Daniel Craig is a more investing protagonist than the one from the Swedish version, and he did more than I had expected him to. He shows many vulnerabilities that I didn't expect.<br/><br/>One of the major differences is the ending of this and the ending of the other version. The way this version revealed the truth about the prime antagonist and about Harriet was handled much better here, but it has some problems in the final 20 minutes. After the big climax is over, it takes too long to wrap things up. Fincher's version doesn't add any ambiguities. One of my favorite aspects of the Swedish original was the way that lisbeth ends the attacker, and a conflict between how she handled it and how Michael wanted it to end. Here, all of that is removed. I was disappointed in this. Also, this version adds more to the ending of what Lisbeth is doing undercover. I thought this worked well. I have not seen the other two films based on the trilogy, but I felt that this version handled it in a good, but different way. And the final scene, surprisingly, worked. I wouldn't have thought it could if reading it on paper, but it did. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent film. It doesn't really do anything out of the ordinary, and when looked at is pretty simple and straight-forward, but in that respect it works. Many will find this structure solid, if unexciting, but it adds to the richness of the characters. I loved it for even more reasons I can't explain, and I do think it's better than the Swedish film."

Many times I found myself asking my girlfriend ""what did he (or she) say?"" I don't know if it was due to the theaters speaker system or if it was the quality of the sound recording but much of what I heard was not much more than a mumble. It would have helped if the actors could have spoken a little slower and/or clearer. With that being the case, I missed a lot of some key parts of the movie, thus losing track of what was happening. The other thing that affected my understanding of the movie was the fact that there were too many people/relatives to keep track of......who they were and how they were connected to the plot. In my opinion, this is the type of movie that requires seeing it two or three times to get a good understanding of what is actually happening.

","The soul of the story is indeed symbolically referred by the book's title ""Men Who Hate Women"".<br/><br/>What this means is there are men who cannot even bare to think about strong women with intelligence and power.<br/><br/>Now you have Fincher trying to interpret the story... Why does it go wrong? Why doesn't Fincher get it?<br/><br/>Well you cannot misunderstand the original story unless you are a man who either knows about strong women and hates them, or a girly-boy-man who fears strong women because he has never dared to speak to one yet. I surely hope Fincher goes to the second category.<br/><br/>The story does have some interesting material in it but that cannot be credited in my opinion, because a story with events and material is not a story unless it has the correct psychology of characters in it too.<br/><br/>If the events that take place are forcibly glued to wrong psychological profiles and wrong characters you make a story that does not work because it could never happen. A weak woman like Fincher's Lisbeth could not have lived the life and done the things that the strong Lisbeth of the original story did.<br/><br/>Modern feminism interpreted by and promoted by inherently chauvinistic modern capitalist consumer-culture seems to be the ideological frame of this movie and thus most likely it's director. And although modern feminism is marketed as an equal rights movement between the sexes it is mostly marketing ideas of inherent weakness of female features, and while doing it trying to deny women those features to pretend men and women are exactly the same... effectively branding femininity a weakness by denying it's existence in women on the bases of it supposedly being a weakness.<br/><br/>Strong men never hate strong women... nuff said."

Hmmm, a best-seller? seriously? It's ethically wrong to mislead the audience just in order then surprise them in such a cheap way. Ain't going to watch the 2011 one, only from the trailer I can tell it's almost a duplicate of everything, as if the 2011 version was based on the 2009 version, they should rather make their own conclusions from reading the book and base the movie on that, not get impressions from a movie that was made about the same book!

","I admit, I watched this Americanised remake before watching the original and found it fairly entertaining. It seemed like a good, solid piece of entertainment, sufficiently dark to match Fincher's directing temperament. On its own merits, I might have given it an 8 for effort.<br/><br/>But oh dear! Having watched it, I wanted to know more about the characters and the sequels. Given that there are no American sequels, I was faced with the choice of watching the Swedish original movies, or reading the books. I opted for the movies, and that is where the trouble began.<br/><br/>You see, as I sat through the original, it became painfully obvious the American version is little more than a scene-by-scene copy of that original screenplay. Different actors, same scenes, same dialogue etc. But still, I liked this version, because it was reasonably well acted and shot.<br/><br/>But oh dear! About halfway through I noticed something in the original that this version lacks utterly. Character development and background.<br/><br/>This new version gives absolutely no background for either the Lisbeth Salander or Blomqvist characters. If they had simply changed the backgrounds it wouldn't be so bad. But whereas the Swedish version explains Blomqvist's personal interest in the missing girl, and explains why Salander is a ward of court, the Hollywood version excises all of that material.<br/><br/>The resultant movie, in light of the original, is shallow and trivial. It's dark, yes, but not excessively so. Putting Fincher's name on this gives it a certain gravitas, but it is just a copy with all of the important parts cut out.<br/><br/>Additions, such as a cat-friend for Blomqvist (yes, really!) and the utter insanity of Salander asking Blomqvist for permission to kill the murderer towards the end show how utterly clueless this screenplay was in capturing the essence of the work and the characters.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me understand the perceived need by Hollywood to ""do their own take"" on foreign films. At best it just appears as awful plagiarism of what are, usually, better movies (Let the Right One In, anybody?). At worst they end up completely butchering the intent of the original.<br/><br/>And for what purpose? How is a Hollywood version with a known actor and director any better than the original? Does reading subtitles really offend American audiences so much? Or watching the (rather well-done) dubbed version equally unpalatable? Or is it just that Hollywood believes it can do it better, because it is, after all, Hollywood? I don't know the answers. What I do know, however, is that this film, although watchable, is NOT better than the original. It's lazy film-making. Hollywood's ""Be Kind, Rewind"" mentality of remaking foreign films should stop at once, or we shouldn't pander to them by watching what are, almost always, as here, inferior copies."

With movies like Fight Club, Se7en and The Social Network, he could very well be one of the best directors of the century. Fincher added his dark touch to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and it worked; the movie is beautifully directed and the opening scene is breathtaking. The opening sequence isn't only visually stunning, it also indirectly refers to many of the book's/movie's themes and the music is just creepy and perfect for the movie.<br/><br/>he book-to-movie adaptation tells the story of a woman in her early twenties, declared incompetent by the court after a mysterious, tough childhood. Being a first class hacker, Lisbeth can find all kinds of information about anyone and anything. She works as a researcher for Milton Security and end up helping a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, catch a rapist murderer.<br/><br/>The movie stayed somewhat faithful to the book. A few minor details were changed; Mikael does not serve a prison sentence, the fact that Mikael's father worked for the Vangers and lived on the island is not mentioned, Mikael's and Cecilia's romantic relationship doesn't happen in the movie, Lisbeth's mother is never mentioned and Lisbeth doesn't think that Palmgren (her previous guardian) is dead, instead she visits him regularly. Lisbeth tells Mikael that she has been declared mentally incompetent and that she tried to kill her father, although he sort of figures that out himself in the second book. The biggest change is the ending; instead of moving to Australia and starting a family, Harriet is living under Anita's identity after Anita's passing.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara is how I imagined Lisbeth Salander to look and be like, just maybe a bit tougher. Mara's performance is amazing and believable, she deserves the Oscar nomination and I'm rooting for her. Honestly, when I first heard that Mikael will be played be Daniel Craig, I wasn't that thrilled; Blomkvist is nothing like bond, he's smart and quick-witted, yet sort of weak and sensitive. He's also a journalist, not the world's favorite spy. I realized I was wrong from the first scene, Daniel Craig made a great Blomkvist, his performance wasn't as good as Mara's but I can't deny his awesomeness! I also liked the movie's Bjurman, played by Yorick van Wageningen. In fact, the only character I didn't like was Erika, played by Robin Wright. Robin Wright is a great actress, yet Erika didn't seem real, she wasn't spontaneous or friendly or anything other than fake for some reason.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is banned from Jordanian theaters, so I had to get it on DVD. I now understand why the movie was banned, I'm not really that bothered by such scenes (sex, rape..etc), but it's not something I'd like to watch either. I had to fast-forward/skip some scenes, but these scenes shouldn't stop anyone from watching the movie because they deliver a message or a cause.

","First off, the casting was perfect. I wasn't sure if Daniel Craig could make a believable and realistic transition from James bond to an average journalist. And the most impressive factor to this film was Rooney Mara who hasn't had a good deal of limelight other than playing Erika Albright in the social network (also by David fincher). The movie was gritty, realistic, and very entertaining. With a plot that a mystery buff couldn't resist, it captivates your attention and keeps your eyes on the screen throughout all the two and a half hours you're watching. All characters show their personal pros and cons in simple ways that only add to the depth of the story and all things related. To say it all in all, the movie was tremendous and should win at least two of the Oscars it's been nominated for. It's worth going out of your way to see, because you won't be disappointed."
"geodrake-71-627198","6","5","10","14 January 2012"," Decent enough thriller but has plenty of flaws
","Not having read the books or seen the Swedish movie I didn't bring any preconceptions or my own opinions on the plot with me to the cinema when I saw this. The opening credits are ludicrously over the top - full of C.G.I. writhing figures that would be more fitting for an action blockbuster. Daniel Craig does a decent job as Blomkvist, however like the rest of the characters, we never feel that there's much below the surface. They exist to tell the story rather than to be absorbing personalities. Even Rooney Mara's Lisbeth isn't more than a well sculptured shell to hang a narrative on. I think this has more to do with the source material than the adaptation. Christopher Plumber gives the best performance as Henrik Vanger, which given his veteran status as an actor is no surprise. The plot starts off briskly and as the murder investigation gathers pace, it does draw you in. Keeping track of all the players takes concentration as there are lots of Vanger relatives hanging around to provide suspects. Lisbeth's sub plot regarding her status as a ward of the state and taking revenge on the guardian who rapes her was deftly handled but I felt it didn't add much to the overall story. Her sexual relationship with Blomkvist seemed unlikely and unnecessary though. After the vaguely unsatisfying revelation of the killer's identity (again, this is the fault of the plot source) my interest waned when Lisbet goes after the tycoon responsible to Blomkvist's downfall at the beginning of the film. This is worth seeing but not worth the hype. I suspect the 'Millenium Trilogy' books are fast paced but lack any interesting literary technique."
"celluvoid","9","5","10","30 December 2011"," Lisbeth Salander's Liquid Core
","Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Fincher, 2011) concerns the interaction of two characters who are dipoles on the social spectrum. The wrapper of the mystery and acts of aggression committed by or against them serve to enamor the spectator to Lisbeth Salander (Mara Rooney) and Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig). The character Lisbeth is title namesake and hence the primary protagonist. Lisbeth is the first character to appear in the film as she engulfs the spectator in the opening credit title sequence. The primordial ink stained technological opening denotes the subconscious processing of present and early traumatic events in the dragon girls dream-nightmare life. From this point forward Lisbeth remains an enigma of feminism exploited. In the tradition of fetishism of female protagonists, Lisbeth falls somewhere between horror and pornography. She is broken up, dissected and split between the two genres as both victim and hero. The sadomasochistic aspects unleashed upon our hero have her pinned into the corner of inescapable social conformity that has been thoroughly corrupted by perpetrators of the administration. She is obviously not a nice girl and as such must be punished for her non conformity. Director David Fincher gives us this punishment beyond what we may have imagined. This added level of pure sadism inflicted upon Lisbeth and physicality of abuse leaves her character totality stripped of any humanistic element, there is little choice for her other than to curl up and die or fight for her life. It leaves the spectator with the feeling, ""well she did not deserve that!"" and questioning their own system of beliefs and morality. Reacting as a caged animal would, she lashes back at the audience in the psychic castration most feared by the phallus wielding spectator. The audience is more than elated by her resilience and exacting revenge against the atrocities committed, indeed it has been quite some time since I have witnessed such an outburst of cheers elicited from todays placated spectators. Her vengeance is not only for herself individually but for female victims everywhere. As is the trend of modern cinema, the character has become a vessel for the spectator ego-ghost, and we are given a protagonist that is a blank canvas upon which we paint.<br/><br/>Trnet Reznor's sound-image adds considerably to the film. I especially enjoyed Lisbeth's scream/roar on the subway escalator. The NIN t-shirt plug is a little clich√©. Fincher does a nice job, in Hitchcockian fashion, of building suspense and downplaying they more graphic elements as contained in the original version. It was an excellent film and Fincher is at the top of his game, although the general public still may not recognize his name as much as more celebrated Directors.<br/><br/>Excerpt: The Ego-Ghost Theory: ""The oscillation continues between the inner (RIS) Spheres as sustained elevated duration enables reading of a complete cinematic language. The double level communication structure exists between the Ego-Ghost and the Screen Universe itself. Complete cinematic language as interpreted by the Ego-Ghost is provided in transference as a psychic imprint to the outer (RIS) Spheres of the Ego.<br/><br/>Future trends with respect to the Cinema can be observed in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. The Ego-Ghost as inhabitant of the characters of Lisbeth Salander and Mickael Blomkvist moves beyond the screen universe. As the characters seek to solve the mystery, they, and we as their inhabitants, are drawn into the spectacle of home movies, multi frame still images, computer video media and audio-visual evidence. This spectacle within the spectacle may produce an additional level of (RIS) essentially inverting the model again and the producing a perceptive refection that the events and evidence are in effect real""."

"artist89","9","6","13","30 December 2011"," A dark, well-acted Fincher showcase
","Shortly before his death, Steig Larsson published a series of books that would become surprise hits. The first of these books was The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, a story that followed defamed journalist Mikael Blomkvist who hopes to save face by publishing a memoir uncovering events within the Vanger family. What starts as a journalistic investigation culminates into a deep interest and involvement in the tangled web that is the Vanger family. <br/><br/>With the help of brilliant but very unconventional Lisbeth Salander, the two use computer hacking codes, public records, and informal interviews to get to the bottom of the Vanger crises, specifically the alleged murder of young Harriet.<br/><br/>Shortly after the books were released, Swedish films were created starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist. The films were quite successful in their production home of Sweden, and as a result, American viewers took note, particularly David Fincher who sought to create an American version of the Swedish story, not a remake of the Swedish films but another retelling of the novel. The production was underway and the casting proccess was quite intense. Fincher saw every under-30 actress in Hollywood from Scarlett Johannson to Carey Mulligan, but he ultimately settled on an unknown named Rooney Mara.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara is the glue that holds the film together. Physically, her transformation from young New England prep to disaffected punk was startling. The already thin Mara lost weight, pierced several areas of her body, dyed and cut her hair, and bleached her eyebrows. She was truly shedding a new skin as an actress, and as a result, her performance was not only startling in terms of appearance but in overall performance as well. There is something intriguing about a character who is incredibly single-minded and abrasive, yet vurnerable. Mara herself described Salander not as an ""open wound"" but instead ""scar tissue,"" and performance more than pays off. She earned her Golden Globe nomination and I truly think she is deserving of the win.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig gives a chillingly good performance as well. My opinions of Craig have waxed and waned over the years. I've never been a fan of his Bond, but I do think that his film choices, for the most part, have really highlighted his strengths. He brings an incredible amount of weight to the role of a defamed reporter who just wants to gain back his credibility. The character is more obviously sympathetic, at times seeming fragile. He's a far cry from the take-no-prisoners characters Craig has portrayed in the past, and as such, I think it's one of his finest. <br/><br/>The other performance that I think may either match or surpass Mara's in the performance of Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Martin Vanger. He is the antagonist of the story but handles the role in a very subtle way. When we meet Vanger, he seems kind and hospitable, very interest in helping Blomkvist. However, as we start to peel back the layers of the character we realize the pile of skeletons in his closet and his treachery as well as his guilt. I regard Skars√•gard as a rather underrated actor and I'm glad to see him getting more and more work in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The pacing is handled perfectly. At 158 minutes the film takes time to develop the characters. The action sequences are handled perfectly, and the exposition is essential without lagging. Fincher is proving to be a master of handling difficult subject matter delicately while exposing it for the striking terror that it is.<br/><br/>My one complaint is not that the pacing was slow, but that it was so chockful of information that it almost seemed rushed at times. The literature is very meaty so I almost felt that it would have been better served as a mini-series than a feature film. However, those are just nitpicks of an otherwise excellent film. If you are interested in dark, compelling, visceral, uncomfortable, and superbly-acted films, this will be your bread and butter."
"ericjams","8","6","13","25 December 2011"," Lisbeth Salander is the best character of the past 10 years
","The real intrigue in Millennium Trilogy starts and ends with Lisbeth Salander. As with the books and the original Swedish movies, I can nit-pick the plots and the films to death like everyone else, but ultimately, the fact that we get to see another depiction of Salander should force most people from the fans right on down to the uninformed to see this film.<br/><br/>To that end, I think Rooney Mara holds are own against Rapace's Salander. I initially found her style a bit too over-the-top as compared to the costume design in the Swedish film, but as the film churns and we see the Salander's army/goth exterior cast alongside her feminine sexuality Fincher does justice to the curious duality of the character. And bravo, Rooney Mara, I thought she was a bit too withdrawn in the first act of the movie, but much of that is plot driven and I really enjoyed the way this film draws more on her physical desires then the Swedish version, whether those desires are for Big Macs or orgasms.<br/><br/>The film itself is good, not great. Apart from the opening credit fiasco that made me think of the worst modern day James Bond films and felt completely disjointed from the tone of the film, I can't find too much to criticize Fincher for. His depiction of the cold Swedish countryside, the little things like the wind in Martin's home and the rough cabin feel were all pluses. The cat's role was a nice warm up and cut down the audience moment. Reznor's score is enthralling, its one of those scores where you acknowledge its power during the movie, it doesn't blend into the background, it comes at you in waves and you feel it hitting you in the face at the right times.<br/><br/>Criticisms include the editing back and forth between Salander and Blomquist's story lines throughout the first 40 minutes of the film. I liked the idea of trying to keep the viewer constantly linked to both characters, but we were literally jumping back and forth in 30 second intervals, it felt too cut up for my liking. Daniel Craig is a good actor, I like him and I don't know another big name actor that I'd have preferred in this role, but I agree with others who lean with the original Swedish actor (name escapes me) for the roll. Craig masters the suave and broken characters in his Bond films and Layer Cake very well, but there is a certain aesthetic missing from his portrayal of Blomquist.<br/><br/>Lastly, I had such high expectations for Fincher's portrayal of the dark, murderous, violent aspects to the film that I felt the final act and the run up to the whodunnit resolution to be somewhat sanitized.<br/><br/>All that said, I still give it high marks and recommend it for newbies as well as fans of the Millennium Series."

Another feature I loved is the cinematography, the Sweedish winter is such a sight and of course the scenic beauty of the same. Daniel Craig was good too in his role of Mikhel and I enjoyed Plummer and Skarsgard in their roles as well.<br/><br/>Now the cons of the movie. The only problem is the ""Remake"" factor.

Second, the flash bang aspects of the film overrode the more subtle aspects of the story and if I had not read the book, I would not have recognized the plot at all. Third, too many changes from the original storyline were made. Why? To satisfy the director's time constraints, literary license, or both? In summary, I was disappointed with the film and I will wait to see any sequels on DVD rather than pay top dollar to see them in the theater."

","Everyone had their pick of who they wanted to play the Lisbeth Salander in the American remake if The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, there were slot of really big names and a lot of great actresses who came very close to bagging the role, but Mr Fincher did the right thing and chose a little known actress who had the acting chops to make this difficult role something memorable, it must be said that Rooney Mara is phenomenal in this movie, I would go so far as to say that she out does Noomi Rapace, which is saying slot because she was also amazing in the original.<br/><br/>Remakes of foreign films are either hit or miss, sometimes they can change it too much and it is just lame, or sometimes they can stick to closely to the original and it seems kinda pointless, this remake however is pretty much perfect in sticking to the story but bringing it's own little bits and pieces to it that make it different, it's pretty much the exact same storyline and all important scenes are almost identical, it's just the right amount of same and different. Daniel Craig is rather good as Mikael Blomkvist, but he really us no match for scene stealer Mara.<br/><br/>Sweden is shown in all it's freezing cold glory and it's presented in an equally inviting and non inviting way, im glad that Fincher decided to keep it set in Sweden and not transfer it to America, it wouldn't have the same vibe if it were any different. Another awesome thing about this film is the epic opening credits, your eyes and ears are attacked by dripping tattoo ink and Miss Karen O's screeching voice, it's truly epic and sets you up for the film you are about to watch.<br/><br/>Fans of the original and fans of Fincher will be impressed, it is a worthy remake of an already excellent film but it also stands as a film on it's own.

"dalelawson-1","10","4","8","22 January 2012"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Review
","The Swedish original of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Dir. David Fincher, 2011), M√§n som hatar kvinnor (Dir. Niels Arden Oplev, 2009), methodically followed the plot created by Stieg Larsson to almost the exact word. This Hollywood remake did choose to leave out a few scenes that had been included within the original, but with the film already stretching at 2 hours 45 minutes I can forgive Fincher, as a fan of the novel, for cutting out some of the final scenes from the film. <br/><br/>The most unusual and off-putting part about the whole film were the opening titles. They used a very James Bond-esc animation style where both Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) are born from oil. Thankfully, the heavy metal soundtrack accompanying the animation appeared to be the sort of music the character of Lisbeth would enjoy. My opinion of the film was redeemed, as for a brief second I had feared that Hollywood producers had taken control of the film and created an action filled mystery; this was not the case. <br/><br/>Every single actor within The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo created individuals so similar to my imagination of the characters within Larsson's book that the film almost became a visual playback of my mind when reading the novel. Daniel Craig played an excellent Mikael Blomkvist but was unfortunately the only person who wasn't seemingly putting on a Swedish accent. The lack of accent wasn't that noticeable but it did make me raise questions as to Mikael Blomkvist's origin. Rooney Mara, in her protagonist debut, portrayed the girl with the dragon tattoo with such charisma that any problems I'd had with Daniel Craig's character were forgotten while she was on screen. David Fincher doesn't always produce films of a high standard, but this one is one of his greats. This movie has unusual protagonists, detestable villains and a mystery that keeps people who haven't read the book gripped till the end. <br/><br/>The only warning I have for anyone watching this film who knows nothing about it is that it does include multiple uncomfortable scenes where at least one of the protagonists finds themselves in a situation which is difficult to watch. These said scenes are extremely well edited in Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. They are abridged in such a way to make any of the grotesque scenes within the film more foreboding and uncomfortable. As an example, the first one of these scenes cuts between Lisbeth and her guardian in his bedroom, and a slow backwards zoom away from the door and down the corridor, making the scene more ominous than it already was. <br/><br/>Finally, the film does extend to 2 hours and 45 minutes. For someone who enjoyed the novel it wasn't quite long enough as the final scenes within Australia have been cut to reduce time. But, I have been told, that for someone fresh to the franchise the film does last too long, as after the main plot has ended the film stretches on for 20 minutes into a detailed conclusion, similar to the book. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this film was definitely better than the Swedish original as it had more personality, fantastic editing and a strong cast. Many will question whether there was a need for a Hollywood remake at all; and while the answer is no, I still believe that when watching this film it provides a more Swedish vibe than the Swedish one itself. The intoxicating acting of Rooney Mara keeps one engaged throughout the whole film, and despite the accent, this film has widened my eyes to the acting ability of Daniel Craig."
"Legendary_Badass","7","6","14","20 December 2011"," The Year's Best Remake of a Recent Swedish Film
","The Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo offers few surprises for the seasoned viewer of the 2009 Swedish original. Yes, it has come to the point that we can't wait long enough to rip-off foreign markets. To its credit director David Fincher manages to inject the compelling mystery with his auteur pizazz, though the Bond-esque ink laden title sequence may have been overkill.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a magazine editor on the verge of financial collapse after losing a libel trial. When an assignment appears before him to investigate a murder from 50 years ago, with an enticing offer of the dirt needed to clear his name, he takes it. With the help of an eccentric investigator by the name of Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), Mikael finds himself investigating not one murder but a series.<br/><br/>At some point studios are going to figure out that Daniel Craig is not the answer to their casting problems. Here, he's too cool under pressure. I'm no magazine editor, but I don't figure that they handle being kidnapped like James Bond would. He hardly seems bothered.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara mutilates her hair and body for this role, receiving more piercing than I'd care to describe. Her accent is highly authentic, more so than Craig's to say the least. I'm not a fan of how she has decided to sell out her body for realism, but Mara does have the most genuine performance of the film.<br/><br/>Because of her unorthodox appearance, it can be troublesome for an audience to root for Lisbeth. To accomplish this she's put into a compromising situation involving rape, to which end we can take joy in her revenge. It's an effective tactic, but I question the nature in which she is exploited, making for a largely anti-male narrative. Not only that but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) makes the same lazy circle as the 2009 film. Random acts of violence happen in the real world, but in a movie the unlikely is frowned upon. When a thief damages Lisbeth's Macbook Pro, she has to see he newly appointed guardian, a sex maniac, and trade services for an allowance to have her computer replaced. So ultimately she ends up back where she started, she had a laptop, and now she has a laptop. This choice makes a nearly 3- hour movie. In fact an entire film goes by before Lisbeth and Mikael meet.<br/><br/>The discrepancies between this and the 2009 Swedish films are few until the mystery is solved. As the movie struggles to conclude we find a flashback that has been nixed, replaced by a brief aural tale. Fincher then moves to resolve everything presented in the first half, so Lisbeth becomes a busy girl following up with friends and doing favors.<br/><br/>I wasn't crazy about the 2009 film, but I certainly respect it. I can't find myself respecting a blatant cash-in regardless of its individual merits."
"folsominc2","1","5","11","17 June 2014"," Filth!
","There is only one word to describe this movie and that is ""Filth!"" I had heard about it from movie reviews and other people and decided since it was on TV last night I would watch and see what it was all about. After all, it was an Oscar Winner and had a 40-year old murder mystery.<br/><br/>I should have turned it off from the first time the weird girl gave a report about the sexual tendencies of the ""hero"" in the movie. From then on, it was a toss up what really was going to be the combination of a sick girl who was getting sicker from rape, torture, bi-sexual relationships and perversions.<br/><br/>The murder mystery turned out to be some convoluted crap with sexual domination and torture. Frankly, you had to find the clues they were ""investigating"" - AND the fact that they threw in something about the Bible being mixed up with the German torturer did not make it any more endearing to me. Especially when the daughter of the ""hero"" who was going to Bible camp had to tell her father, ""Don't worry. I am not dangerous."" What a rot! People who claim to be Christians AND are dangerous are NOT true Christians! <br/><br/>The ending of the 40 year mystery was predictable that I got it early before it was revealed - after all, who was left to be the murderer and it was so obvious about the location of Harriet. And the final culmination of the weird girl traveling in a blonde wig and embezzling money was never quite understandable. What did she do with the money? Keep it? Frankly, to me this was nothing more than an excuse to lay all of Sweden's society's dung heap lifestyle out before the world and shock the pants (literally) off everyone watching.<br/><br/>Seeing how many sexual partners and lack of emotion behind any of the characters in the film in and out of bed, it is not surprising, I must say, that Sweden has one of the highest rate of HIV in the world.<br/><br/>This film was disgusting and perpetuates that all perversions which are horrendous are basically OK as long as it feels right!

They completely removed the rape scene; it was barely hinted at here, that was a very important part of her characterization of why she neither trusts men nor the authorities, because this is what she have been a victim of since she was a little girl.<br/><br/>This movie fails utterly and completely compared to the real version, and if you have any like for this mockery, then you should try to see the real thing. That movie was great, this one is barely adequate on its own, and when we know what it is supposed to be, what it has the audacity to claim to be, it is nothing less then an abomination.<br/><br/>But I guess we shouldn't be surprised, as I said in the beginning it is codename Nina all over again.

","I guess there's no need to beat around the bush. I'll go ahead and say that Rooney Mara deserves the Academy Award for best actress due to her powerful, yet disturbing role as Lisbeth Salander in this film. Now, with that being said, this movie is why I go to the theater. The setting was perfect, the acting was amazing, the writing was superb, and in my honest opinion, the film clearly separates itself from the Swedish version that many (including myself) saw and loved. It's an American telling of a Swedish novel and everybody dialed it up big time for this movie. Now this is not a movie that I would take a child to go see and I would be skeptical of taking friends to see it around the holidays due to the disturbing content, but it is still beyond amazing. This movie forces you to pay close attention to every little detail when it comes to solving a mystery and the ending is not one you would expect if you had never read the novel. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo shows you the darkest side of people (especially men and I can't go into that without telling you about the film.) I can't say enough about Rooney Mara who transforms herself for this role. For those of you who are dead-set on bashing this film because you love Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, if you let that go for a little while, you will see like I do, a film that is deserving of every single award it WILL win and consideration as one of the best films of the last 20 years."

","I must say that I found it hard to believe that anyone would contemplate doing a remake of this movie. I found the original film to be really unique, very much like a Bergman film, in a league of its own. I read all the books and saw all three movies, all of them excellent.<br/><br/>The Nordic feel to the movie is right in your face and everything feels really authentic. The actors are all incredible, Rooney Mara & Christopher Plummer in particular. The action is quite fast paced, with very little time to get complacent.<br/><br/>I was on the edge of my seat for the whole film, even though I knew what was going to happen more or less. The ending with Harriet is different from the original. Stieg Larrson makes equally fascinating research for anyone who is interested in the man behind the movie. <br/><br/>The photographs and all the research material used in the case file are excellent and add to the feel of the movie."

","David Fincher is one of the greatest directors of all time. The characters in this film are stellar. The acting, directing and editing is as good as it gets. Rooney Mara is amazing. A must see film. One very cryptic aspect of this film is that on one hand it's about a family of (male) Nazis of whom two were serial killers, but also that the method of the killer is gleaned from the Old Testament and it's brutality and casual yet sadistic methods of murdering women. There are also flashes of Bolshevism, for which the Nazis gained their popularity in Germany for their opposition to Bolshevism and it's blatant genocide of ethnic-Slavs and ethnic-Europeans."

As soon as the killer came on screen, I whispered to my boyfriend, ""That's the killer,"" and I was right. The ending was obviously going to end the way that it did. I just wasn't surprised by the movie at all and found myself getting bored and impatient. My boyfriend suggested we leave the theater because he saw I wasn't enjoying it but I stayed, hoping it would get better by the end.<br/><br/>The acting was good, which is why I gave it 5 stars.

"braddugg","6","2","3","19 September 2014"," Hmm...It reduced from a great thriller to a simple murder mystery
","Hmm...It reduced from a great thriller to a simple murder mystery<br/><br/>When I watched it first time a few months earlier, I was in awe of Rooney Mara and the way the whole subject was handled and directed and finally made into a movie. When I watched it today, all my enthusiasm came down to the understanding of a simple murder mystery of a girl who has for some reason been assumed to be killed by someone.<br/><br/>Amidst this murder case, there is a libel case which our hero Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has lost to Wennerstorm and this comes back much later just to redeem the lost glory of our hero. Now who does all this is Lisbeth Salander played wonderfully by Roonery Mara, she is a surprise to all those who have not known much about her and her ability. <br/><br/>All other departments fared well and a special mention to David Fincher and what a movie he has made up. This is a mystery that holds up for long and he does a pretty good job till he held the mystery. Once, we know the murderer is known, he gives away the fun. Also, I am not sure if Wennerstorn was a main plot or a subplot coz he takes up the last 15 mins of film which I don't think was so important and just a glimpse of what happened to him was enough. Having said that, those 15 minutes were important too in establishing the GIRL as one superb woman who can go to any extent to does what she believes in. But she does all of those very unrealistically, can't we just simply bluff so many European officials, I really doubt. <br/><br/>David Fincher has lost it only at the end apart from which most of it was good, yes cinematography was exceptional and so was the background music, editing should have been so lot better, the same duo who worked for 'The Social Network worked for this and they won an Academy award even for this but I did not like this film's editing though.<br/><br/>If there is any reason for watching this movie then it's Rooney Mara. It's a 3/5 for a good movie that's good as a murder mystery and OK OK for everything else. It just could have been so better had a few moments been cut out.<br/><br/>Note : I did not see the Swedish version, nor did I read the book, I perceived the film as it is, if anyone is offended then please take it easy."

","I missed the first quarter hour of the film and that may be why I was a little puzzled throughout. I understand that Daniel Craig is a magazine editor offered a lot of money by a millionaire isolate to find out what happened to his daughter many years ago. I understand that Craig enlists the help of a punk delinquent young girl who is a computer whiz.<br/><br/>The problem, if any exists outside of my own head, may lie in the difficult task of translating a novel into a movie. In a novel, we have time to stretch out and get comfortable with the characters, to learn their distinguishing features. A movie by necessity compresses social space and simplifies the story. That's one of the reasons there are so many complaints that ""the movie isn't as good as the book,"" and so few complaints that, ""the novel is a waste of time compared to the movie."" This must have been a long novel because the disappearance of Harriet, that fourteen-year-old girl, that took place so many years ago, happened in an Agatha Christie setting -- an island from which it was impossible for Harriet to escape and equally unlikely that she was drowned.<br/><br/>So someone on the island probably knows what happened to her, but who? The only people on the island -- now and at the time of the disappearance -- are family members, many of whom are not on speaking terms with one another, for reasons not made too clear. Except for the fact that one of them is an unregenerate Nazi, it's hard to tell one from another. And when you add in the police and big business intrigues, it's like looking into a kaleidoscope. It isn't until a few minutes before the end when things clear up, and the solution turned out to be extremely simple.<br/><br/>One of the resident family is Stellan Skarsgard, who is always impressive, no matter if he's a good guy (""Good Will Hunting"") or a bad boy (""Ronin""). He has an easy-going psychotherapeutic demeanor. If a bullet pocks the plaster near his ear (as in ""Insomnia""), he just leans slightly away and looks slightly annoyed, as if he'd been pestered by a fly.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara has an important role as the devalued computer expert with the leather jacket, the tattoos, and the pins through her eyebrow, nose, and lips. She lacks eyebrows too but she's no Mona Lisa because she never smiles. Neither does she blink. This gives her a fixed, determined, reptilian glare. And it all adds to the impression that her character has only one note on her instrument. Not even sex seems to arouse her.<br/><br/>It's a long, slow, rather dull mystery with little action, though what there is of it is handled deftly. But I'll bet the novel was interesting because some of the dialog, presumably lifted from the text, is catchy. (""Isn't it odd, that we're more afraid of offending someone than of dying?"")"

","Reading through the reviews for some clues, one can quickly realize that many of them come from an audience that has encountered the story either by reading the novel or watching the older Swedish film. I have done none of them. This adaptation is my only encounter.<br/><br/>To me, it felt like a trailer to a novel, rather than a compelling or intriguing thriller. There was just too much of everything at once. Uncles, sisters, nephews, business partners, paper cutouts, maps, computer searches, code lines, pinned photos, location changes. It soon became just a big mash of hell-knows-who-did-what-where-when-why. Characters are presented in sequence so fast that you don't even get to sample their personalities or their relation to the subject matter. Apart from Mikael and Lisbeth, everyone else seems two-dimensional and just another generic piece in the puzzle.<br/><br/>This movie should have been a TV series. The pace picks up too fast in the middle for anyone not familiar with the novel to care. It ends up being a Game of Thrones season in 150 minutes."

","This is a cold movie. The temperature of the story's location is low, the sets are stark, and the color palette is muted. The only hint of warmth comes in a brief flashback to a simpler, happier time. Nothing like it happens before or since, and due to its significance to the story, it is a very memorable scene. However, nothing like it happens before or after. The film all but comes out and tells you that this little Swedish island has many, many problems. And it's not the only one. Arguably even more important than the story is the female lead character, Lisbeth Salander. Apparently, many other reviewers have said this, but it will never diminish in importance. Rooney Mara delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. While watching her in the film, I completely forgot Lisbeth was being portrayed by someone. I actually thought she was a person, not a movie character. This is how utterly convincing Mara is, whether she is investigating a murder or getting vengeance for being raped, she is always Salander. And she EVOLVES. This one of the few times in any movie I've seen where it is possible to actually observe a character's arc. When she smiles, you know she has been at least partially transformed. For the better. Her relationship with Mikael Blomkvist (played by the inimitable Daniel Craig) is as important to the story as the the central mystery. Craig and Mara play off each other admirably, whether it be with borderline hostility or sexual attraction. As she is with seemingly everyone, she is incredibly guarded against him at first, keeping a taser in her waistband at their first meeting. However, despite the obvious physical and mental differences between them, they investigate with a dedication and passion that seems like it would be unmatched. This investigation is what drives the unusually involving plot along. A wealthy former industrialist's grandniece was murdered forty years ago,and said man wants the mystery solved before he passes on. He says that Blomkvist will be investigating ""thieves, misers, bullies, the most detestable group of people you will ever meet."" Well, at least he was up front about it. His family meets all four of these criteria, including more than one Nazi and a murderer. Unsurprisingly, no one talks to anyone else. Detestable, indeed. Gradually, Salander and Blomkvist discover layers to the mystery that hook you with ferocious efficiency. Without spoiling anything, the story has one or two major twists that anyone who hasn't read the book or seen the 2009 version will expect. I know I didn't. And the ending is an unexpected gut-punch that WILL make you feel for the characters, as well as finalizing Lisbeth's evolution from a cold, insane person to slightly less of one. David Fincher has stated that if this film is successful, the sequels will be adapted back to back, with Craig and Mara reprising their roles. Please go see this movie so that this might happen. Once you do, you'll want this to happen as badly as I do. It's just that good."

","I will be honest. As a professional physicist and part-time philosopher, the direction the real world is headed in generally frightens me. So when I switch off, I tend to hide away in science fiction and speculative fiction.<br/><br/>That is why I was surprised that I was drawn to this rather mundane and down to Earth story of a newspaper reporter and hacker/activist.<br/><br/>I did take exception at the number of foreigners trying to pass themselves off as scandinavians... while actual scandinavians ended up in the background...<br/><br/>Living in Japan for most of my life, I have been subjected to downright horrors such as Black Rain, Rising Sun, The Last Samurai and the most disappointing to me, the adaptation of Memoirs of a Geisha...<br/><br/>((I lived in the town where Geisha was going to be shot but the then mayor, in a sudden -ironically harakiri like- career truncating move, turned Spielberg down, resulting in a childishly bitter Spielberg hiring a Korean and Chinese cast and throwing away a chance at a decent movie....))<br/><br/>So trying to be authentic is something I take seriously and I think they inevitibly failed at bringing about a scandinavian atmosphere.<br/><br/>It was basically brits in winter with a few yanks...<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the movie...<br/><br/>From the outset, the portrayal of the outcast Lisbeth captivated me and since I had only watched one movie with Craig as Bond, I had very little baggage to contend with, taking him as Blomqvist.<br/><br/>The pacing was superb and the detailing along the way, impeccable. The music was at times jarring, though that might have been the intention.. I'm not really a soundtrack guy.<br/><br/>The core of the film, the protagonists, gain their viewers' attention and sympathy early on in the film, though it is not certain how they will end up meeting.<br/><br/>If I have one issue with Lisbeth's portrayal in this movie, it's how quickly she turns from flinching at Blomqvist's mere proximity after having been abused and then raped at the hands of her ""social""worker to, a mere few hours later, getting naked with him and f''king his brains out.<br/><br/>Yes, she is supposedly insane, but I feel she more than just likely a superbly highly functioning autist... (I haven't read the books)<br/><br/>As someone who has been close to and looked after abuse victims in the past, I found this particular aspect rather... offputting... The brushing off of what was seemingly a lifetime of abuse since childhood (in and out of institutions and state care?)... at the mere presence of our rather dashing and masculine protag. did come across as a bit insensitive.<br/><br/>Perhaps if they had developed their characters a bit more and especially, her intense and sudden attraction to Bq, I might have found that particular aspect of the movie more palatable...<br/><br/>However, despite that, the whole story was compelling and the characters relatable enough that I found to my surprise, I truly cared about the outcome enough to watch a 155 minute film...<br/><br/>Very entertaining and stimulating movie... I look forward to future installments."

","Had I known the combination of screen writer Steven Zaillian (Gangs of NY '95) and director David Fincher (Fight Club' 99) were involved with this sour mess I would have stayed away. Many people who paid good money to see this must have come away wishing they had not. The director tells us he is drawn to works that 'scar' the audience, a sure recommendation for like minded masochists. I see several reviewers have said 'it leaves you wanting to cleanse yourself'. I see their point. <br/><br/>The most accurate mainstream critical notes on this came from the N.Y.Post where Kyle Smith was brave enough to label it: ""rubbish"" - commenting that it ""demonstrates merely that masses will thrill to an unaffecting, badly written, psychologically shallow and deeply unlikely pulp story so long as you allow them to feel sanctified by the occasional meaningless reference to feminism or Nazis."" I have to agree 'Bravo Kyle' as do many other astutely observant user reviewers! As the lead, Daniel Craig largely seems uninvolved or simply embarrassed that the writer presents him as one of the dumbest private detectives on screen. Enter the 'girl' ‚Äì she also never learns and makes the same mistakes several times (with the same vile character) leaving her a victim to hideous sexual abuse ‚Äì it becomes obvious both writer and director are living out their lurid sick fantasies with unnecessarily gratuitous details, giving one or both away seriously.<br/><br/>The sudden U turn by the 'girl' for no truly convincing reason - going from a man hating lesbian to 'totally-in-love' with the detective, is yet another excuse for the makers to overload their already weak script with multiple sex scenes for the unwashed. Add to this, an overly convoluted script with so many manipulative elements that it at times becomes laughable (except it's all too grotesque). This typifies the commonality of the academy and trendy critics with their out-of- touch stance with many audience attitudes. As others have already said: Please, don't remake the follow up stories - leave well enough alone. For those who don't mind what pollution they put into their heads, this might please, others may care to look elsewhere."
"KineticSeoul","8","1","1","16 January 2016"," This Fincher's take can still draw you in.
","Despite the original or the first one coming out before this 2011 version by David Fincher. And the book written by a Swedish writer and the story taking place in Sweden with Swedish actors and actresses. This one is the better version despite the leads being American and British. Because of how it's directed, the direction and the cinematography of it all. I thought it was more thrilling and exciting to sit through with scenes that escalates when it comes to the tension and suspense every second. David Fincher is really meticulous when it comes to his films, he is just really keen when it comes to details. And the cinematography and the detail of this film really drew me in. I personally thought Daniel Craig is the better Mikael Blomkvist despite him being British and not Swedish. Although some may really disagree with that opinion. Since I seen the 2009 original film before this one, I knew most of what was coming. But the detail and more realistic aspect of this film kept me engaged on this mystery regardless. The original did a better job when it came to the flow of the story though. The music really carried the tone of this film, especially when it comes to each scenario. It's very rare for the US version to be better than the original foreign film, but this one is one of the exception. Sure having a bit more resources can be a factor in this, but it's part of the film game. Just because a film has more resources doesn't make it a worse film. Although some hipsters may disagree with this. It deals with Biblical stuff not much as ""Se7en"" but that might be one of the aspect that got David Fincher's attention to take on this story. Because he seems to really like delving into these mystery murder stories that has some sort of ties to something grand and can go in depth with when it comes to certain patterns or at least something that people can at least relate with and is informed about. I really liked the cast in this, but the actress Rooney Mara transformed herself for this role (check the before pictures), she was really dedicated to this project. And put on a noteworthy performance that really showed her boldness and dedication to this role. She is a pretty actress, she is still attractive in this but just differently and it's was a big transition for her. Overall this is a mystery investigation film that will intrigue first time viewer from beginning to end. <br/><br/>8.6/10"

I liked Rooney's portrayal of Lizbeth better than Noomi's.<br/><br/>When I heard that they're doing another movie without Rooney Mara as Lizbeth I felt they killed the series. The idea that a movie can make 10's of millions of dollars over the budget and be considered a flop because it didn't make the ""experts"" expectations of what it should make is a Wall Street model that has no business in movie making.

David Fincher was the ideal director to make this adaptation with a properly dark style and operatic quality. Daniel Craig may stand out in this role as his second best known aside 007. But Rooney Mara is the best stuff. She's priceless, since the physical transformation to her own performance (more aggressive, more seductive, deeper and with a better yet tragic closure). Even the movie could expand its world (from the source novel) or close the chapter on its own as the finale shows. Whatever it happens in the future, this movie will be as rock-solid as hell.

"italo505","7","5","12","10 April 2012"," Better Lisbeth?
","Comparing Rooney Mara's performance from her Swedish predecessor's (Noomi Rapace) is hard to decide which actress played Lisbeth Salander better but at the climax of both movies the scene that's stuck in everyone's minds is the scene where she gets raped in such a violent way by her parole officer that it's hard to shake off this horrific scene. It's one of those scenes that is disturbing to watch yet you can't turn away from the screen. Lisbeth is such a character though that you would think that after all she's been through she would be able to fight back but she's so fragile and defenseless that you feel her pain and desperation that you wished you could help her in some way¬Ö That's until she gets her sweet revenge. It's one of my guiltiest pleasures to watch Lisbeth take revenge on her oppressor in such a way that she turns him into a sheepish and obedient servant that she manipulates in whichever way she wants. No matter in what language these scenes are: they are what makes both The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo versions so compelling.<br/><br/>The only complain that I can think of is that the story attempts to cover way too much ground for just one movie. You don't know if you enjoyed the family mystery bit, or the murderer still on the loose bit, or Mikeal's scandal bit, or Lisbeth's personal struggle bit. It's hard to stay focused unless you're reading the novel series by Stieg Larsson which possibly cover as many subplots as possible and I bet it'd be a great read but it doesn't always translate well into one single film. Another peeve of mine is that I kept comparing both versions of the movie to the point where it was distracting me and I kept wondering: Was Lisbeth Salander more bisexual than the Swedish version? Was Mikeal Blomkvist more compelling the first time around or was he just uninteresting this time around (sorry Daniel Craig but I liked Michael Nyqvist better)? Did this new rape scene seem way longer than in the original version? Was the killer in the original version (or even the book version) more frightening than the new version (I shall not reveal who that is for those who still haven't seen it)?<br/><br/>And the biggest question I needed to ask is: why does Hollywood try to imitate every single successful movie out there? Are there not enough stories, best-seller novels or scripts out there that deserve the movie treatment? I think that Hollywood producers take American audiences for granted and they underestimate their appreciation for the arts. I'm sure if a movie is good in Chinese, or Swedish or Spanish then you should just watch it and not have to wait until they remake it in your native tongue, and you'd be surprised to know how many movies have been redone in the past that were better left alone: The Eye (better in its original Japanese version), Open Your Eyes (redone and retitled for American audiences as ""Vanilla Sky"", never able to imitate the original Spanish version), Diabolique (I heard the French version was much scarier than the American version starring Sharon Stone) or even Fright Night which was one of my favorite films in the 80's (I've heard the remake with Colin Farrel was really bad).

"dimarinc","8","5","12","3 January 2012"," A very interesting and rewarding film
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a hit that fired on all cylinders. It has deep and interesting characters and a great, thorough story. The movie is very mature and can not be watched lightly, it requires full attention and will shake you will disturbia at time. However, this all attributes to the mood which is set beautifully with imagery and a great musical score. I think that Daniel Craig did a great job in a more vulnerable and educated role and Rooney Mara does a great job making us marvel and fear her character. All of the secondary characters in the movie add to an extremely complete and thought out executed movie. Overall, it is a mature movie that should be enjoyed by all, of the sufficient age."
"darrylyarnal","9","5","12","3 January 2012"," Unbelievable Performance.
","First let me start by saying I'm a huge NIN fan and as I had the soundtrack a month before I saw the film I was paying amazing attention to the film and it's music.<br/><br/>I have never read the book so came to the film unsure of what to expect, people had told me that there was no way the film could match it as the book was that good. So if I say that I'm on the verge of ordering the trilogy that should say something. The performance from Rooney Mara was incredible, dare I say Oscar worthy. I came away utterly in awe and cannot wait to see what she does next. Without putting in too much info to play a character so hard edged yet still show a vulnerable side like she did at the end is amazing.<br/><br/>The film is very, VERY dark, and sometimes not in a nice way. But to understand the story it needed to be. By being so graphic it may put people of but without this it would not have the same impact. Even my partner, who doesn't believe in violence for violence sake, agreed. <br/><br/>Bring on Girl who kicked the Hornet's nest."
"freemantle_uk","10","5","12","31 December 2011"," A Tour de Force of an adaptation
","The Millennium Trilogy has been a publishing sensation, selling millions of books and has been adapted into film in its native Sweden. The original film adaptation was one of the most successful Swedish films ever and when Hollywood announced it was going to make their own adaptation there were cries of blasphemy the world over. Then they heard that David Fincher was directing and their opinions quickly changed.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a disgraced journalist after being sued for libel and his political magazine faces the brink of bankruptcy. He is financially wiped out and his rival the industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg) is out of the kill. At his lowest apt an old industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) gives Blomkvist an offer he can't refuse, if he finds out what happened to his grand-niece Harriet (Moa Garpendal) who disappeared in 1966 he will pay him four times his yearly salary and more importantly the evidence to bring down Wennerstorm. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a private investigator and hacker who was asked to find out everything she can about Blomkvist. She is also declared mentally incompetent and her new guardian, Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen) is a sadist rapist. Both Blomkvist and Salander end up working together when it turns out the disappearance of Harriet has lead to a even bigger mystery.<br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a really entertaining page-turner thriller and is the best written and developed of the whole series. The characters were better developed, particularly the villains and it was good stand alone film. The Swedish original was an excellent film and so is Fincher's version. Fincher makes an even more stylish film with his camera movements, the title sequence and even the editing, making a tense film (even to someone who has read the novel and seen the Swedish version). Fincher has such skill that he make people researching on a computer and in an archive tense and interesting. Fincher makes his version even dirtier and gritty, and seeing that original was a tough watch it. There is a deliberately grim and grimy look, having a grey filter to it and Fincher does not finch with scenes like what happened to Salander after her rape. We slowly see how the mystery is solved and despite its long running time it does not feel like any scene was wasted and fits in most of the book. Some elements like Blomkvist's daughter, Pernilla (Josefin Asplund) actually plays an important role in this version compared to the Swedish version.<br/><br/>The casting is great, particularly Rooney Mara as Salander. Lisbeth Salander was one of the most covered roles in Hollywood, with the likes of Emma Watson, Natalie Portman, Mia Wasikowska and Keira Knightley being linked to the role, so it was a massive surprise that Mara got the role. But is was excellent in the role, looking the part. Whilst Noomi Rapace was very good in the Swedish version, she looked a bit too old and her Mara was more like the novel description, short, thin and small breasted. Mara also gets the characteristics right, she avoids eye control, very intelligent, cold and distance. Whilst she is a very anti-social person, she is not quite as spiteful as she is in the books sometimes, only taking out brutal revenge when someone truly wrongs her. This the role that should make her a start.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are also excellent. Whilst it was annoying Craig did not speak in a Swedish accent he was able to over come that because he is such a talented actor, his performance being very natural whether his interaction with his daughter or showing his anger or show or when he scared and being tortured. Craig and Robin Wright seems a more natural couple then Michael Nyqvist and Lena Endre were in the Swedish original and Erika Berger and the troubles of Millennium were actually addressed in this adaptation. Whilst most of that subplot is left in the background it still helps raise the levels of problems and guilt for Blomkvist. I found it weird that the only major Swedish actor in the film, Stellan Skarsgard spoke with an American accent, then what we would think is a Swedish accent. I think that Peter Andersson was a better Bjurman then van Wageningen was but van Wageningen still played him as creepy, sleazy man.<br/><br/>This version is not 100% perfect, there are some subplots that are skipped over, like Blomkvist's affair with Cecila, the investigation involving the other members of the Vanger family, Blomkvist going to prison, the death and mention of Salander's mother, that character was combined with Salander's guardian Palmgren (Bengt C.W. Carlsson). The ending was also changed, to give it more of a twist, I personally would have preferred the original ending, but oh well, the basic idea is still the same. But I think that some small thinks like saying that Wennerstrom tried to kill a pregnant woman being cut was a wise move because I think that was a bit much still he was already a man with his fingers in crime and trying to destroy Blomkvist and Millennium when it was down.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provide an excellent score and soundtrack to this film, from their version of the Immigrant Song to the intense beats throughout the film. They provide some great music.<br/><br/>Fincher's version is a very good adaptation and so is the Swedish version. I like to see them as two different interpretation of the same source then a try remake. No one would bat an eye to a new version of a Shakespeare play or a classic novel, so why should this be different."
"ticket_for_one","10","5","12","28 December 2011"," Dark cinematic genius.
","I haven't read the books. I have seen the original Swedish film series and loved every single one of them. Especially the first film which I thought was brilliant. Knowing David Fincher was up to direct this version had me waiting with baited breath at the outcome. I'm more than happy to say that Fincher's version is equally as brilliant. Whether or not he'll direct the rest of the series (if approved) we'll just have to wait to wait and see. If yes, then this is a fantastic opener from one of the best directors in the business.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig gives a solid performance as Mikael Blomkvist, the disgraced journalist. Had my doubts about Craig after watching the dreadful Cowboys and Aliens. Watching Craig struggle with an accent is almost torturous. But here he uses his English accent and does a great job. Christopher Plummer as Henrik continues to play characters with such ease and conviction. No wonder he's getting plaudits and nominations for his role in The Beginners. A wonderful actor who continues show how it's done. Stellan Skarsgard who plays Martin, plays his role with a deceptive menace and puts in an impressive performance. <br/><br/>Others, Robin Wright, Steven Berkoff, Joely Richardson and others, perform wonderfully. Now, Rooney Mara. There's no point comparing, because Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth was electric on the screen. Couldn't take your eyes off her. She had attitude, sex appeal and brains. A great fictional character, who eventually becomes the feisty protagonist we all know an love.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara is all that and more. She is Lisbeth Salander. Just mesmerizing on screen, by no means a copycat or an imitation. It's a simply brilliant performance. Say what you want about Noomi Rapace. Rooney Mara is just phenomenal as Lisbeth. It's a performance you'll talk about for days and rightly so she's been recognized with nominations. If a Foreign Press Association know what's good, she'll get the Golden Globe award. Yeah yeah there are other performances to consider, but I rooting for Rooney. Shame her sisters not as good, pretty girl though. Anyway, Fincher mark is all over this. Obviously because it's his film. But I consider this his darkest film since Se7en. It's sub dark. Recreating the infamous rape scene, which is a terrifying scene but still watchable, as is Lisbeth's revenge against her rapist.<br/><br/>The tone of the film does change, but never hinders the consistency of the plot and story. Both of which are faithful to the Swedish original. I also liked the intro. Stylish and sexy techno music with a with great visuals. Quite a few humorous moments and quite a few sex scenes in this. Neither of which stopped me from loving a well written, brilliantly adapted, visually wonderfully thriller. Best Director, Actress, Screenplay and Cinematography nominations will follow. One of the films of the year. Anyway, Fincher mark is all over this. Obviously because it's his film. But I consider this his darkest film since Se7en. It's sub dark.

","I thought the story line was very interesting, but the rape scenes were too disgusting for me! I feel it would have been better with less. I almost walked out after the rape scene. The mystery was great and the acting very convincing. I like that the main character was strong and finally fought back against her rapist, but wished she would have done so in the second scene. I was just way too uncomfortable watching her be abused. It did not help that a person next to me brought a young child who watched it all! Not a child movie which anyone should be able to figure that out! I would have liked the character more if she was less easy and did not have sex with everyone in the movie. It seemed like sex scenes were just put in out of context. I understand that the sex scene with the woman showed that she had an abusive history with men and turned to woman, but all the others I felt were a bit much. I would not watch it again and wish I had not gone to see it."
"padres01","8","5","12","27 December 2011"," Not Sure it Was Better Than the Swedish Flick
","I read Stieg Larsson's entire Millennium Trilogy, and I recommend that people read the books before setting foot in a theater.<br/><br/>Of course, movies never live up to books, and the way the reader imagines characters, scenes, plot development, storytelling tension, etc.<br/><br/>As a standalone film, this film is OK, but I feel sorry for anyone who is not familiar with the trilogy and all of its story lines and intricacies. I don't know how anyone who has not read the books could possibly follow the plot line, or see the complexities of each character and their relationships to each other.<br/><br/>I saw all of the Swedish films based on the books, and I'm still not convinced that the first Hollywood installment is any better than the Swedish version. The Hollywood version might be a bit slicker and bigger budget, and its screenplay might be a tad tighter, and more well written.<br/><br/>All in all, though, I was not as blown away by the Hollywood version as I had hoped. The ""corny"" factor that was evident in the Swedish films seems to have been taken care of in the Hollywood version. But then you have the ""weirdness"" of accents used to convey ""otherness"" and ""foreignness"" to U.S. audiences.<br/><br/>U.S. audiences may enjoy the newer version because we are biased toward movies filmed in English, and biased toward more well-known actors and actresses, i.e. Daniel Craig over Michael Nyqvist. It goes without saying that the Swedish films were more authentic.<br/><br/>I will say this, though, Rooney Mara kicks ass as Lisbeth Salander, and I might even like her performance more than Noomi Rapace's. I didn't think anyone could top Rapace, but Mara may have just done that.<br/><br/>Minor footnote: I really wish the producers had ended the film with another hard- charging Led Zep song."
"DJRMewzique","9","5","12","21 December 2011"," Every once in a blue moon, an American version does far surpass the original.
","As soon as the Stieg Larsson movement made its way to North America, me being a pop culture junkie, I was intrigued. But I hate to read. Lucky for me, of course, the three books in the trilogy had already been made into feature films in Sweden, and thus, I saw them all. And to be quite frank, I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about, as made evident by my reviews of the first three films. The story seemed choppy, convoluted and the films were far too long and seemed to drag forever.<br/><br/>I understand now that I think a fair amount was simply lost in translation¬Öor missed due to reading sub-titled.<br/><br/>""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" has now been remade by an American filmmaker. Although usually the kiss of death right there, well, um¬Ö.Not this time.<br/><br/>As soon as I heard there was to be a remake, I sorta cringed at the thought, but once I saw the Swedish version, I couldn't help but think it could be improved upon considerably. And the story would be much easier to follow in, you know, English. When I found out the man behind the film was going to be David Fincher , however, I couldn't imagine a remake not being anything less than exquisite. With works of brilliance like ""Seven,"" ""Zodiac,"" and his Oscar-nominated ""The Social Network"" under his belt, this film couldn't have possibly been anything less than electrifying.<br/><br/>And I was right. Right from his signature, breathtaking opening credits.<br/><br/>There were a lot of things about the story I had a hard time keeping track of the first time around, but I remember the film. And what Fincher managed to do was nothing short of beautiful. Staying very true to the original film, but flushing out what I can only imagine to be some of the more subtle details of the book, he has made a much more uniform film.<br/><br/>The incredibly talented (and stunning) Daniel Craig takes over the role of Mickael Blomkvist, a discredited journalist who is hired by a wealthy patriarch to try to solve the murder of his niece forty years prior. Aided by a brilliant but troubled researcher, Lisbeth Salander, they uncover corruption that goes far beyond what they expected to find.<br/><br/>Craig's performance is nothing short of perfect, but Rooney Mara's transformation into Lisbeth is nothing short of extraordinary. Last seen in a small role in ""The Social Network,"" the actress is almost unrecognizable as she executes the troubled character with such precision, watching her on screen is like a moving work of art, both painful and graceful. Having just captured a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, I would be hard pressed to imagine that her nomination won't translate into one for an Academy Award as well. A nomination that I think she could have a serious shot of winning, despite the obvious upcoming inclusion of some woman with the last name of Streep.<br/><br/>And although the rest of the supporting cast is made up of excellent performances by the likes of Oscar-nominated Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and a surprisingly strong showing for an unexpected Joely Richardson (""Nip/Tuck""), the real artist here is, once again, Fincher himself. Going against everything most American directors attempt, Fincher did not try to Americanize the film in any way. There was worry that he might water it down or make it more Hollywood-friendly but the end result is, in fact, a film that is even more violent, more distressing, and even more sexually charged than the Swedish attempt. No corners were cut, no locations were changed, no smoothing anything over to avoid an R rating. With just a slight alteration for a more cohesive ending (no idea if this ending is not in the book, or the original films ending is), Fincher managed to make the film I completely expected him to make. And then some.<br/><br/>Yes, the film does indeed run a little long, as did the original, but with so much intrigue and twists and turns, it doesn't run so long to make you check the time. It simply manages to tell an excellent story of familial corruption, while conveying the true, intense, incredible hardships of a heartbreakingly beautiful and intelligent but violent woman who has covered up her pain in makeup and hairspray. And tattoos."

","Hollywood did not mess this up. David Fincher did a spectacular job putting this together and he did a great job putting his own spin on it. I think the best strategy was what they did - they did a completely different angle than the Swedish set of movies. You really can't compare the two - they're both spectacular.<br/><br/>Loved the opening sequence - very James Bond-y. All of the actors were great and Daniel Craig was awesome as Mikael Blomkvist. Rooney Mara also did a great job. The cinematography was great. It stayed true to the books while taking on a bit more of an action-y feel. Highly recommend watching this one - cannot wait for the next two!"
"barnabyrudge","8","4","9","10 April 2012"," Well made and compelling (but needless) remake of a Swedish crime thriller.
","The Girl With The Dragoon Tattoo (2011) is a direct translation of a 2009 Swedish movie starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace, based on a smash hit bestseller by the late Steig Larsson. It's quite sad in some ways that so many English-speaking viewers have a near-xenophobic attitude towards subtitled movies, necessitating Hollywood's fascination with remaking anything and everything that has been a hit on the continent. All too often, these Hollywood revamps fail to live up to their foreign source material, leaving one to ponder whether the whole remake game is really worthwhile at all. Although this version sticks very closely to the Swedish original ‚Äì so closely, in fact, that it is essentially a re-run in terms of plot and narrative ‚Äì it is done with enough energy and esprit de corps by director David Fincher to emerge a very commendable remake indeed, certainly one of the best in recent memory.<br/><br/>Journalist Michael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) runs Stockholm-based magazine Millennium, which has just been crippled after losing a libel case against a corrupt businessman. Facing the loss of his business and all his life-savings, Blomkvist gets an unexpected chance at redemption when he is summoned by aging tycoon Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to the remote northern island of Hedeby to help solve an old family mystery. Forty years earlier, Henrik's niece Harriet vanished under mysterious circumstances and has long been assumed dead. However, every year Henrik receives for his birthday a framed flower like the ones Harriet used to make for him, sent anonymously from an undisclosed location. He has long suspected that Harriet was murdered by a family member on that fateful day forty years ago, and believes the murderer is sending the flowers in an effort to drive him to despair. Blomkvist is hired to delve into the mystery, coming at it with a fresh pair of eyes. To aid him in his quest, he enlists Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a bisexual, computer hacking cyber punk who happens to be a surveillance whiz with a photographic memory. Comrades between the sheets as well as in their quest for the truth, Blomkvist and Salander soon discover their lives are in danger as they close in on a very perverted serial killer indeed.<br/><br/>Whichever version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo you watch first is likely to be your favourite, simply because the story relies on surprise revelations and a handful of powerful shock scenes for its effect. Both versions generate a compelling and utterly absorbing mystery, benefiting hugely from authentic Swedish location work and the cunningly twisty narrative. In this one, Craig is extremely good as Blomkvist, giving perhaps his most admirable performance to date. The real scene stealer though is Mara, suggesting quiet torment and rage as the weird but resourceful heroine. It's a difficult role, calling for some very frank scenes to say the least, including one of the most graphic rapes ever seen in a mainstream movie. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is slightly overlong and the journey to the denouement is ultimately more gripping than the solution itself, but overall it is a very well made and compulsively watchable thriller. Remaking a movie two years after the original may seem pretty pointless, but if it must be done then at least Fincher does it with his usual provocative panache."

","First of all, I have to preface this by saying I have not read the novel nor seen the Swedish film. Watching David Fincher's American version is my first experience with this story. Now that that is out of the way,what can I say about this film other than how this is filmmaking at its finest? Totally riveting, brilliant and captivating. From the hauntingly beautiful score, to the picture perfect cinematography,to the gripping intensity of the dialogue, and the amazing performances by all of the cast, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one of my favorite movies of all time. It hits every beat and always nails the feelings of the characters beautifully. I loved everything about this movie. I loved the performance of Rooney Mara in particular. Wow talk about giving yourself completely to a character and film role? She did not hold back and delivered one of the most brilliant, magnificent performances of all time. She hit every beat perfectly and said so much with the look in her eyes. This movie is very dark and very disturbing in certain scenes. And this movie does not have tons of action. It relies on its dialogue and its character development, which is the strongest I've seen in a long time in a film. The dialogue is important and puts the pieces together beautifully. And when the film does have action, it once again delivers perfectly on the mark. I could say so much more about this wonderful piece of cinematic excellence but I will simply say this: one of the best movies, not only of the year, but also of all time. David Fincher once more hits the mark. This movie is not for everyone, if you don't like long movies with lots of dialogue and few action scenes and if you don't like gruesome, grotesque, overtly violent scenes-this movie isn't for you. But if you like dark films with great dialogue, haunting music, superb acting, and an overall look and feel of excellence-then this movie is for you. I can't wait to see this movie again and again. This film gets 9 out of 10 rating from me."

"tbmforclasstsar","10","4","9","27 February 2012"," a terrifying and powerful adaptation that could be the darkest work of David Fincher
","David Fincher has never been one to shy away from a dark story or a demented character. A John Doe that kills according to the deadly sins, an anarchist with split-personality disorder, and the infamous zodiac killer are all within Fincher's repertoire of films. And now, Fincher may have achieved his darkest work with one of the most interesting characters he has ever had.<br/><br/>Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is nothing short of an incredible achievement in filmmaking set within a terribly dark and troubling tale. Based on the millennium book trilogy by deceased writer Stieg Larsson, Fincher's adaptation is a nightmarish film that is most likely the best possible portrayal of the source material I can imagine.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" follows the story of Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a magazine publisher that takes a break from his work when he loses a libel case for an article he had written and published about a powerful businessman. Taking some time away, Blomkvist is contacted by a lawyer named Frode who represents another powerful businessman, Henrik Vanger(Christopher Plummer). After taking a meeting in the small and wintery town of Hedestad, Blomkvist signs on to write the memoirs of the Vanger family, but, more importantly, to try and solve a murder over 35 years old.<br/><br/>During his meeting, Henrik explains to Blomkvist that his grandniece Harriet has been missing since 1966, when she disappeared during a family party. The most curious part: a car accident on a bridge that day meant that Harriet could only have been abducted or murdered by someone within the Vanger family.<br/><br/>The task of finding answers in a case that has had multiple detectives and investigators looking for the victim is no easy business, especially when the possible murderer is most likely walking around with you every day on the small island that you must investigate on. Eventually, Blomkvist finds that he needs a research assistant. An easy hire for Frode¬Ö he can just bring on the girl who did the background check on Blomkvist.<br/><br/>Enter Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a computer hacking researcher that comes from an incredibly troubled past. Ruled legally incompetent and asocial at an early age, Salander has had a legal guardian since the age of twelve. Her first guardian got along as well as someone could get along with a troubled child like this, but after his unfortunate stroke, Salander receives a new guardian who is a sick sadist that forces Salander to perform sexual favors in order for her to get her own money. Once again, this is not a fairy tale story.<br/><br/>Eventually, Salander and Blomkvist join forces in the search for Harriet and dig deeper and deeper into the chaos and terror that makes up the Vanger family. But will they be able to solve the crime when their own lives suddenly become at risk?<br/><br/>What works so brilliantly in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is the raw power of the images and sequences combined with brilliant acting and score. Fincher is known for his dark and gritty films, and he holds nothing back in this adaptation. Having read the book and seen the Swedish version, I truly believe that this is the most powerful telling of the first part of the millennium trilogy. Where the book falters in extraneous and dull detail and unnecessary plot developments, and where the Swedish film doesn't dive deep enough into the filth of the story, Fincher's ""Dragon Tattoo"" exceeds brilliantly.<br/><br/>Slightly reconstructing some aspects of the story while remaining incredibly true to the source material, Fincher creates a tour de terror that digs deep into the characters as well as the audiences watching the film. From the first minutes, which include an insane credit sequence of black ooze, computer cables, dragons, fire, and Karen O. and Trent Reznor's new version of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song,"" (credits that may top Fincher's fantastic credit sequence in ""Se7en"") Fincher takes us on a no-holds-bar journey into the mysterious and twisted lives of seemingly ordinary people¬Ö and Fincher really brings the monsters out.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of this film is without a doubt the performance of Rooney Mara as Salander. After a long auditioning process that almost had Mara walk away from the project, Fincher signed on this almost no name to take on one of the most complex and challenging characters that has been in film in some time. Salander is a reclusive, angsty young girl that has been caught up in a life that might be as dark as the Vanger family. Mara has the incredibly difficult job of portraying someone who is seemingly unrelatable, but someone the audience must care for. With careful movements and facial expressions combined with terrifying anger and energy, Mara pulls off one of the best acting performances of the year and shows talent beyond her years. This is a performance that can put someone on the map, and Mara knocks it out of the park.<br/><br/>In reality, I believe this is what a true adaptation should look like. This is a film that can be defined to some degree by the source material that the story is based on, but, more importantly, it is characterized and comes to life through the craftsmanship of the filmmakers and performances by the cast.<br/><br/>Fincher's telling of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an electrifyingly cold tale that takes us to the brink of insanity, and even lets us look over the edge. Fincher's brilliant visuals, the performance by Mara, and the incredible score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create an atmosphere that is almost incomparable. A terrifying thriller into a dark world of murder, torture, and snow, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is exactly as advertised: The Feel Bad Movie of Christmas.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at CustodianFilmCritic.com"

As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined (plot).<br/><br/>What is hidden in snow, comes forth in the thaw (Great Tagline!), I was really looking forward to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo ever since I learned that David Fincher had been attached to, First i didn't see the Swedish version or read the novel, so i can't say if this film best than the first version, or the adaptation was best than the novel!, so i will talk about what i saw in ""Fincher Film"".<br/><br/>About the film, without a Spoilers words, I completely loved it, I usually like thrillers and mysteries, but this one is even better. It's not only thriller, it's also drama and the characterization is strong and it shakes you all the time along. The plot actually contains two story lines, Vanger family and Lisbeth Salander, which eventually clash together, and each is fantastic by itself. Story is intriguing, it doesn't back out one bit from telling the ugly truth and it doesn't even soften it. It says straight in your face everything you need to know. With no sugar-coding at all.<br/><br/>Now the Acting : I want to say about this movie is Rooney Mara's performance, she knocks it out of the park portraying Lisbeth Salander, she captured the mystery, the strangeness, the darkness, the out-of-the- norm personality that this character had. She was absolutely fantastic, she was really great and when you see her expressions you will feel her in the darker parts of this movie, which we'll get to in a moment, Daniel Craig is great as usual and there is great chemistry between him and Mara. Christopher Plummer, as little as he's in the movie, does a great job as well, in fact all the actors do. This is a really well acted movie.<br/><br/>David Fincher has put his trademark darkness to fantastic use. Whether its sweeping shots of freezing, snow covered Sweden or wonderfully eerie interiors Fincher creates an unsettling atmosphere that is unrelenting and technically perfect. With Fincher i've learnt to expect a beautifully shot film and this is no exception, within this film are some of his greatest images. Regarding the disturbing nature of some scenes, Fincher is wise enough to show them in all their horror but doesn't stop to linger or exploit.<br/><br/>Finally, this film is absolutely amazing, it does in my opinion, despite speculation, the movie moves at a break neck speed from the beautiful opening sequence, wonderfully reminiscent of Fight Club all the way through an astonishing piece of movie making to the end, definitely on of the best in 2011, stop thinking and when you see Fincher in the poster what ..what do you expect from him?Masterpiece.<br/><br/>5/5"

","OK I just saw this movie and it was really good. I think there are some very intense moments that made me very uncomfortable to watch. I think most people agree to that. If you read the books you know that its coming, but still hard to watch it and not sure we needed to see as much as we did. But, the acting was superb! I was also reading of Rooney's transformation for the character, all her piercing and stuff. That is very commendable that she went so far to embrace the character. I'm not an actor but I don't think I could go that far for one movie. impressive. I agree that it is very dialogue driven, and there are a lot of moments that might have come across as slow moving. But the actors kept it so interesting I was not bored at all. they are both very talented actors. I would recommend it. But read the book first!"

","The brutal violence of ""Se7en"", the complex intelligence of ""Zodiac"" and the gripping style of ""The Social Network"" are only the tip of the iceberg in David Fincher's ninth feature film, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"".<br/><br/>As an avid reader of the novels and original Swedish adaptations, I was skeptical of the American ""remake"", but although the original Swedish adaptations were well-acted, especially from Noomi Rapace, they suffered from low budgets that prevented the lavish production on display here.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score is haunting, suiting the feeling of the film perfectly, as does the ominous cinematography of the cold Swedish countryside. Rooney Mara is outstanding as Lisbeth Salander. She is fierce, original and, on rare occasion, insecure. Daniel Craig is impressive as Mikael Blomkvist, while Christopher Plummer is first-rate as Henrik Vanger. <br/><br/>""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is a captivating film that will have you on the edge of your seat, whether you've seen the original or not.

"Andy-296","5","4","9","26 January 2012"," Not completely worthless, but disappointing
","A Hollywood remake of a Swedish movie made just two years ago, is the first part of the best selling trilogy Millennium, by the late Swedish author (and journalist) Stieg Larsson. The plot is mostly about how investigative journalist Michael Blomkvist (clearly an alter ego of Larsson) is asked by Henrik Vanger, an aging captain of industry to solve the murder of his favorite niece forty years ago. By some strange circumstances, he will be helped in the investigation by the pierced, troubled hacker Lisbeth Salander, with whom professional cooperation will soon turn into the personal as they discover the very dark secrets running under the very successful Vanger family. The Hollywood version is also set in Sweden, though here all the characters speak in English.<br/><br/>As much as I like the original movie (I haven't read the books) I must admit that its view of the world is a bit naive, equivalent to an earnest teenager shouting that the whole world is corrupt. In the US version, Blomkvist is played by Daniel Craig (a fine actor who has made a career playing macho guys) as a stronger and more attractive man than in the Swedish movie (where he was played by the older and somewhat chubby Michael Nyqvist). On the other hand, the Lisbeth Salander character is played in the remake by Rooney Mara as a weaker woman than in the original (she might be a fine actress, but she doesn't show it here, despite critical acclaim for her performance). Noomi Rapace made a far stronger impression as Lisbeth in the Swedish movie.<br/><br/>Though there are not major changes in the movie plot, the Hollywood version does make small variations, which I think are generally for the worse. For instance, when Craig tries to understand the meaning of certain numbers that might be a clue to the murder, his daughter, who is a fervent catholic going to a religious camp, alerts him that they are a biblical reference. This scene is unlikely, since there are very few Catholics in Sweden, or very religious people for that matter, as it is a very secular country. In the original version, the character of the daughter does not appear, and is Lisbeth, by surfing in the net, that finds the religious connections.<br/><br/>The director is David Fincher. He has occasionally made fine movies (for instance, Zodiac) but most of the time his work tend to the flashy and empty (Seven, Fight Club), the overrated (The Social Network) if not to the directly mediocre (Benjamin Button). This movie is not totally worthless, but it is disappointing, and it is considerably weaker than the original version."
"valexiadis","8","4","9","24 January 2012"," A good film but worse than the original in every single way
","Let me first of all begin by saying that I was very excited when I found out Fincher was directing the remake of an already great film. I was even more excited when I saw Craig was portraying Blomkvist. All that started changing when I saw the first poster which had to be a tiny bit provocative in order to promote the film. Then I watched the first trailer and I wasn't very impressed. I wouldn't watch the film but I kept hearing everyone saying it was great and I saw the IMDb rating so I started believing it was even better than the original one. But it isn't. I didn't like some changes they made (like for example the sweater) and I didn't like the acting. I didn't mind so much about Craig but in my opinion Mara didn't impress. Noomi Rapace's acting was a lot better. The same goes for the rest of the characters. The original Henrik was much more emotional and seemed more concerned and the original young Harriet was so much more better. She had such distinctive eyes that you just couldn't shake them for the whole film. Finally, I also preferred the original ending as well.<br/><br/>To conclude, if someone has watched the original first I don't think he/she would be very impressed with the remake. It's a good film because the story is amazing but it just isn't as good as the first one. I gave it an 8 for that exact reason. The original one got a 10."
"barberoux","7","4","9","9 January 2012"," Good but Swedish version is better.
","I enjoyed this version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". It was a well made and well acted movie and I gave it a 7/10 rating. But I enjoyed the Swedish version more, 8/10. The Swedish version was truer to the book and a bit more coherent. The acting in both movies was fine, some great performances in both and I can't really fault either movie. I thought the American version could have been a bit confusing since they took such liberties with the book's narrative. The main character of Mikael Blomkvist in the American version was a bit less conspicuous which is a good thing since I got rather sick of Mikael Blomkvist by the end of the third book. He wasn't a believable character since he was so self-righteous and such a ladies man. His portrayal by Michael Nyqvist in the Swedish version was also underplayed, and well acted. The really big difference between the versions was the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander. She was the biggest draw of the books and the movies and her character drove the narrative for me. Noomi Rapace portrayed her in the Swedish version and was wonderful in the role. She was Lisbeth Salander to me. Rooney Mara in the American version was good but not in the same league with Noomi Rapace. In the American film she came across as a more deliberately rude, petulant little girl, like a spoiled ,rich, high schooler who did what she did to get attention and anger people. Noomi Rapace's version came across as a more disturbed person, someone who just didn't have social skills or even thought about them. In the books she was more of a idiot savant or someone who could have Asperger syndrome. She was horrible mistreated as a youth but was extremely intelligent and talented. Noomi Rapace had that down. Her most interesting scenes were as Lisbeth sitting and thinking. You could see the wheels turning. You could see her figure things out. Rooney Mara didn't have that. She just was shock value. Not that she was bad in the role but just not deep enough. She bragged more and was more out there with her personality. Noomi Rapace was very internal and disliked anyone getting close to her. She had few friends and even with them she was very reserved. It was a wonderfully intriguing portrayal. Both movies are good but if you are a fan of the books you may like the Swedish version more with Noomi Rapace's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander."
"tjgross11","10","4","9","6 January 2012"," ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is brutal, dark, suspenseful, and holds many deep messages at its core. It is truly a masterpiece....
","I had heard many things before going to see this movie. I am a film critic as a hobby, and I knew that the critics all loved this movie, however, many people I know who went to see it absolutely hated it. If you go to the movies to socialize and eat popcorn, then this movie is probably not for you. However, if you look for near perfection in a deep, dark, yet tormentingly beautiful movie, then you will love ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."" <br/><br/>I always appreciate when movies are deep, and even when there is a main story, there are messages throughout about different subjects. Although this film is essentially about a murder mystery, it is SO much more than that. As you progress through the story with these characters that you become hopelessly attached to, there are many symbolic scenarios that say a lot about human emotion, relationships, and victims of violence.<br/><br/>I know that this is a short review, but it is mostly because I could go on for weeks about how masterful this movie is. With excellent acting, a gripping story, interesting characters, and symbolism, ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is not for the weak minded, and certainly not for people who can't see past what is on the screen. This film has made its way on my top 5 movies of all time - It sucks you in and doesn't let up, and even being over 2 hours and 30 minutes, it will leave you craving more."
"darbmilne","9","4","9","30 December 2011"," Loved Fincher's version
","I watched this movie just the other night and was definitely a fan. Rooney Mara, Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, and the rest of the cast are all wonderful in this movie. The movie also looked beautiful, and was edited as well as it could be with considerations to the plot of the book. It was definitely a movie that was elevated by the performances and the direction of Fincher. The story is not a bad story mind you, just nothing groundbreaking or out of the ordinary for the genre. I must say it is likely to dark to garner any serious awards consideration, but I do firmly believe that Rooney Mara's performance was the best I saw by a female this year. She may not have physically embodied the role the way Naoomi Rapace did in the Swedish version, but I had no trouble believing her in the role, and it was definitely a complete transformation from anything she had done previously. <br/><br/>The story concerns itself with a great many things, and therefore is a longer film but I didn't feel that it wasted a moment. Once again if you are a fan of the original as well as the books I am sure you will be a fan of this."
"Jan_El_Senor","9","4","9","29 December 2011"," My opinion: US vs. Swedish
","OK. This movie was awesome. Go and see it now! <br/><br/>My opinion as far as the Swedish version vs. the US version: The US version is superior. The Swedish version was made on a ""made for TV"" budget, and this one has the big budget in addition to top-notch actors and a top-notch director. <br/><br/>Believe it or not, my only complaint about the US version is Daniel Craig. It was hard to accept him as being so helpless in some scenes. Plus, at one point he is having a hard time hiking up a hill and he states that he is really out of shape. That's kind of silly in a movie where the very obviously in shape Daniel Craig does a sex scene a few minutes later. His performance wasn't bad, but they should have done more to separate him from his Bond image. Any scene where he is wearing a suit, it is fitted just like Bond. I think a more ""frumpy"" wardrobe would have helped....<br/><br/>And Rooney Mara owned the role of Lisbeth. She had some big shoes to fill after Noomi Rapace's performance in the Swedish version. She was equal to the task. Both were really good in the role, but if I had to choose, I'd say Rooney was slightly better. Her performance was a little more emotional, and her younger look really sold the character.<br/><br/>Storywise: there's not much new here. I've heard that this version is supposed to be closer to the book (which I have not yet read), but there wasn't much difference here to make me believe that.<br/><br/>If I had to point out one thing I liked better in the Swedish version, it was Lisbeth's parole officer (or whatever he's called as far as Swedish law goes). The actor was just a much creepier fellow in that version (in my opinion). The dude in the US version was good and he sells it. He's just not as good by comparison.<br/><br/>Overall: see this even if you loved the Swedish version because this one is just as good, if not better."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","9","25 December 2011"," Given the challenge of adapting Larsson's novel, it's a strong thriller
","Be prepared to have your annual ""movies are never as good as the books"" conversation with family and friends, because Stieg Larsson's worldwide best-seller ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" has come to theaters (this time without subtitles).<br/><br/>Wanting to honor the beloved source material, Sony placed this American version in the hands of serial killer mystery expert David Fincher (""Se7en,"" ""Zodiac"") and Oscar-winning writer Steve Zaillian (""Schindler's List""). The move pays off, because ""Dragon Tattoo"" is about as good as it possibly could be given the challenges of the adaptation.<br/><br/>The multi-faceted story deals primarily with Mikael Blomqvist (Daniel Craig), a journalist being sued for libel who temporarily steps down as his magazine's editor and quietly accepts an offer from a retired businessman named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Under the guise of writing Vanger's memoir, he is to investigate the unsolved mystery of Vanger's missing/presumed dead niece, Harriet, a case over 40 years old. In need of help, he comes across Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a strange young woman with expert hacking skills who passionately takes up the job due to her own troubled past.<br/><br/>Much like its Swedish predecessor, this adaptation strives to pack the bulk of the novel into a ""reasonable"" runtime without boring its audience to death. Zaillian compresses the hundreds of complex details of the cold case at the film's epicenter into easily digested chunks, yet merely having to do so always produces no better than satisfactory results. Oddly enough, saying the script doesn't derail the film or damage the story and its characters is the highest of compliments one can pay it in this case, and that's what it does.<br/><br/>But it's Fincher who elevates this film, with no offense intended toward Niels Arden Oplev, director of the 2009 effort. Fincher is a master of his craft, and that means a considerable amount when dealing with a film so densely filled with plot points that other elements (like character development) can get lost.<br/><br/>Although no adaptation of this novel could possibly convey the lengthy passage of time and the obsessive nature of Blomqvist's search for the truth, Fincher provides an abundance of tone, especially in reflecting the frigid temperatures of northern Sweden. He and his ""The Social Network"" and ""Fight Club"" cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth make it so every golden ray of sunlight on the desolate island feels as warm as it looks. Only directly blasting cold air on you from the back of your seat a la a ""4D"" theme park attraction would be more effective.<br/><br/>The film's editing job is also top notch, overlapping audio and video to smooth over the exorbitant location transitions and maximize suspense in the scenes that cut back and forth between Lisbeth and Blomqvist. In fact, the movie finds its best groove in these scenes.<br/><br/>Also crucial to depicting the book are the issues of graphic content, namely violence and sadism. After all, the translation of the original Swedish title is ""Men Who Hate Women."" Fincher embraces the book's sexual and disturbing nature as evidenced most basically in the marketing campaign. He also doesn't shy away in the film's most difficult scenes, giving them the brutal and sordid edge they require to honor the message of Larsson's novel. Although it feels wrong to call them tastefully done given the subject matter, it's true.<br/><br/>Mara's performance mirrors Fincher's vision in many ways. There's no expectation of pity for Lisbeth, yet neither is she a hollow shell who completely bottles up her feelings. She bares it all in this film in every sense, giving herself to the performance. Rather than ham it up a notch to get some Oscar attention, she sticks with her interpretation of the character and makes for a rather unforgettable Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>Craig is also a perfect Blomqvist, though his character lacked something distinctive, perhaps due to the script not giving him many moldable moments. A similar fate befalls many of the characters, which just emphasizes the need for Fincher's work and the talent of his actors all the more. Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Martin Vanger, the current CEO of the Vanger Corporation, does perhaps the best job of utilizing his screen time to create a compelling character.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a busy movie, and understandably so. Larsson's story deserves its integrity preserved the way it was in this version (only minor omissions and one major change), even at the cost of something that could have been more emotional and moving. Putting the book down and looking at this as a mystery/thriller, it's a consummate offering for the genre. Those unfamiliar with its source material will find it a bit slow at points and not as clean as a thriller written directly for the screen, but will still enjoy the payoff thanks to the professionalism of Fincher and Zaillian.<br/><br/>A book and two movies later, rather than saying ""the book is better,"" it should be said that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" thrives the most in its original novel form. Some books lend themselves to film better than others ‚Äî this isn't one of them. Given this movie took it out of its ideal state, its a good thing it turned out how it did.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site! moviemusereviews.com"
"ldquinn","7","4","9","24 December 2011"," Good, But Not The Original or the Book
","I must confess that I write this with just a bit of bias. I had already seen the original Swedish film and felt that it was one of the top ten films of the last year or so; therefore, the new version had quite a hill to climb were it to rate better (in my mind) than the earlier version.<br/><br/>If I could forget having seen the earlier version, I would have come away from this film with the comment that it was a well done film but didn't really do justice to the book.<br/><br/>Both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara did very good jobs in handling their parts as written. However, with a deeper script in this version, they acted with much less nuance than did Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.<br/><br/>The film began with a very dark, James Bondish, introduction which was really excellent. Throughout the film, the hand of the director, David Fincher, could be seen, working his magic on his vision of the book.<br/><br/>This film varied from the book (as many films do) and from the earlier version - in most cases the changes added to the experience, although there were a couple of times the changes were a bit too far afield. I, personally, found the changed ending spoke more to how Fincher wanted the ending to be than did Stieg Larsson, the author.<br/><br/>So, I guess the final tally is:<br/><br/>1) If you read the book - This film, while not true to the book, is a very well done film that is well directed, well acted and generally well done.<br/><br/>2) If you saw the original - This film doesn't reach the pinnacle that the earlier version did. It's still a good film; just not up to the standards of the original, especially in the acting department."
"oldgirl","8","4","9","23 December 2011"," Captures the tone
","Although I've read all three of the books (structurally, they're really 3 installments of one big honking novel), I haven't seen the Swedish movies. Forget about the books. Forget about the other movies. On its own, this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and resonance of the novels, and it does this with admirable brevity and to-the-bone editing. There is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely encapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds. Snow. The sterility of Martin Vanger's modern house on the hill. The cool patina of years on the old cottage's walls, furniture, and stonework. The camera dwells on Lizbeth Salander's inexpressive face and you can almost hear her complex gears spinning away. The lighting director in this film is a genius -- and so is the cinematographer -- emotions are relayed in light and shadow so well, and the camera angles nudge our tensions without being overt about it. It's not perfect, of course. No movie version of a well-plotted novel ever is. But it strives to do the story justice, and manages to accomplish its task."

","If you saw and liked the original Swedish film based on Stieg Larsson's novel ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"" you might be pleased or disappointed with David Fincher's English-language remake for the same reason: this is a pretty straight-forward remake with few surprises for fans of Neil Arden Opley's 2009 adaptation of the same material. Even the leading players, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, seem to have been chosen because of their resemblance to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.<br/><br/>Despite its familiarity, I found this version as engrossing as the first with the cast more than equal to the challenge of bringing these characters to life. And if you're looking for a great insult to direct at an enemy, the phrase on Mara's T-shirt in one scene is a masterpiece of raunchy perfection. I think Leo the Lion, M-G-M's mascot, may have read it, too, which could explain why his roar was silent for a change when the company logo appeared on screen before the movie.<br/><br/>Be sure not to miss the opening titles which reminded me of the opening of a Bond film as it might appear in a nightmare."
"gigadragon12","8","4","9","22 December 2011"," A formula whodunit cake sprinkled with intrigue and an unexplored better storyline
","Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is essentially a whodunit layered by a story about an investigative journalist getting his professional dignity stripped from him and then reaffirmed. It's central focus being that the title character Lisbeth, is a bad ass never back down girl who is stuck in between a rock and a hard place and performs several lewd, violent, and otherwise ""bad"" acts in order to get what she wants. Where the movie loses its center is in emphasizing the seemingly usual whodunit plot line that is the heart of this story, but not its soul, which lies in the personal stories of its characters.<br/><br/>Before the bad stuff, let's talk about the good stuff. The stories of Lisbeth and the whodunit are both crafted superbly. While I can't say either of them are different or challenging the mainstream craft of these types of story lines, it doesn't change how visceral the scenes within are. I don't want to give anything away, but I want to say that there are a minimum of three scenes in this movie that made my skin crawl and my seat feel physically uncomfortable, but in a great way that only movies can manage. Note: This movie is really not for the weak of heart.<br/><br/>Both lead actors do well with their roles. Lisbeth is brought to life in every blank stare and movement, yet something about the whole character seems very statue like, I can't figure out if it's good or bad, but it was believable in any case. As for Daniel Craig, I've enjoyed his turns as James Bond, and this role is like a less secret agent version of that role.<br/><br/>In all reality I look at this movie and I believe that what's been done here is very good, possibly the best film of this year, but I would assert that that statement is not saying much. This has not been a great year at the movies.<br/><br/>However let's address what I was alluding to about the heart of the movie and the soul of the movie. Where the movie spends much of its filming genius and storyline is in the whodunit plot line. Intricate set pieces with perhaps one too many family members and flashbacks and pictures all lend themselves to a formulaic mystery plot line that serves as the driving point of staying with the movie. However, before starting that plot line and for about the last thirty or so minutes of the movie, that's not what this movie is about.<br/><br/>While the movie spends so much time working the whodunit, several other more interesting things have happened and eventually happen that get skated over because the biggest part of the running time was spent on David Fincher's version of noir, without all the pulp that comes with the cop drama. Just about every moment of the film that doesn't have to do with this central theme has more interesting elements, but none of them are spent with much time, its almost like they were put in the movie just so people couldn't point and say, ""You left this this this and this out of the movie when they were in the book,"" but they are thrown together so fast and recklessly that it leaves me wondering if the book truly skated over these plot points with such abandon or if I have to go read it to get what feels like the actual story.<br/><br/>The biggest issue comes from its central characters only participating in the whodunit because there in lies something they want. For all the time the film spends making Lisbeth a bad ass new age woman that gets what she wants for herself, they spend a lot of the film showing that she really is just a dressed up girl, who makes her self out as a vamp. None of this is more painfully shown than in the last shot of the movie, which I'll let all of you experience for yourselves.<br/><br/>While I like this film, something about it is just unbalanced from the story perspective. Why in a story rife with intrigue into the inner ties of corporate leaders and secrecy and shadows and computer hacking type activities must the plot butter up the seen a thousand times whodunit and skip the icing with the stories centered around these overarching elements? It doesn't make sense, and I firmly believe this film misses something from the book. Maybe I am wrong about that, but it makes the film seem unbalanced in that aspect.<br/><br/>And yet it is a good film. I will give it an 8 out of 10."

","Loved the movie, and I have read all three books and seen the Swedish versions. As one reviewer already mentioned, I wanted to clear something up: this is not a remake, but an adaptation of the book. People take away different thing from the book, hence why the movies have slight differences. Its fine to like one over the other, but reasons shouldn't be 'it's an American remake.' Both films took away different parts of the book, which on both films, can be disappointing. However, the book is written so in depth that some cuts had to be made. People cannot compare or say how Lisbeth is portrayed between the films without knowing her character in the book. Side note, I could have done without the beginning. A little too stylized for me. However, the performances were brilliant. And the score was great. This movie makes me want to watch seven again."

So the problem when you try to make an American version you can't avoid to compare every scene and every character. It happens involuntary. <br/><br/>I think I would have liked this movie if they had made a totally new movie based on the same story, and taken place in US or UK with American or British characters. Because it sounds ridiculous when Americans tries to pronounce Swedish towns or Swedish names. I don't get the point. This movie is full of great actors, but unfortunately they're not good in this movie, very few suit their characters. Craig makes a good performance as Mikael Blomqvist, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth is so anonymous, something is really missing in her character. Noomi Rapace makes it so much better. Most characters in the Swedish version is so much better, with a few exceptions. The characters in the Swedish version has more depth and credibility. So of course I'm aware that my love for the Swedish movie is affecting my review of this movie, maybe, I'm saying MAYBE, I would liked this movie more if I didn't see the Swedish version first. But I even think the storytelling is better in the Swedish version, I was pretty bored during watching the American. But the American version is without doubt worth watching. It's a decent movie."
"AMar_rom","Null","3","6","25 June 2013"," A good atmospheric film that did not balance well its two sub-plots
","Overall I liked the film but I have some reservations on the way the plot progressed. My main objection is that the major storyline was not self-contained: the film tried hard to merge two rather unrelated sub-stories that did not have too much in common. On one hand, the crime story with the disappeared woman and secondly the personal struggle of Rooney Mara's character (the girl with the Dragon Tattoo). Furthermore, her relationship with Daniel Craig's character was not convincing and was not given a proper build-up.<br/><br/>Despite the good acting and the eerie atmosphere of the crime subplot the movie suffered because of the above. To his credit, David Fincher, being a capable director barely managed to salvage the film. A 7/10 from me."
"p-stepien","5","3","6","10 February 2013"," The most expensive English dubbing ever!
","When Michael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) editor of the Millennium investigative journal becomes successfully sued for libel after reporting a story delivered by unchecked sources, his career and beloved paper seem to be in free-fall. Thus when offered lucrative employ by billionaire and family patriarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve a decades old mystery about the disappearance of his niece, he decides to take up the opportunity. As the clues start appearing the mystery starts to get bogged down and soon Michael decides to seek assistance with a reclusive computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a rebellious youth, who has become a ward of the state due to her destructive behaviour.<br/><br/>Based on the book by crime novelist Stieg Larsson, ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" is a second movie take on the story, after its Swedish predecessor, directed by Niels Arden Oplev was released just two years prior. Hence the issues stemming for inevitable comparisons, reinforced by both movies strongly following the source material. Mostly a scene for scene replica, but with differing directorial sensibilities, Fincher delivers a more cold and murky atmospheric version, with superior framing but one which failed to entice with its protagonists as strongly as Oplev's version. Whereas Rooney Mara does perfectly fine as Lisbeth Salander, somewhat more reclusive, detached and condescending, she lacks the same animalistic bite that Noomi Rapace provided, in my opinion evidently losing the battle to claim the character as her own. Daniel Craig imbues an increased sense of presence to Michael Blomkvist, although the absurdity of having the movie set in Sweden played by English speaking characters is never more evident, when the current James Bond attempts to add a weird twang to his accent to miraculously 'change' into a Swede.<br/><br/>Admitedly a huge David Fincher fan, ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" seems like an immense waste of time and money for viewers of the Swedish version. Even more so, that the American version actually feels inferior with character exposure dealt with less sensitivity and finesse, making it feel more forced and lacking the same flow. While focusing on creating a shadowy backdrop Fincher also fails to create a sense of familiarity with the key Vanger family and their decade-old mysteries, affording much less attention to Henrik, Martin or Cecilia. Oplev may have lacked the same opulence in shots, but manages to add more meat to the mystery, in part because he creates a sense that the island on which the Vanger's live is in itself one of the key characters to the story. In general Fincher seemed partly disinterested with conveying the story and character interaction, introducing small changes which actually hurt the gist of the Blomkvist-Salander relationship and failing to offer anything, which I wouldn't prefer to watch in the Swedish version. That said all three Stieg Larsson ""Millenium"" novels were filmed in Sweden, while only the first was artistically successful, the other two poor conceived follow-ups which afford Fincher vast space for delivering his improved version."
"vespatian75","6","3","6","15 September 2012"," Fair but not great.
","I must say I was a bit disappointed with this film. It is a decent film, but I don't think it is worthy of the high ratings it has gotten. First the good points. The acting is fine, particularly Art Rooney's grand daughter Rooney Mara. I would say it was competently directed with good atmospherics. However, I view it as a fairly standard mad killer movie which substitutes new clich√©s for old. We have Daniel Craig taking on the Lois Lane role of the intrepid but ultimately powerless reporter rescued by the cynical conflicted hero or in this case heroine. There are the now familiar Nazi villains but since Nazis are getting pretty old we have a son of the old Nazi taking up where his father left off. And we know that the villain is really evil because he quotes from the biblical book (gasp!) of Leviticus. Of course there's steamy modern takes on sex, bisexuality, rape and bondage, and the sadistic sexually abusive alpha males, etc. This would be okay but the movie, in my opinion doesn't deliver the thrills of a great mystery/suspense film. Worth seeing, sure, but a great film-not."

I am 15 years old and for my age, people would consider that I would like explosive movies, with awesome music and stuff like that, but I can see any movie yeah! Yet, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo made me say... It was brilliant. But yet, it had a few flaws:<br/><br/>1. Too Much Sexual Material: One Necessary and Highly Graphic Rape scene, two unnecessary sex scenes between Lisbeth and Mikael, an implied lesbian sex, too much female nudity and Lisbeth shoving up a sex toy to the man's anus. THE NUDITY/SEXUALITY IS HIGHLY DISTURBING!<br/><br/>2. Too Slow in some aspects: The Film, as well as the book, has a strong and captivating plot, but it's not well reinforced, since it's interrupted by many sex scenes.<br/><br/>3. Almost No Action: Okay, I know that the only factors nearing action is the flashback of the cars, Mikael getting hunted down, Lisbeth chasing Martin and Martin getting killed by an exploding car, but another few things could be recommended, for not to be an exception in the WOW! factor.<br/><br/>Sincerely, I enjoyed the movie a lot!

"timijan-tuparov","10","3","6","23 January 2012"," Beautifully brutal and intensely exciting
","As a fan of the Swedish Millennium trilogy based on the Stieg Larsson's works, I wasn't very happy when I learned that Hollywood got the rights to do American version of the book. I thought that they will ruin the original film like they did with Let The Right One In. Boy, I was wrong. I wasn't expecting much when I sat to watch the American version of the book, but as the story evolved, I was mesmerized by the vision of the director, David Fincher, of the events. It was more brutal than the original Swedish film and much more intense and clearer. People could actually follow the storyline of the film without having read the book first. The flash backs of the the past were very good touch, I think. And although I still prefer Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, I think Rooney Mara did a really great job and her performance is not one that you'll forget any time soon after you've watched the film. Noomi Rapace is darker and more manly, and Rooney Mara looks very fragile and gentle, but in spite of that she managed to look very dangerous and like a lunatic, which is something that only a great actress can manage to do. As of Mikael Blomkvist, Daniel Craig was better than Michael Nyqvist, in almost anyway. I only liked the way Michael Nyqvist managed to look like a frighten little child when he was hurt in the woods, in spite of the size of him. Daniel did managed to act that scene also good, but in his own special way. All I want to say is - WOW! I am pleasantly surprised by Hollywood and I think they did a great job making this film. It's beautifully brutal and intensely exciting. If you want trills, chills and enjoy a good story, don't you dare miss to watch this one. Definitely worth the time! Awesome job!"

It attacked religion, portrayed adultery as normal and OK, and displayed true X rated sex in an R rated movie. If it had been labeled correctly I would have chosen NOT to have seen it.

"MovieGeekBlog","6","10","32","19 December 2011"," A handsome but quite pointless adaptation.
","Your appreciation and enjoyment for this film mainly comes down to whether you buy into the story or not and whether you are you a fan of the original book (I should probably say books, since this is the first part of a trilogy). Unfortunately my answer to both questions is quite a drastic no: I know I am going to be quite unpopular with this statement, but I've never really fallen in love with the book and I in fact just don't seem to be able to find the appeal for the actual story itself. I find it quite derivative, exploitive, contrived and a bit heavy-handed to be honest. These exact same problems are translated (in fact even enhanced) into both film adaptations. It's probably unfair to draw comparisons with Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 version, but also unavoidable. There are of course similarities, but given the fact that David Fincher is directing, the US version is a lot more slicker and cinematic. It is also closer to the original book in many places, but, as always in condensing it all into a movie, it has lost some of its more polemical thrusts from Larsson's story and some of the details which made the characters so compelling. All for the sake of the actual crime/mystery plot (which let's face it, it's pretty bland for today's standards and brings very little new to the genre). So in the end, not only the film suffers from the same problems of the book but by shrinking it all it has lost some of its more subtle subtext too. I am not really saying anything new here: what works in books doesn't necessarily work movies. For example, the film spends a long time setting up the two main characters who don't meet until a good hour and 20 minutes into the story. And yet despite all this time Daniel Craig's character is just as elusive to the audience as it was at the beginning. That is an ongoing problem with Fincher's movies. His usual cold approach to film-making and detachment from his characters makes it always very hard for anyone to empathise with anyone on the screen. Craig does bring some unexpected charm and a slight sense of humour to his character (something which was completely absent in the previous version), but it's really not enough to make you care for his character, let alone for making you want to watch him again for the next couple of sequels (Fincher has recently announced his interest to direct both sequels back to back¬Ö But no official announcement will be made until this one get released, of course). It's Rooney Mara who really steals the show here (well, let face it, so did Noomi Rapace in the previous version. It's a great part to play!). This is one of the performances of the year and there will certainly be nominations and awards for her coming left and right over the next few months. She even manages bring a certain realism to an otherwise over-the-top character by convey both fragility and an incredible strength, sometimes with pure simple looks. However, did we really need that 1 hour and 20 minutes of preparation before these two characters meet? Did we really need to see the infamous rape scene? Yes of course, it's that rape that gives her the motivation for wanting to solve the crime, but why couldn't they just convey that with a quick flashback? Why was the audience allowed inside that room watching not only the rape but also her revenge to her rapist? Wouldn't it have been just as effective and less exploitive if we had been left outside the door, maybe listening to the screams? The problem is, if you take all that preamble out of the equation, you're actually left with very little else because let's face it, as a mystery this is a fairly derivative film. As I said, these are all queries with the book and the story itself . Given the material Fincher has probably down the best he could. This is a handsome film, with some solid acting (Plummer once again is at his best!) but in the end you're left with a sense of ""¬Öso what?"". I couldn't help feeling that everything that Fincher did in this film, he had already done it before. The dark tones of Se7en, the seedy and multi-layered atmosphere of Zodiac, the dark ominous music (if we can call it that) by Trent Reznor from The Social Network. Finally it's probably worth mentioning the impressive ""James Bondesque"" title sequence (again, Fincher has down beautiful title sequences before) to the notes of the cover version of ""Immigrant Song"" by Led Zeppelin which I found absolutely mesmerising and yet somehow seemed to belong to a different film altogether. In the end this film adds very little to the previous version, aside from giving us the wonderful Rooney Mara, and certainly adds nothing to what I already know about David Fincher. I just look forward to seeing him handling a script and a story worth of his craft, because I do believe he's one of the best directors out there right now¬Ö Moviegeekblog.com"

Based on the Swedish version and the great book and a in-general-decent director I've decided to give it a chance. It turns out to be a real crap. <br/><br/>In a simple word ,the main aim of the story is justifying showing disgusting rape scenes to satisfy sick viewers, or maybe wants to say I am so ugly so I'm special... Regardless of the main aim there are plenty of negative points:<br/><br/><ul><li>annoying English-Swedish accent - lack of character development - insisting on justifying immoral and outlaw behaviours - busy story with bunch of junk sub-stories that mess up the whole crap even more.</li></ul><br/><br/>Take away note: don't watch it, really is not worth your precious time, mood and money.<br/><br/>I got a bad headache after watching this crap."
"NapaRick","8","5","13","21 December 2011"," Very good but couldn't touch the Swedish version.
","When I first read this book I found it slow going and long. Even after reading half of it I didn't like the confusion or the slow pace. At 3/4 I began to like it and by the time I finished it had grown on me. Although not a well written book it was filled with detail that a movie maker could use to craft what they wanted into the picture. <br/><br/>When I saw the Swedish film I was really impressed. It was a little confusing but much better than the book. The photography was interesting and bright and helped to let the viewer focus on the complex plot. The acting was really good and it was surprising that none of the characters were particularly attractive. I expected the English version to be much less realistic and it was but that's OK. We imagine ourselves as the characters and are used to Hollywood. The shocking scenes of nudity, homosexuality, rape, sadism, bondage and torture are brutal and I'm not sure if this isn't the most shocking to the sensibilities of any movie I've seen in my life. It stays with you long after you watch it and doesn't make me want to go visit Sweden anytime soon. I'll never think of it as the land of Elke Summer again. On the plus side I was really amazed at the quality of acting, photography, editing and overall movie-making in the Swedish film. It's not just at the top of foreign films it is comparable to any non special effect American movie. <br/><br/>The American version I expected to be even better. I thought it would show the superior expertise of writers here portraying the complex plot in a more understandable manner. I thought there would be more effort shown with the pace of the movie and all the areas that we excel in because of the huge sums of money we put into our films. After all they were copying not only a best selling book but the most successful movie ever made in Sweden. How could it help but be better. Unfortunately I was wrong on all counts. <br/><br/>This should have been a piece of cake. They weren't working from a book but already had a very good movie to work from. It seems like the worst they could do was just dub it in English and reap millions. Instead they started with a Terminator beginning like a James Bond movie, completely out of place and inexplicable. Then they get a director of dark, scary movies to create a dark mood with DARK visuals to make everything hard to see and understand. Sure don't need that with a complex plot. The music seemed out of place also. You don't need all this scary stuff when the story is absolutely frightening without it and when the contrast of bright clarity and horrible actions is much more shocking. <br/><br/>A word about the characters. Daniel Craig looks a lot like the Swedish actor Michael Nyqvist except without the bad skin. Both were very good actors. The Girl Lizbeth (Noomi Rapace) was excellent. Going in everyone knew this was an Academy Award part besides being a three film role. What actress wouldn't want this role? And Mara Rooney also did a great job EXCEPT - now maybe I'm just getting old but they had her whisper stuff and mumble things and I absolutely couldn't hear or understand them. In a movie that has such incredible suspense you don't want to be asking the person next to you in the theater what the hell she said.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I like this movie. It was frightening. It was shocking. It was consequently REALLY memorable. But what an opportunity lost. I can't imagine how it could be easier to make a movie when all you have to do is copy a great one, make it in English, and improve on the weak points. Unfortunately it's sort of like they remade Pride and Prejudice with John Woo directing, and used rap music. The movie is a ""B"" that will get treated as an ""A"" because of the subject matter of abuse of women and how graphic the scenes of sexual abuse are. Rooney will receive awards, etc. But oh, what it could have been. <br/><br/>If you like this movie, which you will, get the Swedish version. You'll like it better."

","If you've seen the Swedish adaptation, you might think this is just an American attempt to get money out of a good franchise. Well, think again. This movie does what the Swedish one could not: it provided a chilling, dark, and isolated atmosphere that pervades throughout the movie, mostly thanks to Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' incredible, gripping score.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara also gives the performance of a lifetime. She is so dedicated to this role, and it shows. Just the face she makes in the end after getting her heart broken by Blomkvist should've won her an Oscar. Throughout the entire movie, she brings that quiet power and determination that Salander is known for, yet she also manages to convey a longing for someone to recognize her for who she is rather than how she looks. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig was also very good as Blomkvist, especially in the end sequence when he is being held by Martin, portrayed by a slyly evil Stellan Skarsg√•rd. Craig was able to bring Blomkvist's desperation and determination alive on the screen. You want to root for him, but deep down you know he is not a wholly good person, as he is unable to commit himself to any woman.<br/><br/>Now, it would be impossible to review this without comparing it to the book or the Swedish version. It is obviously impossible to fit the entire book into one movie, and I'd say Steven Zaillian did the best job he could. As for the Swedish film, I never liked it, and I thought Noomi Repace looked and acted nothing like how I imagined Salander.<br/><br/>This movie, in short, is a quiet masterpiece. It got noticed, but in my opinion, not enough. Sure, it might be sexual and violent, but I was able to sit through it without flinching, although the scenes definitely do leave an impact on you.<br/><br/>If you loved the book, go see this movie--it's now one of my absolute favorites."

","Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig form an interesting and unusual pair in this thriller based on the book by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. There is a lot of exposition at first, since the characters are new and their lives complicated, to say the least. And frankly, at just under two and one half hours, I would not be a proponent, but this film is an exception. The background of the characters, especially Lisbeth's, is required to understand the darkness of not only the family being investigated, but the investigators themselves. The depth of Lisbeth's darkness can be seen in the way she deals with a purse snatcher in the subway, and with the abusive state appointed clerk who administers her funds after her guardian is hospitalized. Christopher Plummer is superb as the retired industrialist who only wants closure to the disappearance of his granddaughter, an event he might have put out of his mind except that every year on his birthday he receives the same gift she gave him before she disappeared. Stellan Skarsgard gives a wonderful performance as the incompetent grandson who is ruining the company, and Joely Richardson is magnificently understated in her role. Perhaps the most impressive player is Daniel Craig, who continues to astound us with his range and depth of ability. To transition from the hard, emotionless Bond to this role is a total reversal of character, but one we have seen before in Defiance and Lara Croft. Craig, I believe, is the next actor to be added to the list of phenomenal performers like DeNiro, Hopkins, Pacino, and a scattered few more. Lastly, Rooney Mara impresses me with her ability to remain detached yet empathic in this role. Overall, this film is a wonderful peek into the dark underbelly of the human condition, and a must see for fans of Hitchcock, Craven, and the other masters of horror who have gone before. Rated R for graphic violence, rape, torture, language, and sexuality, I would hazard to say this film belongs in your collection if you are a fan of the detective genre."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","4","10","10 April 2012"," A pretty good remake for once
","The Swedish film was good and nothing has been changed in the drama nor the thriller. It is made more explicit on things Scandinavians practice a lot but do not show, sex and emotions. So the sex scenes are more developed though they remain within Parental Guidance and the emotions are of course essentially present at the end and of course again in the negative way, the disappointment is for Lizbeth, the poor girl who thought she could be loved by a real respectable man on a permanent basis.<br/><br/>The film does not bring one iota more on the exploitation of the young people who are made dependent on the state and under guidance, control and even at times more from some kind of bureaucrat who takes advantage of the situation for his own perversions. Be sure if it were a woman the situation would be the same. The bureaucrat always thinks his authority gives him the privilege of exploiting those who are under his or her control.<br/><br/>In the same way a family business has become an impossible quagmire because the members of such a family consider that their name gives them the privilege of exploiting the business to their own benefit, to exploit the workers with the same objective, and of course to cover up their worst impulses under the virginity of the power of money. It is true at the same time the Swedish family business that is used as a screen to hide criminal activities is redoubled with the case of another international business, this time not family at all, that is a blanket covering the recycling and laundering of all kinds of drug and criminal money. This extension is quite funny in a way since it will serve the vengeance of the raped and humiliated and exploited dependent girl who gets rich by just hacking a whole set of accounts in the Caiman Islands. No complaint possible since it is criminal money in a tax and financial haven.<br/><br/>What's left is the denunciation of the deep hypocrisy of the Swedish society about its past. Sweden was one of the first countries in the western world to introduce eugenic laws against all kinds of people who were a burden to society, more than thirty of forty years before Hitler in Germany and quite in line with what the British author H.G. Wells advocated at the end of the 19th century that will also produce social Darwinism and behaviorism in the USA.<br/><br/>Then in the past and still in the present the people who are classified in those categories, Swedish or foreign, are silent preys to the predators who are in the positions where they cannot be asked any question. The police will do its job but without the means they need, nor the will they need, to get to the rock bottom of the problem and the criminals will walk free and proud, respected and even loved in society.<br/><br/>That film should make us think and think again and we should keep in mind that politicians are too often doing the same and a prostitution ring can operate in one of the most important hotels of a big city, across from its opera and nothing is done till finally some scandal comes up generally from outside the country or from a marginal complaint and political interests are finally giving the police the power they need to do their job. Everyone knows about it, and first of all the mayor or mayoress of the city but everyone pretends nothing is happening, including the press that is so blind at times.<br/><br/>If you don't believe it is possible just go to Lille in France, New York in the USA and presently a city in Shanghai had the same problem with the mayor being demoted;, including from all his national and regional jobs and his wife is in custody under the charge of having killed a British journalist who was too nosy.<br/><br/>What is the world coming to? Go see that film and you'll understand just 10% of what it really is.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"MaximumMadness","9","4","10","9 April 2012"," David Fincher's new adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a near-flawless mystery/thriller...
","I suppose I should star this review by saying I have never read Stieg Larsson's original book, now have I seen the previous trilogy of films adapted from his ""The Girl..."" books. I came into this film open and willing to accept it as it was- with no pre-conceived notions, nor anything to compare it to.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Seven, The Game, The Social Network) delivers this new adaptation (not a remake of the other film, but rather a fresh adaptation of the novel) of the neo-classic book. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, with some outstanding supporting roles from the likes of Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and Christopher Plummer, this film is an exceedingly strong and well-crafted mystery with some shockingly strong hints of suspense and even at times horror. It is an expertly crafted tale that has just a few minor flaws keeping it from getting a perfect 10 from me.<br/><br/>Craig stars as Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist whom has just lost much of his savings in a libel case against a powerful businessman he accused of having criminal ties with in his newspaper. Trying to get out of the public eye and lick his wounds, he accepts an invitation from Henrik Vanger, a wealth Swedish magnate, to come stay with him and help him solve an elusive mystery of who murdered his grandniece. Blomkvist is pulled into the mystery, intricately tied into Vanger's demented family (itself made up of recluses, distrusting people and even former members of the Nazi youth and German Army), as he searches for clues as to the girl's true fate and murderer.<br/><br/>At the same time, Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but deeply different and troubled young woman (Rooney Mara), whom was hired to perform a background check on Blomkvist, faces her own series of heart-breaking obstacles, before she joins Blomkvist to solve the mystery. More on Mara later.<br/><br/>Fincher's direction is absolutely outstanding. From a solid (but flawed) script by Steven Zallian, Fincher is able to craft a dark, Gothic, brooding but still somehow beautiful and touching scope for the film. The visual direction and Fincher's choice in shots are expertly done, and he does throw in a few insane shots in the vain of his former classics like ""Fight Club"". (Mainly in the insane and jaw-dropping opening credits, a nightmarish and ""oily"" montage set to disturbing techno-like remix of ""Immigrant Song"")<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly perfect. Craig is outstanding as Blomkvist and delivers a stunning, layered performance. Skarsgard and Wright make for compelling supporting roles, and Plummer is absolutely magnificent and will evoke tears as an old man who merely wants peace with his one big regret in life.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara, however, is a revelation. Her portrayal of Lisbeth is absolutely stunning. I almost cannot describe it. I had seen Mara in several other films, and she was completely and utterly unrecognizable. She inhabits the character in a way that is impossible to fathom- she isn't acting- she IS Lisbeth. I am flabbergasted that she didn't win an Accademy Award for the role. I honestly cannot believe it.<br/><br/>This praise being said, the film isn't perfect. As mentioned, the script is fairly flawed. I suppose in that adapting the novel for film, it was extremely hard to fit in all of the major characters and moments. So the film does feel a bit over-stuffed, even at about 150 minutes in length. It could have used another 20 minutes just to slow down the pace, because often I found myself unable to keep up with certain moments. While most people generally complain about what could have been cut out of movies, I think this is a case where the film should have been longer.<br/><br/>In addition, there are some small problems and aesthetic flaws to the film. While the score (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) is haunting and breathtaking, at times it does overpower the images. In addition, even as a mainly American production, it is hard to keep up with conversations at times with all of the foreign accents, names, references, etc. I'm not nit-picking, either. Some of the smartest, most cultured people I know couldn't understand the dialog at times. (I even know a few foreign people who couldn't tell what was being said in certain scenes) They could have taken a bit more care to mask some of the more exotic accents and language. Finally, Fincher is perhaps too subtle with the mystery aspect of the story, and during key revelatory scenes, I couldn't understand what was happening.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a near flawless film. I am excited to see the two sequel books being made with the same cast (particularly the stunning Mara), and I have since become more and more interested in the books and the original film series.<br/><br/>I give ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" a 9 out of 10. Outstanding."
"meeza","9","4","10","7 April 2012"," It's a Finch for King David to always direct a great movie! And Rooney Rules!
","I wish I could start my review of David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" as riveting as the film's infamous ""Immigrant Song"" opening. But I am foreign to those type of stellar intros unless there are plenty of corny puns on the menu. Many, including yours truly, thought there was no need to make American versions of the 2009 Swedish film franchise which was adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-seller Swedish novels. But since it would have the Fincherprints of the master auteur David Fincher, I thought maybe it would turnout alright; and it sure did! At least, the first installment did. David Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is simply one of the best films of 2011. For those of you who are not familiar with the premise, I will ink it for you. It is about a disgraced Swedish journalist named Mikael Blomkvist who gets hired by a wealthy Swedish geriatric billionaire named Henrik Vanger to investigate the 40-year-old mystery of the disappearance of his granddaughter Harriet; her case was unsolved and her body was never found, so Vanger wants someone to do a bang-up job and finally solve the mystery. Henrik is even suspicious that someone from his Vanger familial bunch was responsible for Harriet's disappearance. In return, Blomkvist gets mucho cashola and undisclosed information from Henrik about the corporate magnet that Mikael has been trying to pin for many years. So how does that chic with that dragon pic in her skin fit into the picture? In mucho ways! Lisbeth Salander is the name, computer hacking is the game, and her Gothic fashion is not lame. And by the way, you don't want to make a sexual move on a first date with this Salander Girl, or else you will be sorry; just ask her monstrous welfare officer Nils Bjurman. I will just leave it at that, and if you have not seen it, I will be hush about Lisbeth's vengeful show on not-Nine Inch Nils (a little kudos there also to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and movie composer pal Atticus Ross for another mesmeric score to a Fincher flick). Lisbeth who knows all about Blomkvist due to her hacking ways, eventually teams up with him to try to solve the Harriet disappearance. Fincher's well-tuned directorial techniques were very pulsating throughout the Tattoo picture, and Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian's Tattoo scribe read very well in its verbal intercourse. As much as I loved the Fincher and the Zaillian's labor efforts to the Tattoo, my favorite contributor to this movie was that of Rooney Mara's tour-de-force starring performance as Lisbeth Salander. Let's just say that Rooney Mara was a giant among scene- steelers throughout the movie. Daniel Craig's performance as Blomkvist was spectacular and there is nothing to libel about that sentiment. Christopher Plummer turned out another great performance as Henrik Vanger from this now Oscar-winner veteran thespian. The steady Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard was stellar as Harriet's brother Martin Vanger. Kudos also goes out to Robin Wright's right-on work as Blomkvist's lover and boss Erika Berger. And this Joel has to commend a Joely of course; because Joely Richardson turned out a genuine supporting performance as one of the Banger women, Anita Banger; say Anita Banger five times real quick; just saying. I see now why Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall picked up yet another Best Film Editing Oscar in a Fincher movie; because just from the film's opening, you know they were going to be immigrating to the Oscar stage. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" might not fully- capture you in its initial viewing (especially if you have read the novel or seen the Swedish film version since you know what is going to happen), but this Fincherpiece will stay in your mind and there is Mara of where that came from. ***** Excellent"
"ckinnair205","10","4","10","15 March 2012"," Authentic & Truly Brilliant !
","The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is sensational, disturbing, well casted and plain darn brill! The acting is brilliant and to what I saw; very smart. A good psychological thriller what will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The story line picks up from The Girl Who Played With Fire to which is just as good as The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, It is just amazing and brilliant. It has a raw talent to disturb the consumer and it is definitely not suitable for anyone under 18 (Seemingly hypocritical because I'm 12) - The torture scene is a revenge and I was really happy about the girl's vengeance. The rape is clinically disturbing and very upsetting. I really do recommend such a film"
"camjohn918","9","4","10","25 February 2012"," True to the Atmosphere, Characters and Steely Soul of the Book
","I had already read two of the books before I saw the movie, and I wasn't sure what to expect. There's a big online war about whether the Swedish version of the movie (Sweden being the setting of the story and home of its late author Steig Larsson) is better than the American version. I haven't seen the Swedish version yet (which leaves me perfectly without bias, honestly), but I quite enjoyed director David Fincher's version. The art direction was very well done, something I expected even from seeing the above poster for the movie- the poster itself made me excited for the movie, which was awesome. When I heard snippets of the cover of ""Immigrant Song"" done by Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross and Karen O of Yeah Yeah Yeah, I knew this movie was going to have at least some form of amazing quality. <br/><br/>This was all but confirmed when I saw the drop dead gorgeous opening of the movie, set to that cover of Immigrant Song that had me rocking in my theater seat. And while the movie doesn't often contain that same amount of excitement and can even veer into dullness on some occasions, it surprisingly uses its two and a half hour running time very well. The story feels, for the most part, complete from the book, but doesn't drag on much at all. There's a chilling, tense atmosphere highlighted by the winter Swedish setting, and in fact the whole movie seems to have a cold, steely feel to it, which in itself seems to be highlighted by the title character herself, Lisbeth Salander, played to absolute perfection by Rooney Mara, nominated righteously for an Academy Award for her work here. Even in the scenes she's not in, you can totally feel how she glues the movie together.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig, who ranges from pretty to very good), who is wrongfully convicted of libel after slandering a well respected businessman. His life savings drained and his independent magazine looking at the end of its budget, he takes a sabbatical by taking a seemingly easier job helping Henrik Vagner (played incredibly well by Christopher Plummer), who asks him to write a memoir on his life, mainly by solving the cold case murder of a niece of hers that was 16 at the time, who disappeared off the island forty years ago and was the only light in a family full of drunks, rapists, shady businessmen and, yes, even Nazis. Against his better judgment, Blomkvist accepts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, his paths are about to intersect with a young, asocial hacker named Lisbeth Salander, an investigator who is hired by Vagner's assistant to do a background check on Blomkvist. She has some mental problems and a troubled past, so she is cared for by a guardian despite being 24, and when her current guardian has a stroke, she is given a new one in the form of Erik Bjurman, who sadistically begins to abuse his power over her.<br/><br/>Eventually Salander and Blomkvist cross paths, and that is when the movie begins to rev up and really get somewhere. The first half is a good setup, but not as gripping as you'd expect, save for the promising opening and... well, most every scene with Lisbeth in it. This is the same as in the book itself, which may bore you to tears until you get a good distance into it. This second half of the movie houses most of what is best about the movie- it has you on the edge of your seat, hopelessly lost in the snowy northern-hemisphere world it is set in until it reaches its not-very-surprising-but-incredibly-tense reveal. This is due to an excellent pacing and other work on the part of director David Fincher, who really shines in this faithful adaptation, as well as another rocking score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who won last year for their Social Network score.) Their score is definitely the best of the year and was totally snubbed in the Academy Awards, which is ironic because there were easily two scores better than them last year (Inception and How To Train Your Dragon) and they beat both of them.<br/><br/>The actors, as mentioned, do a very good job as well- especially Mara for Salander. Lisbeth Salander is arguably the most praised, complex literary character in contemporary fiction of the 21st Century, and whoever was going to play her part would have to do it very well. Mara does not only look like how I pictured Lisbeth, she acts and talks and moves just like her, she embodies her, which is an incredibly hard feat to do right. Craig does a good job in the lead as well, capturing the passive-aggressive and overly-rational tendencies of Blomkvist, but in the end, it felt too Daniel Craig- you never can detach the actor from the role. In a supporting role, Plummer does an excellent job playing a broken, decent man in a family of wretches and thieves. I could say it's not that far of a stretch for Plummer, but hell if I care, he was good.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for everyone- a hard R if there ever was. The sex is very explicit, and there is, as has been oft repeated, (SPOILER) a horribly graphic rape scene in the first third of the movie that you will only look at in shock through the cracks between you fingers. (SPOILER)<br/><br/>But for those who can watch it, and are willing to be patient, this is a movie worth watching as it and its characters will resonate through your mind for a long time after. (and the awesome music, of course.)<br/><br/>Rating: A-, 9/10"
"vostf","9","4","10","2 February 2012"," Great adaptation: faithful and powerful
","WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ADAPTATION I was amazed that people thought so much of the original adaptation. It was clearly not a good movie (caveat: I saw the TV version in two parts which is longer than the movie but still feels rushed and disjointed). Whatever you think of that Scandinavian movie you can't seriously say the main character, Mikael Blomqvist, was magnificently embodied. The actor had zero charisma, he felt so boring you couldn't buy he was passionate about his work (and women - and in turn his sex appeal was questionable). Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander was good but not great and you could feel it was for lack of top-class directing skills in the Danish film-brewer.<br/><br/>FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK Actually the first book in the Millennium trilogy is such a good thriller - it is really a top-tier page-turner that deserved to become a best-seller - that the story (featuring Lisbeth Salander as the most engaging character) is enough to have people feel they are watching something original, thus good.<br/><br/>Stephen Zaillian's adaptation really does justice to the book and we really have to congratulate the producers and director David Fincher for not shortening significant parts of the original story. At over 2h30 the story is never slow, neither rushed. Most importantly Daniel Craig is a perfect Mikael Blomqvist (and I admit I don't like him as 007), Rooney Mara feels more fragile than Noomi Rapace and is thus much more touching.<br/><br/>I am not a great fan of David Fincher but now his visual gusto is matched by great scripts (well, he earned that through lesser works I think) he does wonders. Clearly here you can tell the production sense and values were perfectly in tune with the original material, plus Fincher shoots the perfect pace, the perfect emotional tone as he directs Craig and Mara (and the supporting cast as well) to hit the high marks.<br/><br/>Sole big blunder: an over-bloated and totally out-of-line opening credits sequence. This is not a super-hero movie or a saw gruesome horror flick: clearly here less - much less - would have been more. Credits displayed over an extended presentation of Mikael Blomqvist (possibly thru Salander's private eye) would have been way better. The fact is the only unfaithful bit is the English title (chosen by publishers) but there was really no urge to make it that explicit so soon in the movie.<br/><br/>Now I am expecting a lot from Millennium II - The Girl who played with Fire. The book was boring, long digressions and obvious suspense with a multi-pronged investigation stalled for pages. Here the movie can even be better than the book, too bad they didn't shot it back-to-back with the first movie."
"nbayes","10","4","10","26 January 2012"," A bloody good film.
","Blown away. Totally. After a totally compelling opening visual effects intro the film sorta became an average thriller. Mikael was slow. Then came Salenger. Mikeal was more interesting. Salenger was - well - see for yourself. We all wanted them to meet and they did. BOOOOOOOOM! The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo exploded into one of the most unique,compulsive can't-take-your-eyes-off-the-screen movies I have seen for a long time. I reckon I'm a decent judge of Cinema. African Queen to the Shawshank Redemption. A good film is a good film.<br/><br/>And this,also is a bloody good film. Watch for yourself. Pleasant it is not. A great film it is. 10/10"
"warthogjump","9","4","10","17 January 2012"," Easily the best movie of 2011
","Admittedly, 2011 did not have much to offer in terms of outstanding movies. There were some decent titles, but the majority of the movies, actors, actresses, etc nominated for Golden Globes and rumored Oscars simply felt undeserving. In order to be appreciated for such awards, I always used to think something extraordinary needed to be produced, and unfortunately this year, I felt like that was not so.<br/><br/>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is the only extraordinary film I have watched of 2011. It delivers superb acting, brilliant storytelling and script, and unprecedented directing.<br/><br/>David Fincher has long been a favourite director of mine, with classical titles such as Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac to name a few. After a rather over hyped Benjamin Button, I felt like Fincher really redeemed himself here. Dragon Tattoo manages to capture the suspense and thrill of Zodiac, but through a different perspective in a different world.<br/><br/>Probably the best part about this movie is that you can have zero knowledge about the book and the previous Swedish version and still walk out amazed.<br/><br/>For whatever unknown reason, I believe Dragon Tattoo is just short of a masterpiece, the only reason being why I didn't give it a 10. However, as stated before, it is easily the best of 2011. If it was up to me, it would get the directing, script and actress Oscars without question. I'm disappointed to see this movie merely as an underdog at the Oscars as opposed to an ""expected"" nomination/prediction. It deserves much more credit given the mediocre standard of movies produced in 2011."
"spamobile","10","4","10","13 January 2012"," So well done, so European quality, so believable
","Having seen all the Swedish movies of the series I was a bit apprehensible on seeing this as I really really like the Swedish ones. I was not disappointed! What a good well made movie! At least it's not Hollywoodised, it's a proper movie of a believable story with good actors that are very much the person portrayed. It's set in stunning landscapes, in real snow, in real towns, just very real. That all adds up to being in the movie if you watch it, you're there, in it. Praise to the main characters, well played by both. It's very worth while watching, can't wait till the 2 follow up movies are made to, and maybe the 4th unfinished one as well. Watch it !"
"bruziene","10","4","10","8 January 2012"," Loved it!
","I was a bit cautious before I went to see the film - normally, after reading a good book, you tend to find all the flaws and discrepancies from the book in the movie: wrong actors, wrong settings, changed story lines, you name it. So, I prefer to see a movie and then read a book, or read a book and not to see a movie. In this case I was too intrigued to abide by my own rules :) I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the cast was great. Not once did I want to say ""oh, common, he/she is not supposed to be like that!"" The way the story was presented was also amazing. Having read the book and realizing the volume of information that was there, I was curious to see how this amount of information could be presented to the viewers... IMHO, it was done great - naturally, some details were not there, some of the points had to be omitted, but all in all - the story was clear.<br/><br/>The ending... - that was the major difference from the book. Although I am not sure why it had to be done... Probably, to save the time (as the movie is long enough without including Australia into it :)) But the main idea remains unchanged - Harriet survived.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved the performance, the scenery, the storyline. Thumbs up! Now waiting for the Girl that Kicked the Hornet's Nest :) Hope it will be even better."
"rodolphefleury-182-126991","10","4","10","5 January 2012"," David FINCHER'S The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is way better but watch both versions!
","This is a very personal review, but I do think it's worth watching the two millennium versions, it's two completely different films with the same story, very interesting. And of course reading the books are a must too.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the Swedish version but the US version is a lot more subtle, less explanatory and more effectively dramatic. As a thriller Fincher creates more tension, he lingers a lot more on decisive scene like when Lisbeth meets the Vanger's layer for the first time or when she meets the sadistic lawyer. The dialogues in those two scenes are not very effective, too erratic. The way Fincher films those scenes leaves more space for the actors, creates more tension and makes you quiver in your seat. The Swedish version's too fast, the fact it's fast always makes it really excellent in the action scenes though.<br/><br/>US Lisbeth is a lot more enigmatic, believable, fragile and threatening than Swedish Lisbeth who you can see behind the make up is a nice actress, US Lisbeth is also more dangerous looking (Swedish's Lisbeth clothes are sometimes too laughable, too nineties), she's also too old to play the part (why does the lawyer have to look after her money at 24 years old?).<br/><br/>The Swedish version is like a superb American type of action movie straight from the nineties, but it annoys me by the way it over explains everything (I'm not stupid and I don't need to be told twice everything, nor having stuff underline all the time). like ""the access to the island was blocked for 24 hours"" says Vangen, then the journalist says ""so Harried disappeared when no one could leave the island"" (no way?).<br/><br/>Fincher's version is very David Fincher, it's a auteur film, it's stark dark, masochistic, uber aesthetic and almost slick and drenched in sorrow."
"eisenfield","10","4","10","4 January 2012"," Perfect adaptation, and casting.
","Obviously I thought that this film was absolutely flawless, albeit gruesome. I think it was a wonderful adaptation of the novel, and the acting was absolutely astounding. It has a wonderful score, wonderful editing, wonderful cinematography, etc.<br/><br/>I think the one thing that gets to me is the amount of people assuming this film is a remake of the Swedish version; or that the Swedish version is considered the ""original."" I find that humorous because The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011) wasn't based off of the Swedish version, it was based off of the novel. They're two separate film trilogies, based off of the same novel.<br/><br/>I feel as though Rooney played Lisbeth a tad better than Noomi, simply because Rooney has the ability to be completely and truly androgynous, while also being incredibly attractive while also terrifying you with her looks at the same time. Not to mention her ability to absolutely remove all emotion at just the right moments is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love Noomi; she's absolutely gorgeous and wonderful at acting. However Noomi, while also a good Lisbeth, isn't androgynous enough for me. She never makes you second glance and ask, ""What gender am I looking at?"" I also don't find her face empty enough like I do with Rooney's. Which is also why I enjoyed the bleaching of Rooney's eyebrows, to help rid her of showing any emotion.<br/><br/>I could spend hours talking about why I enjoyed this film so much, and explaining my love of Rooney and her role as the new Lisbeth, but to sum it up: the film was impeccable as was the acting. It honestly deserves an Oscar."

","This is the best movie I've ever seen. I saw it last night and cannot stop thinking about it. I am beyond excited for the future creation of the last 2 movies in the trilogy. After seeing the first one it has sparked my interest in the novels and I am going to purchase the trilogy and read them. I am very excited to read the books as I am to watch the rest of the trilogy in theaters. I cannot get enough of Lisbeth, I think she is one of the best characters created in literature or film. Her character is so mysterious that it keeps you hooked the entire time, Rooney Mara did a fantastic job in depicting Lisbeth. The constant mystery and twists are a great formula to a 5-star movie."
"Pumpkin_Man","4","4","10","4 January 2012"," Rooney Mara Saved the Movie For Me!!!
","I don't why I wanted to see this. I've never read the book or seen the original Swedish movie. I know they wanted to establish character development for Daniel Craig's character, Mikael, and Lisbeth Salander but it took forever for something interesting to finally happen. The film is told by two story lines at first, then finally meet up at about 90 minutes in. First off, I thought Daniel Craig's storyline was a little boring. He's asked by a man named Henrik to solve the murder of his niece that happened 40 years earlier. (You can have a drinking game when Daniel Craig puts his glasses on and takes them off every time he finds another piece of the puzzle) Then we have Rooney Mara's hot awkward Gothic character, Lisbeth Salander. I loved her storyline and her character. She is the only good thing about this movie. She's a computer hacker that deals with mental issues and rape. Later in the movie, she becomes Mikael's assistant in finding a murderer. I probably wouldn't recommend THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO!!!"

","There was such a high expectation of this film after being so enthralled with the book. I found that the book had so vividly conjured up strong images of both characters and locale that it might be disappointing in how it was portrayed in film. So it was very refreshing to see such a great book so well translated to the screen. The casting was superb, each character very much true to the portrayal represented in the book. Even though the book had a high shock impact with the violence and sex, it was very sensitively and well presented. In addition, the filming of Stockholm city centre and the Swedish countryside was beautifully captured. Although a longer-than-average film, I never found myself losing interest. What was cut and edited from the book was expertly handled, without losing anything of importance. Even the few changes to the book were handled well. I now look forward to the next book being filmed!"
"jadepietro","9","4","10","4 January 2012"," A Twisted Sister, Rebooted, Re-envisioned, and Reviewed
","The film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Many have questioned the rationale to remake this film. After all, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was a well-made successful foreign film just two years ago, appearing on numerous best film lists. Did it really need to be redone? Too many subtitles? Too graphically violent for American audiences? Too much of a European sensibility? Too much of a cash cow to ignore?<br/><br/>Rather than go into any of the detailed plot of Steig Larson's popular novel which most people already know, I decided to list 10 reasons for its existence:<br/><br/>1. The director is David Fincher. No one does creepy better than this talented filmmaker. ( Think back to Se7en, Fight Club, and Zodiac to remind you. ) His films have shown a prurient bend in the past and he is a gifted director whose films have a diverse cult following. Fincher's visual tricks carry with them his unique style and he can say more without words than most directors. So this film treatment suits him to like a leather glove ( pun intended ).<br/><br/>2. It stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. The diverse coupling of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander now is embodied by these two fine actors. Craig has the less flamboyant role as the journalist reporter and plays him with a dogged but world-weary spirit. . Mara plays out Lisbeth's rage in a fearless and bold performance. She also manages to hide the character's vulnerability beneath the sexual and emotional scars left by conspirators and powerful men in general. These actors' strong chemistry elevates this version to a slightly higher degree of excellence due to their credible and realistic portrayals. <br/><br/>3. The mystery still involves its audience. Did a family member kill Henrik Vanger's niece, Harriet, who disappeared almost 40 years ago? Blomkvist and Salander investigate and go on a convoluted journey to solve the case. These damaged individuals need to unravel the mystery as they begin to trust each other and tend to their own personal issues. Just as before, the initial story takes its time to have the characters converge and their subplots, while explaining their motivations, do little to advance the on-going mystery and subsequent investigation. <br/><br/>4. The supporting cast remains strong. Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright, the superb Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, Steven Berkoff, Geraldine James, and especially Yorick Van Wageningen all do yeoman-like service in their respective roles. Their casting is spot-on and the actors take special pleasure in defining their roles.<br/><br/>5. There are some minor changes in both films. Some minor characters are missing in the American film and some flashback actions are merely mentioned rather than shown in the English language version. Both films have a different visual sense, with Fincher's film less conventional and more edgy and hyper-kinetic. Also, the Blomkvist role seems to be more expanded in this newer version and the romantic pairing of both investigators has been augmented and feels unmerited with its gratuitous moments of nudity. The film's ending differs from the novel also.<br/><br/>6. The sexual content and violent nature of the film is on the edge of a NC-17 rating. This latest reincarnation is more graphic in sexual content and violent overtones than its Swedish predecessor. The camera seems to linger on Mara's body and exploits the actress, which became completely disturbing at times. However, that Mara / Salander connection yielded a veiled discomfort for the moviegoer, adding to the sinister subject matter while stressing the objectification of women in this society. <br/><br/>7. The film boasts an innovative score and a clever use of pop music. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross create a dissonant and effectively soundtrack which adds so much to the visuals on screen. Their use of sound effects melding into the musical background heightens the tension. ( One misstep: the title music by Led Zeppelin in a 80's music video opening credits that is too reminiscent of a James Bond flix, failing to capture the film's more somber tone by choosing a stylish high fashion biker chic. One smart move: the use of Enya's new-age song, Orinoco Flow, to underscore a particularly unsettling and memorable moment in the film's climax. )<br/><br/>8. Technical values are top-notch. As with Fincher's other films, his creative team never fails to astounded its movie-going audience. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth, editing by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall, and the production design by Donald Graham Burt are exemplary.<br/><br/>9. There's nothing on television right now except reruns and marathons of vintage series. Enough said.<br/><br/>10. We need an adult violent mystery / thriller to celebrate the holiday season. With so many films being family-oriented fare this December, it's refreshing that adult-oriented films are still available to view to a more discerning moviegoer. This film dazzles in its shocking content and its full- frontal assault on the viewers.<br/><br/>Voyeuristic and racy, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has a takes-no-prisoners attitude. The violence is brutal and twisted. It makes no excuses for its sensationalized story and boldly stays the course. ( Be forewarned, the film is not for the prudish or the squeamish. ) The 2011 version has been visually updated and efficiently rebooted with only a slight improvement over the excellent Swedish import.

"jafar-iqbal","8","4","10","3 January 2012"," Fincher Teaches An Old Dog New Tricks!
","'¬ÖDragon Tattoo' hit the cinemas on Boxing Day, only two years after the original Swedish version arrived, a massive hit in its own right. Both films are based on the bestselling book, written by Stieg Larsson as part of his 'Millennium' trilogy. You'd have to question why Hollywood would remake a movie so soon after the original, but that tells you a lot about the state of Hollywood right now.<br/><br/>Pros and cons aside, though, this is a fun movie. That needs to be established. I was engaged, I didn't get bored, I was even leaning forward at points because I was so immersed in it. When you have a team of people that includes David Fincher, Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer, that's the least you should expect, and it succeeds on that level.<br/><br/>The story quickly - disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist (Craig) is asked by the retired and stupidly wealthy Henrik Vanger (Plummer) to find out which member of the Vanger family killed his granddaughter fifty years ago. Blomqvist agrees, and quickly starts his investigation. He ends up finding out about Lisbeth Salander (Mara), a girl with incredible hacking skills and a very distinctive tattoo. She helps him with the investigation, and the rest of the film is them trying to solve the case.<br/><br/>But, obviously, no good film is ever as simple as that. There are lots of smaller sub-plots and character histories, adding more layers to the story, and pushing it beyond the typical whodunnit. While it's good those layers are there ‚Äì and I'm sure the books delve much deeper ‚Äì the restricted running time means that those subplots aren't fully explored. I won't go into spoiler territory, but we have to believe characters are able to achieve things without consequence, so the movie doesn't slow down. The exact same problems are there in the original Swedish version; I really wish Fincher had tried to remove those problems, but he didn't. Another issue with the Swedish version was the controversy over the graphic sexual violence in the movie. There's graphic sexual violence in this version too, and it's not for the squeamish. But, frankly, it's justified. Those scenes do as much a good job of building character and tone as any in the movie.<br/><br/>But enough of where Fincher falters, let's talk about where he excels. A quick IMDb search showed me that I've seen almost every Fincher film, and they're all great. The guy knows how to make a film. What he does best of all is bring out outstanding performances from actors who don't really seem suited to their role. Brad Pitt in Fight Club; Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network; and now, Rooney Mara. Mara is stunningly good as Lisbeth, just fantastic. Vulnerable, unhinged, sexy, detached, steely, feminine ‚Äì she goes through a whole gambit of emotions without really ever saying much. It's all in the eyes. Her partner in crime is Daniel Craig; granted, this is a role we've seen Craig do many times, but that's not a shot. He does it well. But what really griped me was the fact that everybody spoke in Swedish accents, except Craig. Why? It made no sense. You forget about it eventually, but it's still puzzling.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna go on and on about every single cast member, because it'd be a waste of your time. But if you know the people on this list: Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Steven Berkoff, Robin Wright¬Öthen you know you're in for some great performances.<br/><br/>The other bits of the film ‚Äì the music, the cinematography, the editing ‚Äì are typically brilliant. The music's all techno-y, the cinematography is all Swedish-y, and the editing is all frenetic-y. And you've got a cover of Led Zep right at the beginning, which is always welcome, despite the fact that the opening montage is more Bond-like than anything else. It seems out of place from the rest of the film, but good visually nonetheless.<br/><br/>There are things to fault, it's not perfect film. But it's still a brilliant one. For Mara's performance alone, it's worth watching. Inevitably, people will compare her to the original Girl, Noomi Rapace, but Mara makes the character her own. Everyone else is just as great, and you're left with a movie that leaves you wanting more. And, conveniently, we won't be far away from more.<br/><br/>Watch it."

","I had heard many a good thing about the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, from friends and even my girlfriend.<br/><br/>I knew the American version was due out (and although I had not seen the Swedish version) and I was really looking forward to watching it. I was not disappointed by the resulting movie either.<br/><br/>I made sure I read the book first and actually finished it two nights before I went to see the movie. The book is brilliant(I am not an avid reader) and I would recommend it to anyone. As I would this movie(As long as you are old enough).<br/><br/>There are some very graphic scenes, though not as bad as they could have been.<br/><br/>I cannot compare Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth(Although I will be watching the Swedish version in time) to Rooney Mara's. But I can say that, both myself and my girlfriend thought that Rooney Mara was spellbinding as Lisbeth. You could not take your eyes off her when she was on screen.<br/><br/>I also felt that Daniel Craig was a great foil for her. The supporting cast is also very good. Bjurman's character was played very nastily and very well by Wageningen.<br/><br/>This movie is not an exact copy of the book and there are some differences that may annoy some of the lovers of the book. The ending being one of them. But not me, as the movie is based on the book and therefore David Fincher is allowed some artistic licence in my opinion.<br/><br/>I now need to read the next two books in the series and I would be very surprised if they do not adapt them as well. I hope they hold onto Fincher at the helm as he is a brilliant director and I hope that they are as good if not better than the 1st in the series."

Besides sticking to the story very well, it was visually beautiful, and had a killer soundtrack. I'm also impressed with Rooney Mara, and the way she embraced the role of such a complex character as Lisbeth..

","Just to be quick and get it out of the way, Rooney Mara did an outstanding job as Salander. She surpassed my expectations and put any doubts I may have had about her to rest. She did a better job than Noomi Rapace and Rapace delivered an incredible performance to begin with. She definitely deserves the academy awards best actress nominee if not the award itself because she carries that movie from start to finish and it was breathtaking to see her do a complete 180 from her earlier roles. She is not playing Lisbeth Salander, but rather, she is Lisbeth Salander. <br/><br/>Despite minor discrepancies from the book's plot, the changes that were made worked if and only if you are not a picky fan that cannot have anything changed at all. I will admit the first half hour is a little slow especially to the general audience but that does not detract from the rest of the movie. Being in a full theater, everyone gasped, clapped, cheered, laughed, and even cried at all the pivotal points of the story. Everyone I have talked to and based on people's reactions in the theater, they all felt attached to Salander which again reinforces my best actress winner.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie because it truly is ""the feel bad movie of Christmas"""

","The main problem with the movie is that it was too long. The ending is dragged out after we learn whom the killer is. It just kept going and going. There was no need to go back to the guy that had sued Mikael and see how Mikael and Lisbeth got revenge on him.<br/><br/>A rich old man, Henrik, hires disgraced journalist, Mikael, to do research on the disappearance of his niece some 40 years ago. A very weird girl, Lizbeth, helps him discover the truth. What I didn't get is why did they have Lizbeth be tortured by that trust fund guy like that. Other than to show that she hated guys that abused women, why have something that disturbing put in there. And it was interesting how she handled the guy, but it had nothing to do with the murder mystery. Also, I didn't like the affair they started. I think Mikael was a sicko for doing it.<br/><br/>Also, the revealing of the killer wasn't that shocking. It looks like that family would have known something of the sick perversions going on.

In my opinion they should get free obligatory tattoos saying ""Lousy Parent"". <br/><br/>The person I went with had read the book and so understood the story. I think the movie-makers did not bother to make a story that actually fits together and that the viewer can understand. The movie is just an excuse for showing gross scenes.<br/><br/>Key things that the viewer needs to know were not mentioned in the screenplay. At the beginning of the movie, one of the main characters is convicted of libel, but we don't know whether he wrote a true story or not. At the end of the movie, the screenwriters may think they told whether he was vindicated, but I don't think they did explain it -- whether this was on purpose or by writing an incoherent script I'll never know.<br/><br/>Also, the second primary character is a whiz at hacking computers, but the screenplay doesn't mention that until about halfway through the movie. If you read the book, you know that she is a computer hacker, but you don't need to see the movie; if you didn't read the book, you are in the dark.<br/><br/>During the opening credits the viewer is treated to incomprehensible visuals which have nothing to do with the plot or with any of the characters. What's with that?<br/><br/>Finally, I'll avoid giving any spoiler, but the main question raised by the movie is never answered in any way that makes sense... you simply cannot tie the pieces together... the script does not contain a story that could actually work out as the writers show you it did."

Normally I wouldn't be interested in seeing something so far removed from the original, but the reviews were so good that I decided to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed. This is a very solid movie. <br/><br/>It is difficult to take a book with the complicated relationships of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and turn it into a comprehensible movie script, but I think this film succeeds. Is it 100% faithful? No, many details have been left out. Does it need to be? If you feel a movie's first objective is to be a 100% accurate reproduction of the source material then this movie is a failure.<br/><br/>If, however, you feel that a movie should stand and fall on its own merits and should be its own experience then I think this movie succeeds. Daniel Craig's persona lacks a bit of warmth which I think his role needs to engender Lizbeth's trust, but that is my biggest complaint.<br/><br/>Having seen the movie, you will not have read the book.

"mrcibubur","8","3","7","4 February 2012"," Thumbs Up Swedish over the American!
","I watched Daniel Craigs American version last night and I watched the Swedish version again this afternoon after first watching it a month ago. I felt it necessary to make a reasonable comparison between thew two movies. I have not read the book.<br/><br/>A month ago I also watched 'Dream House"" in which Daniel Craig also had a somewhat bizarre but nonetheless starring role. I felt his acting delivery was on a par with that and not with his performances as James Bond or Doctor Who. That is not, however, to mock it.<br/><br/>This film in both versions is, of course, about a girl with a dragon tattoo and its meaning to her in her life. In the Swedish version, Lisbeth is more of a loner, intense, unemotional and single-minded in her purpose, whereas in the American version, she is portrayed as somewhat collusions and even romantic.<br/><br/>She is a young woman who has suffered a lot in her young life and yet fights on. She is gravely misrepresented but she is strong and takes on super heroine status. She does not like men for a reason, so I do question her intimacy with Michel in David Finchers American version.<br/><br/>The beginning and end of the David Fincher movie are not in the Swedish version and thankfully so, though that is not to mock those stories as ridiculous; they are not. I just feel that they were not necessary to tell the story and should have been substance for another movie about this amazing young lady.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is much too cool for my liking in his role as an investigator and what he has to investigate. there is much more purpose and intent with Michael Nyqvist.<br/><br/>There is apparent nudity in both movies of Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara, especially in the lesbian scenes and anal sex scene. Though I like David Finchers films generally, I do think he has missed an opportunity.<br/><br/>Surely this total story is about a vengeful young woman against a backdrop to human trafficking of young women (called meaningless whores in both movies as I now recall)administered by a bunch of crazy family members who were also paedophiles with their own children somewhat in remote Sweden.<br/><br/>The two main stories in the Swedish film of us trying to understand Lisbeths life and why she is being pursued while a group of investigators work together on a significant news story about human trafficking.<br/><br/>It is also important to say that Lisbeth is a brilliant computer hacker and her hacking skills work well with her investigative abilities.<br/><br/>As with Hollywood always, whether David Fincher intended it or not, they 'overkill' the storyline and spoil the curious association which existed between Lisbeth and Michel into something that it was not.<br/><br/>Despite all that, the American version is still an excellent film but it is just that I personally think, produced on a smaller budget, the Swedish version with its more subtle acting, is a whole lot more superior.<br/><br/>if Rooney Mara gets an Oscar for best actress (I think Glenn Close will win for Albert Nobbs)then she should share it with Noomi Rapace.<br/><br/>I remain mystified why it was considered appropriate to make two different version of pretty much the same story with a few add on and changes here and there.<br/><br/>The first hour is a bit sluggish and there is little, if any, no action, an awful lot of plain dialogue.<br/><br/>Go and enjoy the movie however because there is a lot to enjoy - but make sure you see the Swedish version as well - with subtitles!"
"JohnRayPeterson","8","3","7","27 January 2012"," Fincher's work is, as always, undeniably quality driven.
","If you have seen the 2009 original and this 2011 version, don't try or feel you must choose one over the other. Enjoy them both for what they are; the original was a thriller you can't forget and the remake is in many respects a version with the few improvements you'd like to see. David Fincher grabs your attention from the outset with the stylistic opening credits that are in the same class as what we have come to expect with the likes of the James Bond opening credits; a soundtrack that commands attention and graphics that astound.<br/><br/>There are nuances in the stories' details; the remake has added more than it has left out. Fincher is noted for attention to details, the kind that keep you glued to your seat and make you revel in each turning moments of the story (not that the original lacked in much of that). The pace is faster and the more than 2¬Ω hours (5 minutes longer than the original) will wiz by, something many viewers will appreciate. I preferred the pace of the original, but I'm probably in the minority.<br/><br/>The cinematography, as good as the original was, is superior in the remake, in my opinion. As for the cast, the remake has for a majority of us the advantage of featuring actors we are familiar with and of which are likely fans. Daniel Craig, in the role of Mikael Blomkvist, is certainly preferred over Michael Nyqvist; Stellan Skarsg√•rd, in the role of Martin Vanger, also preferred over Peter Haber and Christopher Plummer over Sven-Bertil Taube in the role of Henrik Vanger. Rooney Mara has gone above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a 'Lisbeth' we could appreciate as much as the performance of Noomi Rapace; that is a spectacular character and a role formidable for any actress. I give credit to Mara for delivering a solid performance. No doubt, many will love her. I, on the other hand, feel Noomi Rapace owned that role by the exceptional and unbeatable performance in the original. I can't help but mention that the tattoo on Noomi Rapace is stunning and a reminder of the one adorned by Ralph Fiennes in 'Red Dragon'; the tattoo on Mara is not even close to rival Rapace's. Fincher was however smart not to have the same one used on Mara.<br/><br/>Like many viewers, I can only hope Fincher will do the other two remakes; I'm afraid to look up that information and find he won't. I liked the 2011 remake as much as the original, no more no less. I won't choose, but I will say I love the Stieg Larsson trilogy and leave it at that."

"TOMNEL","6","3","7","26 December 2011"," Kind of a decent by-the-numbers mystery caper
","David Fincher in recent years has grown to become one of America's best known directors working today. He has an interesting, oftentimes dark visual style that he features, and usually he has an interesting story to tell. Unfortunately, in this film, the story is just not interesting enough. It's kind of a typical murder mystery film, with some twists and turns, and an ending that really isn't too shocking. What raises this up from being completely mediocre is Rooney Mara's performance as the title character. Otherwise, this story here doesn't have enough weight or originality to stand out over other pretty good mystery films.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's fallen out of favor after possible slanderous reporting. He is called upon by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the ex- CEO of a company, to solve the mystery of his missing and presumed dead niece who disappeared 40 years ago. He ends up being partnered with an anti-social computer hacker, Lisbeth (Rooney Mara), who uses her skill and research to help solve the case. <br/><br/>Mikael and Lisbeth (""The girl with the dragon tattoo"") don't meet up until halfway through the film, and the first half features them each working separately. All the scenes in the first half of the film focusing on Lisbeth are very interesting. While Mikael gets immediately thrown into the main story, Lisbeth is given almost a character study (that furthers along the plot) for the first half of the film. Rooney Mara is really great here, giving the character layers, with such understated acting. The character is emotionally disturbed and apparently ""crazy"" but any trait is hidden beneath this straight and unflinching face. Daniel Craig's character, on the other hand, is not nearly as interesting, and for some reason, he mumbles here a lot, so he's also hard to understand at times. The mystery he's trying to solve is interesting conceptually, but visually it's often hard to convey excitement when he's sitting alone reading up on research.<br/><br/>When the characters finally meet, about 75 minutes into this 160 minute behemoth, the mystery story gels a bit more, mainly because Daniel Craig finally has someone interesting to interact with. Where the film is lacking is largely in the story. The revelation at the end as to the connections of murders, and potential villains aren't that interesting. The resolution of the film must take darned near 30 minutes, and the main thing I took away from the film, was what a great performance Ms. Mara gave, and what an interesting character she played. The plot is by-the-numbers mystery, and the film does at times drag. David Fincher's direction is alright, but he doesn't make researching the murder much more than mundane. He throws in a few disorienting movements of the camera's placement, but other than that, this doesn't feel like a really great David Fincher directed film. It feels more like an O.K. mystery thriller, that has a great performance, some tense moments, and overall just kind of slips out of one's memory after a while. <br/><br/>This film isn't bad by any means, it just doesn't have enough going for it to make it anything more than somewhat generic, other than the character of Lisbeth. It is overlong, though not bloated, and really not a lot could have been cut out without either cutting the story, or getting rid of good character scenes. The mystery is sort of interesting, but not nearly engaging enough. The final scene in the film was very good however, and mixed character development with a sort of sadness, giving the film a bittersweet feeling. The title character basically saves this film, and rises it above mediocrity, though not quite enough above.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 160 mins. R for violence, sexuality and brief nudity."

","This might possible be the most overrated, over advertised, worst film of the year. Yes, I like many other people got duped into watching this boring waste of time. I hope Daniel Craig got a big pay day, because after this film choice they should throw him off the Bond movies. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara did a decent job acting in this film, but then again all she had to do is look incredible weird, and do weird crap, probably pretty easy and not far off base for the spoiled rich girl she is in real life, and I am pretty sure either her family paid her salary for this job, or paid for the advertising.<br/><br/>This film is full of way to much boring talk, endlessly boring scenes, and nothing that even comes close to interesting, except maybe a rape scene and a revenge for that aforementioned rape scene.<br/><br/>I hear the original European movie was a good one, if so I hope it is nothing like this version.

","Mikael Blomkvist has been convicted of libel against Wennerstr√∂m(whose pretty much only perceived as a villain in this, one of the few arguable failures of this) and the fee he has to pay costs him his life savings. So when he is offered a large pay, as well as the inside scoop on his nemesis, he agrees to, in return, try to solve the 40-year-old disappearance case of the daughter of Henrik Vanger, the retiring and dying leader of the concern named after him. The suspects? His entire family. The wealth and power is alluring, after all. He is aided by the Goth hacker, Lisbeth. I didn't think I was going to say this, especially because I loved Rapace's performance, but Rooney Mara *is* Salander. The mannerisms, the anti-social behaviour, the voice, everything, spot-on. This is the far more interesting(and emotionally involving, both her to us and her with others) take on her(like other things in this, it's deeper), such as the clear Asperger's Syndrome aspects to her(not present in the other one). These are not hammered home, they are there and if you know what they are, you'll see them. They come naturally to this, as many other things in this. This is not a remake or Americanization of the Swedish film, it is a fresh adaptation of the novel, and without having read it, even I knew things that that one missed, and they are in this, and this is all the better for it. This is far superior to that one; while not in every single respect, the things where they match or this is lesser are insignificant in amount and/or scope. One negative that is perhaps noteworthy is that not only was this shot where it's set, no, they went the extra mile with Swedish pronounciation and poorly attempted accents, and this is awkward and requires getting used to. This doesn't convey the isolation, however, in its place is the freezing cold. The theme of men of authority who hate women and make them suffer is explored well. This doesn't remove anything that was extreme in the original, rather, it makes them even stronger. It is a brutal, disturbing, sexually perverted tragedy with a moderate amount of swearing. The ending and opening(reminiscent of that of Fight Club) are infinitely greater, and leave an imprint on you. I don't know how, since this isn't much longer, though this definitely fits in a lot more, and has a richness of detail that the '09 one lacks(and while I know that those were meant to be a mini-series, I'd say this is the better approach, separating the installments and not making them all at once). This has a good mystery, if I'm unsure if the hints towards the solution are excessive or not. I recommend this to anyone who might like it(be sure to know what you're in for, this pulls no punches). 10/10"
"jacco59","8","4","11","28 January 2012"," Definite improvement upon the Swedish version
","Let me just start by saying that I have both read the book and seen all three of the Swedish films, so going into the theater I knew what to expect. And I have only positive things to say. Sure, a lot of the scenes in this version resemble those in the Swedish one, but that was to be expected, wasn't it? I mean, both films are adapted from the same novel!<br/><br/>About the film itself: As you might expect from an American remake with David Fincher behind the wheel the film is a lot more action packed and goes through events a little faster than the Swedish version. The cast is superb and very well picked, and the atmosphere throughout is very dense and isolated. As the story slowly unravels it becomes more and more gruesome and mysterious, and it grabs you and doesn't let go for the next hour and a half. Then what seems like the showdown arrives, but the real answer to the great mystery is even more surprising than you think, and it's something you couldn't have possibly thought of, but which, when you think about it later (as I'm doing now) is pretty much the only logical one. As the final scenes, which make the connection with the second book, play out you can't help but feel sad that it had to end so soon. <br/><br/>SUMMARY FOR THOSE WHO DON'T FEEL LIKE READING THE ABOVE: This film is definitely better than the Swedish version, and its mystery has a way of gripping you and not letting you go until the end. You should see it."
"zardoz-13","10","4","11","5 January 2012"," Top-Notch Thriller!!!
","If you saw both versions of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" side by side, you could spot the differences between the Swedish original and the American remake. Nevertheless, if you've seen one, the revelations in the other won't surprise you. Mind you, ""Fight Club"" director David Fincher brings his obsession with serial killers with him to this first-rate adaptation of Stieg Larsson's international bestseller. Fincher scored his first major cinematic success with the crime thriller ""Se7en"" (1995) about a serial killer, and he explored the theme again in ""Zodiac"" (2007) a film about the real-life slayings in San Francisco. Considering that the lurid subject matter of Larsson's novel concerns a man who murders women, the pairing of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and Fincher seems ideal. Oscar winning ""Schindler's List"" scenarist Steven Zaillian brings his formidable skills to bear as the sole scribe. Indeed, little is amiss in the Fincher & Zaillian retread, except cat lovers probably won't appreciate the butchered feline that winds up on our hero's door step. The cat was conspicuous by its absence in the Swedish version. Perhaps the biggest difference between the films is the casting of Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace registered brilliantly as the eponymous heroine in the original, but newcomer Rooney Mara is no slouch. Mara wears insanity as persuasively as her black, boot-polish Goth make-up and her punk rock coiffures. Any preference you have may boil down to your choice between either Ms. Rapace or Ms. Mara. Each deliver unforgettable performances, and the Lisbeth Salander character is going to be remembered as one of the strongest images of women in film since the titular character in the French action yarn ""La Femme Nikita."" <br/><br/>Aging Swedish business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer of ""The Sound of Music"") fears that he has few years left. The mysterious disappearance of his niece Harriet is the one thing which has haunted him for 40 years. She vanished without a trace one day during a family reunion. Neither the authorities nor Henrik were ever able to find her. To add insult to injury, Henrik has received a framed flower picture annually on each birthday. Harriet gave him the first flower, but lately Henrik suspects that all subsequent flowers since she disappeared have been sent by Harriet's killer. Henrik feels like he is being ridiculed and he has suffered from this torment long enough. He hires an illustrious Swedish political journalist who writes for the magazine ""Millennium."" A reluctant Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig of ""Casino Royale"") accepts Vanger's job offer since he has just lost a highly publicized libel suit against a notorious Swedish billionaire investment banker, Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m (Ulf Friberg of ""Exit""), and the court settlement has wiped out his savings. <br/><br/>Henrik commissions Blomkvist to write his memoirs in part because he abhors the corrupt Wennerstr√∂m. Moreover, he possesses files on Wennerstr√∂m which will damage the billionaire's reputation and he promises to give them to Blomkvist after he completes his assignment. What Blomkvist doesn't know is that Henrik's attorney, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff of ""Octopussy""), has employed Milton Security to conduct a background check on Blomkvist. The individual who does the background check is a 23-year old girl, Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara of ""Youth in Revolt""), and she leaves no stone unturned. Once Henrik hires Blomkvist, he describes his family as rather repugnant. Two of his brothers joined the Nazi Party during World War II. Some don't talk to each other even though they live in houses on an island linked to the mainland by a single bridge. Furthermore, Henrik suspects one of them may have murdered poor Harriet. Henrik installs Blomkvist in a nearby cottage and provides him with every shred of evidence that the police used in their investigation. <br/><br/>Later, things go awry when Henrik suffers a heart attack, and everybody but Frode expects him to die. At the hospital, some of Henrik's relatives demand Blomkvist be dismissed, but Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsg√•rd of ""Thor"") convinces the family to allow Blomkvist to complete Henrik's chronicle. Meantime, Lisbeth encounters her own woes when her guardian suffers a stroke, and the state replaces him. Lisbeth, it seems, has a life filled with tragedy. We learn later she burned her abusive father over eighty per cent of his body because he beat her mother without mercy. Since her assault on her father, Lisbeth has been in trouble and is now a ward of the state. The state transfers Lisbeth over to Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen of ""Soul Assassin"") who displays a hostile attitude to Lisbeth. They get off on the wrong foot, but Lisbeth manages to bring him around to her way of thinking. <br/><br/>Eventually, Blomkvist finds the mystery so overwhelming that he asks Frode for an assistant and Frode recommends Lisbeth. Together, they struggle to not only find clues but also to interpret those clues correctly. If anything differentiates the two films, the casting disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist does. Stockholm born actor Michael Nyqvist appears more believable in the original, but English born actor Daniel Craig holds his own in the remake. Actually, were it not for radical, off-beat character of Lisbeth, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" would amount to little more than a complex European whodunit set in a scenic, snow-swept wonderland. In fact, it is Lisbeth who gives the film its lurid but gripping quality. She assumes a role of greater significance in the Swedish sequels and probably will in the American sequels. She emerges as a female Rambo with a no-nonsense attitude. If she were a cat, she would claw more often than purr. <br/><br/>Although ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" clocks in at a lengthy 158 minutes, director David Fincher doesn't squander a second. He knows the right moment to cut away from one scene to another to heighten suspense. Furthermore, despite the graphic crime scene photos and the misogyny, Fincher is careful enough to never rub our noses in it."

","I wonder why directors or producers choose to make such terrible films. Films that have such perverse and sick scenes. The first part of this film was twisted, sick and terrible to watch. Even if the second half of the film seemed interesting the first was simply dreadful. Who in their right mind would enjoy it? <br/><br/>When I spoke to friends about this film they said the novel and previous adaptations were pretty good and enjoyable. Puzzled, I told them what I just saw and they gasped. The events were twisted and quite degrading. Making a film with such lewd content and terrible scenes acts to undermine the quality and story of a film.<br/><br/>This film is a definite past and not recommended at all.

"rowmorg","7","2","4","23 September 2014"," All the fascinating detail of the novel is gone
","Yes, it's a powerful movie (and immensely long). However, only in a prose work can you convey the mass of detail required by this complex story: the magazine Millennium, the reasons for Blomqvist's fate, his relationship with the married publisher, his journey north, his relationship with a tangled very wealthy family, his investigation of its background and the fate of a teenage-girl member, his discovery of satanism, his relationship with Lizbeth, and so on. It's a complex story told in hundreds of pages by its author (with many hundreds more pages in the two follow-ups) before his death. The movie is a pale shadow, with only a few brutal passages between Lizbeth and her cruel social worker, and Blomqvist and the Nazi. There's a couple of pretty explicit sex scenes between Blomqvist and Lizbeth and that's it. It's a sketch of the novel, even if it remains a powerful picture and worth seeing."

For example, I thought Infernal Affairs was great, but thought that The Departed was even better). Retains the grittiness and atmosphere of the original. <br/><br/>Having seen the original previously, the plot was fairly second-hand, so the original diminishes the impact of this movie quite a bit.

","The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of the best crime solving stories I've ever seen/read.<br/><br/>finding out about 2 years ago that they'd be making an American remake with the intent of opening the story to a bigger audience was a bit insulting. there's no need, if people want the film, let it be David Fincher/ Steven Zaillian. there's nothing like fresh out of the oven. remakes are stale and somewhat bitter by attempts of bettering the original. to gain the approval of the audience over a remake is a quite difficult thing, not only would actors are demanded to follow descriptions, layouts and backgrounds from a book (Millennium's case) but also meet or even surpass the that portrayal presented once before. as it is in love, it is in films; that first time forever will be special.<br/><br/>nobody likes their work overlooked and redone by others. watch the original as the say. you won't regret it, and if it's a matter of language then The Millennium trilogy was dubbed to English not long after it was first released, also subbed, knowing what's going on without having to miss the beauty of the original actors' voices and feeling put to the characters by it. no one should be robbed of that."

One thing that bugged me the most is that the movie takes place in Sweden but everyone in the movie speaks English with an English accent. The movie also tries too hard to be like the original movie. It felt too much like they were trying to replicate the original film when instead they should have been trying to tell Steig Larsons story.<br/><br/>I think this could have been a brilliant film if it took place in an English speaking European city, or if they at least had Swedish accents and most of the towns people spoke Swedish.

","This Hollywood take on the Swedish book with the same name is entertaining if not a little predictable. I hadn't read the book and I've seen that some people have said that it has somewhat bastardised this by its hollywoodisation of the source material. However watching the film I managed to figure out ""who done it"" and that the girl that had died hadn't actually died within the first 30 minutes which I certainly wasn't intended to. This may because I watch far too many films like I this but I think it also may be due to the way the script was rewritten and edited so as it gave a little more away than it should have.
Having said this I still enjoyed the film and found it interesting from start to finish and it certainly didn't wait to hold your hand at times as Fincher blasted us with information relevant to the care both verbally and visually constantly meaning you couldn't take your eyes away for a moment without being totally lost. Certainly not his best film but he can add it to his portfolio without it diluting the strength of his stronger pieces.
Daniel Craig and Roma were both great in their own way however she was particularly captivating as the strong willed bisexual, straight taking, rapist torturing, motorcycle riding, investigating, titular character. Having said this both the actors relationship did seem a little off and I'm not sure their best scenes were actually spent with each other.

They both portrayed their characters in such manners that made you feel and live with them throughout this journey. The cinematography was also amazing and I ought to say that this was one of the best parts of the film. Then, the writing and direction were almost flawless and you could totally feel Fincher's presence. The soundtrack was absolutely astonishing especially in some key scenes throughout the movie and it made everything so much better as it was very intense and pure. Also, I would like to point out the fact that the opening credit sequence was without a doubt one of David Fincher's best, as he manages to capture your attention from the very beginning and also to introduce you to the fictional world.

","This movie was the biggest disappointment. When ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" first came out, I remember hearing such rave reviews. Based on that, I decided to read the book first. Let me say, I am SO glad I did; THE MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE BOOK. It is as if they took the faint IDEA of the novel and made it into a movie. Yes, I understand that this is a complex storyline and it is near impossible to fold in that level of detail in however many hours, but I have never seen a movie/book combo be so far off from one another. There were points where the script was blatantly ahead of the events, clues and information were delivered by different characters, scenes were made up in an attempt to speed up the plot, there was little to no character development, entire storylines were leftout... this movie was a disorganized nightmare. Even having read the story beforehand I was confused because they changed the entire story of Harriet!!!! I have no clue what the logistics are behind translating a book into a movie, but this one for me fell extremely flat. Everything clever and cunning about the book was outright missing from the movie. I have yet to watch the Swedish version, but my current theory is that the US simply threw this together (with no thought whatsoever) in response to the original adaptation over the following year. I would honestly be offended by this film if I were the author. I would have never even let this movie fly had I written this book. This book needed to be broken up into multiple films, and the way it was put together hardly allows for this. I would call for a complete remake. Yes, from the surface the acting is fine, but if you knew how the real characters were you would realize how far off some of their responses and reactions were. I guess my biggest issue is with the script and possibly the directing. The prioritization of information seemed very off to me, and I do not agree with what aspects of the book that were being highlighted. No development whatsoever. All complexity lost. I cannot emphasize this enough. The only redeeming factors I can seem to pick out are the picture quality/lighting. Casting was off for me, but I guess I could give the costuming a pass here. I plan to watch the Swedish version next. A one sentence wrap up? Read the book."
"fraser-simons","7","0","0","26 April 2020"," A descent adaptation, but the Swedish version & book are better
","The American version changes strange things, most likely to make it more palatable to that audience. The relationships are more conventional and less complex. The main plot is truncated, the sub plots that bolster what the point of the story is--which was to show sexism and misogyny at a societal level, personal level for the characters, and an institutional level. The book makes it clear. It starts out with stats about how many women in Sweden have been sexually assaulted. The Swedish version is better at this, this version is pretty much just a straight up mystery, rape-revenge, catch-a-killer trope, which is a disappointment.<br/><br/>The story in this version has strange pacing as well, mostly because it wants to tie up multiple plot points from sub plots not introduced at all, or are briefly mentioned only. Some major details are changed as well, which I assume is to make it shorter despite it being pretty long already.<br/><br/>Additionally, though it's hard to get across on the screen, I really recommend reading the book because the ways in which Lisbeth thinks is not neurotypical and I think is fundamental to her character. The movies kind of elude to it, but being in both the main characters headspace is important for the story. Again, the Swedish version is better at it than this one. This is very American. Also, why the hell aren't they speaking Swedish? They're IN Sweden. They have weird accents instead.<br/><br/>Some weird decisions with this movie. But overall, it was decent. If you did like it, totally check out the book, though. There's so much more there. Or at least look for the Swedish version, extended or otherwise."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a movie directed by David Fincher and premiered in 2011. The movie is adapted from the book written by Stieg Larsson of the same name. The movie stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara as leading roles. The movie follows a journalist and an investigator as they look into a series of old murders.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a good movie. This movie has great pacing and introduction of its characters. The move has Mikael Blomkvist being more focused on the main story arc while Lisbeth Salander has a longer introduction. Mikael Blomkvist has more of a conventional introduction. The more interesting introduction is in Lisbeth Salander. The introduction of Lisbeth Salander does not have much to do with the main story but it is an interesting beginning of the movie. It absolutely sets up the movie's tone well and it sets up the character of Lisbeth Salander well.<br/><br/>The lead actors of Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, and Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander do an excellent job in their roles. These two actors bring a great energy to the role. Rooney Mara sticks out from the cast. She does incredibly well portraying Lisbeth across the intense emotional range that Lisbeth goes through this movie. Lisbeth Salander is the best component of this movie.<br/><br/>The writing of this movie is the real focus. The characters are great, and the plot is fun to watch. It is incredibly tense with all of the setting and world helping with that feeling. Even the mystery is engrossing to both the audience and lead characters. Even the villains are written well with the dialogue between the main characters and villains being a highlight.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly well directed by David Fincher. This direction is taut and improves the tension that the books does well. The quieter moments in the movie are also well directed by showing important facts to the audience. There is so much in each scene that has more than the audience may notice at first. The movie reflects this incredibly well while also allowing the audience to only care about the immediate plot.<br/><br/>I highly recommend The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This movie is a great adaptation of the books.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

The film was nominated for five academy awards and won one academy award for best achievement in film editing.<br/><br/>The both acting performances of lead actors were considered amazing and Rooney Mara was nominated for an oscar for her performance as Lisbeth Salander, The Girl with the dragon tattoo.<br/><br/>Now in this discussion on a film maker peaking his tradition in his 2011 film, The discussion on his films in a chronological order will give a more broader perspective on tradition.<br/><br/>David Fincher's debut film Alien 3 was supposed to be a great moment for him to establish himself in the industry. But unfortunately it didn't work out for him. I discuss these factors in my MovieFreak blog years back. (2012 - July)<br/><br/>But he then created one of his best films Se7en (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2011) and Gone Girl (2014).<br/><br/>Many or all of his films after Alien 3 are his own films that has a distinct iconic DF or David Fincher signature style.<br/><br/>His films in a sense of thematically most of them studies psychopathy and the dark nature of humanity and it's macro level impact to society.<br/><br/>His few films take a different approaches.<br/><br/>His ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)"" was considered an amazing poetic and fantasy fused film with reference to the american history and culture with a perspective of a singular individual. Rather than dark themes and the dark atmosphere DF creates films with his unique technical competence which is editing and cinematography. Like ""The Big Fish"" (2003) where Tim Burton fuses his tradition while ""Forrest Gump (1994)"" by Robert Zemeckis this DF's singular fictional american story.<br/><br/>""The Social Network (2010)"" is the story of ""Facebook"" may be his best film after his masterpiece ""Fight Club (1999)"" in my opinion.<br/><br/>Now this article is about TGWTDT(2011). This is a unique film on the darker aspects of human life with reference to the characters discussed in the summary. But like I said since many films of the director are based on the elements of human darkness and he specialises it through acting, editing and cinematography. The greatest technical competence of DF is his use of CGI and TGWTDT (2011) is his greatest film where you can't determine what is real and CGI because he made sure it to be that cool.<br/><br/>And also thematically film maker becomes more and more symphonic in his artwork and in his tradition through heartlessness. And darkness not with atmosphere but with characters and he has peaked it in this film is quite amazing. The filming tone, camera movement and music is bleak and it makes TGWTDT (2011) a peak moment of the filmmakers tradition."

","The original 'Millennium' trilogy, native to Sweden, are decent adaptations of Larsson's novels and accessibly engrossing for global audiences. Fincher's American remake is a different beast entirely, taking a steelier approach that hosts an abundance of cinematic flair. A few narrative alterations change specific scenarios in comparison, however it remains captivating throughout. Renowned journalist Blomkvist is hired by a wealthy family to investigate a forty year-old unsolved missing girl case, to which he recruits a professional hacker as his research assistant. Much like its source material, this is very much a investigative mystery that is powered by realism. Realistic jaded characters with tainted backstories. Realistic murders from a deranged serial killer. Realistic corruption of wealthy billionaires. Heck, even Salander's hacking was realistic. The central plot revolves around Blomkvist, with most of the runtime centred on the murder mystery, yet the ever intriguing Salander steals every scene. All thanks to Mara's outstanding transformative performance that feels incredibly commanding. Craig was decent as Blomkvist, as were the supporting cast. However it's Fincher's cold direction that sets this apart from the original. The darkened filter highlighting the visceral grit of the mystery. Various quick cuts to illustrate the chaotic investigation. The trademark Fincher tracking shots that ooze sophistication. The story remains thrilling throughout. A few deviations from the original do detract from the overall story, particularly the final act that focuses on the Wennerstr√∂m corruption case. The film essentially begins with Blomkvist being hired for the case, instead of properly developing the recent lawsuit against him and Millenniun. This makes the final twenty minutes slow and derivative. Also wasn't too sure on Salander's emotional vulnerability towards Blomkvist, this was more subtle in the original. Fortunately there are enough similarities and differences to make this adaptation just as compelling."

","The story follows James Bond as he attempts to solve a murder mystery on a island with the help of Rooney Mara (I couldn't think of a role everyone would know her from). The story is filled with suspense, character development, a rich world around them, and disturbing scenes that are unforgettable.<br/><br/>While Gone Girl follows a great murder mystery too, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's performances stuck with me a little bit more. James Bond was amazing with the dark character he portrayed, along side Rooney Mara it combined to gave way to some great scenes. The two made every scene intense and interesting as they sucked you in.<br/><br/>The camera work, as per usual in David Fincher movies, is amazing. I can't really describe the cinematography without rambling on, so just watch it and you'll know what I would say.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is amazing! Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross made an amazing score that added to every scene. The ambient noise and pulsing bass made scenes really intense and memorable. P.S. If you have a surround sound system, get ready to have your ears blown out from the bass.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo remains to be my favorite David Fincher movie. The dark atmosphere, story, and everything else stated above combined to make a amazing movie."

The script sticks a little more closer to the original source material that was written by the author Steig Larsson, but the screenplay is written by Steve Zaillian.<br/><br/>The musical score is composed by Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross, who won an Oscar for the 2010 film, ""The Social Network"", also starred Mara and directed by David Fincher, who also directed another one of my crime thriller favorites, ""Seven"", starring Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and the opening title sequence just blew me away, I could not believe that the title sequence alone told me what kind of film this was going to be and looking at the trailer itself, I remembered what kind of film this was.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist and he does a good job with the role, but he feels like he's acting like James Bond in a few scenes. Stellan Skarsgaard and Yorick van Wagnengian as the antagonists of the two main characters are just creepy. Robin Wright Penn was really good as Erika Berger. I liked the rest of the cast too, especially Joely Richardson and Christopher Plummer.<br/><br/>Now, let me talk about Rooney Mara, who plays the girl with the dragon tattoo herself, Lisbeth Salander. I like Rooney Mara and her sister Kate as actresses and I have not seen Rooney Mara in ""The Social Network"", but I will say that she was kind of bad in the Freddy Krueger remake as Nancy, but I will defend her and say that she tried. Mara, as Lisbeth, is really good and she's better than Noomi Rapace, who played Lisbeth in the original trilogy, but Rooney Mara, she poured everything into this role, from getting piercings, getting the tattoos put on her, and even kissing James Bond himself, Daniel Craig. She deserved to win that Oscar and I am so upset that she didn't get it.<br/><br/>I would definitely be interested in seeing the other two novels be directed by Fincher and starred Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig as the two main characters, but I still have to read the other two books in the series.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm giving The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a perfect score of 10 out of 10, it does have some things I hated, but I still think this was a really good interesting and entertaining film.

"dromasca","8","0","0","20 September 2015"," a remake worth being made, but ...
","When I wrote about the Swedish version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a few years ago I ended with a remark that I am concerned about the news of an American Hollywood version of the film. I still believe that the Scandinavian version of the first of Stieg Larsson's book in the Millennium trilogy is a better movie, but from many respects the American remake directed by David Fincher is a respectable effort worth being seen and watched even if you have already seen the original, and even if you are not necessarily a big fan of the author and the legend around him (which continues to develop as we speak).<br/><br/>I was expecting to see what the director of Se7en, Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac, Gone Girl, and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button will make out of the labyrinthine and cool (from so many respects) Scandinavian thriller. To my surprise he was quite respectful to the original story, and developed it better than the version directed by Niels Arden Oplev some of the detective story elements. The Agatha Christie heritage is so evident here that we did not need a Christopher Plummer in the cast to make it more obvious, but I enjoyed his presence. The Hollywood version is also more detailed in describing the social backgrounds of the two principal characters and this only makes their encounter even more charged when it happens. Did I miss something from what I was expecting from Fincher? Yes - the surprise, the usually close to the final twist that makes many of his film be something else than what you believed them to be when you watched them for the first time. Too much respect for the text sometimes harms.<br/><br/>Despite being made at high professional level the Hollywood version stands one step lower than the Swedish one on several key aspects. One is the atmosphere. Whatever Hollywood cameramen do, snow and cold and the light of the North look and feel different in a Scandinavian movie, and the original dialogs and the soundtrack sounded more natural in the Swedish version than the English spoken words. The other is acting. It is said that Daniel Craig brought life into Agent 007. It may be that the dose of life needed to make James Bond a real person is not enough to make investigator journalist Mikael Blomqvist the man in Larsson's novel who overcomes his life being broken into pieces in order to find the truth. Michael Nyqvist who played the role in the Scandinavian film walked that inch towards fully melding into his character. Almost the same thing can be said about Rooney Mara's rendition of Lisbeth Salander - one of the best roles created in the last decade for a young actress. Mara makes us forget her other (nice girl) roles, while Noomi Rapace had made us forget that there is an actress behind the character.<br/><br/>Despite being better than most of the Hollywood remakes of non-American movies, David Fincher's film stops one step apart from being as good as original, maybe at an invisible border that cannot really be crossed."
"full-option","1","5","16","19 February 2012"," Shocking
","This movie is one of the ugliest movies I've seen in my whole life. I ask myself how anyone can see this movie through till the end, if you want to remain human and sane. The rape scene shocked me more than the one in the movie 'Irreversible' simply because I didn't expected it and it was far more sadistic. And the rape scene in the movie Irreversible was a much contested one ! In my opinion, this movie is for the voyeurs only. I left after the rape scene because I wanted to keep my sanity and self-respect. Afterwards I was informed by other viewers about the even more sadistic revenge by this minor leading actress who's praised for it by the public. Injustly. She should have refused this role. You would like her do that too if she were your daughter . This movie is so ugly. That sort of movies and the praise they get from the public cause me to doubt humanity. Avoid if you are a thinking and feeling human being and want to stay that."
"adeck14","10","4","12","16 April 2013"," The American version is a hit!
","WARNING: this review may contain spoilers I am obsessed with the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series. I first watched the Swedish films, which were also amazing! Having been won over by the foreign version, I was doubtful about the American version living up to its predecessor. While there were differences in the plot and representations of the characters, the American version holds a candle all on its own.<br/><br/>Starting with the main character, Lisbeth Salander, Mara's portrayal of the character was absolutely phenomenal. Her portrayal differs from Noomi Rapace's in that it is more fragile and feminine. I really like how Lisbeth's character develops throughout the film (and Mara certainly brings depth to the character). She starts off very distrusting, standoffish, and disconnected from the world around her. She is extremely intelligent and seizes control in every situation. Despite these representations, I still felt very sympathetic towards her ‚Äì she has been betrayed by men her whole life (starting with her father, her guardian, and, in the end, Blomkvist). May sound sadistic, but I rather enjoyed watching Lisbeth mutilate her guardian who viciously rapes her. But that's just it: I feel so connected with her character, not because I can relate to her personally, but because the movie does such a great job at bringing you into her world.<br/><br/>This movie has one main storyline with several side stories branching off. I really like when movies do this because you grow so attached to each character that way. You have the story of Lisbeth's rough childhood, which is revealed more in the foreign film, and the story of Blomkvist's problems with libeling Wennerstrom. The story behind the characters is what gives this movie its depth. We are given so much more than just a great storyline. We are watching the characters develop as the story develops, making the audience feel like they are experiencing the events through the character's perspective.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10 out of 10. In comparison to the Swedish films, I am anxious to see how the American version's ending will play out in the rest of the series. I really wish they would hurry up and come out with the next film! Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. If you like dramas or crime films, this is perfect! This movie is not for the squeamish: there are some truly horrific scenes depicted. Action film lovers may find this movie slow. There is a lot of dialogue and a rather dense/complicated plot. I may be biased because I have watched all of the Swedish films and I have read the book, so my view may be vastly different from someone watching this film for the first time (never having seen the foreign films or read the books). I guess to those people I would say, you need some patience with this one. You won't regret it!"
"InterArmaEnimSilentLeges","4","3","8","8 March 2014"," Takes a the original to a whole new level, and still falls short.
","I know what you're going to say: The original is sooo much better. No it isn't! The hell it is! The original bored me to tears! The characters were so two-dimensional it's scary. The direction was so non-existent that I'm guessing the director just phoned it in.<br/><br/>I thought Fincher would remedy that. But, uh-uh. This is more of the same. Granted, Fincher has an eye for the visual. And this version is at least pretty to look at. And the music is good, as well as the sound editing. So there's that. But that Lisbeth girl is still a ROBOT! If you're going to have Mr Data in your movie then at least have the decency to call it sci-fi! <br/><br/>The story still feels like it was written by a 10-year old. Inconsistent, haphazard, incongruous and cobbled together. It feels like this story was written with the ""time honored"" tradition of ""story-telling by dice"". ""Let's see what they do next! *Rolling the dice* Oh! All of a sudden the 18 year old mentally incompetent girl has to go to bed with the 50 year dude! Yeah! Good work, dice!"" Christ...<br/><br/>Still. It IS a rather large improvement over the Swedish version, which had the same idiotic story, except it had terrible actors, atrocious photography, worthless music, and no direction. So in that sense this is a triumph! At least this movie gets everything right except for the story and character direction.<br/><br/>So where the Swedish version got a 1 from me, this one gets a 4. But make no mistake; it's still a bad movie. But it's not a train-wreck like the Swedish version."

","Spoilers will be present.....<br/><br/>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is David Fincher's latest film. The Millennium trilogy was only recently made in Sweden and was, from what I have heard, was decent to good. Now this Hollywood remake comes out only a short time later, and does it succeed? My answer is, for the most part, yes.<br/><br/>The driving plot of this film is the mystery of Harriet. I found that aspect of the plot extremely engaging. I wish that I have not read the book before I have seen this film, as the suspense and closely identifying the conclusion of Harriet became predictable. Fincher and Zaillian successfully keeps our attention and haves us figuring out on our own who may have killed her, so it was not their efforts that made me find the story predictable, and I blame myself for it. My pre-knowledge of the source material does not affect the score of this review. The disappointing aspect of the film's plot was the events after solving the mystery, it is though faithful to the book in exploring Lisbeth's feelings for Mikael and the repair of the broken reputation of Millennium and Mikael, but it doesn't hold up for me as the excitement and wonder of the Harriet's story really drove the film forward and was heavily focused, I even forgot at a point there was a problem outside the Vanger island/village. There are differences of the book and the film, in particular the Harriet resolution and it did bother me a little bit. I feel that Zallian should have stuck similarly to the novel.<br/><br/>When I first heard about the remake, I was annoyed but when I saw that David Fincher was directing it, I was a little less worried. Fincher have done it again, he has made a film that can entertain the audience and grips us the whole way through. The tone of the film makes me think back of his previous films like Alien 3 and Se7en, where the themes are dark and gloomy. Fincher feels like he understands Larsson's novel and the themes that fills it's pages. Just straight from the opening title sequence, it felt dark and twisted that you may feel a slight shiver or fear from it. The first half of the film involving Lisbeth and her guardian involves with themes of power, control and helplessness but Fincher cleverly uses it as a form of getting the audience to understand the abuse and powerlessness that comes with rape and sexual violence. This makes the resolution of the mystery of Harriet even more repulsive and twisted.<br/><br/>Fincher's direction captured the film's tone but that is also supported by the photography of Jeff Cronenweth. They both seem to have agreed to wash out a lot of the colour to give off a feeling of darkness and despair. Cronenweth captures this atmosphere of death that makes me feel uncomfortable, not that he did his job poorly but rather the feeling unpleasantness that I personally feel when I watch it. He captures key moments like the rape scenes in a way that appropriately induces a feeling of disgust in the rapist's action and yet at the same time captures the feeling of power and control that the antagonist is then feeling.<br/><br/>The film's score was not something I can deeply say I would remember later on but it does fit well with the mood that Fincher is trying to create. The opening title sequence though was played with a twist on the song 'Immigrant Song' and it felt incredible haunting when paired with the eerie imagery displayed.<br/><br/>I have recently seen the Swedish version of this film and so I had a predetermined idea of the look and feel of the characters. Casting both Craig and Mara was great, they both work well. As both protagonist play off each other, you do feel that there is a relationship between each other that is being built either professionally and personally. Mara seems to be dedicated to her role and has from time to time throughout the film reminded me a lot of Noomi Rapace's performance in the Swedish edition. The role played by Stellan Skarsg√É¬•rd should have been casted by someone that is less well known, as soon he came on screen and has been identified by Henrik, I immediately knew he was going to be an important piece of Harriet's mystery. This does not mean that Skarsg√É¬•rd's performance was flawed but rather an issue of miscasting.<br/><br/>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo will be a film that I may not watch for a while due to the themes that I may find uncomfortable but will definitely someday, if in the mood, will immerse myself again as it is an excellently crafted mystery drama with wonderful performances and faithful direction."
"TerpStudent","10","3","8","1 January 2013"," Fincher Blows the Swedish Version out of the Water!
","Fincher's version of the international bestseller blows the original Swedish film out of the water, and rarely, rarely does an American remake of a foreign film surpass or even equate to the original. For example, I saw French horror film ""Diabolique"" and foreign Sci-Fi ""Solaris""; then watched the American remakes and all throughout I was thinking, ""Shame on you Hollywood!"" To my splendid surprise that wasn't the case with Dragon Tattoo. Every single aspect of the English version is phenomenally superior to its predecessor: directing, acting, editing, cinematography, production, script, music score, plot construction, suspense, terror, and especially Rooney Mara's Lizbeth Salander.<br/><br/>The Swedish version is 152 minutes; with the English version you get twice the amount of story and character development in only 158 minutes. I cannot for the life of me understand why every Swedish film maker thinks they're the first one to discover the art of slowly paced story-telling, or why they think they know how to do it right when a great deal of the time they don't.<br/><br/>Fincher has painted a dark, evil, haunting picture that makes his previous thrillers such as ""Panic Room"", Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"" look like tame, PG-13, M. Night Shyamalan films. Once again, Fincher has raised the bar on shocking, graphic, riveting film making and once again, the Academy deprived an underrated masterpiece of its rightful Oscars such as Best Actress Rooney Mara, Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Script and Best Music Score."

","I've not read the book or seen the original Swedish film, but I'm more than willing to go to the cinema to see a new David Fincher film... more often than not, his films have impeccable cinematography and sound design. These are both present in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but, as a film, I found it underwhelming and verging on genre silliness. The film it reminded me of the most is the Charles Bronson vigilante drama Death Wish... here, our lead actress (who plays an unknowable, almost Bronson-like cypher) is violated and seeks revenge. The violation is nasty, fetishised and dwelled upon by the filmmakers for too long, and the revenge is comic book and simplistic.<br/><br/>This 'cause then consequence' narrative structure continues throughout the film - it's very formulaic. The plot about dark family secrets is rather stodgy, although it would like to be edgy, like the Danish dogme melodrama Festen. There is excruciatingly awful dialogue in the sex scene between Daniel Craig and The Girl, the climactic action scene underwhelms on a genre level, and the long, drawn out coda had people in the cinema heading for the exit early."
"vladtopliceanu","9","3","8","10 March 2012"," An astonishing film
","What an awesome film! I can't think of anything else to start with when I tell a person about this film. What an awesome film! The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a thriller film directed by Academy Award nominee David Fincher and written by Academy Award winner Steven Zaillian.<br/><br/>The thing I loved most about this film was the pacing. In this 2 and a half hour long film, you never get bored. Not one single time! I really admire when a film makes me stay with it 100%. I remember There Will Be Blood doing that to me in a similar way. Rooney Mara was stunning in her performance as Lisbeth Salander. Daniel Craig didn't give his best performance ever, but he was OK, and the chemistry he had with Mara was very good. In terms of acting, Christopher Plummer was amazing as Henrik Vanger and I hope he will never retire from acting, although he is already 82 years old. The original score of the film was great and I am surprised it did not get nominated for an Academy Award. David Fincher also did a nice job. Not as good as in other films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or The Social Network, but still, satisfactory work and in concordance with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The movie was so good, that I was expecting something spectacular from the ending. Well, I didn't get that. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a smart and logical ending, I simply didn't like it. Maybe it's because I didn't want the movie to end at all.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great film with great acting, great music and I could go on. Almost everything in it is great and I sincerely do not know why I am not giving this a 10."
"The_Frase","8","3","8","30 January 2012"," Fincher has done it again, a brilliant new addition to his impressive resume
","Review The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.<br/><br/>The English adaptation of the runaway success story of 'The girl with the Dragon Tattoo' was always going to be a large undertaking due to the 'best-selling' Stieg Larsson's Novel and the highly rated Swedish adaptation by M√§n som hatar kvinnor.<br/><br/>Even for a director such as David Fincher, who can boast a career built on many hugely popular titles such as 'Se7en', 'Fight club' and 'The Social Network', an undertaking of this magnitude and an inability to produce a film that was deemed worthy of its attachment to the novel would be disastrous. Although not doubting his ability, the undertaking of this project could be seen as a bold but exciting move. Fincher's adaptation is every bit exhilarating and in depth as the base material.<br/><br/>The intense intricacies of the novel are displayed well throughout the film. These are an essential foundation for the trilogy but are obviously detrimental the motion and speed of the picture. For a 2:40 hour film, these areas can slow the pace to a point where people around me were nearly nodding off. Combined with an inability of many English speakers to learn and follow the characters Swedish names, the opening of film can be challenging for those seeking easy gratification and not familiar with the characters.<br/><br/>The numerous side-by-side narratives that permeate into the main plot are very well constructed, shot and acted. It is through these vessels that Daniel Craig and in particular, Rooney Mata shine.<br/><br/>Mara's transformation into the 'cyberpunk-esque' hacker is flawless. I often completely forgot her as an actress, a true testament to her performance. I found that she breathed a greater sense of humanity into her version of the character which was a great loyalty to the novel.<br/><br/>Craig's performance is obviously integral to the film but it is all the better alongside the mesmerising Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Martin. His performance is truly great and sits well alongside the strong acting casts' offerings.<br/><br/>The film displays the action and points of conflict in a heart racing trance, you cannot help but be consumed by the intensity and realism that's pouring out the screen. Brutal, unflinching but not prosaic in the slightest, these scenes bind the audience to the characters trails and battles in a very close and personal way. We feel their pain, think their thoughts and sympathise with their positions.<br/><br/>Throughout the viewing experience you are held by that feeling that the film you are watching is going to be something that not only will you watch again, but champion it to your friends and colleagues. I have already had discussions about this film with groups of people that some may regard as outside of the typical demographic. Like the novel and Swedish version this has the ability and power to mesmerise large portions of the population. An excellent adaptation expertly constructed and flawlessly acted.<br/><br/>8/10 The_Frase"

","Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The (2011) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>David Fincher's telling of the Stieg Larsson novel about a reporter (Daniel Craig) who is asked by an elderly man (Christopher Plummer) to find out who murdered his niece forty years earlier. The report comes upon on dead end after another so he seeks the help of a troubled but brilliant computer hacker (Rooney Mara). I haven't read the novel so I can't comment one way or another on how close this film is to it but as someone who wasn't familiar with the story I must say that Fincher has created a rather unique film. I say unique because while watching the movie I couldn't help but admire how laid back it actually is. There's really not any flashy style, in-your-face fake thrill moments and there's an overall atmosphere of something very calm and cold. Those familiar with the work of Ingmar Bergman will probably see a connection to his films because of this coldness that is one full display here. The film takes place in the winter and you can just feel the coldness really coming off the screen and it's this white, almost dreamlike nature that really makes the film work so well. The images in front of us are usually quite pretty but they're all surrounding by a rather brutal and ugly story that tackles many taboo subjects. Fincher handles the material quite well and with a running time of 158-minutes I was shocked to see how well he kept the thing moving as there's really not a slow or dry moment to be found. The pacing is incredibly good and this is especially impressive considering how much he packs into the running time and how there's very little action. Of course, another major benefit are the performances with Craig really turning in one of the best of his career. I've read a few negative reviews saying that he's too ""James Bond"" here as a reporter but I didn't find that to be the case at all. Plummer is always reliable and we get nice supporting performances by Robin Wright and Stellan Skarsgard. Then there's the Oscar-nominated Mara who easily steals the show. She's completely believable in the part and it doesn't matter if she's being abused or giving the abuse as you can see her in both sides. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO features a terrific score, some wonderful cinematography and all of this adds up to a very good thriller. I wouldn't call it a classic but it's certainly in a league to itself."
"onumbersix","9","3","8","26 January 2012"," Simply extraordinary!
","A Swedish cinematic trilogy which was a great hit in its country and we can understand why. Americans feel obliged to remake these foreign gems with often unfortunate results, but not this time. My state of mind after seeing this film in one word: WOW!<br/><br/>An extraordinary film on so many levels. A mysterious modern whodunit in which the story is peeled away one layer at a time, without revealing the rest to come. An almost futurist thriller, where the new information technologies are center stage. An imagery of reality in the raw. Complex and vulnerable characters. Fast paced action which keeps you riveted to the screen for more than 2 hours. And what can be said of this resilient character, Lisabeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo who dominates all her scenes in a role which surely will mark cinematic history for years to come, no less. Even Daniel Craig earns my kudos for his role. There are so many ways to appreciate this film that I'll probably go back for a second viewing while it is still in the theatres. It's really that good. Six weeks after its release and the theatre is sold out, a rare feat nowadays. Truly a standout film."

","When it comes to mystery/ crime genres i'm more of a visual kind of type. I've never read the books, so i was completely unaware and untroubled by the fact that i'd just experiment with watching another movie without any expectations. And i think this is one kind of way to enjoy a film.<br/><br/>For starters, the cast was fantastic! I was only remembering Daniel Craig's playing in this movie, never looked for any information before. And there's, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and of course Rooney Mara (she was great). Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who's been assigned to do a research on a missing woman. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a hacker who assists him. It's a lovely mix of mind and science. It keeps you wondering about the crimes and the connections and the psychology. Like, everyone's a suspect.<br/><br/>The scenery was beautiful, gloomy, overcast, creating an additional suspense especially with the foggy locations. Cold colors. You'll have to get cold to get comfortable (that means your emotions, too). Director David Fincher did a great work, and i see that he's bringing up '20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: Captain Nemo' in 2013. Also, 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' is the second book adaptation of the trilogy and it will officially start shooting back in Sweden at the end of the year.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a very interesting mystery film with nice twists. I enjoyed it very much. All 158 minutes of it!"
"herrfleischgewehr","8","3","8","24 January 2012"," Somewhat closer to the book and much more compelling
","Well most of you probably read the book (or the trilogy even). It was and still is a bestseller, something that starts and ends a conversation over a short coffee break. An easy read, thrilling story and a Swedish touch, who could resist? David Fincher certainly couldn't. Thank you David Fincher for taking the matter seriously, as always.<br/><br/>The story follows the book better than the Swedish original, the characters are portrayed in a more thorough way, systematically so to say. This is a good thing of course and if you put Hollywood money aside, the biggest difference between the Swedish interpretation and the Fincher vision. The visuals are superb, the winter of Swedish north was revealed in such a way that even I felt the coldness (in my cozy little apartment) and the chill in my not so old bones.<br/><br/>My rating is a strong eight, I could be nine but I am still struggling with the casting choice for the Lisbeth Salander. I still believe the Noomi Rapace would be better, but you know what, if the Oscar goes to Rooney Mara, you will know that I am wrong (wouldn't be the first time). Anyway, a strong recommendation follows: watch this movie."

","While the Swedish original was a very good film, with very good performances (especially from Noomi Rapace and Peter Haber), this 2nd adaption comes out superior. I love how Rooney Mara's take on Salander expands on yet more levels, taking Mara up to the heights of acting legends. I doubt I've ever seen a more complete and convincing performance from an American actress. Daniel Craig is also perfect in the role of Blomkvist, while the Reznor & Ross soundtrack is absolutely incredible. I went twice to the cinema to see this film, and I'm not the least disappointed having seen it twice in a short period of time. This is a masterpiece."
"Carnivorous","10","3","8","7 January 2012"," Best film of 2011.
","David Fincher is brilliant. I thought he had maxed his potential at Social Network, but he came & did it again. Having not seen the Swedish film or read the novel, this was a completely new story for me. & I was blown away! Daniel Craig gives a solid performance as Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced journalist tasked with solving a 40 year old murder. The supporting cast is excellent as well, in particular Christopher Plummer & Stellan Skarsgard. But the real star is Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth Salander, an emotionally damaged and unstable woman bordering on insanity. In every scene, she owns the character. She's fierce, wildly sexy, and unbelievably authentic. She better get an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>David Fincher is known for his dark, edgy style & it shows in this film. the cinematography is fine, but its the score that really shines. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross definitely produced a phenomenal score that goes well with the film. Oh, and don't let me forget the opening credits! Amazing, one of the best.<br/><br/>This film is R-rated for a reason though. There is quite a bit of nudity and a particularly disturbing rape scene. Just be forewarned. Overall, my favorite film of the year, just beating out Drive."
"Reel_starz","8","3","8","4 January 2012"," Welcome to the land of ice and snow
","Three years ago, nobody took David Fincher seriously. People admired his visual artistry ‚Äì he made even preposterous duds like Panic Room interesting with his imaginative camera-work ‚Äì and his willingness to push the envelope, but even his most celebrated film, the cult favorite Fight Club, bombed at the box office and received disparaging, almost downright hostile, reviews upon its initial release in 1999. Then, in December 2008, the ambitious, long-gestating romance The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a movie unlike anything Fincher had previously attempted, debuted to critical acclaim and eventually garnered a stunning thirteen Oscar nominations, including one for its director. In 2010, his next project, The Social Network, became the virtually undisputed Best Movie of the Year, sweeping the critics' awards and appearing on countless Top Ten lists, and suddenly, David Fincher was one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. Considering his previous filmography and his newfound popularity, it's little surprise that when Fincher was chosen to helm the American adaptation of Steig Larsson's wildly popular crime novel, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the decision was met with much excitement and surprisingly little outrage. It was the perfect opportunity for Fincher to both prove his worth as a mainstream filmmaker and return to the darker, more audacious movies that jumpstarted his career.<br/><br/>By all rights, the movie should be considered an undeniable success. Opening with a typically innovative, gorgeously nightmarish credits sequence set to the distorted, rollicking strains of a cover of Led Zeppelin masterwork ""Immigrant Song"" by Karen O, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a fascinating tight-wire act of a movie, weaving a story of murder, rape, intrigue and vengeance that feels adequately gruesome and macabre but never abusive, once again demonstrating David Fincher's ability to handle graphic material with finesse. The director fuses together an ice-cold atmosphere (both literal and metaphorical, as the audience can practically feel the frigid Swedish weather through the screen), spine-tingling imagery and a taut score (courtesy of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who won an Oscar for their work on The Social Network) to create almost relentless tension; even those who know every inch of the plot will find themselves on the edge of their seats for much of the running time. It goes without saying that this movie is not for the faint-hearted. Even so, Fincher surprisingly manages to devise moments of poignancy and even humor amid all the gloom, making this film slightly more enjoyable ‚Äì if such a word can be used in this context ‚Äì than the generally bleak source material and Swedish version. Devotees of Larsson's novel will be pleased that this adaptation is remarkably faithful, keeping the majority of the plot intact and making only a few minor tweaks. <br/><br/>As far as the actors go, not a single misstep can be found. Despite his limited screen time, Christopher Plummer imbues the jaded Henrik Vanger with a nice mix of pathos and dry wit, and Stellan Skarsgard thankfully plays the cordial yet enigmatic Martin Vanger, brother of presumed murder victim, Harriet, with a chillingly understated menace, lending realism to a character that could easily have been overly manic or cartoonish. Daniel Craig takes a break from his usual macho-guy persona to embody the determined, albeit somewhat bland journalist Mikael Blomkvist, his hulking, age-worn physique lending credibility to the character's lofty ideals. Nonetheless, as in the novel, the undeniable star of the show is the tortured, antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, and, in the titular role, Rooney Mara is simply sensational. Previously known by most for playing Mark Zuckerberg's exasperated girlfriend in The Social Network, Mara became all but a household name when David Fincher chose her to play Salander, one of the most coveted roles of the century, as evidenced by the frenzied media coverage that accompanied the seemingly endless search process, during which such A-list actresses as Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johannson were allegedly considered. Viewing the final product, it's obvious Fincher made the right choice. Mara, ordinarily a rather unassuming brunette, is unrecognizable with her dyed-black hair, heavy make-up, multiple body piercings, tattered Goth clothing and near-anorexic frame, yet more impressive than her physical transformation is the way she nails Lisbeth's volatile psychological state, her fragile yet explosive personality. Through her haunted eyes and guarded posture, she conveys myriad emotions at once, alternating between passion and vulnerability, belligerence and anguish, tenacity and insecurity to create a complex, mesmerizing character that dominates the screen simply by being there.<br/><br/>And yet, something doesn't feel quite right. For all its perfectly calibrated suspense, the movie left me, if not disappointed, then slightly empty, as though something vital was missing; even now, I can't quite figure out why. Maybe it's the story itself, which I find overly convoluted and rather unfocused (I was never a huge fan of the book). Maybe it's the fact that, despite having both read the novel and seen the Swedish adaptation, I let the feverishly edited teaser trailer trick me into believing that the movie would be a kinetic, fast-paced thriller rather than the slow-burning mystery that it actually is. Or maybe ‚Äì and this seems the most likely explanation ‚Äì I'm just tired of the detached, methodical air that has saturated Fincher's recent work, even the ostensibly warm Benjamin Button. Don't get me wrong: I adore The Social Network as much as the next person, and I was captivated by 2007's Zodiac. But what happened to the dynamic brio of Fight Club? Technically, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is flawless ‚Äì almost too flawless, if that's possible. The whole affair is so measured, so painstaking, that it's honestly not that fun to watch; I suppose this could be more to do with my own expectations than the movie itself, but I somehow wish it was more stylish, more liberated and adventurous, more like the old David Fincher. I liked it, but I wanted to love it."

","In 2005, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the first book in Swedish journalist and writer Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium Series"", was published; unfortunately, Larsson died without ever having the opportunity to see his books published, let alone how popular they would go on to become. The novel went on to become a worldwide best seller, as did the two sequels: The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest. As the books grew in fame, and Swedish film adaptations of the series were successful, so did the likelihood of Hollywood film version.<br/><br/>In order to meet the complexities within the novel, a director proved capable of handling such complexities was needed; there was no better choice than David Fincher. Fincher, whom in prior years had been nominated for Academy Awards in Directing for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and The Social Network, was tailor made based on previous films, such as Se7en, The Game and Zodiac. The decision to film the movie on location in Sweden was an intelligent choice, as it allowed the natural elements and locations to set the backdrop. The biggest decision Fincher made, and one that would make or break the movie, was casting choices. Daniel Craig, best known for playing the latest incarnation of James Bond, does a fantastic job as journalist/investigator Mikael Blomkvist. Craig's best attribute is his ability to play up to the strengths of his character, and with Blomkvist it's his charisma and submissiveness. Although Blomkvist is one of the central characters of the film; without question, the star is Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara. Mara gives an Academy Award worthy performance as the socially awkward Salander. Mara commands the screen in everything she does. Mara provides the character with such depth, that you sympathize with Lisbeth and understand her need to not attach herself to anyone. If an Oscar Nomination doesn't come her way, it would be disappointing. The rest of the supporting cast is also impressive; Christopher Plummer continues to get better with age, as Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsg√•rd is wonderful as Martin Vanger, and Yorick van Wageningen gives one of the creepiest performances of all-time as Nils Bjurman. <br/><br/>No film is without flaws, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has a few. The one issue I had with the film was the opening credits; it played like a music video and was entirely unnecessary and there's one sex scene near the end of the film that wasn't needed. Aside from that, I thought the film stayed very true to a book with approx. 480 pages. With a book of that size, certain parts must be left out of the movie; I truly believe that what wasn't included, wouldn't have improved the film. Without a doubt, this film is one that merits a lot of consideration come Awards season. Rooney Mara's star has begun to blaze ever so brightly and deservedly so. The transformation into her character alone was impressive, but to look the part and be the part are two entirely different things and she was able to achieve both. David Fincher accomplished what he set out to do, to make a brutal, mysterious and brooding film and I enjoyed the end result.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

But despite the bleakness, the thing that really shone through was the performance by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. She brings total passion, fear and strength as she struggles with her own demons of social flaws and insanity to solve this horrifying case of a WW2 type serial massacre of people.

"maatmouse-1","8","3","9","4 January 2012"," Dark as night Fincher remake of Swedish thriller
","I made the decision to come to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo - the film right after finishing the book and I'm glad I did, partly because in order to understand the way the film moves around, you really need to have read the book. <br/><br/>Firstly, there are the main characters. Daniel Craig is brilliant as Mikael Blomkvist, the disgraced financial journalist whose libellous actions find him out of popular favour and put him right in the arms (and money) of the Vanger family and Corporation. Here, he is tempted to indulge Henrik Vanger's obsession with finding out where lost family member Harriet is. His chief motivations are pressed flowers which come each year from who knows where or who and a sense of closure he desperately craves as an old man. In short Craig's journo has to turn detective to satisfy the old man's curiosity. <br/><br/>As Blomkvist leaves his magazine behind in the capable hands of his married lover Erika, he travels to the colder north of Sweden to the heart of the Vanger family in Hedestad. He deals with cold weather, a family of dysfunctional people, some with 'nazi' tendencies and, in the latter stages someone trying to kill him. No mean task this.<br/><br/>Playing parallel to Blomkvist's adventures is the story of Lisbeth Salander. Salander, played very ably by Rooney Mara, is a punk, goth, rather brilliant loner with her own values/opinions on sexuality. We first meet Salander as she emerges from her motorbike, wearing a distressed black leather jacket, spiky black hair, extreme make-up and facial piercings which scream 'leave me alone'. Salander is a woman who dresses her own way with little thought as to her perceived attractiveness and desperately wants Swedish society to leave her well alone to do her job and not be hassled by anyone. Of course, this is not the case. After one social welfare guardian suffers a stroke, Salander is taken into the 'care' of another who just sees a way to exploit and control the free spirit, abusing his power by coercing Salander in a series of horrifying sexual assaults, each more severe than the last. This makes for very hard watching, as Salander is bound to his bed and is raped, all because he believes she should be more 'sociable' and friendly. His comeuppance is just as brutal, but also deserved as Salander zaps him with a tazer then dishes out some of her own treatment. <br/><br/>Thus do the paths then cross. Blomkvist appeals to Frode, his employer's solicitor for help in researching details and Frode points him to Salander. In the most uncomfortable of meetings, Salander begins to help Blomkvist in his journey to find Harriet alive or dead. It is this journey that continues to take darker paths, as Blomkvist reveals whats at the heart of the Vanger family and it really isn't pretty. Salander also initiates a sexual relationship with Blomkvist and in the course of the film, finds solace and a sort of brief peace in his care. In return for that, she manages to save his life after he is assaulted at the hands of another Vanger family member. <br/><br/>Fincher makes this adaptation of the film something to look at and a challenge to follow. For women there is a strong female lead to watch in Salander, a woman who tries to live her life by her own rules (but doesn't always succeed) and Blomkvist whose own love life is a bit of a mess in the book has it rationalised slightly in the film by only managing 2 lovers. And there's the brilliant mostly British cast, who include Craig, Geraldine James, Christopher Plummer, Stephen Berkoff and Joely Richardson with grand turns from Robin Wright and Stellan Skaarsguard (who else),but its Craig and Rooney Mara who make this film with likable, believable characters, not merely parts which could have ended up as caricatures."

Leo the Lion's roar, the roar which signifies the start of an MGM picture, is muted. It's a portent, which sets us up for something. Shame it wasn't anything interesting.<br/><br/>Despite missing Stieg Larsson's trilogy and the Swedish film adaptations, I was optimistic going into this screening because of last year's 'Let Me In', another American retelling of another Swedish original ('Let the Right One in'). I should say that I purposely avoided the books because I have a phobia of the term 'international best seller'.

His investigative skills are famous and attract the attention of Henrik Vanger (a typically superb Christopher Plummer). Henrik, another magnate, hires Mikael, ostensibly to write his memoirs, but actually to help uncover why a niece of his mysteriously disappeared 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Henrik doesn't prevaricate. He tells Mikael to be weary of his family, who he unhesitatingly calls 'the worst people you will ever meet' (two are 'ex'-Nazis), and to suspect everyone, including Henrik. Mikael works from one of Vanger's outhouses, keenly trying to keep warm in the arctic weather (the film is painted in shades which reflect the bone-numbing cold).<br/><br/>Most of my memory of this film is how tedious the storytelling is. Mikael alternates between his Apple Mac and his wall of notes, interviewing people in between. I confess I quickly lost track of all the names, dates and events, which is never as good compared with knowing all the details and guessing the culprit. Mikael realises he will not solve the case alone, so requests help. Enter Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>The only interesting part of this film, the only reason to part with your money, isn't to find out whodunit, but to see Rooney Mara's unfettered and courageous take on Salander, the film's eponymous heroine. Salander is the ultimate Private Eye-come hacker. Give her two minutes and she'll bring up a list of all your indiscretions, even the ones you forgot about.<br/><br/>As a character, Salander is a fascinating creation. She's a multi-layered enigma. Institutionalised from a young age, she passes through life as a ghost. Her sexuality is ambiguous. Is she a lesbian? Bisexual? Judging by the blas√©, almost mechanical way she stands in front of her desired match ‚Äì male or female ‚Äì and simply undresses, I'd say she is asexual. <br/><br/>A big distraction was Daniel Craig. I don't see him as a cerebral actor. I would have given the part to Viggo Mortensen, who was considered. But Craig is Bond, so that means he is second only to God. The film tries to both American and Swedish. Sweden may be the setting, Swedish may be the characters' ethnicity, but English, bizarrely, is the language. Plummer, although spot on, was replaced by Max Von Sydow, a true Swede, who would have brought authenticity to the artifice.<br/><br/>I felt the ending was an anti-climax. Will I be spoiling anything by saying it's the one you suspect from the beginning? I also couldn't understand why Vagner waited 40 years before revisiting the case. Those sorts of details spoilt it for me. Except for a vicious rape scene and a macabre torture sequence, you couldn't tell this was by Fincher.<br/><br/>What is it about this story that attracts so many people? It can't be plain old retribution: that would be plain and old. Maybe we're attracted by the notion of superwomen in cinema. Is this a new fetish? I hope so.<br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"
"jules5488","9","3","9","28 December 2011"," The ""Feel Bad"" Movie of Christmas -- Fincher delivers a gift to viewers
","December 22, 2011<br/><br/>Last night, I stopped by Patriot Place in Foxboro, MA to go see the highly anticipated ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" a second rendition of Stieg Larsson's international bestseller. Second to the much admired Swedish film, many critics were skeptical of whether or not an American remake would live up to Larsson's widely acclaimed trilogy. On a whole, the screenwriter, Stephen Zaillian, sticks pretty loyally to the book, and the director, David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en, Social Network) and cinematographer definitely outweigh the Swedish version in terms of artful rendering and skillful directing. While taking some liberties of leaving out minor details and plot lines, Zaillain fits in every important aspect and character in the 2 hours and 40 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The opening sequence, with a cover of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song (""we come from the land of the ice and snow"") by Trent Reznor and the vocals of Karen Oh, gives you the credits among abstract scenes of seemingly black oil-covered characters (Salander and Blomkvist) and creatures that vaguely touch upon the trilogy's titles: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who Played with Fire, and The Girl who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara was enthralling as Lisbeth Salander, a socially inept computer-hacker genius who works for a state of the art security company. Salander teams up with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) to track down a killer of women, after Blomkvist, a journalist for the fictional Swedish magazine Millennium, is sued for libel by corrupt billionaire Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m. Mara portrays Salander a bit differently than the Swedish version's Noomi Rapace in that Mara captures her vulnerability while still being the kick ass, reclusive and disturbed, but still endearing heroine that we know and love (if you are a fan of the novels). Rapace gave off lots of raw energy in her performance as Lisbeth and did an equally wonderful job in portraying her. However, Mara's fragility shines through, so that Salander is not solely perceived as a bad-ass Goth biker chick, but a relatable and likable human being.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist also gives a solid performance, keeping true to Blomkvist's professionalism, while still remaining in his familiar acting style of James Bond: womanizer, mystery solver. He even holds his British accent true among other American actors, who speak English in a Swedish accent (Robin Wright as Erika Berger does this with flair). The chemistry between Craig and Mara is just as I pictured it between Blomkvist and Salander; her ""puppy love"" crush that is covered up as a fascination with him after doing a background investigation on his life and the Wennerstr√∂m affair becomes a more mature friendship, a bond of respect and trust, that you see develop throughout the film. This was a prominent topic in the book, Blomkvist pointing out to Salander during a more intimate moment between them that ""both elements have to be there. And it has to be mutual. You can have respect for someone, but if you don't have trust, the friendship will crumble."" However, Blomkvist is not a monogamous lover, as Salander must come to terms with in the final scene of the film.<br/><br/>The film also isn't afraid to be bold with the scenes of graphic rape, violence, and sex. Stieg Larsson's original Swedish name for the first book of the trilogy, ""M√§n som hatar kvinnor,"" or ""Men who hate women,"" is the theme of all three books in the series and therefore, any cinematic elements left out in terms of these scenes would deter from Larson's original purpose. Not only are the rape scenes graphic, but we get a glimpse of the serial murders in photos and descriptions. Finally, the sexuality between Blomkvist and Salander are also quite vivid, and again I believe this to be necessary after reading Larson's descriptions of their trysts.<br/><br/>The music, by Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch, also didn't fail in enticing each viewer into the suspense-filled, bone-chilling setting of northern Sweden, where the industrial tycoon Henrik Vanger takes you into his estate. Here he gives Blomkvist the tale of his family, mainly his long lost niece, Harriet, who he believes was murdered by one of his family members many years ago and now is being haunted by the murderer year after year with a framed flower on his birthday. Harriet used to give him a different and exotic framed flower each year up until the year she disappeared at 16 years old; over 40 years ago.<br/><br/>If you have read this trilogy and have a few spare hours, I recommend you go out and see this in the theater. The so-called ""feel-bad movie of Christmas"" will leave you with a satisfaction you won't get in a shopping mall this season."
"blanbrn","8","3","9","28 December 2011"," Complex and in depth mystery that's spiced with raw and erotic feel good sex appeal.
","I for one am not a big reader of novels, and I have never read ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", yet I must say that David Fincher's in depth and long drawn out film adaptation had me in interest with suspense and complex thought. As one knows any Fincher film often shows the brutal and raw nature of life and with many scenes in this picture he pulled back no punches. As one watches this complex drama a mystery of dirty secrets will unfold and the film is guided by it's grit and raw erotic sex scenes which keep the viewer even more intrigued.<br/><br/>The story involves soviet journalist Mikael Blomkvist(Daniel Craig)who's a man that's clearly a little burned out with his work only it once again gets interesting when he's hired by a rich international family man Henrik Vanger(the superb Christopher Plummer)to investigate the disappearance of one of his dear loved ones a young girl in the family. Only soon thru it all Mikael's investigation will lead to more and more gruesome discovered disappearances and brutal murders. On the side in an interesting subplot is the arrival of an exotic and strange computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander(in a raw and gritty performance from Rooney Mara)and she is Mikael's assistance to breaking the secrets and lies of the dark past underworld of many cases. Along the way the passion of hot erotic and kinky sex encounters occur between the two which spices the film up some. And as always with a Fincher film he shows how brutal life can be it's often raw and wicked as evidenced by the blunt and provocative rape scene.<br/><br/>Overall good film that will hold your interest even though it's drawn out and complex it's one interesting mystery of secrets, and an interesting journey. The film shows that life is raw and often mysterious with secrets and lies."
"markgorman","9","3","9","28 December 2011"," This movie proves that Hollywood can do art-house. Again. The Swedish must be gutted.
","For the second time in as many years Hollywood has come out to face up to the competition from outstanding Swedish cinema with remakes that, at the time of announcement, seemed indecently hasty.<br/><br/>Cashing in, one might conject? Maybe so, as the movies in question, ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""Let me in"" could both b e accused of copying the Swedish originals quite closely.<br/><br/>So, Boxing Day in the UK saw the much anticipated Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, stateside version, hit our screens and boy does the US cinema industry once again show that it can hold its own against European art house with some ease.<br/><br/>The original (Swedish) movie, which was adapted from a mega hit novel by Steigg Larson, was outstanding.<br/><br/>This reviewer gave it an IMDb score of 9.0. So how does this compare? In a word. Admirably.<br/><br/>Indeed the US version actually communicates the story slightly more clearly than the Swedish adaptation (and that's not a comment about subtitles).<br/><br/>The fact is, David Fincher is on fire and he has once again crafted a thriller that sits proudly alongside Se7en.<br/><br/>The film opens with a thundering, and truly awesome, cover of Led Zepellin's Immigrant Song by Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose (the Social Network) - there's a nice touch early in the movie when Lisbeth's go to man for forgeries appears wearing a NIN T shirt - and the opening credits, again like se7en are worthy of an Oscar in their own right. Brilliantly mixing oil and flame (a theme that bookends the movie) they set the scene to perfection.<br/><br/>Black. Black as you can get.<br/><br/>You'll probably know the plot if you're reading this so I won't go into it; it's a complex and interwoven tale of historical murder and modern day defamation mixing religion, Nazism and extreme sexual torture, but it's all handled with a restraint that makes it all the more shocking in a directorial masterclass by Fincher. With the exception of the brutally bad Benjamin Button, Fincher is building a body of work (including The Social Network, Fight Club, Zodiac The Panic Room and Se7en) that makes him the current king of the thriller and one of the best and most reliable directors in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is very good in this but Rooney Mara blows him away with a performance every bit as good as Roomi Rapace's in the Swedish version.<br/><br/>This is a languid, but often shocking, storytelling experience. It's a great movie. Sure, it's only really a pseudo cop film but it's got everything that anyone loves about great film making could hope to see in a luxuriant 156 minutes.<br/><br/>Magic. 9/10"
"gene1","8","3","9","26 December 2011"," A movie you can sink your teeth into - satisfying!
","Finally got a movie I could sink my teeth into, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" One of the things I liked best was its length, which, like a book you find yourself drawn into, you feel delighted and look forward to spending some time with these characters and this story. The plot developed the leads separately, brought them together and then gave them time to interact and time to give a satisfying conclusion so we find out what finally became of the missing girl. So I was happy to sit and participate and see what would happen, like a satisfying mystery or spy story. And Rooney Mara is very hot as the female lead, showing her sexuality in a very natural and appealing way, at least for me. Not at all in a smutty way, even though the temptation must have been there. She plays a self-imposed outcast, not a misanthrope.<br/><br/>And as for Daniel Craig, I disagree with Roger Ebert, that he comes across with the same confidence he showed as James Bond. In fact, like 'The Descendants,' where George Clooney allows the older daughter character to, at times, overshadow his character so that he really does come across as the clueless, feckless father, Craig also doesn't seem to demand the audience's attention be focused on him. Nor is he a particularly strong character ‚Äì he never fights anyone; it is Dragon Girl who gets the chance to do damage to the villains. In fact, Craig's best qualities are the humanity and sense of character he brings to a role, without any melodramatics, exaggeration or heroics. He just allows us to sympathize with his character, as he did in 'Defiance.' So, overall, I was drawn to these characters and plot line ‚Äì a satisfying film experience ‚Äì 3 ¬Ω stars of 4, an 8 stars out of 10."
"cara-58","8","3","9","26 December 2011"," Much better than expected
","Having read both the books and watched the Swedish version of the film, I did not have high hopes for the remade American version. I was concerned about how a big-budget, Hollywood style movie might take away from the rawness of the story. Turns out I had nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>This American version is actually much more true to the book than is the Swedish version. The only major change from the book was that Blomkvist did not have sex with every single female character that showed up in the story (thankfully, the Swedish version left this out, too, because it was just ridiculous). Besides this, it incorporated many aspects of the book that were left out in the Swedish film. The result is a very long film, which may start to drag on for people who have never read the books, but which is certainly enough to satisfy fans. Despite being a somewhat flashier, higher-budget version, this version of the movie does a good job of incorporating a lot of the rawness of the story. There are plenty of horrifying, cringe-worthy scenes that are not censored anymore than the Swedish version (in fact, it almost seems as though Fincher was trying to be even more shocking).<br/><br/>The acting and casting was superb. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice for Blomkvist; despite his previous macho hero roles, he does a great job in bringing out the vulnerability of his character. He is a relatively mild-mannered man who finds himself caught up in some dangerous situations. Although I don't feel like anyone can ever do any better than Noomi Rapace as Salander in the original movies, Rooney Mara certainly came very close with a much different style. Mara brings out a little more of the emotionality of Salander but still well mixed with the blank mask of a traumatized girl. The chemistry between Blomkvist and Salander is very well done in this movie - there is a certain warmth between Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara that was lacking in the Swedish version. Other notable performances include Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger (who borders on amusing when he talks about his family squabbles), Stellan Skarsgard as Martin Vanger, and Steven Berkoff as Frode.<br/><br/>I did have a few minor issues with the movie. The accents were pretty poorly done. It felt as though the directors and the actors couldn't decide whether they wanted the characters to have accents or not. Some characters had part-time accents and others seemed to have no accent at all (Daniel Craig, in particular). I wouldn't really mind if none of the actors had Swedish accents since this is an English-language film but there is definitely a need to be consistent. Unlike other reviewers, I was not at all a fan of the soundtrack. Most of it hardly sounded like music to me - sort of just techno sounds half the time. The worst was the opening credits with really bizarre Gothic art and a song that just seemed very at odds with the rest of the movie."
"Bellock","8","3","9","25 December 2011"," Lisabeth Is My Hero!!
","Personally, I haven't seen the other versions of this movie or read the book. So I can only discuss this movie on it's own merits. The plot has deliberate pacing in developing and at times struggles to keep one's interest. Most of the characters personalities was developed as the movie progresses. The plot resolution becomes something of a back story for me once Lisabeth and Mikael finally meet. I was captivated by Rooney Mara's ""Lisabeth"". Rooney Mara was fearless in her portrayal of this antisocial, unpredictable, emotionally damaged and extremely intelligent young woman.<br/><br/>On reflection, Craig's Mikael Bromkvist was the most disappointingly drawn character in the movie. Mikael telegraphs the ending after Lisabeth saves his life. She saved him from a horrendous death yet he was blas√© about it almost tone deaf. I don't remember him even thanking her. Then she turns around and gives him what he wanted to accomplish in his book. Again the blas√© response from him. The ending brings into question his sense of reality and the value of his own life. He blunders through his life with little concern for consequence. The character Mikael has no vision which might explain the meandering plot in the beginning. I'm not blaming Craig. He made the character quite believable.<br/><br/>I certainly recommend the movie to adults. There are some hard, unforgiving scenes in this movie. The viewer will feel violated while watching the rape scene. Meaning, it was perfectly shot. Not for the faint of heart and certainly not for children. My favorite part of the movie is Rooney Mara's performance alone."
"nejadb","4","2","5","6 June 2018"," Poorly directed / editted
","Strong performance all round is let down by a poor directing. 
Skilfully directed movie never feels like a collection of separate takes jumping from one scene to another and this one is exactly that. In addition I found some of the scenes objectionable. For example it seemed to me the rape scene was unnecessarily too long and distressing, as if the director enjoyed filming it. There should be no joy seeing someone suffering like that. If the perpetrator was beheading someone would he been filming it that long?! Same goes with the sex scenes that were definitely didn't need to be over done to that extent."

","I never read the book and after hearing all the hype and seeing the overall bleak appearance of the trailer, I was not interested in this movie. Boy, was I wrong. This is a thrilling detective story about a disgraced investigative reporter trying to solve a family mystery for a wealthy eccentric and his bizarre extended family. There are some squeamish parts involving ""The Girl"" before she enters the investigation that could have been left out in my opinion, but I'm sure others would say those events helped define the character. There were a number of well-developed red herrings to keep you guessing and actually two mysteries solved by the end, neither of which were easy to figure out. I actually watched it twice over 3 days to pick up on more details and I find it worthy of repeated viewings. 8/10"
"stickbob123","9","2","5","17 March 2014"," On par with the original. And that's quite impressive.
","It is so rare that a remake matches the quality of the original, but this film does just that. In terms of quality, the two movies are in a perfect tie, I really can't decide which is better. I'll start with Lisbeth. Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth is tough as nails and very mysterious to the audience and especially to the other characters. Rooney Mara's version of Lisbeth is quite different. She's vulnerable and she quickly becomes easy to sympathize with. She's also more understandable. There's a part in this film relatively early on when Mike smirks at her antics, as if she and him are good friends even though they only met yesterday. Lisbeth's relationship with the audience is much the same in this movie. In both movies there's a part where she disguises herself as a well- dressed business woman. In the Swedish version, she looks out of place; like she's wearing a costume, but in this version she looks comfortable. Like the piercings, leather jackets, and crazy hairstyles she wears are the disguise instead of the classy suit. In the Swedish version, Lisbeth's personality closely matches her exterior appearance, but in this one, at the core, she is a little less complex, but more relatable. If I had to choose who's performance I prefer I would have to say Noomi Rapace's because she seems more complex and a bit more mysterious, but Rooney Mara did an outstanding job and made it her own as well. I also preferred the pace at which the mystery unravels in the Swedish version to this one. The audience is kept in the dark much longer in that version and it makes the twists much more potent. However, if there's one thing the American version did better (much better), it's the cinematography. The film embraces its neo-noir vibes and delivers many stylized shots that are infinitely more visually interesting than its Swedish counterpart's shots. There's one in particular where the camera moves in to right behind Lisbeth's head and then flips around her to show her face encased in a glowing red light that I really loved. It looked great and it captured the tone of the scene quite well, something the Swedish version didn't try to do very often. David Fincher is a master at creating unsanitary, immoral labyrinths with his camera-work (Fight Club, Se7en), and that's on full display here as well. Like I said, the films tie. They both show different sides to the story and Lisbeth and I recommend both very highly. """

","When I first heard about the book I didn't think I would like it. It just sounded crazy. But when I finally sat down with it I couldn't stop. It was absolutely gripping. It has been a few years since I have read it so I can't be real specific. I liked it so much that I couldn't put it down and bought the rest of the trilogy. They were all great but the second two wandered a bit after the gripping tension of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Thank goodness I read them in proper order. <br/><br/>The first time I watched The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo it was on Netflix and in Swedish. Luckily the subtitles were good. After that I had to see the English version.<br/><br/>What a shame that the author died shortly after he finished the third on.

"SnoopyStyle","8","2","5","8 September 2013"," David Fincher Recreates
","David Fincher is able to recreate the first of the Swedish hit trilogy based on the novels. The style is similar with the Swedish original. It's got the cold blue tone, and the same desolate morality. It hasn't been transplanted to anywhere else. In fact, it's basically kept the whole thing intact with the exception of the actors. Daniel Craig is a Hollywood choice to be the journalist. Of course, he's 007. Sure he's hot. So when Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) sleeps with him, it is less about his personality and a little more about his James Bond body. But it's to be expected for a Hollywood remake. Rooney Mara is just not as intense as Noomi Rapace. Rooney is a skinny girly actress with some good acting skills. She has just enough to play the anger. But Noomi has more. The original Lisbeth was a true discovery.<br/><br/>I hate to compare the two, but they are so close that they're begging to be compared. Overall I liked the Swedish one slightly more but just very slightly. Some of that probably is due to the fact that I saw that one first. David Fincher does a great job of recreating the original."
"Luigi Di Pilla","7","2","5","17 March 2013"," Solid puzzle mystery thriller
","I am very satisfied at the end of this hard thriller. I like this kind of mystery movies where tricky puzzles must be solved. The landscapes of Sweden were beautiful and created a good atmosphere. The performance of the detective work of Daniel Craig and his assistant Rooney Mara were very respectable. Then another great plus for this film was the experience of director David Fincher who delivered the other legendary thriller Seven. What I didn't like therefore was the long running time of two hours and a half. As I mentioned in other earlier reviews the playtime must not exceed 2 hours. I think that a few scenes could have been cut here. But don't understand me wrong. The Girl With The Golden Tattoo took me anyway on a real hell trip with lot of turns and twists. If you like this genre of movies you shouldn't miss The General's Daughter with John Travolta. Final rate: 7/10."
"cultjones","Null","2","5","11 February 2013"," A Tattoo to admire.
","Based on a best seller, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is another piece or art that makes its treacherous journey from the paper it was born on, to the silver screen. Donning the mantle of trying to do it justice are Daniel Craig, of Bond fame, and Rooney Mara who starred in The Social Network and Nightmare on Elm Street. Her striking transformation leaves an indelible mark in the viewers mind and is only surpassed by her performance of a badass, tech genius with social deficiencies. Craig on the other hand is anything but Bond like and successfully does his bit not to be pigeonholed as an Action-Man. Instead, he parades his acting chops and demands to be recognised for his ability.<br/><br/>David Fincher, the director who brought us memorable films such as Se7en, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is clearly capable at the helm of Stieg Larsson's masterpiece. Fincher gently steers the audience down two parallel winding paths where the travellers are spiralling in their own lives only to meet at a crucial junction. Before you know it, you're hooked and are unable to turn away. Under the surface of the mystery, David gives you haunting glimpses in to the disturbing and nauseating primal nature of man, which is brutal in its reality.<br/><br/>In a genre riddled with predictability and well-travelled twists and turns, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a refreshing breath of fresh air. Both Craig and especially, Mara only enhance Fincher's vision further with notable performances."
"JamesHitchcock","8","2","5","12 October 2012"," Nordic Noir
","A recent literary phenomenon in English-speaking countries has been the popularity of ""Nordic Noir"", Scandinavian crime fiction by such authors as Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell (both Swedish), Jo Nesbo (Norwegian) and Peter Hoeg (Danish). A number of works by these writers have been adapted either for television or for the cinema, in Britain and America as well as in Scandinavia itself. <br/><br/>This is the second of two recent adaptations of Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""; the first was a Swedish-language version from 2009 which I have not seen. It is an example of what has been called ""neo- noir"", the type of modern thriller which attempts to emulate the spirit of the classical films noirs of the forties and fifties while using the benefits of late twentieth or twenty-first century cinema technology. (The neo-noir style dates back at least to Polanski's ""Chinatown"" from the seventies; later examples include ""Body Heat"", ""Gorky Park"", ""L A Confidential"" ""Insomnia"" and Bille August's adaptation of Hoeg's ""Smilla's Sense of Snow""). ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" combines several main features of neo-noir, including a complex plot involving crime and corruption, a cynical, world-weary investigator who nevertheless retains a sense of decency and fair play, and a striking visual style which can act as an equivalent to the expressionist black- and-white photography of classical noir. Here David Fincher provides this visual element with some very distinctive photography of a rain- swept Stockholm and of the snow-bound town in northern Sweden where the Vanger family lives; as in some of Fincher's other films the film's gloomy look is intended to parallel the dark events which make up the story. <br/><br/>As the film opens, Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist, has just lost a libel case brought against him by a businessman named Hans- Erik Wennerstr√∂m. Despite the verdict, Blomkvist believes that he was right to accuse Wennerstr√∂m of corruption, and accepts a commission from a wealthy industrialist named Henrik Vanger. Ostensibly, Vanger wants Blomkvist to write the history of his family, but he is in fact hoping that Blomkvist will be able to uncover the truth about his great-niece Harriet who disappeared in 1966 and is presumed to have been murdered. In exchange for this work, Vanger promises Blomkvist damning information about Wennerstr√∂m (whom Vanger dislikes) as well as a handsome payment. In his researches Blomkvist has the assistance of a brilliant computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander. <br/><br/>In many ways it is Lisbeth rather than Blomkvist who is the main character. The Swedish title of Larsson's book literally means ""Men who Hate Women""; possibly his translator changed this in order to stress Lisbeth's centrality to the story. In her sharp intelligence, her obsessive determination her belief in justice and her willingness to go outside the law in order to see justice done, she is reminiscent of Hoeg's heroine Smilla, but is a far more dangerous, threatening character. <br/><br/>Lisbeth, in appearance a mixture of seventies punk and eighties Goth, is intellectually brilliant, especially as far as computer technology is concerned, but is clearly emotionally damaged and vulnerable. At the age of twelve she was committed to a mental institution after trying to kill her father- we never learn the full details of this incident- and is still regarded as a ""ward of the state"" due to mental incompetency, which means that all her affairs are in the hands of a state-appointed legal guardian. Lisbeth is bisexual; we see her in a relationship with another woman, but she also finds herself falling in love with Blomkvist, despite his steady relationship with Erika, his partner in both the business and the romantic senses of that word. Rooney Mara- an actress I had not previously come across- gives an absolutely brilliant performance here, bringing out all the many facets of Lisbeth's highly complicated, contradictory character. <br/><br/>Scandinavia is often regarded in Britain as something of a peaceful backwater, socially progressive and with a low crime rate, but the picture given of Swedish society in this film is a very different one; murder, rape, incest, financial corruption and political extremism are all central to the plot. The Vanger family in particular have any number of guilty secrets This stress on the darker side of the human character is, of course, in the best film noir tradition, but the makers of this film were able to treat the sexual aspects of this dark side with much more freedom than were film-makers of the forties and fifties. <br/><br/>Larsson's original title may not have been retained in the English translation, but it is highly relevant to the events of the story, as male violence against women is a theme running throughout the film. Blomkvist and Lisbeth discover that Harriet's disappearance is linked to a series of killings of women during the forties, fifties and sixties. Lisbeth herself falls victim to such violence when her official guardian, Nils Bjurman abuses his authority to assault her sexually; she is to take a vicious, but highly effective, revenge. <br/><br/>Fincher has not always been my favourite director. Although ""Panic Room"" was a reasonably effective thriller, I found both ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club"" overrated and ""Zodiac"" rather dull. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", however, is the best of his films which I have yet seen. Besides Mara, Fincher is also able to bring out good performances from Daniel Craig as Blomkvist, the sort of dogged noir hero who sixty years ago would have been played by Humphrey Bogart or Glenn Ford, and Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger. There are also good contributions from Yorick van Wageningen as the repellent Bjurman and Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Vanger's sinister nephew Martin. The acting, the striking photography and the intelligent, literate script combine to make this a grim but compelling thriller. 8/10"
"steve-ruzicka","7","2","5","21 April 2012"," From a great book to an average movie
","I confess: the movie was a disappointment. The book and the deepness of the characters is far superior. A book of course has far more potential when it comes to describe a large family over generations and their internal battles. The genealogy is important to understand the various relationships and I admit having had to go back to earlier passages to reposition the players. The book is magnificently constructed with far more content to the ""investigation"" and the development of Lisbeth's character. It also seems that the book's intermediate end (what did really happen to Harriet) did not please the director, so he took a shortcut: open for discussion. In conclusion, people who did not read the book are likely to give the movie a higher rating. To them I strongly recommend to get the book and ... enjoy it."
"brandonhaber95","9","2","5","10 February 2012"," One of the absolute best films of the YEAR!
","This movie was beyond fantastic, truly a well made film which let's face it, may be hard to come by often these days. Daniel Craig who plays the main role does so in such a thrilling manner as well as Rooney Mara who had me convinced she'd lost her marbles. From a cinematic point of view, it was directed by one of the best thriller directors out there David Fincher who redefined the gory twist completely with the 1995 film Se7en. Fincher made the audience compelled to watch to see what happens next. Although a negative point would be that the film starts slowly and holds that pace for a while, but if you stick with it you will no doubt be more than satisfied ( because it does ""speed up""). I can honestly say that this film is a must-see but if blood & gore, violence , substance use and/or graphic sex scenes/nudity tend to bother you, i would undoubtedly advise against this movie. If you feel you can take it, you are in for the ride of a lifetime. I recommend this movie 110% !"

","Unless you have been living on the outlying tip of a remote island, under a pile of rocks, you may well of heard of the late Stieg Larsson and his Millennium book trilogy.<br/><br/>The books have been phenomenally successful, kick started a Swedish literary thriller bonanza and inspired three critically acclaimed and box office successful Swedish film versions, albeit subtitled for English speaking markets.<br/><br/>Whether there was a need for a remake, is largely irrelevant, Hollywood found many compelling arguments, one suspects with dollar signs on each and every one.<br/><br/>However, the first film arrives with an A list director, David Fincher and Daniel Craig reprising the part of Michael Blomkvist, a campaigning left leaning magazine journalist. Lisbeth Salander previously played by Noomi Rapace, has been replaced by the relatively unknown Rooney Mara, in a part ruthlessly pursued by many aspiring and established actresses.<br/><br/>Following a highly stylised and beautiful credit sequence, albeit seemingly disconnected to the story, we are plunged into the ""feel bad"" event movie of the year.<br/><br/>Licking his wounds after being on the wrong end of a libel suit, Blomkist and his ""Millennium"" magazine co-owner and on/off lover, Erika Berger (Robin Wright), decide their next move.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Henrik Vanger (Chrstopher Plummer) a retired CEO of one of the largest Swedish companies, continues to receive pressed flowers from the killer of his murdered Niece. Blomkist is called upon to investigate the murder, under the pretence of writing a history of the Vanger family. Initially reluctant, he realises this represents the perfect escape from the media spotlight, following his much publicised trial.<br/><br/>Relocated to the remote snowy wastes and the spectacularly dysfunctional extended Vanger family, he has his work is cut out for him. To help in this quest, he is eventually joined by arguably one of the most unusual and well written anti-heroines to grace the silver or indeed, any screen.<br/><br/>A pale, thin, motorcycling hacker with spiky hair, no social skills whatsoever, unashamedly bisexual, amoral, tattooed, much-studded and with a photographic memory. Lisbeth is the best investigator on the books of the firm hired to background check Blomkist, it is good to see Goran Vijnic on the screen again, as Lisbeth's long suffering boss.<br/><br/>To provide too much further detail of the plot would provide spoilers to those two or three people left in the world, who have not read the books or seen the previous films.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that the film stays true to the story, feel and tone of the books. The violence is strong but not graphic, rape scenes are featured but again are filmed in a non-sensational way and the events portrayed are very relevant to the story.<br/><br/>Craig makes for an excellent Blomkist, managing to effectively distance himself from James Bond in every way, even the way he walks is very different. Mara is as effective as Rapace was in the role, indifferent, caring, streetwise, childlike, a walking bundle of contradictions. If you follow the story further, her character's background is extensively explored. Budget of course allows for better set dressing and production values but the overall this is ultimately no better or worse than the original. Although the addition of English as the spoken language will please those with subtitle-phobia, which was the point of the exercise.<br/><br/>The story is set and filmed in Sweden, to do otherwise would have been foolhardy indeed. The snow adding to the sense of dread and foreboding in every frame. Christopher Plummer is his usual commanding self, it is a shame he does not get more screen-time due to the story.<br/><br/>There are many supporting players, all played by well respected character actors, including Skellan Skarsgard, Geraldine James, Joely Richardson and Stephen Berkoff.<br/><br/>Fincher has dialed back his usual directorial flourishes, this is a complicated story to compress and the script by Steve Zaillian has managed the job of presenting the initial rush of dry family information, perhaps even better than the book.<br/><br/>The film perhaps did not do as well as the studio had hoped but parts 2 and 3 have now been green-lit, so the full trilogy will work it's way to the screen over time. Which is a positive news, as the film does not deserve the fate of being the solo entry in the story.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A great story with fine performances makes for a solid well made dark thriller.<br/><br/>A long film but the time will slip past as you are drawn into the dark underbelly of a country few knew much about, before the recent explosion in Swedish thriller literature.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"
"room102","4","3","10","26 January 2012"," Just as Boring as the Swedish Version
","I didn't like the original movie and I don't like this remake either. Except for the main titles, which were cool, I found the entire movie boring, EXTREMELY long and very badly written (the entire plot is pretty useless and doesn't really lead to the revealed truth - and that's a bad psychology thriller/mystery writing). I had to FORCE myself to watch the movie. At the end, after over 2 hours, I finally cracked and started to fast forward.<br/><br/>I came to like Daniel Craig since I (re-)watched his impressive performance in The Jacket. However, I wasn't impressed by any of the cast members in this movie. I don't remember the original movie, so I can't compare Rooney Mara's performance to that of Noomi Rapace. It seemed to me like she's playing a ""simple"" depressed Emo girl, nothing more. The violent scene was indeed impressive in its shock value, but I don't think that alone deserves an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Like Tarsem Singh, I appreciate Fincher's style (although I wasn't impressed with his direction of ""The Social Network"" and ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""), but I don't connect to most of his movies. It seems to me like his fans (especially since ""The Social Network"") would eat anything he makes, even if it stinks to high heavens. Not to mention that the movie is over 2.5 hours long! Was it really necessary? Yeah, the original movie was also that long, but it doesn't justify the length of either of them.<br/><br/>3.5/10 Avoid"
"mako_chan7","3","3","10","6 January 2012"," A review from someone who did not read the book/see the original
","I had no idea what this movie was about. I remember seeing a short preview, and thought it looked interesting. My family saw this on Christmas Eve, instead of watching Tom Cruise in MI4. I seriously wish I had voted for Tom Cruise. At the end, there was the most awkward walk out of at the end, because everyone shuffled out in total silence.<br/><br/>This movie only has an R-rating, but that should be put into perspective. <br/><br/>The first R-rated movie I ever saw was 'The Faculty'. My cousin and I were 12, and we convinced our Grandma that our parents totally said we could watch it (they didn't). It was a little scary, and I think there was some shadowed nudity and decapitation. We had so much fun!<br/><br/>'Dragon Tattoo' is way more intense. Way more. I'm 24 now, and I was incredibly uncomfortable watching many of the scenes in this movie. The content is challenging as a topic, but the gruesome depiction is so much worse to deal with. You can't just turn it off and walk away. If some of it had been left to the imagination, I would have been much happier, and the story would not have suffered, in my opinion.<br/><br/>To sum up:<br/><br/>1) This movie is not going to be enjoyable for children (and some adults).<br/><br/>2) If you can get past that, the acting is good and the story is interesting.<br/><br/>3) If you can't get past that, but you still really want to see it, wait for it to come out on DVD/netflix/redbox, and just fast-forward!"

","I could tell, even before I saw it, that it was going to be a great movie, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>To me, David Fincher is one the best director on the planet, and it was great to see that he, yet again, has delivered an amazing movie.<br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, tells the story of Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who is in the midst of a court case with powerful business man, Hans Wennerstrom. Shortly after Mikael is contacted by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a Swedish industrialist, who offers him a job in searching for a killer from over 50 years prior. Soon after acquiring this job, Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to do research for the murder and together they discover that there is way more to the crime than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Of the movies from the Oscar season, none of them kept me as drawn in as Girl With the Dragon Tattoo did. The acting, the story, the score and the setting were all top notch.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist was done well. I've never seen Craig as a great James Bond, but playing an older man with evident vulnerabilities was much better suited for him. Rooney Mara, who was practically a nobody before this movie, turned up a performance that, to me, was worthy of the Oscar. I was a bigger of Rooney as Lisbeth Salander than Noomi Rapace (who was great in her own right, however). Rooney was great at portraying the victim in the earlier parts of the movie, and then made an amazing turnaround as an aggressive, take-charge woman. The rest of the cast was great, despite having less important roles, with an obvious stand-out being Stellan Skarsgard.<br/><br/>One thing that people may overlook when watching a movie is how much the score can improve a scene. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, just coming off Fincher's Social Network, turn in another score that fits with the movie and adds to scenes. The music in the final scene is absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>One thing Fincher has always been able to do in his movies is add his own charming touch and sense of humour to a extremely dark atmosphere. In GWTDT, he succeeds in this again, showing comedic moments in one of the darkest movies in recent memory.<br/><br/>It may be biased on my part, since I'm such a big fan of almost everyone involved in this movie, but it is truly a phenomenal film. Specific scenes may be to graphic to handle, and the overall feel of the film may be too grim for some, but it's one of the best serial killer movies ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Based on the Swedish film of the same name which I only watched half an hour of because it was so mind-numbingly boring.<br/><br/>This one was almost as boring, and it drags on for an agonizing three hours.<br/><br/>It doesn't help the film that the two principals don't meet until an hour and a quarter into it. It's like you are watching two movies that kind of crash into each other about halfway through, and the actions of a lot of the characters don't make a lick of sense.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is actually pretty good in this, not so much the female lead, who is unlikable as a character. The whole mystery plot is kind of dull. And just when you think it's over, nope, we have another 20 minutes of plot to go..."
"James_Callery","10","3","11","23 December 2011"," Worst Movie, Stick to the Original!!!
","For everyone who is about to read this and get excited over the fact that this movie is awful, I have a delightful surprise! I'm hoping those of you who clicked this to agree with me actually read this review because I have something different to say.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely fantastic. I saw the Swedish version immediately after reading ALL 3 BOOKS, and I liked their take on the first book. The last 2 movies they made were boring as hell and had no thrill to them whatsoever.<br/><br/>However, this David Fincher flick is SWEET! Right from the opening credits, you're immersed in a tech-trance of wonder. The opening credits show glimpses of angry hornets and fires blazing, obviously pointing out the fact that Fincher is game for the next 2 adaptations.<br/><br/>Every aspect of this movie had me engaged and extremely entertained. I didn't see the Swedish version on the big screens, but I listened to it with my lovely Bose headphones, and the score was simply unimpressive when compared to the American version.<br/><br/>Fincher's take on Blomkvist and Salander are superb. Mikael is not just Daniel Craig pumping out his normal demeanor and smooth accent. He is an actual character that you are interested in! You want to know why he is able to shag the wife of his co-worker, and continue to use his charm to attract even the most unlikely candidates-Lisbeth.<br/><br/>Lisbeth is purely the main character, and those who haven't read the books still get a good idea of her almost-soulless attitude. Her character is expressed beautifully. The toughest scenes (if you read the book you would know) seem to come naturally to Rooney. It's as though Salander were a real person and Rooney studied with her for 2 years in Sweden.<br/><br/>As for the mystery aspect of it, some may be able to figure out the ending from the beginning if they have some weird NCIS instinct. However, I know that there were details I forgot from the book that Fincher encompassed perfectly in his take.<br/><br/>If you are heart-set on the Swedish version, and rate this movie poorly, shame on you. The boring Millennium-centered dialogue that fill the Swedish version are drastically cut back. In fact, I don't believe they spent more than 2 or 3 scenes inside Millennium. If you care about movies continuing to be spectacular, then go see this movie. Compare it to the Swedish version for all I care, but understand that there is no way this movie deserves anything less than 6/10. I give it 10/10, where I would rate the book version a 9/10 had I the ability to compare."

","I decided to watch this movie twice because I couldn't quite decide weather this or the Swedish original were better. After a second viewing I must say that this is probably one of the only cases in which an American remake of a foreign language film rivals or is in fact better than the original.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross prove that their score from ""The Social Network"" wasn't just a fluke, Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara's performances are superb.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to pretty much everyone, although to content may be disturbing to some viewers."
"calebisastud","9","2","6","14 February 2014"," Better than the Original
","I would give this film about a 93%. Solid, grade A material. David Fincher continuing his dependable resume' of quality film-making. It's no wonder that our next Batman - AFLAC !! ... I mean Afleck - is mentoring under Fincher. Better than the original.<br/><br/>Now to begin, I need to point out how awesome the original Swedish trilogy is. Subtle, quiet, tense, amazing acting, great editing and photography. I would probably give it an 89%. B+. But give the reins to Fincher, and the guy just knows how to make it even better, as well as the almost impossible task of making it unique, which he seems to do with ease. The guy should write the book on Directing.<br/><br/>Now, this might sound like verbal fellatio but for those of us who RELISH the details, the camera angles, the color schemes, the production design, the art direction, the COMPELLING score (by kick-ass Trent and Atticus duo) ... it becomes clear that the man behind the Best Picture nominee ""Social Network"" is a true A-List heavyweight. Just watching the DSH, it is so clear how Fincher can turn out quality like a Mercedes-Benz factory. His attention to detail is nigh unparalleled. His endless ideas, perspectives, and experience are the compass that keeps this HIGH-STAKES project on course.<br/><br/>Now, on to the star of the film, little-known (at the time) Rooney Mara, mostly-known as Erica Albright that dumped Mark Zuckerberg's ass in the brilliant opening scene of ""Social Network"" for being ""an asshole."" How much can be said about Patricia Rooney Mara? Her auditioning for the part took months. She completely transformed her image without ANY insurance that she had been cast. Multiple piercings (ACTUAL new piercings), shaved head, dyed hair, bleached eyebrows, and a well-done Swedish dialect. No doubt, a well-deserved Oscar nom (of which I REALLY wish she would have won). Her performance was so riveting, I hated the scenes where she was not involved. There is absolutely no room here to say she didn't give this film everything she could have. A chipped tooth, extensive bruising, and a brutal rape scene are just a few examples.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig really turns in a solid, non-pretentious performance without resembling any of his Bond-antics or previous films. Christopher Plummer is solid, Robin Wright is solid, and so is the duplicitous Stellan Skarsgard.<br/><br/>Few remakes surpass the legacy of the original. Chuck Heston's Ben Hur was indisputable, McTiernan's Thomas Crown was brilliant, and the Coen Brothers' True Grit was gorgeous. Fincher's work earns a spot on this exclusive list.<br/><br/>Bring a cup of coffee, though, as Fincher thought to do the brilliant Larsson masterpiece some justice by making it a 2 hour and 42 minute flick."
"CinemaClown","Null","2","6","8 October 2013"," A Rare Example of A Hollywood Remake Done Right.
","It's not very often that you come across a Hollywood remake that's almost as amazing as the original film & in that particular aspect, David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a winner. Dark, brutal, sinister yet intensely engaging & viciously entertaining, the film is crafted with sublime aggressiveness from start to finish & also marks Fincher's return to the genre he does better than anyone else.<br/><br/>Based on Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo concerns Mikael Blomkvist; a disgraced journalist who's hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance & assumed murder of his grandniece, which happened 40 years ago. As he delves deeper into the family's history & tries to connect the dots, he recruits the help of Lisbeth Salander; a young computer hacker who has dark secrets of her own.<br/><br/>Ingeniously directed by David Fincher, the first impression is made in the opening moments only for the title sequence is a work of marvellous creativity, which puts the viewers in just the right mood for the dark journey that lies ahead. Screenplay is penned down by Steven Zaillian, who does a good job in providing a cohesive structure to the whole plot, keeps it faithful enough to its source material & also handles the characterization part pretty well.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, Fincher's version of the first chapter in the Millennium Trilogy is far superior to its Swedish counterpart in every manner. Set pieces are painstakingly detailed, Cinematography makes precise use of colour tones, camera-work, detailing & lighting, Editing is smoothly carried out, and the unsettling score by Trent Reznor & Atticus Rose perfectly captures the ominous ambiance of the story with its eerie tracks.<br/><br/>As far as performances go, the film features a reliable cast in Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Christopher Plummer & others, with Craig & Mara impressing the most. Craig never lets his James Bond persona affect his performance here & is very convincing as Blomkvist while Mara is a revelation in the coveted role of Lisbeth Salander, is easily the strongest character in the film & her on-screen chemistry with Craig is instantly likable.<br/><br/>Compared to the Swedish film adaptation, I've to say that this one is slightly inferior in its overall impact. The violence in the original was far more emotionally affecting, and even Noomi Rapace was a better Lisbeth than Mara is, though by no means does it mean I didn't love the latter's performance. Where this remake triumphs is in providing a far better visual & sound design but it never really brings anything new in the storytelling department.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo plays remarkably well to David Fincher's strengths & by every means is an English-language remake done right, despite the few nitpicks. The character of Lisbeth alone is enough to keep you invested into its dark story & the unflinching portrayal of its disturbing themes also works out in its favour. Definitely worth a shot, this fascinating meditation on evil comes highly recommended."

Why would the investigator be so bumbling to get discovered - then go back into the house? How did Lisabeth get into the dungeon to save the day? The double doors and key card access were explicitly pointed out. <br/><br/>After that, all the exotica about the disguise and bank transfers and then school girl disappointment dragged on and on. Apparently there will be a sequel.<br/><br/>The idea that the missing girl moved to London and grew up and became a successful banking professional - under an assumed name - BUT still part of the family??

"brunowangtaiwan","10","2","6","7 July 2012"," Dark & Suspenseful, Unique From The European Film
","The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is the American adaptation of the Swedish novel written by Steig Larsson. It follows the successful trilogy of Swedish films based on the popular ""Millennium"" book trilogy that includes, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest.<br/><br/>The original Millennium book is literally titled ""Men Who Hate Women"" and the themes of the film are dark and deeply disturbing...including graphic accounts of sadism, rape and murder. Intertwined with this overshadowing theme is a brilliant mystery and psychological thriller. The story centers around journalist Mikael Blomqvist who is forced to take leave from Millennium magazine after a disgraceful libel suit goes against him. Shortly after receiving a jail sentence and fine for libel, Blomqvist (played by Daniel Craig) is hired by one of Sweden's wealthiest business tycoons, Henrik Vanger. Vanger hires Blomqvist to try to solve a 40 year old murder mystery involving his niece Harriet. <br/><br/>The 'girl,' Lisbeth Salander, is played by Rooney Mara. Salander is hired by Vanger to do background research on Blomqvist prior to his hiring by Henrik. Salander is a computer hacker, extremely brilliant and also an abused and abandoned ward of the state. During the course of his investigations, Blomqvist finds out that Salander provided intel on him to Vanger and he hires her to work with him to help solve the case of the murdered girl. <br/><br/>What Salander and Blomqvist discover is the Vanger family has a dark and sordid past and they eventually uncover that certain Vanger family members were involved in brutal, ritualistic serial murders involving young women. The movie is very graphic in its presentation of sexual themes and violence. It is also clear to the viewer that Salander has experienced her own severe emotional trauma - which ultimately leads to her being a champion of the film and a champion of women. <br/><br/>Where the American version deviates from the European version is in the depth of the characters themselves. The American film is much more like a very dark DaVinci code, with some major twists and turns in the plot line and some decent action sequences. This does not make the American version better or worse than the European version...quite the contrary. The plot twists in the 2011 release are very refreshing and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. So, while it delivers in terms of sheer suspense and 'good story telling,' it lacks in the sense of giving us more background on the characters themselves and what really makes them tick. In the American version, Salander is more of a robotic heroine for women, versus the European version where she is much more complex and emotional. <br/><br/>The main theme is that of the hero, Salander, and her ability, along with Blomqvist, to piece together clues in order to solve a four decade murder mystery involving the deaths of young women. Rooney Mara turns in an Oscar-winning performance on all levels. <br/><br/>I give this film a Bruno Wang 4.5 out of 5 stars. It is an incredibly gripping film, albeit at times very disturbing imagery. The smart and sophisticated plot twists keep you guessing at 'who done it' and the action and suspense are superb. In my opinion they could have added the same depth of character building that the European version does and it would have really rounded out this film."

","I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie at the beginning. The film was gray and had a murky quality, and the first characters I saw were too understated and a little mumbly. I was also a little unclear as to what was happening at first.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed, it became a little more interesting. It became darker. Then it introduced a mystery, which made somewhat centered it. Then it got much darker still. <br/><br/>As the movie moved along, I was increasingly drawn in. Many of the things that had initially put me off - Daniel Craig's understated performance, the deliberate pacing, the oppressive, almost monochromatic style - started to fit together nicely.<br/><br/>The movie winds up working for a number of different reasons. The dragon-tattoo girl is an intriguing character who has most of the best scenes in the movie. The mystery is well done (although it follows a not-unusual mystery-book path) and the movie does a nice job of making slogging through old documents interesting, mainly by focusing on photographic evidence. The movie extends in both directions past the mystery itself, which makes the characters more than just detectives.<br/><br/>While it probably took me a half hour before I was sure I was going to stick with the movie, by the end I was ready for the sequel."

"Caps Fan","8","2","6","16 May 2012"," Surprisingly good
","I must admit that, when I heard they were making a ""Hollywood"" version of the Swedish film of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I groaned. Another original ruined. Though the trailer looked promising and Daniel Craig struck me as ideal for the male lead, I settled down to watch it with some reserve. <br/><br/>No need. In many respects, it is a substantial improvement. The acting is better, the sets somehow work better, and the soundtrack is appropriate. Best of all, however, is that they stick closely to the original plot, including the very end, which, for some reason, the Swedish version missed off.<br/><br/>Those who have read the book and seen the original film will know that they both include some rather graphic scenes of sexual violence. Since the English-speaking peoples tend to be a bit more prudish about these things than the Swedes, I had been curious to see how they would be handled. The answer is, not badly. Though the worst of the violence is not shown, we are left in no doubt about what's happening. Even better, one crucial scene, where Lisbeth turns the tables on her tormentor, is shown more or less in full. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig's performance as Blomqvist is excellent, but he is not alone. Rooney Mara is a revelation as Lisbeth. Both are given sterling support by Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer, and an array of other performers. They handle the well-scripted dialog with conviction; I particularly enjoyed the exchange between Blomqvist and Lisbeth about the string of Bible-related murders, which shows the girl whose disappearance Blomqvist was called in to investigate is just part of a much bigger, nastier picture. <br/><br/>Such trimming as was made was mostly well judged. In the original, the disappeared girl is found in Australia, but here they settle for London, merging her fate with her sister's. The legal case Blomqvist was involved with when we first see him is not omitted, but its importance is reduced, removing something I felt was a bit of a distraction in the book and the Swedish film. <br/><br/>A very creditable job all round then. Having seen all three Swedish films, I'm now actually looking forward to the remaining English-language remakes.<br/><br/>Rating: A pleased 8/10."

""The daughter of a priest, if she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father. She shall be burned with fire"". Hence, a reenactment of this bible passage from Leviticus 21:9 is inflicted upon a women's body. Every woman that is murdered is given a biblical reference linked to her killing. The role of justice and judgment is brought to the audience's attention throughout the film as well. Lisbeth is judged and misjudged by everyone who meets her. Her unique haircut, edgy make-up, and striking tattoos cause many people to jump back. She is mistreated by the social welfare system and in term brings justice to herself by taking matters into her own hands. The man who is in charge of monitoring Lisbeth, forced oral sex and rape upon her. She in turn secretly films the entire rendezvous, and uses it as leverage against him. She also tattoos his stomach with nasty suggestive words and tells him he is not allowed to see any other women. Like a God-like figure, Lisbeth tells him that she will be watching at all times and know when he disobeys her. She lets him know that punishment will fall upon him if he does. Through a 'vicarious lens', we as the audience believe what Lisbeth says to be true and fear her wrath as well. The narrative elements including the character, plot, point of view, and atmosphere all worked their way into the film and meshed fluidly. Even when graphic images are placed onto the screen, it is presented in a way that makes the audience still watch and not turn away."
"y-323","8","2","6","9 February 2012"," Very exciting thriller
","The most shocking movie I've seen recently is ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with Daniel Craig produced by Colombia Pictures. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is based on the famous novel which has a huge fan base. The movie is directed by David Fincher, and the screenplay is written by Steven Zaillian. It was released on December 20, 2011 in North America. <br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is the co-owner of ""Millennium"" magazine and is hired by Henrik Vanger who is the retired CEO of Vanger industries. Henrik asks him to find his niece, Harriet Vanger, who went missing 40 years ago. Blomkvist moves to a cottage on a remote island and starts to investigate. He visits Harriet's closest relative, Anita in London, but she don't help him. <br/><br/>In the meantime, Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is hired by Blomkvist to help his investigation. Although she is under legal guardianship due to mental problems, she has a very high level of technical skills as a computer research and hacker. Blomkvist finds out suspicious girls names and 5 digit numbers, and they indicate Bible verses. Salander investigates and notices that murdered women are located in the places where Gottfried, Harriet's father, was on business trips. Also, she finds that Gottfried's son Martin, current owner of Vanger, and brother of Harriet, has become a murderer like his father. The family belonged to the Swedish Nazi Party before, and Gottfried and Martin had mainly killed Jewish women. While Blomkvist is searching Martin's house, Martin catches and tries to kill him. Salander rescues him. They think Harriet might be alive. Actually, Harriet killed her father and escaped from her brother because of sexual abuse. She had used Anita's identification to completely vanish. After Martin's death, Harriet visits her uncle Henrik who is looking for her. <br/><br/>The genre is mystery, thriller, suspense, and drama. The background, a remote island where only the Vanger family lives, enhances the thrill. Also, a vanished girl in an isolated island makes it more mysterious like the movie ""Shutter Island"". It contains lots of sexual and violent content and deals with sexual abuse. In my opinion, there are some scenes which are disturbing, shocking and that were unnecessary. The scenes where the new guardian of Salander, Nils Bjurman, rapes Salander, and she later gets revenge on him.<br/><br/>The acting of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara was very well-done. Especially, Rooney Mara looks like Lisbeth Salander. She is completely different from her movie ""Tanner Hall"" where she acted as Fernanda, a shy and studious girl. Since it is based on a novel, the plot is very well organized, and directing is flawless."
"ishtapaz","10","2","6","5 February 2012"," Maybe if I knew Swedish then I won't say it is better than the original one
","I have watched the original one but have not read the book. I've also lived in Sweden. I was apprehensive that it will be an English-i-fied, the way that you expect when Hollywood tells stories of various European epics, stories etc. Well this was not, Daniel did not have to have an affected Scandinavian accent -- except for Rooney and Robin Wright maybe. Nevertheless, the story was really told well.<br/><br/>This rendition is more dramatic because Rooney evokes more vulnerability than the original actress Noomi and maybe because it is in English it is easy to internalize the plot. I think the opening montage is ridiculous. Totally out of context for the movie, very James Bond 007 like and stupid but of course does not take away from the performance of everyone in the film. personally - I'd rather have the original actor Michael Nyqvist than Daniel.<br/><br/>It is worth seeing even though it is not as stoic as a you'd expect in a typical Swedish movie but has the direct yet complex undertone of the Scandinavian psyche."
"evanston_dad","7","2","6","20 January 2012"," Fincher Style to Spare, But Terrible Material
","I've not read the book on which David Fincher's newest movie is based, and after seeing the adaptation I certainly don't want to. For it's obvious, even to someone who hasn't read it, that Fincher and company are fighting an up-hill battle against borderline terrible material.<br/><br/>That material is all about perversion, sadism, torture, murder, and it's particularly occupied with all of the horrible ways in which men can victimize women. It's the kind of story in which the serial killer gets caught and then delivers a lengthy soliloquy directly to the main protagonist so that the audience can be bluntly told what the writer wasn't creative enough to tell us in any other way and another character can swoop in in the nick of time and stop the serial killer from killing our hero.<br/><br/>But Fincher's talents as a director are considerable, as are those of his cast, and the film is pretty entertaining up to a point. But it goes of for far too long, there are one too many story lines, and the material becomes too preposterous to bear. What the film has going for it is the performance of Rooney Mara, sensational as the titular character. Though the film treats her character like crap, Mara herself is hypnotic and carries the film, no small feat given that she by no means has the most screen time (that honor belongs to Daniel Craig, also very good). The incessant violence against women is hard to take after a point -- the story isn't smart enough to make any commentary about that violence, so it just comes to feel uncomfortably gratuitous.<br/><br/>One bit of unequivocal praise I can offer this film -- I doubt I will see as kick-ass an opening credits sequence in any other movie this year.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"paytonprovo","7","2","6","15 January 2012"," Fenominal
","Where do I start, the movie was amazing. Daniel Craig was great and Rooney Mara put on one of the best performances I've seen in a while. The plot was great, David Fincher is my favorite directors. There were many subplots that made the characters what they were and who they were. It definitely was a detective movie that showed how they found information. I think that how they had the family made a comical touch. I believe this is a best motion picture and it should win. There was good suspense and action and I love the part where the serial killer is revealed. I'm not going to spoil the movie for anyone because this is worth going to the movies and then buying it on DVD. I want to see David Fincher make the other 2 movies because this was fenominal."
"Troy_Campbell","9","2","6","14 January 2012"," An unrelenting and intense thriller; another Fincher masterpiece.
","Those that thought David Fincher couldn't pull off the impossible ‚Äì creating a worthy remake of the much loved Swedish Dragon Tattoo only two years after it itself was released ‚Äì thought wrong. Fincher has added another indelibly powerful body of work to his already amazing CV; somewhere above Panic Room and Benjamin Button but slightly below Zodiac, Seven, Fight Club and The Social Network. With a tone-setting opening credits sequence ‚Äì one of the best I've ever witnessed ‚Äì and a darkly atmospheric score by regular collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch, the U.S. TGWTDT is an unrelenting and intense thriller that had me on the edge of my seat despite knowing the bulk of the narrative twists and turns (some of which have been altered from the original). But what of the cast you ask? Well, comparing the new and old portrayals of the titular inked female ‚Äì by Rooney Mara and Noomi Rapace respectively ‚Äì doesn't generate a clear winner, only how different they actually are. Where Rapace played it physically stronger, mentally clearer and emotionally detached, Mara is less physically imposing, mentally weaker but emotionally more in control. Daniel Craig on the other hand is a much more engaging Blomkvist than Michael Nyqvist, and, most importantly, the chemistry he shares with Mara is more convincing and tangible than that of the Swede duo. This really is the ""feel bad movie of the year"" that the posters suggested thanks to the impressive cast and crew, and one that will have both fans and newcomers enthralled."

","Directing 9/10- Unique and almost trippy shots, that superbly mastered an eerie sense to the film. Not Oscar worthy, but well done. Acting 10/10- Everyone in this film was fantastic, everyone. Mara, Skarsgard, and Plummer(despite lack of screen time) gave academy award nomination worthy performances, and Mara may deserve a win. Screenplay 8/10- I don't like giving films based on other materials perfect scores so an 8 is the best I can do here. Clearly it is unoriginal but with reading the book I can say they did an excellent job transferring it to the big screen. Visual Effects 7/10- Visually, the most remember-able sequence was the opening credits. Well done visuals, nothing to write home about, but solid job done.

","I thought the Swedish Movie was outstanding. Wanted to see what Hollywood could do to make it better. Well I was surprised. I still think Noomi Rapace who plays Lisbeth in the Swedish version did a great job. However the US version is a great work, very close to the book, well directed well edited. Mara Rooney transformed Lisbeth into the Lisbeth of the book. So if you have read the book and seen the Swedish version and you like both of them then you will like the movie. I can see this being a classic and I can't wait to see the next 2 movies. Craig does his part very well.. But the star of the movie and the leading person really has to be Mara."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","6","10 January 2012"," Broken Hero Rises
","Director David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is amazing. Rooney Mara is awesome as the Girl with the tattoo. She is a star. Mara inhabits Stieg Larsson's anti-hero hero Lisbeth Salander. ""The Girls with the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best movies of the year. My bud Neil cautioned me that the movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes, and slow in the beginning‚Äîto set up the context, and worth it. Daniel Craig is unrecognizably physically vulnerable and compelling as Mikael. I think Craig is the most threatening physical presence as James Bond; this is distinct contrast. He plays the tarnished writer seeking redemption, researching a 40 year-old murder of the cryptically dysfunctional Vanger family. Jeff Cronenweth's striking cinematography captures the existential bleakness. Trent Reznor's innovative score lyrically balances the foreboding narrative.<br/><br/>Fincher gravitates toward the darker lurid human crevices. I squirmed watching his shockingly explicit sodomy scene. This derives from the source material. From one point of view, the pivotal character arc for Lisbeth forges familiar rage and calculated retribution. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" gleans on the surface unsavory‚Äîserial murder, and the aftermath of physical and sexual abuse. I was initially puzzled by Fincher's remake of movies based on Larsson's novels which were acclaimed. Fincher triumphs and his vision warranted. He exquisitely underlies the virtue of humanity amidst its brutal inhumanity.<br/><br/>Set in the austere winter of Stockholm, Lisbeth is the tortured Goth savant researcher on retainer to an international security firm. Mara with Lisbeth's facial and body piercings, tattoos, and spiked black hair is not your typical corporate researcher. She is the genius biker computer hacker with both photographic and auditory memory. Fincher has subtle reveal as Lisbeth memorizes the door security code as she strolls by an apartment.<br/><br/>Fincher, Mara and Steven Zaillian's screenplay hint at the haunting possible abuse that shrouds Lisbeth's past‚Äîshe suppresses great fear and anger displaying compartmentalized focus. In a glimpse into her rage, Lisbeth brutally beats a robber with her kickboxing skills. I have been watching a lot of Dr. Drew. Apparently, a ward of the state, Lisbeth is a loner spending her time eating micro-waved cup noodles, while immersed in her cyber research tasks. One of those subjects was Mikael (Craig). Though apparent recluse, Lisbeth seeks out both men and women as lovers. Mara is magnetic. Lisbeth had a beloved guardian, who suffered a stroke. Her current guardian is creepy attorney Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), who leverages appalling favors from Lisbeth to access her family money.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) is the disgraced financial journalist losing a libel case and his fortune to businessman Wennerstrom (slick charming Ulf Friberg). He is co-owner of Millennium magazine with his lover Erika Berger (strong Robin Wright)‚Äîboth are married, to other partners. He has a grown daughter. Mikael resigns. Meanwhile, Frode (menacing Steven Berkoff), the family attorney for Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), patriarch of Vanger Industries, contacts Mikael with a curious offer. Plummer is brilliantly controlling and charismatic as the suffering Henrik. Every year he receives a pressed flower from anonymous sender. His niece Harriet had always sent him this gift; however, he believes she was murdered over 40 years ago when she vanished in 1966. She was 16 years old. Henrik wants Mikael to find the person, who murdered Harriet, who he believes is family. In return, he will pay handsomely and give Mikael critical information. Harriet's brother Martin (icy cool Stellan Skarsgard) is the smart and measured man, who is now CEO of Vanger Industries. Mikael lives in a cottage on the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island and operates under the guise of writing a Vanger biography. Mikael soon discovers the depth of the Vanger family dysfunction.<br/><br/>Frode ironically connects Mikael with Lisbeth to further his research which is at an impasse. They know their own personal connection. Mikael says, ""I want you to help me catch a killer of women."" Their lives intersect and the twisted journey spirals down the dark path. Thankfully, there is light. Rooney Mara is powerful as the broken hero. Daniel Craig is amazing as the compassionate partner. Mara and Craig are such amazing actors, who capture fear, sadness, and surprise in their eyes. David Fincher tells the hero's story with graceful triumphs and muted losses. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is awesome."

"daddyofduke","8","2","6","6 January 2012"," Why I Am In Love with The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo
","I love the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I've read all three of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo novels, seen all three Swedish films twice, and have recently seen the American version of the first film. I understand that the two American sequels are well on their way. I'll see them as well. All of the films are excellent, and I enjoyed them thoroughly.<br/><br/>There has already been a ton of discussion about the films' merits, defects, perspectives, intensity, violence, etc. I don't think I could add any meaningful insight to what has already been written. So, I will do what I do best and not even try.<br/><br/>With the exception of my second ex-wife, I like women. I enjoy being around them. Despite my two divorces, I prefer long term relationships, although I do fantasize about 20 year sexpots. Those fantasies are laughable considering my three heart attacks, but I have them nonetheless. I say this just so you know where I'm coming from in terms of women.<br/><br/>I have always found women who think on their own very attractive. There is no question that the character, Lisbeth Salander, thinks, speaks, and more often doesn't speak, without reservation. Because I would like this essay to be published, I won't repeat the wording of one of her t-shirts in the American version of the film. Suffice it to say it uses the f-word a lot. That's how she is, take it or leave it.<br/><br/>As you have probably heard or read by now, Lisbeth suffers a particularly grotesque rape. She is indeed a victim, but she is not victimized. She gets even, simply. My God, does she get even. But her revenge is so straight forward and business-like that she would make Michael Corleone proud. She does not expend much energy feeling sorry for herself, even though she is more than justified to do so, considering what she endured.<br/><br/>Indeed, to paraphrase William Faulkner, Lisbeth Salander does not merely endure, she prevails. Her life is ultimately better emotionally and financially after her rape than before it as a direct result of what she elects to do. Her revenge is well designed, well planned, and brilliantly executed. And as you will see in the future movies, Lisbeth is not at all selfish for whom she seeks revenge. <br/><br/>And yet Lisbeth doesn't gloat. Or complain. Rather, she is and she does. Period. I wish I could be like that. Take a look at what she does when she is attacked by some street thugs. They sure won't attack her anymore. And, after a fleeting moment of angst because her beloved computer is ruined in the violent assault, she immediately get back on track and does what she has to do to get a new computer.<br/><br/>Lisbeth Salander is courageous. Consider what she does in Martin's basement when she rescues Michael (Blomqvist, not Corleone.) I also very much appreciate what she didn't do when Martin crashed his SUV. And she certainly isn't afraid to initiate sex, as evidenced by what she does with Michael and with Miriam Wu.<br/><br/>There is no question that Lisbeth is intelligent. In fact, she is a genius. She analyzes as well as processes information instantly. It's one thing to have a photographic memory, which Ms. Salander clearly has. It's quite another to be able to decipher, collate and correlate information precisely, and that is exactly what this young woman can and does do. She is extremely organized in a disheveled sort of way. <br/><br/>As anti-social as Lisbeth appears to be (but really isn't, in my opinion), she is loyal to those she loves. Consider her relationship with her original guardian, Palmgren, or her mother, or for that matter, Michael. <br/><br/>Incidentally, I've read that the character Lisbeth Salander is based on what the novels' author, Stieg Larrson, thought an adult Pippi Longstocking would be like. <br/><br/>For all these reasons I love Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>Plus she looks great in black."
"Jack_Skelly","8","2","6","1 January 2012"," ""It is better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach""
","The above quote is used only once in the movie, but it ironically sets the tone for the entire film.<br/><br/>""Dragon Tattoo"" has a strong chance of being the most memorable adaptation of a book since Harry Potter. David Fincher's follow up to ""The Social Network"" is nothing short of a terrifically terrible roller coaster ride of unpredictability. <br/><br/>As far as acting goes, Daniel Craig and Chris Plummer gave their usual stellar performances. The shining star, however, was obviously Rooney Mara, who gave a downright chilling performance. Aside from her Oscar-worthy acting, the fact that she was willing to change her body so drastically for this role says a lot about her character. She isn't here to be another role model or sex symbol, but she is here to be what many Hollywood stars are drawn away from being: a damn good actress. We have without a doubt not seen the last of Mara.<br/><br/>This movie was able to take a simple mystery case and turn it into the most interesting movie of the season. Be warned, however, for as the quote suggests, it is also one of the most brutally graphic movies of the year. The scenes are so captivating, however, that you may not even remember that you are surrounded by other people anyway. However, it is still not by any means a family/date movie. Be very selective while deciding who you see this one with."

"katie-sirles","8","2","6","30 December 2011"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","Based on the novel by Stieg Larsson, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO follows Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist, a co-owner and writer at Millennium Magazine. Mikael seeks to escape the public eye for a while after a blunder of epic proportions. Lucky for him, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) is looking for someone to write his memoirs. Oh, and to uncover the mysterious death of his great-niece Harriet Vanger. How does Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) tie into all of this? Well, if you're like me and you never read books that movies are based on you might not know. Lisbeth is enlisted to do a background check on Mikael before Henrik will take him on. Blomkvist is involved with his married colleague at the magazine, Erika Berger (Robin Wright ‚Äì who, by the way, looks like an old catcher's mitt these days) and with a world of trouble on his shoulders, he ventures out to the island. When he realizes that he is getting in over his head, he insists that he be given a research assistant. He gets the brilliant mind of Lisbeth to assist in all of his research needs.<br/><br/>Now that we're all on the same page, let's talk about how excited I was for the last month and a half. My suspicions were that because David Fincher (The Social Network) was behind this film with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on the turntables, this movie was going to ‚Äî for lack of a better term ‚Äî blow my mind. The story is an excellent one. Intriguing, smart, well done. However, I was not as impressed as I was with, say, THE SOCIAL NETWORK. Now, this is apples and oranges, really, because the two movies are entirely different in nature. So why was I checking my phone in the theater? Why did I leave to go to the bathroom when I didn't even have to go that bad? Perhaps it was the extra 45 minutes of unnecessary movie in there that turned me off. It is always a bad sign when an avid moviegoer like me takes a cellphone out or leaves the theater for any reason during the film. I have risked my ability to bear children more than once because a movie was so compelling that I couldn't tear myself away for as long as it took to use the facilities. I did both of those things last night.<br/><br/>The movie starts off strong. It is ominous and leaves the audience wondering. Always wondering. What is the story here? Who killed Harriet? Why do rich families always have these deep, dark secrets? I'm just saying, if I had my own island and a beautiful mansion to live in on that island, I would be too busy dancing the dance of joy to even think about sinister plots and things of the like. But then my life wouldn't make for good movie material.<br/><br/>When the film is introducing the two main characters to us, some light is shed on the troubling life of Lisbeth Salander. After her legal guardian suffers a stroke, Lisbeth is appointed a lawyer by the state. Nils Bjurman takes over Lisbeth's finances and does things to her that even my desensitized mind was bothered by. Forced fellatio and sodomy (the WORST kind) top the list. He's just a creeper in every way. Putting Lisbeth on an allowance system and then forcing himself on her when she needs money for a new laptop, making fun of her eyebrow piercing. Don't worry, though. He gets his comeuppance in a big way.<br/><br/>The movie is fine. It really is. It's just that extra time they didn't need to have in there. Even the sad kids with the skinny jeans and the wacky hair-dos next to me in the theater agreed that it was too long. I don't think it is hard to over do it in a picture like this one. There is so much story to be told and only so many frames to tell it. David Fincher can make a great movie. I think that with this one it was just a matter of trimming the fat a bit. The acting is superb. Rooney Mara is excellent. Daniel Craig was even good. Christopher Plummer is sublime, but that goes without saying. Next time let's just leave out all of the extra bits, eh?"
"darkrisingk5","7","2","6","29 December 2011"," Excellent story line; overwhelming visuals.
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of those films that I went into blindly. I knew nothing from previews and nothing from novels. I had no expectations and no bias going into the theater. That said, I found the writing phenomenal! I was amazed at the writers/directors ability to run two parallel story lines for the majority of the film and somehow have them merge seamlessly as one. Well thought out, suspenseful, well executed story. <br/><br/>Cinematics were also mind blowing as far as composition is concerned. However, I found the sexual violence within the movie to be emotionally overwhelming and at times distracting from the film itself. Some portions so graphic that I actually could not watch and felt the need to leave the theater momentarily. I fought that urge and stayed to watch. Looking back on those scenes, the information gained from them may have been important in knowing more about the characters, but not necessary to convey the plot. I could have done without them. <br/><br/>The films length was brutal. I found myself loathing the final scene due to its slow build and ultimately dissatisfying ending. Those additional 15-20 minutes could have been cut, resulting in a much more satisfying experience in my eyes. However, the ending DID make me go out and buy the books so that I can find out more; it did leave me wondering and I guess that was the point. <br/><br/>All in all, an exceptional film that takes a few things a little too far, resulting in a less than 10 star rating for me. However, I would certainly recommend seeing the film as I believe it will become a classic series somewhere down the road."
"rjc722","7","2","6","29 December 2011"," Long...but entertaining
","A film of this magnitude always runs the risk of over-hype. Fortunately, TGWTDT lives somewhat up to it. I can't say that all its 158 running time is worth it, but enough of it is. Of course films based on books always come to the screen with pre-conceived notions. In this case there's not only a book written by Stieg Larsson¬Öbut a previous film to follow. This is never an easy challenge but director David Fincher seems to have welcomed it with open arms.<br/><br/>The film's basic plot centers on the forty year old disappearance of the niece of rich and eccentric industrialist Henrik Vanger played handsomely by Christopher Plummer. After hiring recently humiliated journalist and amateur sleuth Mikael Blomkvist, played by Daniel Craig, we learn little by little about Plummer's family tree¬Öfilled of course with weird and rotten apples. Intercutting nicely with the detective portion of the film is the parallel story line of the title character¬ÖLisbeth Salander played by an unrecognizable Rooney Mara. After finding out Salander was initially hired to do a background check on Blomkvist before being hired by Vanger, we follow her life which includes computer hacking, beating up street punks and reporting to her new court appointed guardian. This of course leads to the films most graphic and talked about scenes which include forced sexually favors and rape. While this is going on Blomkvist soon discovers that the missing niece may in fact be the victim of a serial killer and requests a research assistant. Naturally who better then the girl who researched him and the meeting of the two main characters finally comes full circle. Once together Blomkvist and Salander work well as a modern day and unconventional Nick and Nora Charles to both find the serial killer and discover the mystery of the missing niece. Along the way they also find some sexually affection and even have time to give another industrialist his comeuppance. Craig's performance shows intelligence coupled with a vulnerability that makes us forget that he's James Bond. Equally good is Rooney's Salander who obviously makes us forget she's the beautiful girl who unwittingly launched Facebook in Fincher's The Social Network. Speaking of Fincher, his style here is evident throughout with realistic violence balanced with beautifully shot flashbacks. The ending of the film is satisfying and naturally leaves itself open for a sequel¬ÖI just hope it will be a little shorter."

","Why did they make a stupid remake from boring story line and even after been made for many times, movies franchise and TV serial also? Moreover such foolish film gets high ratings too! Reason are here as me ;
1. Firstly movie is too lengthy which unnecessarily takes your more time to reach ending.
2. Daniel Craing (Mikael Blomkvist) and Rooney Mara ( Lisbeth) are totally misacted characters and wasted.
3. Various stories we can see in pieces of scenes alternately, so that we could not connect to any one of them.
4. Also hierarchy of Vanger family does not easily understandable i.e. one get difficult to know who is who?
5. No impressive climax.
6. Throughout half and more movie leading actors only searching and seeing photos, photos and photos only, they quickly get the clue from it and guess what was happened with whom, but viewers cannot use their brain so easily and quickly then failed eventually to connect the story.
7. Unnecessarily love making scenes which are really very boring and filmed like a porn movie.
8. Previous movie series ( Noomi Rapace starrer) was best and watchable.
9. Even in 2018 ( The Girl in Spider Web) is best thriller of Lisbeth Salander series.
I hate this movie. After wasting 2.38 hours I was disappointed with and had a heavy headache. Not recommended."

","30 April 2012. What makes perhaps for a great fictional crime thriller mystery novel doesn't make for a greatest film adaptation except maybe for a politically correct feel good statement in the guise of artistic creativity. Who for instance would even cooperate with such a young punkish female with no social grace none whatsoever? Though amazing and somewhat suspicious transformation occurs by the end of the movie. The movie would have been much more compelling if the repulsive reactive behavior of those associating with this girl would have been on display and her ability or her surrogate more likely were able to negotiate their way around this antisocial demeanor and obtain the necessary investigative facts upon which this amazing mental talent of a girl could then synthesize such facts into an incredible criminal deductive conclusion, much like Sherlock Holmes and his cocaine habit - What a genuinely valuable script and performance that would have been. What one does get is the almost predictable techno-blackmail scenario in the movie as perhaps the only fascinating and somewhat credible social interactive scene in the movie with the girl in another political statement. What one has however is this anti-heroine nominated for best actress Oscar who supposedly gets our critical sympathy and yet authentically and realistically speaking her amazing investigative ability notwithstanding, it's implausible she would really be able to accomplish what is supposed to occur prior to the occurrences in the movie and thereafter until suddenly the audience is confronted with another persona late in the movie. Somehow freakish and unusual characters capture our imagination and fascination, nevertheless, it is the more subtle and performance of everyday characters that are the most difficult because they require a superior performance to capture and maintain an audiences interest.<br/><br/>The movie, in part, depends on an Addams Family assortment of characters from a Hitler era which somehow become a lost after-image as the movie develops as well as on the supposedly convoluted investigation of an assortment of clues, especially photographic compilation in fine chronological detail, sort of an extended Criminal Minds television series episode much better exploited in Manhunter (1986). This fusion of Point of No Return (1993) and Antitrust (2001), Hanna (2011), and Silence of the Lambs (1991) becomes some less of a mystery with its predictable murderer, loses a lot of its suspense and in this case less isn't more. The character development is weak even though it would in this movie have improved the substance of this movie especially as the movie wasn't supported by major special effects or action sequences. Lisbeth's character also wasn't consistent in her early setup particularly to the extent that her actions at the end of the movie weren't as expected as that might have been. Developed as more of a mystery thriller, even The Spy Game (2001) or The Three Days of Condor (1975) had more of the compelling and attention absorbing suspense than Dragon Tattoo whose post-climatic scenes whose outcomes seemed without surprise or doubt, and even in those instances where the doubt isn't really expected, there is still the ""rapt"" possibility that can grab one's attention as in The Thomas Crown Affair (1999). After a time, even the storyline line wasn't that emotional compelling or interesting to sustain any strong motivation to watch the movie, unlike the investigative reporting of All the President's Men (1976) or even Winter's Bone (2010) which gritty and riveting cultural milieu sustain a fascinating presence in the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the best unusual characters, even though mainstream, but directed and emotionally absorbing was found in Terence Young's Wait Until Dark (1967) where Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman who is stalked by some unsavory characters with the possibility of sadistic death on their minds. The ultimate crime thriller that sustains its action, has techno, and intimate relational balance remains Manhunter (1986) which captures unlike Dragon Tattoo some humanness of its horrendous criminal while at the times time provides that background character that seems missing in Dragon Tattoo."
"scrimmers1234","10","1","2","31 December 2018"," Great Hollywood re-make
","Foreign language films are often remade by Hollywood to enable them to be seen by a much wider audience and to cash in on their proven success. Often this involves moving the story to America and the casting of big box office stars but seemingly more often than not results in a poorer film for many reasons, often despite a much bigger budget. For me two notable exceptions to this in recent years have been the vampire masterpiece Let Me In and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Both originally Swedish films, their remakes were still set in Sweden and pretty much copied the original films without them having the need to massively rewrite or change what were already great films. Having also read the book to this particular film I can also state that it does the original story justice and isn't one of those many occasions where the book is so obviously much better than the film.<br/><br/>Although I still marginally prefer the original, which offers a little more detail thereby helping the viewer understand the complex plot, this film is slick, stylish and intelligent and Daniel Craig along with some of the over actors give superb performances in what remains a suburb and compelling thriller very much true to its Swedish roots."

","For so long Hollywood has bungled up foreign films, but they got it right with this one.
I saw the original, after seeing this, and was disappointed at how the lead female role looks more like someone dressing up as a goth for Halloween. Not only that, but the character, can't seem to do anything on her own, without the detective alongside.
Whereas, here, we see and believe Rooney Mara to be the character. A character, that is a loner and troubled. Mara deserved that Oscar nomination, and in my mind, outperforms Daniel Craig. Damn shame the studio bailed on the sequel with Mara. This film has been the highlight of her career, so far."

","I'm not averse to a remake if it's done well, but there has to be a reason for it.
For example:<br/><br/>*If the original wasn't much good (definitely not the case).<br/><br/>*The original is really old and needed updating (a remake after just two years is ridiculous quite frankly).<br/><br/>*The remake offers a new take on a story (nope, it's pretty much a scene for scene copy).<br/><br/>I really can't see the necessity for this film, the original is superior in every way - there;s even an English (dubbed) version on the Blu ray for those people that are allergic to subtitles.<br/><br/>Craig and Mara are fine actors, but they pale in comparison to the original cast in this story. Noomi Rapace in particular portrays Lisbeth Salander as gritty, troubled and above all interesting and (in my opinion) is a lot closer to the character in the book.<br/><br/>Not an awful remake, but just so unnecessary."
"jzathajenious","5","1","2","20 July 2017"," An inferior and unnecessary remake
","This US remake is simply inferior in every way compared to its Swedish predecessor. I have viewed both the Swedish abridged movie version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and in its original form as Millennium the TV series numerous times. I wont say the original Swedish adaptations are perfect by any means, but many of the elements and small, seemingly insignificant moments from the original are either missing or have been diluted for Western audiences. <br/><br/>First of all, Rooney Mara is no Noomi Rapace. Everything about her, from her weird hairstyle and shaved off eyebrows, to her distracting attempt at a Swedish accent, and her cold lifeless portrayal of Lisbeth Salander in general are a detriment to the film. She never garnered the empathy and interest in Lisbeth that Noomi did for me. And the chemistry that Nyquist and Rapace created together, both as colleagues and lovers, is entirely missing. Craig is OK as Blomqwist, he is not an emotional actor and can come off as cold and indifferent. Also why does he speak in his normal accent yet Mara puts on a Swedish accent? I found this very distracting. Fincher is a gifted visual director, but his usual flair is missing here, and really anyone could have directed this adaptation. <br/><br/>Its not a bad movie, just an unnecessary and inferior remake that never reaches the heights of its Swedish predecessor. For the definitive and best version, view the original Millennium TV series."
"hyoga_saint","8","1","2","29 June 2017"," Worthy adaptation with a fantastic Lisbeth Salander
","As a reader of the original novel, I wondered if I should not watch the Swedish adaptation first, rather than what I figured would be an Americanized, dumbed-down, and sanitized remake, the likes of which we've seen all too often in the past with other foreign movies. I was very pleased to see my concerns were completely unfounded.<br/><br/>Rather than a remake, this is more like a new adaptation of the modern thriller classic. A faithful one it is, too, set in the original Swedish locations of the novel and with characters speaking and acting much like their original literary counterparts. Even the controversial decision to speak in pseudo-Nordic accents is one I actually approve of. I liked the results.<br/><br/>Particularly great is the talented Rooney Mara, who looks a little like Natalie Portman but, while not having the same fame or level of recognition, may be just as good an actress. Her Lisbeth Salander is probably *the* character that was going to make of break this film and thankfully, it is a resounding success: she is very much the blunt, complex, riveting girl you picture when you read the book.<br/><br/>Though Mara's magnetic performance in many ways supports the film just fine on her own, she is helped by a strong cast in which Plummer and Wright, in particular, shine, while Skarsg√•rd, Richardson, and Craig also more than hold their own. The music sets the tone wonderfully, while the pacing and editing are also strong points, with 2,5 hours flying by.<br/><br/>As for the story, as I said, it remains faithful to the original while trimming down some of the excess baggage and taking a couple of actually satisfying shortcuts, improving on some of the slightly groan-inducing aspects of the book. However, some of the richness, depth, and mood of the novel inevitably get lost when translated to film, preventing this very good adaptation from becoming a classic.<br/><br/>(+) The story is faithfully adapted to the screen. Good pacing, editing, music. Mara nails it as Lisbeth Salander<br/><br/>(-) Some of the finer points and subtleties of the novel get lost in the silver screen, especially in regards to the Hedestad part of the story."
"mummychic12","8","1","2","20 January 2017"," Fair representation of a long book in a limited time frame
","Overall, I thought this movie did a good job of representing the major events of the book in a more concise way. I was glad that the director chose not make a 600+ page book that at times was hard to read into a multiple hour movie. Sitting through that would not have been pleasant. That said, given that I have read the book, I felt there were a few parts in the plot that could have been made more clear in this adaptation - namely the bulk of the investigation leading up to the climax of the story...it felt a little bit rushed to me the way they skipped out on what I felt was a more natural chain of events; instead they included a scene with a character that was not in the book to move things along.<br/><br/>I did however appreciate the fact that the film toned down some of the more graphic scenes of the book...they were appalling to read, let alone be shown on screen and I appreciated that the point was made without showing too many of the gory details. <br/><br/>I have to mention a few other things besides my commentary on the film-book differences: I really enjoyed the casting of this film. I thought it was superbly cast all the way around. Though admittedly some of my favorite characters from the book had smaller parts, I was still pleased with how everyone looked. And I can only chalk it up to the casting that surprisingly Daniel Craig's British accent surrounded by everyone else's Swedish accent still somehow worked. Also it is worth mentioning that the opening credits are absolutely amazing. I thought they captured the tone of the book so incredibly well and were mesmerizing to watch. I would recommend this movie to someone based on the credits alone, though with the caveat that this film, even certain aspects of the credits, is really not for those with a light stomach."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","17 October 2016"," Succeeds thanks to Mara's character and the atmosphere
","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an English-language movie from 2011, so it has its 5th anniversary this year. This one is a co-production between the United States, Norway and Sweden. The former comes through the impact of director David Fincher and Steven Zaillian, the man in charge of the screenplay. The Scandinavian impact is because of late writer Stieg Larsson who is the man came up with the novel that this film is based on. There was another purely Swedish film in the past starring Noomi Rapace as the title character, but because of the Hollywood impact this one here is considerably more famous. And also because of the current Bond, Daniel Craig, starring in it. It was also the breakthrough film for Rooney Mara, who worked with Fincher already on ""The Social Network"", and she got an Academy Award nomination for her turn of a tattooed hacker, who gets raped, but takes revenge and ultimately helps Craig's character in solving a pretty old criminal mystery. This mystery surrounds the characters of Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsg√•rd. Especially the latter plays a big part in here, which becomes even more crucial the longer the film runs. And ""longer"" is very true in this case as Fincher's take on the story lasts for more than 2.5 hours. I read that they planned on making a sequel (or more like the Swedish version), but so far it hasn't happened yet despite the movie being unusually successful for an American remake. It even won an Oscar for Best Film Editing.<br/><br/>About the movie itself, you certainly have to be interested in the genre and it also helps if you have read the book. Or you will appreciate it even more if you like Craig and Mara as they really have a lot of screen time here, one of them is always seen basically. That said, I still have to admit despite really loving Craig as Bond, I was a bit underwhelmed by him here. It is maybe partially to the performance and partially because of the way he was written. This film is clearly a showpiece for Rooney Mara and basically Rooney Mara only. I am just not too sure if she was really giving a very good performance or if it is about her costume and make-up that make the character so memorable, maybe the most memorable film character of 2011. There are some pretty disturbing scenes involving the main characters and I hinted at one earlier already, so this is not a film you may want to watch with your (small) children. Or with your parents, for that matter. But there are also fairly creative moments on some occasions. The movie lives a lot through its nice atmosphere that overall elevates the material and makes up for the not too big chemistry between Craig and Mara. But it's fine because they really don't have that many scenes together. At times, it almost felt as if I was watching two different movies in one. Anyway, all in all, the positive outweighs the negative and I give Fincher's version a thumbs up. But I would not consider it one of the year's best. It's good but not great. Worth checking out."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","2","29 September 2016"," A second adaptation of the book that is almost as good as the first
","Not quite in the top 5 of David Fincher's best films ('Se7en', 'The Social Network', 'Fight Club', 'Gone Girl' and 'Zodiac') but it does come close. And this is somebody who found a lot to like about all his films, including his lesser ones like 'Alien 3' and 'Panic Room'.<br/><br/>Despite being often considered a remake, personally prefer to call it a second adaptation of the book. The book is a fantastic read, and as an adaptation while it is condensed and has some changes Fincher's film still adheres to the basic tone of the book as does the Swedish version. Of the two versions, the Swedish version just gets the edge for its incredible atmosphere complete with bleakness, chills, shocks and is more authentic, with Noomi Rapace burning the screen enigmatically with her presence.<br/><br/>Where Fincher's film improves over the previous version are in four areas. One is the production values, which are far more audacious here. The cinematography, both bleakly moody and exquisite to look at, is more cinematic and perfectly captures the frozen landscape which is like a character in itself. The film is very tightly edited too in a way that is distinctively Fincher. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' music score is another winner of theirs, it is haunting and gives a really unnerving vibe, combined with some clever sound mixing. The script, even when condensed, is more polished and tighter and also has more flow. While Lisbeth is a fascinating and complex character in the Swedish film, the Lisbeth in Fincher's film has even more complexity and more variation of emotions.<br/><br/>Fincher's direction is exemplary, showing a mastery of visual style and mood setting, ensuring that the film stays intriguing throughout the length. In lesser hands and with less assured pacing, with the long running time 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' could have been a long haul but had plenty of intrigue. Much of the storytelling is gripping, and while not as authentic or quite as masterful in atmosphere like the Swedish counterpart was it has its fair share of chills, twists and turns (without being convoluted or illogical) and shock value as well as a murky bleakness. Contrary to what some believe, this second adaptation did have point (was fearing it wouldn't), as it made the story more accessible and gave it more exposure.<br/><br/>Good acting helps. Daniel Craig is very wisely restrained, the character should have a quiet determination and dignity which Craig handles very well. Christopher Plummer is simply terrific as well, one of his best performances in recent years, while Stellan Skasgard is frighteningly demented and Yorick van Wageningen is unsettlingly sadistic. Robin Wright does her best with a shallow character. Best of all is a magnificent Rooney Mara, such a multi-layered performance and sees Mara not just playing the role but disappearing into it. See her appearance for example, so committed that when you see her in other films you would not believe that it's the same person.<br/><br/>There are faults however. Did not think much of the Gothic James Bond-like opening sequence that just felt jarring and out of place. Nor with the accents, which were a mix for some of the actors of having one too heavy or thick (Wright) or not attempting one at all (Craig). The decision to use both English and Swedish in some scenes did have a tendency to confuse, while the central relationship (mostly successfully done) did feel underdeveloped and, even for characters that are the heart of the story, takes over the story a little too much somewhat.<br/><br/>All in all, almost as good as the Swedish version and better than both of that film's heavily flawed but still worthy sequels. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"marjan-milos","7","1","2","2 August 2015"," Got great moments, still like the previous version best
","I watched the Swedish version, and then this one. These are quite similar and weak plot- spots are also there. Lets look at the movie, independently of the original. The directing and whole technical stuff is very good. It has thriller moments done well, making watcher excited. However, the plot seems unfocused, as it jumps between several topics. Also the ""Ocean's 11 elements"" at the end were something I did not like. The investigation end was somehow not strong enough, I guess they needed to stick to the original plot (book), so it stayed that way. There is something annoying to (at least for me): the Swedish accent that was forced by many characters (that are actually not Swedish actors). Craig played really well, as most of the actors did. Now back to the original. The main lack is actually the Girl's role. Noomy Rapace has that something. She's tough, wild and fully fits the Girl's role and comparing to her, Rooney Mara is quite pale. So, finally, I'm not sure the re-adaptation was needed, at least in that short time: having the plot very similar and the Girl's role degraded, only Craig and the ""technical"" stuff showed up as a benefit."

","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (American) Let me start by saying this is a review of the American version after having read the book & seen the Swedish version. The storyline in the movies remains the same essentially with differences in casting, sets & closeness to the book. Some are small such as differences in closeness to the book some are larger as in sets & casting.<br/><br/>The American version was correct to use Swedish settings but where they lag is in the cleanliness of the sets. This is a personal preference but I prefer the more natural gritty look & feel on the Swedish version. A notable point in the American version's favor is that it is slightly closer to the story as told in the book. The American wins by a nose here, a good example is at the end where the antagonist is dealt with. Neither the Swedish or English gets it correct & it changes your final view of both characters involved but the American is closer to the book here.<br/><br/>The real difference is in casting, the Swedish version has it correct in both the case of Mikael Blomkvist & Erika Berger. They look older, like people that have had a long term relationship based on a slightly hedonistic sexual lifestyle. There's a little meat on them from their long years of late night work & odd hour meals plus their casual use of alcohol over the years. It fits the printed news industry. Mikael & Erika's relationship is not based on looks. It is based on their appetite & the fact that Mikael likes strong women that don't wait for a man to initiate sex. If his sexual relations had been based on looks the Lisbeth would never have had a chance with him. The American one is Hollywood American casting. They have a gym rat body as Mikael & a thin Erika which certainly doesn't fit her notable lifestyle. It seems that Hollywood would have us believe that only thin people have good sex & that doesn't fit reality at all. It's a common problem in movies from Tinsel Town. They polish the sets & polish the bodies if at all possible.<br/><br/>The part that Rooney Mara took on was a courageous move on her part & she does well with it but that role was owned by Noomi Rapace as well as any role in cinema has ever been owned before. Still, the acting in the American version is very good so I'm really complaining of American tendencies in casting as versus the job done by casting in Sweden.<br/><br/>I know that a lot of Americans dislike hearing a foreign language for an entire movie not to mention having to read subtitles & that would qualify as a personal preference. I believe those people are missing some of the world's best cinema & would urge them to view the Swedish version as I believe it is a better experience visually. It is certainly a more dynamic performance by Noomi as Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>I gave the American version 8 stars as opposed to 10 stars for the Swedish version for the above reasons. The American is surely worth seeing & is surprising, enjoyable & a wonderful mystery / social commentary on Sweden. The book is the best of the lot as it has the pages that detail the statistics on sexual assaults on women. The story after all is about Swedish societal & government lack of care about abuse of women in Sweden & not just Lisbeth Salander's life.<br/><br/>The book title was more appropriate being MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, not as dramatic as TGWTDT perhaps, but the movie titles sort of muddle the storyline since they focus our attention on this one woman. I can see where people that only watch American language movies are, in my opinion, better off to watch the American one than skip it & would even say that those who watched the Swedish version only, should see Fincher's remake. I am firmly of the opinion that the Swedish is the best though."

And Fincher's is by far the superior of the films. I am no stranger to the story and experienced it in the ""proper order"" as many elitist fans would call it. (While the ever more elitist ""fans"" would not have even watched Fincher's version). Fincher's Direction is superior; Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's musical genius sets the perfect tone for the film, and best of all, the cast lends themselves to a brilliant story in ways that I believe would be irreproducible by any other actor/actress. I may be blasphemous for saying this but I don't care. Rooney Mara nailed the role better than Noomi Rapace and I look forward to Fincher's future endeavours with Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist in coming years. And as for you people who are ever insistent on the same lame-@$$ed arguments to appear like you know what everyone else ""should"" enjoy...original languages do not make a movie good. ""Passion of the Christ"" was not more enriching because it was in Arabic. Not wanting to read subtitles is not a curse of the Lazy Man and the fact that you do does not mean you are more intelligent, cultured, or artistic. It means you are boastful,arrogant, and are looking for something to make you feel superior instead of going to watch a movie for a good story. If you want to be 100% pure in your Stieg Larsson enjoyment, learn Swedish, move to Stockholm, and bask in the glory that is your raging unmerited self esteem. If a language is reason for you not to enjoy something, you've missed the point entirely of watching a movie."

"garethvk","9","3","12","21 December 2011"," A Dark and Disturbing Tale You Will Not Soon Forget
","Following the very successful adaptation of Stieg Larssons millennium trilogy into three very successful Swedish language films, it came as no surprise when Hollywood announced that it would be making an English-language version of the series. Director David Fincher was announced to craft the first book in the series, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The new version follows very close to the original material with one fairly big exception which I will detail later in the review.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig stars as Mikael Blomkvist, who at the opening of the film has recently lost a court case for which he was being sued for libel by a prominent business figure. His career is in ruins and virtually all of his savings gone as a result of the trial and punitive damages. So when he is contacted by an attorney representing the wealthy and powerful Vanger family, he agrees to meet. Although highly reluctant to take a meeting, Mikael takes the four hour train ride north of Stockholm to a cold and remote island to meet with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Henrik wishes Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his niece some 40 years earlier, a niece vanished under the families' very noses and not a trace of her has been discovered since. Henrik is convinced that she has met with foul play, yet every year on his birthday, he continues to receive a gift of ornate pressed flowers in an anonymous package.<br/><br/>Henrik believes that the killer is haunting him by sending the gifts and that a member of his family may be to blame. Although skeptical of being able to find anything 40 years later, Mikael accepts the case and soon sets up residence in a small cabin on the island and begins his investigation by combing through police reports, conducting interviews, and examining photographs and newspaper clippings. Mikael had been warned that the other members of the Vanger family may not be too thrilled with his presence as not only is the family fractured, they all have their share of secrets. <br/><br/>At the same time, a very Goth punk girl named Lisabeth (Rooney Mara), is fighting her own demons. Lisabeth is an extremely gifted computer and surveillance expert who specializes in gathering background information on individuals. As such, her skills have made her in high demand with her employer. Unfortunately, Lisabeth is also a deeply antisocial person who is prone to lash out violently if provoked. Much of this stems from an extremely traumatic childhood spent in institutions which resulted in Lisabeth being placed as a ward of the state, not deemed competent to care for herself. This arrangement requires her to check in on a regular basis with a representative who, unfortunately for her, has recently suffered a stroke and places her in the care of the new guardian.<br/><br/>The new guardian subjects Lisabeth to horrific demands just so Lisabeth can access her money. The traumatized Lisabeth does not play victim long and in a twist of fate, is assigned by Henrik's attorney to assist Mikael since she did the background check on him prior to Mikael being approached by Henrik for the investigation. The unlikely duo combined to form a highly efficient pair as they start to piece together the clues which indicate a brutal string of murders leading back for decades. As they work together, the relationship deepens and the reserved Lisabeth starts to come out of her shell. Tension mounts as danger surrounds them in an epic race against time to solve the case that certain members of the family do not want solved.<br/><br/>The film runs approximately 2 hours and 45 min and does take a little while to get started as the landscape and back story of the characters is established. The film has some very dark and brutal moments, which are hard to watch, yet were not as graphic as those in the Swedish language version. Craig and Mara work very well with one another and props to Craig for being willing to put on weight and occasionally looked disheveled to enhance his character.<br/><br/>Mara gives a masterful performance as the complicated Lisabeth, the anti-damsel-in-distress heroine, who subtly shows the many complicated sides to the character. Noomi Rapace first portrayed the character and has gone on to prominent success in Hollywood with a slew of upcoming high profile films. I would expect nothing less for Mara with two other sequels in this series to film. I am sure this breakout performance will not go unnoticed as it is an extremely difficult and daring role that few in Hollywood would want to tackle, much less be able to pull off as convincingly as she did.<br/><br/>I was extremely happy to see that the character names, settings, and situations were not changed in the new version, and it was refreshing to see the film set in Sweden and not relocated to London or New York. The biggest issue I had with the film was with the ending, which deviated from the previous versions. I will not provide spoilers, suffice it to say the resolution was a bit too tidy of a Hollywood ending and in my opinion greatly undermined one of the central characters of the film. That being said the film is a bold and dynamic vision from Fincher and is a deeply dark and disturbing story that is difficult to forget.<br/><br/>4.5 stars out of 5"

The Movie shows the poorness and the struggle of teens and youths like her, and the corruption in the states and gov's and also the extreme tyranny and power of the wealthy business men who are protected by the state.

","I postponed watching this movie as I had seen the Swedish version a couple of years ago which I enjoyed a lot. So I knew the basic story- line and did not want to watch a movie due to artistic comparison purposes. Yesterday, when I realized that I did not remember too many scenes, I decided to see what the US version could provide.<br/><br/>First I recognized that many scenes were the same or very similar - the director and screenwriter were obviously eager to maintain the Swedish atmosphere, and they succeeded in that (well, most filming in Sweden and Norway was of big help). And introduction of European, incl. Swedish actors was a wise move as well; all the leading ladies and men are at least good, if not great (beginning with Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara). Thanks to strong book behind, the characters are elaborated, scenes and twists are logical; David Fincher's talent and skills let capture the mood and tensions through mystery aura. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the US remake was ready about 2 years after the original Swedish version... For those millions not eager to read subtitles, it could have been easily postponed for later."

","I had high expectations since I enjoyed the book so much. However, after having read the book, I was hyper-aware of all changes and exclusions made in the movie. Normally this doesn't bug me that much, but I felt that the changes didn't add to the movie at all. I left the theater feeling frustrated and disappointed with a movie that for all intents and purposes was actually quite good.<br/><br/>On a side note, I thought the movie was excellently cast. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara were perfect. I love seeing up and comers (Rooney Mara) knock a role out of the ballpark. She was wonderful. I look forward to seeing more of her."

","This movie is fantastic from start to finish. It's full of fascinating and very well-played characters. It's dark (really dark), it's moody, it grabs your attention and never lets you go. The pace of plot development is spot on.<br/><br/>I thought both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara were excellent (Mara that little bit more excellent than Craig!). They also weave in a really subtle love story.<br/><br/>I find it hard to think of much to criticise, but being a mystery story it probably needed a few more plot twists and a few more interesting minor characters to justify a 10 out of 10!"
"lekgolah","9","2","7","26 September 2012"," Don't let 'that' scene put you off, this is well worth checking out
","Speaking as someone who has not seen the Swedish adaptation of the famous series or read the books for that matter, I had little to go by on what to expect other than what i had seen in the trailers and heard about from friends, so I was going into the film fresh and I can say that I highly recommend it. <br/><br/>As with The Social Network, Fincher strikes the perfect balance between involving the audience with all the information on screen while not overloading them at the same time. It is tricky to do, but with his talent in directing, the film's two hour plus running-time goes by in a flash. The film is in many ways a master-class in all that it does; from perfectly honed performances to the fantastic editing (edited by the Oscar winning team who did The Social Network and won again for this). <br/><br/>Prior to this Rooney Mara had a only a few noticeable roles to mention, but does a fantastic job settling in as the film's protagonist, Lisbeth. Daniel Craig gives a subtle understated performance as her partner who work together to solve a 40-year old plus murder. Supporting actors including Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsg√•rd are also brilliant. <br/><br/>The only weakness that I can think to mention is that we are sometimes unsure of who the main suspects are as the film moves at such a pace, however this is not Scooby Doo and the film features several scenes to remind you of that. <br/><br/>Whether or not Fincher chooses to continue with the series, he has made yet another fantastic film that is well worth checking out but not when eating."
"callum-macarthur501","9","2","7","28 August 2012"," Really enjoyed it, have also read the book.
","I had read the book by Steig Larsson a few weeks before I watched the film and I really enjoyed it. I always have doubts that a film will live up to the book but in this case, it did the book justice. I can't say that it stuck to book extremely well, but if it had, it would have been a very long film. The film followed the book's story line very well, while keeping the film a sensible length of time. There was nothing that was left out that I thought definitely should have been in the film, and if it was left out, they found a clever way to work it back in. All the environments described in the book were reflected well in the film, I thought Hedeby Island was a very well presented environment in the film, it really gave a life to the book if read again as it gave you a great mental image to use for Hedeby Island. Daniel Craig played the role of 'Mikael Blomkvist' very well. His accent wasn't the best, but we can't blame him as the accent is pretty hard to maintain through out the whole movie. Rooney Mara was a brilliant actress to play 'Lisbeth Salander', she looked exactly like how I pictured Lisbeth while reading the book. She executed Lisbeth's attitude extremely well and acted the rest of her personality very well also. I really hope the next film, if there is one, is as well directed as this one so the story line is followed and the characters are well portrayed. Overall is was a brilliant watch and it doesn't matter if you have read the book first, or have decided to read it after, it will still be a great read and watch."

","I don't give very many 10's but this movie deserves it. I watched both versions the Swedish and the Hollywood remake back to back. Both are excellent! Alfred Hitchcock couldn't have made a better movie. Great acting, a plot that made total sense and kept me wondering where things were going, and tension that had me sitting up at the edge of my seat. Don't watch this movie if you have an aversion to brutal violence. Some scenes are very very graphic. Hollywood is into remakes these days while great stories like this are being made into movies in foreign countries. There are thousand's and thousand's of other untold great stories out there but Hollywood is only interested in reproductions catering to young audiences that have never seen the original. Add new up and coming stars and Jazz the old movie up a bit and yes they probably make money, but in the end they have soiled a work of art. No one has chosen to re-write ""War and Peace"" or a Tail of Two Cites"" no one is repainting the ""Mona Lisa"" so why is Hollywood so eager to redo old movies that are works of art."
"olearym-104-860584","5","2","7","4 June 2012"," was their any need for a American version?
","im currently reading the girl with the dragon tattoo and its not for a faint of heart. the Swedish version got me into the series by accident. i saw it at a cinema without knowing what it was about but by its poster. i was shocked and entertained by a well written story and the message of violence against women. Lisbeth was a scary but interesting character to watch. and then moments after the last film was released i heard of a American version being done. a thought came into my head 'what already? are Hollywood this out of ideas that they need to do this?' since their already remaking batman and a ton of other films that arnt that old or are still ongoing franchises. but i saw at the cinima and said to myself. 'please lord, make this be good' and my prayer was answered and not at the same time. <br/><br/>this is pretty much the same film as the Swedish version just with better camera work. i like Rooney's vision of Slander, she made her more alien and less of a human being and it shows on camera, in the parts were their should be pure emotions coming though she covers them up with this weird childlike expression. its hard to describe but i think she did a good job as the computer hacker. <br/><br/>daniel craig for me doesn't work as Mikael. he does a good job at being all dark and broody. but his face in this is like hes been in a scrap and he still got his body of james bond, so its hard to take him seriously as a journalist. they could have cast anyone and it had to be james bond. in fact the advertisement seems to rely on this. the poster looks like 007 movie and the title credits are like that of a james bond opening as well. its a really cheap way to get people into the seats.<br/><br/>its a decent attempt to relaunch the series for a new audience but the fact of the matter is it has been released way too soon for it to be good, it takes a few scenes from the next book and doesn't do enough to stand out from its superior. if you haven't seen the original Swedish version you might enjoy it, but if you have this will seem like a waste of time and talent"
"eve_dolluk","8","2","7","31 May 2012"," More like the book
","I have to say I preferred this film to the Swedish version, I had read the books first and then watched films.<br/><br/>The thing i liked about the books were the murder mystery aspect alongside the Lisbeth character. The Swedish version missed out so much of the murder mystery element that I enjoyed so much from the books. The American version had a lot more attention to detail and included a greater degree of suspense.<br/><br/>At first I found the fast pace of the American version slightly distracting but this passed after 5 or so minutes. I could understand the need for the faster pace and this was to include the details without it being an even longer film.<br/><br/>The American version kept more to the books true nature and the feelings of the story more so than the Swedish version which seemed to have a greater political agenda that was barely apparent in the books unless you looked for it ( and more so if you were Swedish ).<br/><br/>The opening of the American version was strange though, totally didn't fit with the film and was out of place but was still kind of cool. Would have suited a music video more or the opening of a bond movie ( possibly a marketing ploy because Daniel Craig was in it ).<br/><br/>Both movies got the character of Lisbeth right though, neither got the character of Blomkvist right though in my opinion. For me in the books he was a lot more charismatic and articulate but not so wise in his own life. I thought the Swedish film dealt with the relationship between Lisbeth and Blomkvist better however.<br/><br/>The book never made it seem like a love story which the American version seemed to imply.<br/><br/>Overall the American version was better which was to be expected with a bigger budget but the main thing was that it captured the essence of the books better.<br/><br/>The books are always going to be better but a film can translate well to film if it ands the important elements of film making and can suck you in for the 2 odd hours of your life. The Swedish version lacked the tension and mystery for me which was the driving force behind the books alongside the characters ( mainly how intriguing and kind of cool Lisbeth was ).<br/><br/>Overall a good film and well put together 8/10"
"MaleneDK","7","2","7","11 May 2012"," Better than expected but not as good as the Swedish version
","I expected very little from this American version of the Swedish movie.<br/><br/>The Swedish version was thrilling, chilling and Lisbeth Salander amazing as a character.<br/><br/>The American version was better than expected. I thought Rooney Mara did OK, however the interpretation of Mikael Blomkvist was disappointing and detached. The story line was changed many times were it just didn't make sense to make the changes. It let the air out of the story and left it more boring to watch.<br/><br/>The story between Lisbeth and Bjurmann was a big let-down. Especially considering how important it is for the next two movies. The Swedish version was scary and shocking and I did not get that feeling in the American version at all.<br/><br/>Also the solving of the murder mystery was not as entertaining and it did not provide the creepy feeling from the original movie.<br/><br/>All in all - it was an OK movie. If not compared to the original - it did well, but if compared - it disappointed."
"amahlanand","9","2","7","9 May 2012"," Stark, Disturbing Brilliance
","What strikes one about this film, particularly if you have not been introduced to the franchise through the novels, is the extreme lengths it goes to in order to convey the full effect of its impact through both the story and its characters. Sex scenes for instance are far from uncommon, more intense scenes of the same nature are by no means rare either, but not often do they genuinely disturb and unsettle you. If a work of cinema can have that kind of influence upon your emotions, through avenues which are not uncommon in film, it has undoubtedly been brilliantly crafted and deserved of unanimous praise. <br/><br/>The plot is full of intrigue, a great mystery story with many angles, no distracting sideplots and without a conventional 'whodunit'. Initially, the idea of two almost distinct story lines and characters is puzzling, one being full of disturbing and sensitive extremities, the other being mysteriously sedate. However, it allows the viewer to set up an idea of Rooney Mara's character Lisabeth Salander, the linchpin and master focus. There are junctures you find yourself more fascinated with her than the murder mystery being deciphered. She is strange but resourceful, peculiar at face value yet you are inclined to wonder about who she really is, what she really is. It is as if circumstance has consumed her in some way but she finds a way to counter circumstance through passion and intellect. <br/><br/>Mara's is such a vast, demanding role but her performance casts the net even wider in terms of the character's vastness. She harnesses so many aspects of an individual which makes her performance truly revolutionary and compelling. Despite being a stellar actor who absorbs himself into a character that throws himself into everything, Daniel Craig was outshone majorly by Mara. <br/><br/>Was the film far-fetched, inordinately lengthy and perhaps too graphic? Perhaps something to ponder. The film doesn't need you to assume anything. It is stark and will show you implications rather than simply implying them. Those who will enjoy this are those who can withstand such blatancy and appreciate its artistic worth compared to others who may find the foundations of the story too unsettling to even think about appreciating."
"jerlang6","10","2","7","8 May 2012"," Potential perfection for the story
","David Fincher's The girl with the Dragon Tattoo is almost absolute perfection in the medium of film. Rooney Mara's performance is electrifying as she breathes new life and vitality into this already told story. What happened is instead of trying to live up to Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth she read the book and adopted a Lisbeth of her own! All in all making this a fantastic performance.<br/><br/>David Fincher does a great job of giving the movie a dark feel, like I believe from reading the books that it deserved. Add this great dark feel to a wonderful soundtrack by reznor/ross and you have a movie nearing perfection. The story is brilliantly told and the thrill of the mystery and detective work reigns through in great form. <br/><br/>This is a movie that definitely hit the mark and everyone should go out and see!"
"slydoggie","9","2","7","30 April 2012"," Way Better than the Original
","OMG. Hollywood got something really really right. I was not a fan of the original movie, but a big fan of the book. And I loved this adaptation. Brilliantly casted; from Blomkvist to Salander; the awkwardness captured as one would expect. Key plots are examined and counted for unlike the original. OK, so it's not 'word for word' so to speak, but in turning 500 pages into 2 1/2 hrs worth of film, one could expect that. I was worried at having to sit through another confronting effort of sexual violence, but this was done quite well in that I didn't feel like reaching for the bucket. I cannot thank Hollywood enough to alleviate my disappointment of the original film. Big thumbs up to the director, cast and crew."
"dallasryan","8","2","7","30 April 2012"," Comparing the Two- New vs. Original
","I just watched this new version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Comparing to the original is difficult because both movies are so good in their own way. The Swedish version explains the main story better, and unravels it more like a mystery that you, the viewer, are figuring out with Lisbeth and Mikael, where I felt the new one went to quick over the main story. The Swedish version didn't have the ending which I liked in this new one, but the Swedish version implied a lot of that ending in the 2nd and 3rd films(Except it didn't imply the last 2 minutes of this new ones ending). <br/><br/>I thought Rooney Mara was excellent, she looked more like the novel(from what I've heard at least, as I haven't read it), but she still looked too feminine in my opinion, where Noomi Rapace looked more dykie and butch(more manly), but she didn't have as many piercings and she didn't have her eyebrows shaved either, stuff like that. I think both movies were great, but I think Noomi embodied the character of Lisbeth a little better, in my own opinion at least. Both really good movies though. Of course this new one had better sound, a better music score, and better film quality just because it's David Fincher and it's American made, which the Swedish film didn't have that kind of budget so they had to make due with what they had in making the Original. <br/><br/>Also in the Swedish one Lisbeth and Mikael do have sex, but she's more disconnected from him with her feelings as in this one, Lisbeth(Rooney Mara) clearly shows that she's falling in love with Mikael(Daniel Craig). Both portrayals of Lisbeth are great in their own unique way and I really did like the ending on this new one a lot, and the finale scene with Stellan Skarsgard as the bad guy was a lot better executed and better acted by Skarsgard as well, than the original. <br/><br/>I really love the Lisbeth character, there are not a lot of great female roles for women in Hollywood or Film in general, and I think the Lisbeth character is one of the best female roles of all time, and I think Noomi and Rooney both hit the character right on the mark with who Lisbeth is and also giving that feeling of wanting to be with Lisbeth, having that longing to be with Lisbeth and wanting to know who Lisbeth is, but again, I thought that 'longing for' aspect was better executed with Noomi's performance only because that's how those original movies were written, where this new one is written for Lisbeth(Rooney Mara) to show more of her feelings towards Mikael. <br/><br/>One could see the Swedish version for the sheer fact of Noomi's performance, because really it's all about Lisbeth anyway, how interesting and complex she is. Also, the actor who played Mikael in the original, Daniel Craig's part in the new one, I felt the actor playing Mikael in the original was better, he looked more plump, he just looked more like the part and he was more subtle in his performance. Daniel Craig was good, but I feel the other actor in the original was better. In the end, I like the Original The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a little bit better. <br/><br/>Of course, If I would have seen the new The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first, I would be comparing the original to the new one, instead of comparing the new one to the original. So if I would have seen the new one first, I might have liked the new one better just because that's kind of how us human beings work, we always feel more of an attachment to the first one we see, whether it be the original or remake of that film. <br/><br/>Kind of like when we read a book and then see the movie. If we see the movie first and then read the book, sometimes we like the movie better because that's what we identified with first. The Psychology of the human being is interesting. Just like the Internal Psychology of Lisbeth is interesting, no, it's fascinating!!"
"Mihaela_Lacramioara","7","2","7","26 April 2012"," Not too bad

"a_m_baker","9","2","7","25 April 2012"," Not perfect, but quite close
","Firstly before i go into detail i just wanted to say, there are negative reviews on here, but they almost always contain negative comparison to the Swedish versions as their only criteria, not many people seem to want to judge the film on it's own merit, which is a shame.<br/><br/>I personally feel that this film was not only wonderful on it's own way (I went with two friends, one who had seen the Swedish versions but not read the books, the other had no previous exposure, and they both loved it), but that it was better than the Swedish in some ways that i shall highlight: <br/><br/>Lisbeth Salander - I remember seeing the Sweedish version, and although i thought Noomi Rapace was outstanding, I couldn't help but feel she didn't quite fit. When they announced Fincher's adaptation I couldn't see who they could get to fit the role, until I saw Rooney Mara in costume, something just clicked for me. Once I saw her on the screen I felt that Rooney Mara embodied a Salander that was closer to that of the book. Mara in my opinion better captured the dual nature of the character. To the rest of the world Salander appears as a short, waifish girl with obvious emotional difficulties, and is treated as such, dismissed or seen as a target and abused. It is only when individuals earn her wrath that they witness first hand the true strength of her character. Rapace's character seemed to focus more on the rage within, coming across as tough and angry, but to me that was the most accentuated aspect, for example the use of c*** in film just doesn't fit the character, with her views on women. She seemed to me to have a bigger screen presence than Mara's Salander but also seemed to make her less delicate as well as being older, taller and a bigger build than the character in the book.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist - When i originally heard that they were casting Daniel Craig, I was in despair, Blomkvist is imagined as a slightly overweight journalist, and you get James Bond to play him! I couldn't have been more wrong in my opinion, and was most impressed by his performance. Now perhaps i don't understand or have missed particular nuances or inflections within the Sweedish language, and if that affects my perspective here I apologise, but I felt Michael Nyqvist, while good, came across as quite a stern, dour interpretation of Blomkvist, against my understanding of him in the book. The character in the book comes across as an affable, charming man with a gentle humour (for example as he chides Salander for hacking his computer instead of reprimanding her), and I felt Craig captured these aspects fairly well, not perfectly, but more so than Nyqvist.<br/><br/>Christopher Plummer - When i originally read the book the first person Henrik Vanger brought to mind mentally was Max Von Sydow, so i was slightly disappointed when i heard it would be Christopher Plummer, Plummer had always struck me as generally portraying more sinister people. My fears were again unfounded and i found him to be quite likable.<br/><br/>That said the film was not without flaws that i would also like to highlight:<br/><br/>Dirch Frode - whilst I had no issue with Steven Berkoff, I did with the way the character was played. In the book he seemed very much a close friend of Vanger, whereas in the film he seemed to be less genial, more detached, and more obstructive.<br/><br/>Martin Vanger - Again, whilst i think Stellen Skarsgard played the character, the reverse seemed to be true, the character being more helpful than he was in the book, but perhaps this was done to accentuate the psychopathy when you realise his true nature.<br/><br/>Plot and pacing - I was relieved to see how close this film stuck to it's source material (changes to how they find Harriet notwithstanding though they were not detrimental to the film) I was disappointed with some aspects. The scene where she is almost mugged occurs in both films but not the book, i can understand it is there to show she can defend herself, but i think it is also unnecessary. The extra scenes with Palmgren were also not needed, she does not even know he is alive in the books until the second, and that always felt important. I also felt that they could have included more about her personality, for example her photographic memory and how she sees it as abnormal and Blomkvist does not. I also felt they could have played the scene of them first meeting closer to the book, in that Blomkvist is less serious, almost playfully chiding, which is counter to everything she is expecting of him, and sets up her gradual opening up to him <br/><br/>However the two biggest offenders were her telling Blomkvist about her father, and asking to kill Martin Vanger. She does not tell Blomkvist about her father in the books at any point, he finds these things out as events unfold and this was an important piece of the plot, the contrast between the person he knows and information being placed before him. Also, in the book after Salander she tells him ""I'm taking him."" She does not ask permission, and her character would not. It is a point of her character that she has her own set morals and acts on them without guidance and according to how interprets them, which sometimes lead to her outlandish and aggressive tendencies as other characters see them.<br/><br/>Overall however i believe this film was a superb adaptation of the book, I would recommend it to anyone, both as an individual film, or to those who are fans of the books, I only hope that they make the other two films"

","I didn't get a chance to see this movie at the theater last year, so I did what most people do and wait until it came out on DVD. This film caught my interest right from the start, the acting was incredible, especially the performance by Rooney Mara. I had never heard of her until I saw her at this year's Oscar's, I think she or the film was up for an Academy Award. I heard of Stieg Larson, who wrote the book, but I heard his books skip around and are very long. So I decided to see the movie first. This was such a great film, U have an outcast, who is very intelligent who knows everything about computers, but has a very unusual style. She catches the eye of Daniel Craig, who is working a case and wants her help in case that goes back years. A case involving the brutal killings of women spanning years. The person responsible is a little predictable, but that's type casting and the only flaw I saw with the movie. I have to say in some of the scenes are disturbing, and didn't add much to the movie, even though the guy who was in charge of her finances deserved what he got. I'm no prude, but there are a few sexual scenes that didn't add much to the movie, Thank GOD they were quick. This movie has everything suspense, excitement to the end, and who done it , that to some the killer was predictable. In the end Mara and Craig make a great team and even though the killer went free for many year, justice does get served to him the end in this terrific thriller. THX, Kris L. Cockayne"

","Director David Fincher reunites with his highly-accomplished team from his previous movie, ""The Social Network"", and has made a thriller film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's Swedish novel series. The dazzling opening credits of this film are just impressive, as if the movie itself. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" stars Daniel Craig as a newspaper journalist, asked to recover a 40-year-old mystery about the disappearance and possible murder of a young girl. He then teams up with Rooney Mara, in a deserved Oscar-nominated performance as the title role, as an expert researcher and computer hacker that has been involved in the investigation, after recently making a background check on Daniel Craig's character. Don't be fooled by the trailer, when thinking it's a live action thriller. But it's actually a realistic, murder investigation story. I've been a huge fan of director David Fincher, when seeing two of his movies, ""Fight Club"" and ""The Social Network"". Now, he scored a triple home-run with ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". He carefully executes this movie perfectly, with plenty of time and precision, that not even a long conclusion can ruin. The cast is just plain superb. Daniel Craig is always perfect playing the investigative journalist, Christopher Plummer plays the uncle of the missing suspect, Robin Wright as Craig's work partner and long-time lover, and Stellan Skarsgard as the brother of the missing suspect. But the scene-stealing performance belongs to Rooney Mara. She steals every scene in the movie, and she owns the entire movie. She perfectly captures the innocence of her character, and shows the right vision of darkness into her role. What a ""shining star"" performance by such a young actress! I was immediately blown away by the haunting music score of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, that perfectly tells the story. The visionary film editing by Angus Wall & Kirk Baxter, is delivered with such speed and timing, that it deserved this year's Academy Award win for Best Film Editing. The writing is true and believable, the directing is visionary, and the acting is just plain superb. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is perfect for audiences who either read the books, or haven't read the books. This is a slow, strong, violent, dark, thrilling, and exhilarating roller coaster ride. This is also one of the best movies of 2011. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", in my review, ""an exhilarating and thought-provoking motion picture""."

","""Damaged people are dangerous. They know they can survive."" ‚Äï Josephine Hart,(found quote at ""Just Under the Surface"" - wordpress blog)<br/><br/>This quote is awesome. ...It is Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>She is damaged, as a result of being a tortured and victimized girl. Out of the simple necessity for survival, she becomes strong and seemingly fearless, with her walls up high and heavily guarded.<br/><br/>She is vulnerable, though much of it she keeps under lock and key.<br/><br/>She is human, and although projects a 'badass' image, we see in her fear, though it is masked, and shoved to the side by anger and her vengeance for those who commit hate crimes towards women. She is a crusader, a warrior, a vigilante. (I want to hug this girl... but then again, I'm kind of afraid of her. She'd kick my a@# in a heart beat.)<br/><br/>Rooney Mara encompasses this character fully. I never once saw an actress on-screen portraying a character. I saw Lisbeth.<br/><br/>Simply stated, David Fincher's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a hard movie to watch. It is ugly, and shows the ugly side of what our species is capable of (hate, rape, murder, lies, and manipulation). Now, I did not enjoy seeing these horrid/awful themes present themselves. To be honest, watching it totally gave me the cringe factor and I was not immune to the sick feeling at the pit of my stomach. I did, however, like the movie due to the fact that it was willing to talk about the ugly things that go on in life. Most people go on ignoring/act unaware or are, in fact, truly unaware that bad things like these happen. I felt that this book/movie was trying to say, ""hey, don't ignore me this stuff is real. It does/can happen."" I appreciated the fact that this story was able to talk about uncomfortable issues, that are so often swept under the rug. To bring awareness and make changes in this world and society, we have to address the ""uncomfortable.""<br/><br/>""The Uncomfortable""<br/><br/>18% of the women in Sweden have at one time been threatened by a man.<br/><br/>46% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to violence by a man.<br/><br/>13% of the women in Sweden have been subjected to aggravated sexual assault outside of a sexual relationship.<br/><br/>92% of women in Sweden who have been subjected to sexual assault have not reported the most recent violent incident to the police.<br/><br/>-Statistics found before each section in Larsson's book, TGWTDT."

","The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was new to me from the start. I had heard of the books, but never knew what they were about. When I got around to watching the trailer I was instantly hooked. It looked mysterious and violent and seemed to have a very unique cast...I couldn't have been more satisfied.<br/><br/>I'm sure if you haven't seen this movie already you have heard of a few choice scenes from people who have. They might've described them in detail, but it doesn't do the movie any justice until you actually witness them yourself. TGWTDT pushes you to the edge and pulls you back in for more. You never know whats going to happen, and things often happen too quickly and that's the way it should be. This movie has it all: mystery, romance, betrayal, violence, suspense, you name it. Its probably there.<br/><br/>Don't sleep on this one, you wont be disappointed."
"intelearts","9","2","7","11 April 2012"," 505th Review: Great plot, solid filming, but above all, an outstanding female role
","TGWTDT is a great remake of a very hard to beat Swedish film - and they do pull it off. Cannot recommend the Swedish original highly enough - simply stunning - and scary. But this is faithful to the spirit and place of the original and it is mesmerizing. It is in places an uncomfortable watch, but the tale of the journalist (Daniel Craig) who is hired to solve a family mystery and restore his reputation is spellbinding.<br/><br/>But more than that is the outstanding writing, characterization, and above all acting by Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, who is a wonderfully complex and well-drawn character than easily outshines Daniel Craig and Stellan Skarsg√•rd with a knockout performance. Above all this is a female character, not some male ideal, she is vulnerable and broken, but also tough as nails and unbreakable, smart, frighteningly independent, yet searching to validate her choices, a mass of contradictions and dichotomies of the sort that actresses deserve but rarely get. <br/><br/>It may be a gift of a role, but what Rooney does with it is a gift for us - simply the best performance by an actress, in my opinion, this year, and the best since Jennifer Lawrence in Winter's Bone."

The story is truly captivating right from the beginning. Most of the actors play their parts superbly. And the atmosphere is indeed quite Swedish despite being spoken in English. Although I personally prefer movies to be spoken in the language that the characters are supposed to speak (in this case Swedish). <br/><br/>Not gonna give a resume nor analyze the thing.

I don't understand how he was overlooked at the Oscars this year. It was a pleasant surprise to see Rooney Mara nominated in the best actress category. It was well deserved. There are a couple missteps in the casting department. Robin Wright is an actress of limited range and in this movie she has a terrible Swedish accent. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is usually pretty good but in this movie he isn't that good as the villain. The rest of the cast are merely OK. Thank God Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are able to carry the film without having to depend on the supporting cast"

","Saw this twice already, and I know the book has a different ending and several different storyline changes but I tried to watch the movie as if I had no expectations or information of the story and it's characters. This can be very challenging when you read the book, especially when you're a big fan, but realized that it would have to be a mini-series to get all of it in and of course, realized that they would probably need to do a Hollywood ending to it all, as in, she is broken when she finds that her lover (sorry to give away, but I did check the spoiler box) is back with his old fling. Of course in the book she could care less and is the first to move on, and hence, the whole dramatic moment of her seeing him, being crushed and taking off on her motorcycle is Hollywood. I guess they needed her to be more of a 'woman' or in this Hollywood ending, a sensitive, fragile little girl, personally, I liked her kicking ass and taking names demeanor throughout the movie (and book), but Hollywood added in the vulnerability. Probably a good thing, especially after what she does to the rapist. My favorite scene btw! I favor movies that the woman is in charge, being smart and sexy and in control. I like this one a lot!"
"TxMike","Null","2","7","28 March 2012"," Well-crafted mystery, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander is the best reason to see this
","I am generally NOT a fan of re-makes, especially one so close in time to the original (2011 vs 2009). But this is such a rich, interesting story that they pull it off quite well. The story remains set and filmed (mostly) in Sweden, each character uses his or her version of a Swedish accent. But it is a more elaborate production and takes the whole story up a notch. <br/><br/>In my comments on the 2009 movie I wrote, ""All the characters are good, but I can't say enough about Rapace as Lisbeth. She creates a character as memorable as any. More closely akin to Nikita than anything else."" Now I must echo that for Rooney Mara. Who would have thought, from her role in 'The Social Network'? She deserved the Oscar nomination and it would not been wrong if she had won. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig is the investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist. Christopher Plummer is Henrik Vanger, who hires him to re-look at the disappearance 40 years earlier of his niece. And Stellan Skarsg√•rd is Martin Vanger. In an interesting casting Robin Wright is Erika Berger .<br/><br/>The story follows the same arc but some of the story elements are presented differently, often in more detail. The scenes with Lisbeth and her dastardly guardian are more graphic. In the original Blomkvist has to spend 3 months in jail after his conviction, here it appears he only has to pay a large fine. And there is another key difference I will mention below after ""spoilers."" <br/><br/>Overall an excellent movie, and since I saw the 2009 version about 10 months ago, this one was very fresh to me. I hope they make the second and third ones too, but that seems to be in doubt right now. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: As in the original Nazi Martin Vanger was the perpetrator of many unsolved killings, and he was responsible for the niece's disappearance, she fled because she was afraid. In the original she was found in Australia. In this version she was found practicing law in London under a different name. After Martin's death in a fiery car crash she was able to reconcile with her family."
"saadgkhan","9","2","7","26 March 2012"," Dragon Tattoo is excellent but not a Masterpiece like Swedish pehonomanan
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo ‚Äì CATCH IT (A-) The Novel and Swedish version"" M√§n som hatar kvinnor/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" with Noomi Rapace is a worldwide phenomena. There is no doubt that this is one of the most complicated and complex novel hitting the shelves last decades. Presenting the novel with all its complexities to the big screen is challenging, the Swedish director Niels Arden Oplev did a fantastic job with the first novel into a feature movie. Now it was David Fincher's turn to adopt the novel for American audiences with Rooney Mara and transfer into something close to or surpass the original phenomena with Noomi Rapace. Now I defiantly can say that David Fincher has done a fantastic job with American ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" but I cannot say that it's better than the original. Original is a classic masterpiece and Noomi Rapace deadly portray of Lisbeth Slander will go down in the history. If you compare both movies there is some difference like the characterization of Lisbeth Slander and Mikael Blomkvist. In Swedish version Lisbeth is fierce and doesn't show her emotions to anyone. Though in American version Lisbeth is more emotional and in the end her chasing down to Mikael Blomkvist shows her romantic side which was missing both in books and Swedish version. Maybe it was more David's attempt for American audiences to except her. I don't think it was a bad think because it gives it a decent romantic angel which is never a bad thing. Other major difference is Swedish Mikael is looks older though American Mikael is the roughed hot man in his best age. No wonder American Lisbeth falls for him. Noomi Rapace is indeed the winner as Lisbeth but it doesn't mean Rooney Mara is in anyway less. She did a fantastic job as Lisbeth Salander, her Oscar nod and stardom is totally worth it. Rooney Mara has shown how an average looking girl can crush all the odds of success. Not for a second she looked like a starlet, she defiantly lived the character really well. Daniel Craig is really charismatic and pin perfect as Mikael Blomkvist. Robin Wright is alright. Joel Kinnaman has non speaking part. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard are great in it. Overall, David Fincher has directed an excellent movie in all aspects. The Girl with Dragon Tattoo has detailed and intriguing story and enticing performances to entertain us."
"Sergeant343","8","2","7","26 March 2012"," The girl with the dragon tattoo
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a murder mystery/thriller directed by David Fincher in which investigative journalist for Millennium Newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden Mikael Blomkvist(played by Daniel Craig). After being found guilty of libel is asked by Henrik Vanger(Christopher Plummer) former CEO of his family's company to stay on his family's island to the north to find out which one of his family members killed his niece over 40 years ago or if she is still alive under all while under the guise of him writing a memoir about him, promising in return a larger salary and evidence to prove he his libel to be false. He eventually garners help from the title character Lisbeth Slanader(played by Rooney Mara) who is a troubled young adult and ward of the state, but is an skilled investigator in her own right. I can't tell you how close it follows the book, but overall it is an entertaining and well put together film.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great, but Rooney Mara steal's the show with her performance which is one of the best this year, by getting completely into her role, from getting drunk the night beforehand to look hung over even though she herself is not a heavy drinker and getting stark naked multiple time throughout the movie, once being in one of the rape scenes, and the character herself gives the expression of someone who is dark and anti-social while keeping it fresh, even her accent sounds Swedish. Even though Craig's performance is not as good as Mara's, he still does a fine job acting a serious dramatic part, instead of just a pure action star which I have only seen him as until this point, but his English accent can get distracting at times. The film itself also has a large ensemble of Swedish actors which makes the setting all the more believable.<br/><br/>The on set locations for this movie added to that since of isolation and uneasiness Mikael felt throughout the movie when it starts out in the middle of winter and with Sweden at the time experiencing the worst winter in 20 years it definitely added to the feeling of the movie and with seasons changing throughout the movie it gave the viewer the feeling of months are actually passing by instead of keeping a similar looking environment throughout the year.<br/><br/>Despite all the pros about this film there are still faults to be had with it, the major one is introducing characters who have little to with the plot and forgetting them the rest of the movie. An example of this is when Lisbeth goes to fellow friend house to get a device to trace people's emails, you could say that is to show how she got the item, but there is another item later on in the movie showing her putting up surveillance cameras without showing how she got them, maybe that character got more time in the book, but in the movie he is pretty much useless as a character. Another fault of the movie is that I really never felt like I knew the family, sure there were small note cards, but not enough information to see them as characters and with them barely mentioning their names it was hard to tell who was who and who they hated, when they mentioned them and near the climax when they are piecing together the final parts of the mystery, like Mikael said, ""I think I am getting confused on who is who."" As I said before I enjoyed this movie and pros far outweigh the cons. 4/5 stars. Rated R for Strong Violence Strong Sexual themes Strong Language Drug and Alcohol use 2 hours and 37 minutes"
"jdkraus","9","2","7","24 March 2012"," Purely mature and well executed; it draws our attention to its craft, characters, and story
","""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is based off of the international bestseller of the same title, as well as the Swedish movie that was released in 2009. I have not read the book nor seen the Swedish film, so I did not know what to expect. Even so, I am drawn to this movie because of the name David Fincher‚Äîthe master of mysterious thrillers who brought us ""Seven"" and ""Fight Club."" As a film, Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is not so much focused on edge of your seat suspense or thrills, but rather two individuals who lead very different lives that end up paired together and entangled in a murderous case that involves a wealthy family. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist that is facing a lawsuit over publishing a libelous article. He is hired by a wealthy land baron (Christopher Plummer) to solve the 40 year-old disappearance of his niece Henrietta. He is teamed up with Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an antisocial Goth computer hacker that is a ward to the state. This all sounds like the makings of a great movie, but not enough to make a 158 minute feature.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is mostly spent on developing the characters Mikael and Lisbeth. Mikael is presented as not a very nice guy. He has an affair with his publicist. His personality is that of sarcasm and skepticism; he is surrounded by a world full of corruption, yet he can't outdo it. He only takes the land baron's job because he needs the money. Nevertheless, Daniel Craig's performance carries a solid, defiant confidence that can be seen in his past work as Agent 007. He never gives up and gets the job done at any means necessary (even at the expense of breaking and entering).<br/><br/>Lisbeth is not a perfect individual either. Unlike Mikael though, she is someone to both admire and pity. From the very start of the film, she is depicted as a person who is trying to survive on her own. Her apartment is small, unkempt, and she eats anything she can get her hands on (this includes Happy Meals). Little is known of her past, but what is shown in the film is a young woman that is engulfed by loneliness and sexual abuse. Her short temper and cold, blank stares are not a means to depict her as evil. Rather, they show her as a sympathetic, tormented soul that seeks to be loved. Rooney Mara performs this character flawlessly. Every second I saw her, I cannot help but feel her pain and I felt helpless that there was nothing I can do about it. Simultaneously, I applauded her for the brave actions she delivers in the second half of the film. Her Oscar nomination is well deserved.<br/><br/>David Fincher's technical team of people does a phenomenal job of putting together such an impressive film. The sound designers put a heavy use of SFX to help build scenes of tension. Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography is made up of fluid tracking shots and low-key lighting, which creates dimly lit sets that reflect the dark world that the characters are trapped in. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score creates a very eerie atmosphere that helps put the viewer right into the situations that the characters are in. Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter's editing (which both won Oscars for) is crisp, clean, and to the hilt with perfection.<br/><br/>However, what ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" lacks is story structure. It's not an issue of too much plot, but rather a story that feels rushed. For instance, the relationship that builds between Mikael and Lisbeth happens very quickly¬Öin fact so quick that it is almost ludicrous. In one scene, Lisbeth recoils when Mikael leans his arm over her. Ten minutes later in the movie, the two have aggressive sex. There is no breathing room for the characters to grow attracted to one another. Then again, it could be just a casual sex relationship, but I never got that assumption between Lisbeth and Mikael. The ending also runs into this problem‚Äîit is almost as if the screenwriters were running out of time and they tried to compress as much as they can in as fast as possible.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" does not drag in its pace, so the additional time it would have taken to fix these issues would not have damaged the overall film. It is better to have a three hour film that is not compressed in terms of plot than a 2.5 hour one that is squeezed tightly. Even so, I am glad that I have a copy of this movie and I will watch it multiple times. It is worth noting that this is a very disturbing film. It's not violent like a slasher flick, but it deals with graphic depictions of rape and torture. This is purely an adult movie‚Äîand a great one at that!"

","This is a long movie, very heavy on dialogue but the plot is actually quite simple. The identity of the villain is pretty obvious.<br/><br/>I have to say that I found this film to be extremely and relentlessly boring. The story could have been told in half of the running time allocated to this film.<br/><br/>The less than charismatic actors don't help either. Rooney Mara is better but she has a more interesting character. Lisbeth is eccentric but still not interesting enough to sustain the film.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig gives a boring performance of a boring character.

That said, I have seen both the Swedish version and American remake. Give me the voice over Swedish version, please.<br/><br/>Is it just me or do others look at Daniel Craig and see him sitting naked on a bottomless chair asking a man with a rope and ball to scratch an itch down there. I'm sorry, but this was one of the worst casting jobs of a starring role I have ever seen. Craig is simply not believable in the role of a magazine publisher. Next is Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara. Though Mara does a fine job as Lisbeth, there is so little depth to the character that I didn't care about her or what happened to her at all; OK I didn't care about Blomkvist either. The Swedish version provides clips of her past to partially explain why she is as she is. I came to care for what happened to that Lisbeth. Mikael's character is also much more defined in the Swedish version.<br/><br/>The two plots follow along pretty much the same path, but this version seems to be so utterly devoid of character development it feels like Martin's kitchen, sanitary and devoid of any decoration. Even Christopher Plummer falls short, and he never does that. Without the character development I felt like I was watching a movie instead of experiencing it. There is no emotional attachment as there is in the original.<br/><br/>I rated it a six only by refusing a comparison with the original. In comparison, I'd give it a 1. Watch the original and avoid this substandard remake."

Long story short, Craig is sent to investigate a long ago missing of a young woman belonging to a rich Sweden family. He gets help from an eccentric girl with a tattoo of a black dragon on her back. She is a master hacker, estranged and weird in terms of regular world. She doesn't fit in, but she is so skillful in computers and investigations.

Upon hearing all the fuss about the books I wanted to see for myself if this was one of those posthumous things. Well as many of you know it wasn't and the three books are some of the very best in their kind. Now I have read them and have recommended them almost to anyone I know and asks me about a good book.<br/><br/>That said about the books before watching the American version (and having watched the Swedish versions) I have to admit I was expecting to be disappointed in that I didn't expect it to be better or even the same as its Swedish counterpart. Well it was one of the best movies I saw in 2011 along with Drive.<br/><br/>Some people say that it does not smell of Sweden. Well the movie is a Hollywood film, and you can't expect from someone not of Swedish culture to depict aspects of Sweden as they truly are (they even forgot that Sweden uses Celcius and not Fahrenheit). If you judge the movie objectively and without having in mind the books and how much stuff from the books are missing as I hear a lot (which is true but also shouldn't matter) you will see that this movie as what it truly is, a thriller that won't let you stop watching even for a minute.<br/><br/>I also heard a lot that the movie has a lot of sex scenes and more nudity than it should. Well to those people I say that you are going to watch a thriller describing some of the darkest aspects of the human soul and mind so you can't expect unicorns and fairies except if they were carrying shotguns. I won't go as far to say that nudism is a form of art, I leave that to history to judge, but I truly didn't mind about the sex and nude scenes in this movie.<br/><br/>Enough of review other people's thoughts about the movie though. Rooney Mara is exceptional playing as Lisbeth Salander dark and showing that feeling of ambivalence we all have for her actions and truly deserves her nomination. Daniel Craig showed that he in not only good as James Bond but is capable of great emotion as well. All the cast performed very well and David Fincher used their assets to make an excellent film.<br/><br/>All in all I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has read the books or has seen the Swedish adaptations of the books and wants to compare, or anyone who wants to see a good thriller and an excellent movie."
"Sidney-17-477418","7","2","7","26 January 2012"," Same movie, different hero
","If you haven't seen the original this would be OK, definitely lighter. There are several things that make the original better. First of all, in the original Lisbeth kicks ass literally. She is not a victim, everything she does has a purpose and she doesn't hesitate. In this version (i don't know why) they take some of the puzzle solving from her making here more of a simple computer hacker and researcher. And they make her more human, more fragile, where in the original there's nothing of that. Another thing is that I thought that not knowing the cast was a good thing. When u see Nomi Rappace (Lisbeth in the original) u don't know what to expect until u see she kicking some guys ass on the subway. I give u that Rooney Mara is almost unrecognizable but the journalist shouldn't be 007. This guy is not a muscle hero, he's a hesitating journalist that in several moments of the movie is waiting to be rescued. I thought that this is a sugar coated version of the original with a fragile lead character lead to a male counterpart that doesn't quite convince. Again I tell u, this is a good flick, but I still prefer seen the one where Lisbeth steals the show."
"bart-leemans","9","2","7","24 January 2012"," Movie of the year came early this year.
","The Swedisch translation of the Stieg Larsson novel couldn't be more perfect in my eyes. The devotion of the actors in playing their role is excellent.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara played an incredible and truthful role as Lisbeth Salander. It is incredible how devoted she has played this role with a lot of violence and explicit scenes. Her real piercings and other visual characteristics, her Swedisch accent and her incredible acting skills made her a perfect Lisbeth Salander.<br/><br/>""The Immigrant Song"" cover by Trent Reznor and Karen O made a big impression to me as in the trailer as in the movie itself. It created a nice atmosphere for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>In the movie, there are a lot of dialogs, but they aren't as complicated as you have in a lot of other movies. Also, the dialogs are so well written, you never get bored during the entire movie, they are always followed by an action scene of something exciting that has happened. You really get into the story so you wont't notice the movies duration of 158 minutes.<br/><br/>Also the interaction with the main characters showed Dani√´l Craig in one of his better acting roles. The interaction between Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist is that convincing that you want to see a sequel as soon as the ending scene of this movie has passed.<br/><br/>It looks like David Fincher looked a lot at the original movie and improved all the shortcomings to make this film a perfect translation of the original story. The interaction between the characters is better and you feel like there is a lot more that needs to be said and done, hopefully in the sequel. Therefore I would - at this early time of the year - say it's the movie of the year.<br/><br/>I'm also convinced Rooney Mara will get an Oscar for this performance."
"MovieProductions","8","2","7","22 January 2012"," The Girl with the Insanely Good Movie
","***1/2 out of (****)<br/><br/>After waiting an impeccably long time for ""Tattoo"" to get the ball rolling into cinemas, a strong critical reception was promised. And I got that, but something was odd. Fincher's films typically are critically acclaimed with a solid praise, almost promising it's THE movie of the year (""The Social Network"", ""Benjamin Button"", and ""Zodiac"" anyone?). This..., this just got some solid word-of-mouth but strangely enough, no actual hoopla. With a more than prosperous book trilogy and Sweden film collection, how does Fincher's glossy and more polished, Americanized version stack up?<br/><br/>""Tattoo"" revolves around our central protagonist Lisbeth, played by the iconic Rooney Mara teams up with the co-star of the show, Daniel Craig. Together, they are on the hunt for the missing Harriet, who vanished nearly half a century ago. <br/><br/>Clocking in at an excessive 158 minutes, never once does this film drop the ball or lose its steam. Boasting an elaborate and rather oily opening credits sequence, what a way to kick off such a mesmerizing movie-going experience. First off, the performances here are just astonishing to say the least. Craig and Mara are the pitch perfect detective duo and give it their all. I can smell some Academy nominations. Moreover, the script of this film is extremely well written, with various amounts of attention to detail. And how the script is executed? Very competent, with every ounce of the script being projected in its fullest potential. <br/><br/>Now where this film shines is rather in the star power. Throughout the film, Lisbeth and Craig's character undergo this intimate love triangle (if you want to even call it that) and makes things especially interesting. But, speaking of intimate and personal, how is the much talked about rape scene? With all the buzz revolving around the three minute tragedy, I can definitely say I've seen worse, but this was still pretty brutal to watch. Don't get me wrong, rape is never an easy subject to touch on, but the execution here was just disturbing and gut- wrenching. <br/><br/>What about the score? Just the cherry on top. Trent Reznor fails to disappoint with this eerie and mostly engaging soundtrack. It definitely enhances this film on all levels. And last but not least, the cinematography is some of the best I've seen. The shots are simply beautiful and when there isn't your fair share of sex, rape, or violence going on, the atmosphere is definitely one to suck you in. <br/><br/>If there was a complaint I would have, it would be the pacing. The first two hours are paced brilliantly, with Fincher directed a very evenly paced and coherent picture. But those last 30+ minutes are edited just very choppy and it goes off the rails a bit after a smooth transition between the hours. <br/><br/>All in all, Fincher has another winner on its hands. The acting, the visuals, the plot, it's all there and it's all quite extraordinary. Is this movie as mind-blowing and earth-shattering as the hype persuades you to be? That's up to you, but personally, it didn't. But what we have here is still a solid picture that is more than deserving to be on a Top 10 list or two. We shall soon meet again Fincher."
"EdwardNashtonReeves","10","2","7","20 January 2012"," Oscar-worthy, Best film of 2011!!
","Wow, where to start? First I'll say that even if I rate many films as 10/10, this is one of those few whose real rating should be 1000/10.<br/><br/>Solely the opening sequence is Oscar-Worthy. Atmosphere is so good, photography is a masterpiece, everything seams authentic, even more special mention of sound design and beautiful music score by Trent Raznor and Atticus Ross. Simply enchanting! <br/><br/>I usually like thrillers and mysteries, but this one is even better. It's not only thriller, it's also drama and the characterization is strong and it shakes you all the time along. The plot actually contains two story lines, Vanger family and Lisbeth Salander, which eventually clash together, and each is fantastic by itself. Story is intriguing, it doesn't back out one bit from telling the ugly truth and it doesn't even soften it. It says straight in your face everything you need to know. With no sugar-coding at all.<br/><br/>Acting performances are fantastic! Rooney Mara simply IS Lisbeth Salander, so emotional, autistic, fragile, yet strong, intelligent, independent young woman, who can easily be a role model to many young women who have had it rough in life. She literally transforms into the role, who uncompromisingly takes lemons life gave her and turns them into lemonade without second thought about it. She truly does deserve our respect, Lisbeth, and Rooney Mara, a lovely young actress with very bright future. I know it is unpredictable to say who will win Oscar, but she has my vote, and I know I'll be disappointed if she doesn't get nominated. Her performance is hand to hand with Heath Ledger as the Joker, and my personal favorite film ever so far is The Dark Knight, so I know what I'm saying.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is also amazing as Mikael Blomkvist and quite different than in Bond movies, proving he is a great actor. Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer and Joely Richardson are especially good in this stellar award-winning cast and if any of them receives Supporting actor/actress Oscar nomination, it will be very much deserved. All episodic cast is also superb, notable mention goes to Geraldine James, Per Myrberg, Alan Dale and Goran Visnjic. Everybody was just... AMAZING! <br/><br/>So, David Fincher's film is a masterpiece which will not be forgotten in movie history! It is shocking, emotional, deep, clever and realistic, it won't leave anyone indifferent. I would give it more that 10/10 if I could and I know I'll buy a double DVD when it comes out.<br/><br/>Only thing left to say is... I can't wait for The Girl Who Played With Fire to be made and I hope it will be soon. If it is as half as good as this one, it will still get 10/10 from me.<br/><br/>Recommendation to see!!!"
"Thunarae","10","2","7","19 January 2012"," Old fashion thriller
","First of all I have to say that I didn't read the book or saw the other films. To me this was a first hand experience into a story I tried not to read about. This movie is an old fashion thriller. The story is really good and really dark but most of all, intense. With the prices of tickets getting higher and quality of films getting lower this one breaks the rule.<br/><br/>I advise people to go watch this. It tells an very good and gripping story. The acting is amazing, especially Rooney Mara (Lisbeth), however everyone does an awesome job. <br/><br/>We all know there are three books and we assume that they will be doing a second and a third movie and I can't wait."
"lasttimeisaw","8","2","7","18 January 2012"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo: 7/10
","David Fincher never fails me, even including the underwhelming THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (2008) (which I think I seriously need a re-watch), the American remake of THWTDT is as excellent as its Swedish archetype if not excels in every aspect. <br/><br/>Karen O's Led Zeppelin cover Immigrant Song serves as the explosive opening track and dovetails with Fincher's surreal MV-esque opening credit, instantly enhancing the thrill upon to an adrenaline-driven index, eye-dashing, jaw-dropping, so up-to-the-minute yet bespeaks its own attitude, a thriller hipster for this age. <br/><br/>The storyline slightly differs from the original Sweden version (the ending is more agreeable for me, a sympathetic outline of Lisbeth plainly strengthens her character with additional authenticity and pathos. I also prefer the cast in this American version, Daniel Craig manages to embellish his rugged complexion with an anti-Bond vulnerability and a morally passive average-Joe journalist, subjectively I opt him over Michael Nyqvist. As for Rooney Mara, under Fincher's guidance, her Tomboy bent (inwardly in particular) has been exploited to an uppermost bloom, the rape-and-vengeance scenes are the aces in the hole (with a more genial appearance of the pervert by Yorick van Wageningen), compared to Noomi Rapace, I just admire Mara more and it's super to see her to re-enact such a ground-breaking female role fervently and sparks dynamically in just 2 years. I must say she is a more attractive girl to any extent . Among the supporting group, Stellan is creepily swell and happy to see a Penn-free Robin Wright with her new look, fringe does make a difference! <br/><br/>Trent & Atticus Ross' score is another feat (after a victory foray in THE SOCIAL NETWORK 2010 with new buddy Fincher), the pervasive, humming, quasi-vibration background soundtrack is like a prolonged Post-Rock/Experimental album, highlights the narrative turbulence along the way, until the notoriously basement scene about slaughter fetish. Also Jeff Cronenweth's stunning cinematography is another Oscar-bait, good luck on the Oscars, after snagging a surprising DGA nomination for Fincher and a steady Box Officer implementation, I hope it could make some upheaval in this year's languid Oscar race."
"luzian-friedrich","10","2","7","14 January 2012"," Really an improvement
","Craig is a really fine actor as well as Rooney Mara. And Fincher is maybe the most interesting director working today. Even though ""The Social Network"" was not as critically as i wished (regarding the disadvantages of www), it shows how impressive a David Fincher work can look.<br/><br/>I've although seen the Swedish version, but noomi racpace was a little to old and to muscular for this part. Not that it was bad, but Mara fits so much more in this Lisbeth-Salander-thing that it is obviously who makes the better interpretation.<br/><br/>I hope that SONY will stand by what the say and convince Fincher to end his ""own"" Trilogy just like Nolan with his Batman thing.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed and recommend the movie to everybody who's interested in adult, thrilling and feel-bad movies of cause! 9 or maybe 9.5/10 for one of the best entertaining movies in the last 12 months"

","David Fincher is one of my favorite directors so I was very excited to see this automatically, and when I did I was taking away by how well this was made all the way from the acting, music, scenery, visual effects, story was simply amazing. What Rooney Mara's character had to go thru in the movie was hard to see sometimes but if you like that kind of intensity you will not be disappointed, Daniel Craig nailed it in his performance. Reminds me of Seven and how it kept you at the edge of your seat with memorable scenes and pure strength on the deliver of everything. The dark tone of the film is too much for some , but you must understand the mystery of this film simply asks for it, the wonder of whats going to happen next, who did what, to whom and when, the only gripe I have is the ending because I wanted more of what is surely to come. Worth the price of admission and I hope there will be some Oscars given away for this amazing film. Loved it!"
"neil-476","8","2","7","12 January 2012"," Good adult entertainment
","I had not read any of the books or seen any of the Swedish movies, so I knew relatively little about this. The first hour sees us alternating between two unrelated stories. In one, journalist Mikael Blomquist (Daniel Craig), having been disgraced in court over a libellous story, finds himself engaged to investigate, under the guise of writing a family history, the disappearance many years ago of the then-teenage granddaughter of industrialist Hennk Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Vanger's family turns out to be massively dysfunctional - they live in houses within walking distance of each other, but haven't spoken in years. The other story concerns Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), the dragon tattoo girl of the title (not to mention various other tattoos, piercings, odd haircut, and various other signposts which shout ""Attitude!"" Lisbeth is a ward of the state, answerable to a nasty piece of work who demands sexual favours in return for letting her have access to her own money. After an hour, Blomquist finds himself on the trail of a serial killer and engages Salander as a research assistant.<br/><br/>The story is dense and involving, the characters are all strong, Lisbeth Salander is one of the most fascinating fictional characters I have encountered for years, and a number of things happen which I didn't expect. There was a lot here which I really enjoyed - the resolution of Lisbeth's rape, the final follow up to Blomquist's libel defeat, Rooney Mara's performance, the way the story was told.<br/><br/>I couldn't always understand the dialogue (there is a mixture of native Swedish speakers and English speakers, some of whom affect a Swedish accent, some of whom don't). I would have liked to see a more saturated colour palette at times But overall, this unexpectedly long movie (nearly two and a half hours) is an entertaining experience throughout, and I recommend it."
"robbywithnoie","9","2","7","11 January 2012"," My Movie of 2011
","It will be nearly impossible for me to give an unbiased, objective review of this film without bringing any context or personal mumbo jumbo into it. So I suppose it's better that I not even try, and just talk about this as I see fit.<br/><br/>I'll first start out by saying I'm a fanatic of the series of books to which this is based on, and a modest fan of the Swedish film adaptations of those books. They weren't perfect, but I wouldn't call any of them letdowns - not by a long shot. Naturally though, skepticism arose when the American adaptation (then thought of as a ""remake"") was announced. To me that skepticism was not only called for, it was nearly essential. I felt as if it could go two ways: it could be a ""Hollywood"" over simplification of the source material, which would obviously include shameless censoring of the source's graphic sexual violence (necessity be damned); or it could be a simple carbon copy of the original film (not unlike another American adaptation of a Swedish novel/film, Let Me In).<br/><br/>Luckily, David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is neither of those. The film is not only a more faithful adaptation of the novel, but it also might be even more brutal and, for some, traumatizing than the Swedish original.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the story of Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist whose reputation had been squandered by a libel suit, who is hired to solve a 40+ year-old mystery with the aid of the title character, the asocial Lisbeth Salander. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, as a novel, is of a story and style that is unmistakeably Swedish; from the pacing, to the seemingly endless cramming-in of detail, to Sweden's government system working its own way into the plot progression, Sweden is as essential to the novel as any character, plot progression, theme, what have you. It would be a crime to Americanize the story, in both setting and style. Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian made the correct decision of keeping the setting of Sweden and simply having the characters' language masked by English. For some this can be confusing, as the Swedish guardianship system that Lisbeth Salander is under is never fully explained in the film as it is in the books; however if you pay attention, and just go with it, I think you'll get the hang of it just fine.<br/><br/>Speaking of Salander, Rooney Mara is exceptional in the role. She shows a side of vulnerability and fear that is locked away in Lisbeth, more so, I think, than Noomi Rapace did nearly three years ago. As far as the other, less noted protagonist of the film Mikael Blomkvist, the casting of Daniel Craig was yet another source of skepticism for me; I simply couldn't think of him being able to pull off Blomkvist in his more sensitive and vulnerable moments. However, Craig shines as brightly as Mara, and the two sport a chemistry equal to that of the leading man and woman in the Swedish film.<br/><br/>Even at a length exceeding two and a half hours, I couldn't find myself bored with this film once. Humorous dialogue exchanges are perfectly timed to give us a break from the tension when needed, and those moments never feel tacked on. This film successfully brings me back into the world of the Millennium trilogy in a way that not even the Swedish film could; though I feel that to still be excellent, Fincher's adaptation has more breathing room, and I feel as if I'm seeing this bleak universe unfold before my eyes. I love this film, and ultimately the book series, for the same reasons that I love shows like Twin Peaks or Breaking Bad; they're dark, ominous, kinda messed up, but at the same time, enthralling and ridiculously entertaining. It is, without a doubt, one of the most exhilarating viewing experiences I've had this year."
"phd_travel","8","2","7","9 January 2012"," Rooney Mara gives a stunning performance as a most unorthodox heroine
","The most memorable thing about this movie must watching the anti-heroine Lisbeth. Rooney Mara gives and unforgettable performance. She played the European street urchin so well that if I didn't know she was an American I would never have guessed it. Her persona is so effectively weird and yet totally fascinating. For what she went through for this role she deserves some awards for sure.<br/><br/>I found that as a film adaptation it was good. There are things I didn't like about the story itself though.<br/><br/>Casting: As the central reporter character Daniel Craig looks suitably weatherbeaten to be a middle aged Scandinavian. Christopher Plummer is always a welcome stately presence - how does he do it at his age? Joely is good. Stellan is suitable. Robin Wright came across as not very European even though she tried to put a slight accent on. Would have been better with someone like Kristin Scott Thomas. Anyway liked that they all had slight but not overly obtrusive Swedish accents.<br/><br/>Production is good - the cold and depressing Scandinavian city and countryside in winter feel really comes through. <br/><br/>I didn't read the books or watch the Swedish film versions so I came to watch this movie not knowing much about what was in store. There are problems with the story that it's not fair blame the movie for. For example: if she was so smart how come she was in such a pathetic position before. Surely she would have got out her financial problems by some other scheme. Also how she became such a Mission Impossible agent in Zurich is far fetched though the transformation is fun to watch. The story had some twists for the sake of twists. The salacious bits are too unpleasant. The lesbianism is just there to titillate. The sexual violence is distasteful. But these are all faults of the storyline and the film is bound by the story. Some of the details are a bit rushed for people who are unfamiliar wi th the story as time is short. Whatever the faults, the complex and scary Lisbeth is just thoroughly engrossing from start to finish. It's quite a feat that the story makes you on her side and triumph in her successes.<br/><br/>Overall its an atmospheric transporting experience with a real European mystery feel that I haven't felt since good old movies like The Odessa File. The story may be a little too unpleasant in parts. However in the end the character of Lisbeth - one of the most unusual and unlikely heroes in the history of movies makes this worth a watch for mature audiences."
"SheldonChau","8","2","7","8 January 2012"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)
","As a film, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO succeeds. An an adaptation, it is frustrating. As a remake, it is pointless. <br/><br/>Fincher's film does many things very, very well. The characters are extremely well-cast - Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara both impressively fit the roles of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander in both attitude and physicality, much more so than their Swedish counterparts; the production design is stunning - the bigger budget pays off as the settings and atmosphere feel much colder and moodier in the snowy and eerie town of Hedestad; and the pacing, after things are rapidly established, flows smoothly with a careful balance of tension, patience, and story development. The film is a finely-crafted thriller that is carried by the performances of its two leads, both of whom showcase great chemistry with one another and admirably so in the depths of a dark, disturbing, and mysterious world. <br/><br/>As a remake a mere two years after the original, however, this film had to have been beyond great in order to warrant its existence, and quite frankly, it is not. Every character not only speaks English but does so each with varying accents, despite being set in Sweden, and although viewers are expected to suspend their disbelief, it's tough to do so given the inconsistencies in seeing English news channels with Swedish words, or fully Swedish newspaper articles found through an English-based Google search. How Fincher could have solved this problem is an enigma within itself, therefore confirming that this adaptation was never necessary. Add to that a horrific and awfully out-of-place opening sequence in addition to an obnoxious and unremarkable score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross and you have a really good film that is oddly enough a disappointment. <br/><br/>For the record, like its Swedish counterpart, TATTOO fails to fully encompass the scale of Stieg Larsson's novel, which is somewhat forgivable given its various restrictions, but likewise, the brutality was not brutal enough, the characterizations were not fully realized, and the impact of it all failed to achieve both a climax that should have been more powerful and a relief for the characters and the audience that should have likened a gigantic breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>With that said, TATTOO is still nevertheless a very solid film from a talented and experienced team. Pic is recommended, but depending on where the viewer is coming from, it will be a widely assorted experience."
"cultfilmfan","10","2","7","8 January 2012"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is based upon the novel of the same name by Stieg Larsson and was previously made into a film in 2009 starring Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace and directed by Niels Arden Oplev. This American version of the book (the other version I mentioned was Swedish), stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara and is directed by David Fincher. First off I would like to say that I have never read the book of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, or seen the Swedish adaptation either. I know that a couple of years ago the book became immensely popular among avid readers and that two sequels were released with the books and shortly after with the three films done in Sweden and now we have the American version of the first book and film. So having never read the book or having seen the Swedish version, I am going into this film as a newcomer unfamiliar with all of it. When the film first started playing a cover version of Led Zeppelin's The Immigrant Song, to some poorly conceived opening credits, I really had no idea whether I would like this film, or not, and to be honest it did take me a little while to get into it and used to the style of the whole thing, but once I adjusted and got used to the characters and what was going on in the film, I found myself totally enthralled with it and absolutely loving it. The film will definitely not be for everyone because it is very dark and macabre and features some very graphic violence, which I am sure will turn some viewers off. That being said I found the film to be absolutely fascinating. I am not going to give away any of the plot, because many of you going to see it I am sure will have been familiar with either the book, or should I say books, or films. If you have never seen any of them like myself, you will be so captivated by what is going on, you will need no previous knowledge of the films, or books in which to enjoy it. I thought the acting here by the entire cast was absolutely fantastic. Each person did the best job they possibly could and in a film like this, that means taking many risks and even doing a lot of quite physical and demanding work and they all did a terrific job. If the Oscars gave an award for best overall cast in a movie, this should certainly be one of the nominees. The actors each had their own personality to the characters and further enhanced what made them intriguing, different, or even evil. I must also give huge credit to the novelist Stieg Larsson and screenwriter Steve Zaillian, because both have created characters here that are so multi dimensional and they have so many different sides to them that we are not only intrigued and fascinated by them, but we also want to learn even more about them and because of the strong characterization and development we feel for these characters whether it be pity, empathy, or downright fear. I also liked how the characters evolved as the film went on and they were not just the typecast characters that I thought they would be. The film is a mystery and there is so much going on in this film, but it all plays out so well that none of it is boring, or feels useless and the way they crafted and put everything together like this was absolutely brilliant. The musical score as well as the lighting, cinematography and direction further gave depth and feeling to the mood of the film and at types we would feel really fearful, or in a state of suspense, or other times shocked, or even intrigued by what we had just watched. This is a dark and macabre little movie and like I said, it would definitely not be for everyone, but I credit the filmmakers for going with it and not shying away from anything and just producing a sometimes hard to watch, but overall fascinating and mysterious masterpiece. Everything about this film is so masterfully constructed, I think as lot of major film buffs would find it hard not to love, or find a lot to like about this film. The film's director David Fincher directed 2010's The Social Network, which I considered to be the absolute best film of that year and here again he impressed me very much and made what I consider to be the best film of 2011. This guy is definitely going places and has the talent and resume to prove it. This is a hands down masterpiece."

","I know you guys loved the DRAGTAT girl, but c'mon you gotta admit there's a lotta hilarious CAMPY scenes in that movie, such as: 1) The exquisite soft-core porn scene, where DRAGTAT girl is ambushed and chained to a bed by the fat state guardian guy. He exposes her naked bottom as she squirms like a wild beast. Finally, she stumbles through the streets and up to her apartment, barely being able to walk, after being back-doored in the guardian's apt. I was biting my lip the whole time to keep from LOL! 2) DRAGTAT girl's back-door revenge sequence: The whole thing is the most absurdly beautiful feminist fantasy imaginable (shades of Ken Russell & Kathleen Turner). I just wish I could remember her quote about never doing this before (tattooing) and there being lots of pain. 3) The DG torture scene is priceless. I love that harness and insurance-scam neck brace combo, and then the plastic bag was suffocatingly funny. Who could ask for more? Well, the movie just keeps giving! The evil industrialist makes DC hold a drink while all spassed-out in that outrageous harness. Now that's a really cool villain with a diabolical sense of humor. But, just in the nick of time, DRAGTAT girl saves DG from being sliced up. After ripping off the plastic bag, she later asks to finish off the Nazi industrialist: ""May I kill him?"" The delivery of this line is worthy of Schwarzenegger's Terminator line, ""I'll be back."" However, I must admit that I was sad to see the pathetic sap played by DG escape his well deserved fate. 4) To pull off an amazing reverse scam, DRAGTAT girl disguises herself as, believe it or not, a normal looking girl. Whoa! Mission Impossible anyone? I predict that DRAGTAT GIRL will one day be a cult classic like Rocky Horror, and people will go to midnight shows dressed like DRAGTAT Girl or Fat State Guardian Guy or Pathetic Neck-Brace-Harness Guy or even as Normal Looking Girl (just to throw others off). Enthusiastically, they will yell classic one-liners from the movie, such as: - Sometimes he performs cunnilingus on her. Not often enough in my opinion. - BTW, do you like A-sex? - Keep in mind that I'm crazy, won't you? In fact, this remake should have been a MUSICAL in the Rocky Horror style.

With the film 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo', directed by Fight Club director, David Fincher, many fans of the book that the film's based on were cautious, since there has been a Swedish film that was faithful to the fist book of three. I, myself, was as cautious as them, only it was due to Fincher's last film, 'The Social Network'. Many had been pleased with the film about Facebook creator, Mark Zuckerberg, mostly due to being users of the site. Even though I've used the site as well, I can't help but feel that the film had lacked much character into this and that Eisenberg, who portrayed Zuckerberg in the film, gave a performance of a golden toaster; might look impressive, but there's not much to it. Now with David Fincher's newest film, what can be said about it. Well, it can easily be past as a much better film than Social Network will be to me.<br/><br/>With what the story goes, Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner and author for Millennium Magazine, and is now being hired to solve the case of the disappearance of the great niece of Henrik Vanger, played by Christopher Plummer. While finding some clues, he then calls upon Lisbeth Salander, played by Rooney Mara, to help him out, all while developing a strong relationship together. For being one of my most anticipated movies of the year, I had high hopes thinking it would be one of the best films I've seen this year, with all the hype it's been getting. But alas, it's not as much as they say it to be. Granted, it wasn't anywhere CLOSE to bad, but it was still kinda underwhelming. Though, I still would watch this more times and find it more developed than 'The Social Network', even if 'Dragon Tattoo' is two hours and forty minutes long. The performances delivered by each of the actors was well done and didn't in the slightest bore me, with much suspense given to the story, and not once using jumps to scare the everliving pants off us. It takes it's time with it, bringing up to the strong ending that the characters will have to deal with. Even though I never read the book, nor did I watch the Swedish versions, I found it to still be a good film at the least.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' is an exciting thriller with excellent acting from a great cast of people, and with some scenes, you'd know why they would give this film an 'R' rating. It's not done so much, to what most comedies today want to do, but in the essence of making an exciting thriller."
"PartialMovieViewer","6","2","7","5 January 2012"," Well Done Redo but Why Redo So Soon?
","I would like to sit here and whine about this being a rip-off of the original (and actually - it was - but it was well done.) The directing and acting was as good as the original. I wish the movie had centered more around the life of Lizbeth ‚Äì but she never played James Bonds ‚Äì so she just doesn't cut it. One also had to give a pass on content. This is such an in depth story, the movie's writers, directors and producers had to leave some things out (mind you ‚Äì they all did an excellent job ‚Äì just about as good as the 2009 version ‚Äì did I mention this story was done in 2009?). I know many people were ripping their hair out saying stuff like, 'I can't believe they left that out.', or, 'They forgot about this.' It always happens and it happened with the original 2009 version (oh yeah ‚Äì they just did this movie in 2009). It was a well acted movie but I would not give it a look as far as awards go. The movie was only done in 2009 ‚Äì and the older version was also an excellent example of super direction, production and acting."

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a prime example of why you should pay attention to the messages a given movie is trying to send before heading willy-nilly into a theater. This is a film that is based upon a deeply disturbing series of books that spawned a deeply disturbing series of foreign films and which features the tagline, ""The feel bad movie of Christmas."" If you read between the lines here, I believe you should be able to make an educated guess as to the kind of movie this really is.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist whose career appears to be over. After publishing a scathing expose on a powerful Swedish businessman, Blomkvist is sued for libel and is found guilty, a finding that will cost him his life savings, his reputation, and a short prison sentence. At a loss for what to do next, Blomkvist takes a meeting with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), an aging but prominent corporate leader. Blomkvist is presented with a proposition that turns out to be more tempting that he could have ever imagined. Vanger promises to give Blomkvist the evidence he needs to clear his name and in exchange, Blomkvist will attempt to solve a mystery that has vexed the old man for 40 years: the murder of Harriet, Vanger's niece and favorite family member who went missing at the age of 16. With the help of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a socially stunted but immensely valuable private investigator, Blomkvist soon finds himself embroiled in a vast and complex cover up that threatens to consume every aspect of his life.<br/><br/>To describe Dragon Tattoo as ""rough"" would require that you change the definition of the word. More like ""exceptionally brutal"" and ""not at all something you'd want to see with your parents."" I feel sorry for anyone who made the mistake of taking a post-Santa trip to the theater with the family without knowing for sure what they were getting themselves into. I was 14 when Titanic debuted and I had a number of friends who had their Christmas Day movie with the family ruined by the unexpected awkwardness of Kate Winslet's breast popping up on the screen. Dragon Tattoo is approximately one hundred thousand times worse. Even the opening credits are a bit demented (though visually stunning) and that's just a sample of the brutality that follows. Dragon Tattoo is about as raw as it gets for a mainstream movie and despite the fact that I had read the book and knew what to expect, it still made me squirm more than once.<br/><br/>If you can get past the cringe factor, Dragon Tattoo is a quality but ultimately flawed film. Director David Fincher put together a fantastic cast filled with actors who fit their roles perfectly. Led by Craig's usual calm and understated demeanor, the performances within this film are strong to quite strong, though none compare to the work of Rooney. I don't think this is an Oscar-caliber portrayal but it is certainly one that will move her to the top of the list for a number of high profile roles over the next few years. And as always with a Fincher film, the technical aspects of Dragon Tattoo are exquisite. From the score to the shot selection, this is barely a step down from The Social Network, which was nearly perfect from a behind-the-camera standpoint. Fincher uses every element like it belongs to his directorial Swiss army knife, heightening the intensity here, providing subtle detail there. Fincher is the master of creating imperceptible tension within each audience member, building it until you suddenly realize that you're sitting on the edge of your seat and your heart is pounding. In this regard, Dragon Tattoo provides the perfect subject matter.<br/><br/>But where the film struggles is in the way Fincher tries to tell a convoluted, web-like story. In the book, author Stieg Larsson weaves together several stories that don't initially seem to connect in the beginning and he does so in excruciating detail. It is a slowburn of a read but one that I found compelling. In order to present every concept within the book, however, Fincher makes the mistake of jamming almost every ounce of story from the source material into the film. The first third of the movie, then, moves at a rapid pace that doesn't fit the story, the characters, or even the actors. There's a hint of Aaron Sorkin in the dialogue but it doesn't contain the expert craftsmanship that usually accompanies a Sorkin script and it doesn't fit Craig's brand of subdued acting. Moreover, Fincher tries to pack an excessive amount of information into the first act and none of it connects very well. As a result, we get a number of short, choppy scenes that don't flow together and make it quite difficult to settle in. I'm a big fan of Fincher overall but I think Dragon Tattoo displays his limitations, or at least his weaknesses. Far from Fincher's master work, it is nonetheless an intriguing and worthwhile film that you may not want to take in on a full stomach."
"morrison-dylan-fan","9","2","7","2 January 2012"," David Fincher's take on the first part of the Millennium Trilogy.
","Looking at the critical praise in 2005 of Robert Rodriguez ultra-violent comic Film-Noir Sin City,seemed to suggest a good possibility that violent Film-Noir would be making an impact in Hollywood.Sadly,with Rodriguez unsure over the follow-up,and Sin City's own creator,Frank ""Robocop 3"" Miller showing everyone why he should be kept 100 yards away from a movie camera with his 2008 Noir-stylised adaption bomb of Will Einer's The Spirit,any sign of a mainstream Noir movement in Hollywood seemed to die almost as soon as it had started.Luckally,something very exciting was bubbling away in a part of Europe called Scandinavia.Perhaps, not since the Italian Giallo genre had caved in has a Noir influence movement become so connected with one location in Europe,with the Nordic Noir movement delivering such smash hits as Henning Mankell's Wallander novels/adaptation's and the transatlantic surprise hit TV series The Killing.And whist these and many others have made a huge impact on Noirdic Noir,there has always been one trilogy of novels at the very top of the Nordic list:the Millennium Trilogy by investigating journalist Stieg Larsson (1954-2004),and with having been a huge fan Niels Arden Oplev's wonderful 2009 take on the first part of the trilogy,I became extremely excited,when earlier this year it was announced that David Fincher was going to deliver a 90 million dollar take on this Noir epic. <br/><br/>The Plot:<br/><br/>After losing a court case over articles printed in Millennium magazine about businessmen Hans- Erik Wennerstom, investigative journalist,and Millennium editor Mikael Bloomkvist attempts to go underground.How ever,during the Christmas period Mikael gets a phone call,from one of Sweden's wealthiest men: Henrik Vanger, asking him to come visit him for a paternally high-paying job.When Bloomkvist arrives at the ""Vanger Island"",he is told to pretend to be writing a memoir on Henrik .After being given the alibi, Henrik tells Mikael that the real reason he is offering to pay him very well (and to also pay any of the magazines future legal costs)is that, for the last 40 years he has spent every moment of his life trying to find out who murdered his great-niece Harriet Vanger,who ""disappeared"" one evening shortly before the Vanger family (whoses history has some extremely strong ties to the Nazi party) sat down for dinner.And with his health starting to fade,Henrik feels that the only option he has left is to ask Bloomkvist to look at the case.Eventally accepting the offer,Bloomkvist is left shocked,when he is told by Henrik,that to make sure he was ""clean"" a Goth Cyber Punk computer hacker called Lisbeth Salander had been given the job of hacking into Mikaels computer,to look into his activates.Attempting to get to grips with what he has gotten himself into,Mikael begins to read Harriet's diary,where he discovers on the very last page a row with 10 different initials.Suspecting that he is stumbling onto something that only Harriet had found before,Bloomkvist forces Henrik to give him the details of Salander's location. <br/><br/>Operning her front door,Lisbeth is shocked to see Bloomkvist come face to face with her.Convining Salander that he is not here to attack her, (although she does still secretly get hold of a taser,due to recently having had to battle her ""guardian"" after he had brutally raped her)Mikael begins to explain to Salander,that since he has been shown the undercover work that she did on him,he strongly feels that she will be able to spot the smallest detail in this 40 year old case.And although Salander is at first uneasy around him, they both soon discover that what seems to be a missing person case,is in fact something much more disturbing... <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>With being a fan of the original 2009 Swedish adaption,the other main ingredient that got me very excited about this film was the one of my all time top three favourite musicians (Trent ""Nine Inch Nails"" Reznor) was re-teaming with his wife Mariqueen Maandig and fellow How To Destroy Angels band member Atticus Ross to deliver the score for this movie.Whilst the score surprisingly stays away from the aggression that Reznor displays under the Nine Inch Nails name,all three musicians create an absolutely perfect backdrop for the film,with the soundtracks brilliant mix of snow-like Ambiant electronics and a more abrasive Post-Rock sounds perfectly expresses the films mood of fragile pain and burning-red anger. One of the most interesting aspects about both versions of Larsson's Nordic Noir is that the two different team of screenwriters both demonstrate that the films main plot line of the missing girl is almost impossible not to get hooked into.For his gripping take on the events,American Gangster screenwriter Steven Zaillian cleverly builds up the films mystery and characters at a gradually pace,which gives the movie a strong HBO-style edge,thanks to Zaillian having the down-beat grim side of the main characters lives slowly become laced with the mystery elements of the film.Despite being the only performer in the film who stays away from adopting a Swedish accent,Daniel Craig still gives a strong performance as Mikael Bloomkvist,which wisely only allows the characters softer side to be seen in only a few glimpses,and for the rest of the film to have him be wonderfully gruff,which is highlighted most in the film when Mikael brushes away everyone and everything around,as he and the audience become completely obsessed in finding even the smallest clue to the expanding case.After reading that director David Fincher had to go through a huge amount of battles for his chosen leading actress,I was absolutely thrilled to see Rooney Mara give an astonishing performance as Femme Fatale Lisbeth Salander.Along with showing a stunning,bubbling burning rage,Mara shows a chilling,perfectly executed fragile side to Salander,that along with Fincher's brilliantly atmospheric ""wilderness"" directing make this an intense,edge of the seat thrilling, modern (Nodic-influence) Film Noir epic. <br/><br/>Final view on the film:<br/><br/>A truly chilling Nordic Film Noir,with tense,atmospheric directing,a mostly rock-solid screenplay,a wonderfully haunting score and an astonishingly deeply raw and fragile performance"

","Rooney Mara is great in the role of the girl. Daniel Craig proves beyond a doubt he is more than the cookie cutter James Bond. David Fincher brings The Social Network direction experience to a different type of story. Granted I have not read the books, or seen the Sweden Version.<br/><br/>This is a solid movie and since it is it runs long telling the story. There are twists, turns, dark alleys, blood, rape, explosions but yet the majority of the film is drama/mystery. The movie does what it is supposed to do, pull in the viewer and make them wonder what is happening next.<br/><br/>That is what a well told story that is well acted and direction is supposed to do. It succeeds on all levels and presents some brutal sequences and throws a lot of seedy characters around making the viewer wonder what is going to happen next. Leaves open a sequel at the end and seems like it would be very possible as to my view, there is more about the tattoo girl to explore. That is the reason it is not a perfect movie.<br/><br/>This one does a good job following the book, and watching it a second and third time makes it better, sign of a great movie."
"moviexclusive","9","2","7","29 December 2011"," The rare Hollywood remake that's even better than the Swedish original, this is a first-rate edge-of-your-seat thriller that's exceedingly gripping from start to finish
","Why the venerable David Fincher would attempt a Hollywood remake of the first-rate Swedish thriller 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' may seem perplexing at first, but just wait till you see what Fincher has brought to his adaptation of the popular Stieg Larsson pulp novel. Indeed, though Niels Arden Oplev's film may have been the first out of the gate, it is Fincher's that proves to be the superior one, for the auteur's return to twisted serial-killer territory is an even more heart- stopping, gripping and altogether exhilarating edge-of-your-seat movie than its predecessor.<br/><br/>As his work with 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac' will attest, Fincher is no stranger to dark, disturbing material. 'Tattoo' is no different; here is a bleak and brutal story of crime and punishment that features scenes of sadistic rape, twisted torture, and grotesque religiously-inclined murders. It is a tale of uncompromising savagery, and Fincher seems right at home, combining the lurid elements inherent within Larsson's tale with the sharp procedural rigour of his earlier 'Zodiac'.<br/><br/>Following an edgy and utterly mesmerising title sequence set to Trent Reznor's rip of Led Zeppelin's 'The Immigrant Song', the remake opens with Stockholm-based magazine journalist Mikael Bolmkvist (Daniel Craig) losing a high-profile libel suit filed by corrupt businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg). Facing bankruptcy and the reputational ruin of the magazine Millennium he co-publishes with his married on-again/ off-again lover Erika Berger (Robin Wright), Mikael accepts an unusual offer from industrial magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the unsolved murder of his beloved niece Harriet 40 years ago.<br/><br/>Henrik is convinced that Harriet's disappearance was an act of murder by a member of his sprawling family, which he describes as a collection of ""thieves, misers, bullies, and basically the most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet"". Enticed by Vanger's reward of a hefty paycheck and payback against Wennerstrom down the road, Mikael moves into a cottage on Henrik's vast estate and meets with his various family members under the guise of being tasked with writing their family biography. <br/><br/>Whereas the Swedish original wasted little time bringing together Mikael and the computer punk-goth genius Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), Hollywood veteran screenwriter Steven Zaillian keeps them apart for pretty much the first half of the movie. The parallel narratives allow us to delve deeper into the Millennnium trilogy's most compelling character, whose startling physical appearance is simply an extension of her troubled inner persona. That personality is amply expressed through two of the film's most unsettling scenes- the first, a brutal rape by her legally assigned guardian Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen); and the second, her coolly calculated act of revenge against Bjurman. If those scenes left you squirming the first time round, you may want to cover your eyes here, for Fincher stages them unflinchingly for maximum shock value.<br/><br/>Perhaps even more than Oplev managed to, Fincher evokes empathy from his audience for Lisbeth. It is no easy task- how does one identify with a teenage girl who lives on Happy Meals and caffeine and wears a T-shirt that reads ""F**k You, You F**king F**k""? But beyond her tough-girl hard- as-nails exterior, Fincher guides Mara to tone down her character's feral nature and draw out Lisbeth's vulnerabilities. There is a fragility to Mara's spellbinding portrayal of Lisbeth that is missing from Noomi Rapace's in the original, so even though Mara doesn't succeed in topping Rapace's star-making turn, she too disappears just as convincingly into the role. <br/><br/>Mara also shares great rapport with her co-star Craig, and though both hold their own on their own, the film truly sizzles after the latter's Mikael tracks her down to be his research assistant. Despite the sombreness of the material, Zaillian injects some brief moments of levity through Mikael and Lisbeth's wry chemistry, bouncing theories off each other like offbeat detectives while sifting through Biblical clues and old photographs. Fincher has been infamous for being extremely meticulous in his filmmaking, and that discipline pays off with a crystal clarity he brings to the investigative procedural. More so than the original, there is both paceyness and coherence to the storytelling- with due credit to Zaillian for adroitly paring the excesses of the novel into a lean and efficient cinematic adaptation. <br/><br/>Despite the almost two-and-a-half-hour duration, you'll find yourself hooked the entire time, unable to pull yourself away from the arrestingly intense atmosphere permeating the whole movie. Assembling once again his 'Social Network' team- made up of composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, as well as editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall- Fincher uses their considerable talents to construct a sense of forebodingness with a haunting score and evocative cinematography of the frosty Scandinavian landscape.<br/><br/>If there is one quibble, it is that the actors' accents (English with a Swedish inflection) don't always ring true- especially Craig, who thankfully drops his sometimes indecipherable Swedish intonation early on in the film in favour for a straight-out British one. And yes, it is but a minor flaw in an otherwise pitch-perfect thriller, where everything- from atmosphere to storytelling to casting to characterisation- is done to a T and coheres so flawlessly to create a taut, riveting and adrenaline-pumping movie experience. It's not often we say this- but even if you've read the books, and seen the Swedish original, this superior first-rate Hollywood adaptation is a must-see.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

","This movie was quite exceptionally done. It has a really compelling story that keeps going deeper and deeper. There isn't a whole lot of action in this but when there is it is explosive. If you like any other David Fincher movies chances are this will keep you engaged until the very end. Lots of dialog with a big mystery revolving around the whole movie. Rooney Mara is amazing at portraying Lisbeth and Daniel Craig is genius as always. Christopher Plumber has picked another great movie to act in. In the end this is by far Fincher's best film so everyone go see it and be ready to be disgusted and amazed. I'm an avid movie watcher so I know what I'm talking about."

Pay attention! It's really cool how it's done!<br/><br/>This movie also has that sophisticated European foreign film feel that's so unlike the pacing of American movies. I kept asking is this what it's like in Sweden? Geez! Their welfare system really sucks as well. You'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>This movie DOES take you to an alternate unsettling world of daily dysfunctional and abusive family life in another country with a history dealing with its own serial killer who's never been found for 40 years.<br/><br/>I'ld have to say without a doubt Rooney Mara's performance is on line with Batman's Heath Ledger's ""Joker"" in the way they completely and totally become another person never seen before but is made to look quite real and unsettling. They both out do Brando and Dean in this respect. It's fascinating to watch an actor go that deep into a character with such realism. Don't know how they do it. <br/><br/>Just watching that is worth the price of a movie ticket on top of the surprise ending to the who done it mystery."
"Deckard-16","9","2","7","24 December 2011"," A Remarkable Remake
","The novel & the Swedish movie are not great by any standards (they are pretty damn good), but the ""Girl"", Lisbeth Salander & Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth are great anti-heroines.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised that David Fincher made a better movie than the original. Fincher is at the top of his game here. ""The Social Network"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" & ""Se7en"" are better movies because the source material is better.<br/><br/>The shock here is Rooney Mara as Salander. Rapace was electric as Salander in all 3 movies made from the Millennium trilogy. Mara is slightly better. In either incarnation you cannot tear your eyes away from the screen when Salander appears, but there something about Mara's work that runs a bit deeper than Rapace's & I'll have to see this film again to get a better handle on that.<br/><br/>Another shock is that this ""Americanized"" version is a harder ""R"" than the Euro version. This ain't a date movie.<br/><br/>Of course Daniel Craig is perfect as Blomkvist. Christopher Plummer is perfect as Vanger. Stellan Stelsgard (sic) briefly channels Joe Doe in a key scene. Steven Zallian's is more true to the novel despite a non-important tweak of the ending.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross's music is mesmerizing meriting a 2nd Oscar for them. Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is worthy of the best of his late father's work. The opening title sequence is sick, twisted & brilliant with Karen O's ferocious singing charging it.<br/><br/>The movie flags a bit in the last 15 minutes, but then ends with a bittersweet & deeply felt sigh.<br/><br/>This is very rough stuff meant only for the serious film lover who make up all of Fincher's admirers."
"bjones","8","2","7","24 December 2011"," A powerfully done story
","I won't add any spoilers as this is too good a movie to spoil. So how do I review it? We'll give it a shot. This is primarily about the American film.<br/><br/>First, if you have not read the book OR seen the original Swedish film, do not do either. We take it for granted that the book is always better than the film - and that is certainly true in this case. But if you read the book first it will spoil the film, so by all means read the book, but read it after you see the film; both films. The original Swedish film is outstanding in all respects.<br/><br/>I have a great suggestion for the world of filmmaking: The next time you find yourself with such a stunning book to make into a film, get together the American and Foreign interests and make the films side-by-side. It would drastically reduce the overall costs and just as drastically shorten the production schedule. Then you release the finished films; the US version to the US and the other version to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>First, the story is not for the feint hearted, it's brutal at times and portrays the seamier side of humanity very graphically. The story hit most of the important stuff so there's no shortage of material. The film runs three hours, but it doesn't seem like it. The pacing and energy in it is sufficient to keep your attention. That means the writing was very good too, as was the directing. The overall film struck me unmistakably as a modern film noir. The cinematography reflects great skill and is responsible for making the film even better. The camera had great scenery to chew up and it was given delicious sets and beautiful weather to set the mood. It won't disappoint.<br/><br/>The actors chosen to work on this project were well cast and all were excellent in their portrayals. Daniel Craig gave the character believability and a sympathetic demeanor. The young woman chosen to portray Lisbeth Salander was Rooney Mara. Mara was excellent in a very demanding role. She had to subject herself to depictions of violent victimization of the worst kind and managed to make it feel very real. I think Ms. Rooney has a great future in film if someone can find her the right parts. This part was a perfect fit for it. She really makes the movie, but as the title character she should. My only complaint at all was that the sound people didn't quite manage to make all of her spoken dialog clear in spite of the accent she adopted. The accent and her manner of delivering it were quite remarkable.<br/><br/>All in all it's an excellent film of this genre and I was glad to have seen it.<br/><br/>By Bruce L.

"tidus925","9","2","7","23 December 2011"," I remember when I found Se7en to be the most disturbing movie I've ever seen
","I went into this not having read the books (I actually own the trilogy though) or seen the Swedish films. This was me going as a HUGE fan of David Fincher, Daniel Craig, and as much as it pains me to say this, the scoring of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (which, by the way, there's a dude wearing a Nine Inch Nails shirt in the film. And we keep thinking Marilyn Manson's the one who sucks his own dick.) But I digress. Fincher is one of the people who made me want to get into film and pursue a career in it, which is still a work in progress. Fight Club is one of my three all-time favorites, and I'm also a huge fan of Se7en, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and The Social Network. <br/><br/>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is none of those films.<br/><br/>The film follows the intertwining fates of a journalist (Craig) and a social outcast (The Social Network's Rooney Mara) as they investigate a wealthy family's history in order to discover the whereabouts of a girl who went missing forty years prior. They soon discover they're in over their heads as their investigation brings them into a long history of violence against women. <br/><br/>The film has all of the Fincher-film motifs: great dialogue, BEAUTIFUL cinematography (if not a bit creepy at times), and fantastic acting. Within the latter particularly, I found myself extremely impressed with Rooney Mara's performance, having only seen her in The Social Network and a VERY bland performance in the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. However in this, she pretty much stole the show in whichever scene she was in. <br/><br/>But that is not what made the film for me. As I said earlier, I love the movie. But this film has possibly done something to me that no other film has: I feel very disgusting for loving it. I have never felt so uncomfortable during a film. Disturbed, yes. Quite often in fact. But this movie made me uncomfortable for watching, as if I was actually watching a rape being committed in front of me, with a group of people, and no one was calling the cops, as we were all dumfounded by the events transpiring in front of us. <br/><br/>And make no mistake, this film is not for the faint of heart. SPOILER ALERT: The film depicts perhaps the most graphic and disturbing rape scene I have ever seen in a film, which makes me respect Mara even more for having been a part of it. Later in the film, while not as disturbing, there's also an extremely suspenseful scene edited back and forth between where Mara's character is to Craig's. I had to remind myself several times that this was not a horror film, even though many of the moments throughout suggested otherwise. <br/><br/>So overall, I say I love the film, and if it was not for Fight Club, it would be my favorite Fincher film, including Se7en. But I cannot stress this enough, this movie is NOT for the faint of heart. I strongly recommend trying Se7en as well as any movie with a rape scene if you feel you might not be up to it, to at least test it out."
"laursecan","9","2","7","23 December 2011"," An absolute thriller...can't wait for the next 2!
","I can't say that there are many films where I find myself hooked before the movie ever begins.....but, this one ""got me"" as soon as the lights dimmed and the title credits began to flicker on screen. My litmus test for judging films is based upon how long after the film I am still thinking about it. I won't keep you in suspense. When it comes to that test, this film not only passed with flying colors....but totally NAILED it! I will be thinking about ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" for quite some time and, most likely, I will see it again during my holiday vacation. There is so much I want to pay more attention to during the next viewing; even though there are portions in which I will cover my eyes, as well. This is not an easy film to view. There are some pretty graphic sexual and violent scenes. If you are considering whether to see it now, or wait for cable - I assure you, this film is meant to be seen on the big screen. And, this isn't because it is in 3D or some other campy fad...it is because it is an excellent, suspenseful, white knuckler.<br/><br/>It would be very easy to say that the one reason to see this film is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander (the title character) - but that would be too simple....too obvious.....too benign. While this role is pretty much one of the most fascinating characters I've seen on screen for some time, I can honestly say that there are many, many more reasons to view this film. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a thriller that just doesn't stop. Just when you think it's over and the story is done....it keeps going......as you sit in the theatre on the edge of your seat, as if you are riding the wildest, scariest, most exciting roller coaster you've ever been on. There are times during the film that I found myself squirming in my chair, completely uncomfortable with what was being projected, but unable to look away. I never knew where this film was going; it surprised me....shocked me......thrilled me.<br/><br/>I borrowed the book quite a while ago, and I had resisted reading it - as I knew the film was coming out and I purposely didn't want to know very much about the storyline. I could see from the coming attractions that this movie was going to be an adventure and I wanted to ride that adventure.....not knowing the final destination. I am pleased to say that I do not regret that decision. (I will, by the way, read the book now).<br/><br/>I will not give away very much of the plot. The film is meant to be experienced. Too much knowledge of the storyline.....would ruin it, in my opinion. Daniel Craig portrays Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative reporter and Rooney Mara portrays the mysterious Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. During the first portion of the film, the plot follows these characters separately....while the viewer is left to consider and wonder what, where, and when the dots will be connected. Both story lines are riveting....as each time the film cut from Craig's character to Mara's character (or vice versa), I found my mind still focused on the previous scene, wondering what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>There are quite a few name stars in the film.....(Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright, Joely Richardson)...but the star is the film. I loved the camera work, the direction, the editing...the acting. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is just really, really good film making.<br/><br/>There is one particular scene, when an extremely heinous character was figuratively hit with the Karma bus that I actually found myself giving a loud cheer right there in the movie theatre.<br/><br/>For the younger crowd, with the short attention spans - you may find yourself having a difficult time getting into the film, as you may be used to multiple car chases and lots of action within the first few minutes of a film. I am going to plead with you to have a bit of patience and allow the story to unfold. When all is not revealed in the first 15 minutes, it is actually plain old good story telling. I know in these days of instant messaging and pop-ups - you may not be used to that....but do give it a chance. You won't be disappointed!"

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is certainly one of the more depressing films of the year, but also one of the most enthralling, hard to turn away from films of the year. It follows Mikael Blomkvist (Craig), a journalist who has just lost everything, and Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a researcher/computer hacker whose life has been nothing but hardship and misunderstanding since her adolescent years. The two converge on a case surrounding one of the more prominent and dirty families in all of Sweden, the Vangers.<br/><br/>Henrik Vanger (Plummer) hires Mikael to investigate the disappearance of his niece. He encounters many problems, the biggest being the disappearance happened 40 years ago. When his research starts getting interesting and more dangerous, he calls upon Lisbeth, who did the background check on Mikael for the Vangers. Together the two try to solve the case, digging up hidden truths, dirty secrets, and encountering some detestable characters along the way. They don't know if they're getting close or farther from the truth, but as the heat turns up, it seems like the answer is rapidly approaching, or is it their impending demise?<br/><br/>What stands out most about this film from the original Swedish version of a few years ago is the mood. Yes, both films cover some disturbing material, but the original version looks like it was filmed in the real world. Fincher, however, creates an entirely different world. It looks, feels, and almost smells dirty. There is hardly a white light found in the film. Even the snow is turned grey by the overcast skies. You get the feeling that there is no hope for these characters.<br/><br/>There is really only one area where the film lacks. Pacing. There is so much information to translate to the audience. It's the job of the editor and the writer to make sure that the audience doesn't skip a beat. There is montage after montage, intercuts, and Swedish writing thrown about that it's hard to keep track of what exactly a character is doing. We get the gist of it all, but there were moments when I was lagging behind just enough to notice.<br/><br/>Other than that I thought the film was a fine adaptation for American audiences. I wasn't sure how the sexual violence would be handled, but Fincher doesn't hold back, much like the Swedish film. Is it important that we see this violence? I hate to say it but yes. We need to like Lisbeth so much that we completely disregard her outward appearance and see her as a survivor. She's extremely talented and fearless. Mara brings Lisbeth to life much like Noomi Rapace brought her to life, only Mara is a letter more brazen and less moody than Noomi, but both are effective with what they do. Craig too gives a solid performance. I was worried that they would try to toughen his character up (seeing as Craig is currently James Bond), but they didn't. They make him likable only because he seems normal and one who stands up for what he believes in.<br/><br/>It's a slimy, complex, fast-moving thriller that is sure to turn some heads at times but in the end you'll be holding your breath and hoping for the best. You might go into the movie clean, but you'll come out dirty."
"zombiedeathbot77","8","2","8","30 August 2013"," The rare American remake that beats the original.
","Having watched and thoroughly enjoyed the Swedish language versions of the millennium trilogy, (the girl with the dragon tattoo, the girl who played with fire, & the girl who kicked the hornets nest) I was very interested in seeing what the amazing David Fincher would bring to the table with his American version. I was not disappointed. This movie is better in almost every aspect. Fincher's trademark flare for creating dark ominous visual mood succeeds in adding a level of tension that is sorely lacking in the original. Having loved the character Lisbeth Salander played by Noomi Rapace in the original and by Rooney Mara in this remake, i must admit both actresses are strong and fierce in their individual portrayals. However, I give a slight edge to Mara due to the fact that her performance is just as ferocious and powerful as Rapace's but simultaneously Mara gives the character an undercurrent of wounded/fragile vulnerability that is mostly absent from Rapace's more cold, emotionless, and cyborglike portrayal. Also Mara's Lisbeth has a more bizarre appearance which enhances Lisbeth's disaffected sociopathic qualities.<br/><br/>I would also point out that the soundtrack work of frequent Fincher collaborator (the incomparable) Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, adds a further layer of industrial gloom to the mood of this version. Daniel Craig isn't much of an actor in my opinion, but his presence adds a level of credibility to the courage displayed by his character. The original actor seemed a bit unbelievable in the role. All in all an excellent film that trumps the original in almost every way. There are a few flaws which are carried over from the original, such as a long slow and confusing expository stage wherein the enormous complexity and the long sordid history of the Vanger family is revealed. Yet even in this part, Fincher is able to succeed in surpassing the original by creating an almost quasi-montage of researching scenes that speeds the pacing of this section along and is more enjoyable to watch than the same portion of the original film. Here is hoping Fincher returns to continue the trilogy, and that American audiences are more receptive to the 2nd and 3rd movies."

","The girl with a Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 mystery thriller film having incredibly dark and violent subject matter based on Steig Larsson's Swedish novel which goes by the same name. The movie stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara in pivotal roles. The director David Fincher had to use his often-used tool of perfection to avoid the film being a disappointment since the novel hyped and he has succeeded in every form. The movie has a labyrinthine plot with the scenes shot at beautiful landscapes with Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography portraying the dark interiors. It all commences with Swedish reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) losing a calumny case put up against him by a businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m. He is soon assigned by Henrik Vagner to unravel an unsolved mystery of his grandniece Harriet who vanished 40 years ago and wasn't found since. In return he is promised a piece of information which can prove useful in defaming Wennerstr√∂m. Meanwhile Lisabeth Salander (Mara), a bisexual, computer hacker and a researcher who bears psychological wounds of harsh upbringing is assigned to a new guardian Nils Bjurman, a lawyer by profession. This socio-path hacker suffers physical and sexual abuses from hands of Nilis who starts taking advantage of his position. It is depressing to watch the scene where Lisabeth is raped miserably by Nilis and is forced to take brutal revenge as a counter-attack. Here lies the speciality of Salander whose acts of vengeance showcase her absolute ability to expel evil with the help of evil. Fincher makes sure that the plot generates a wait to see Mikael and Lisabeth's life collide as initially their lives start running parallel to each other. Mikael who is on the verge of investigating the lost Harriet case puts up a demand for an investigator to assist him to solve the mystery. Sexual and physical abuse from hands of man who she thinks she can trust leads Lisabeth to join hands with Mikael. Fincher captures the essence of the novel in a truthful manner. For those who haven't read the novel, this film is a roller coaster ride showing murder, corruption, family secrets and inner demons of the two associates working on a 40-year old mystery. The typical procedural focus on topography is deflected into archival topography - the island's magnificent and reticulated landscape is pulverized into monochromatic, snowy ambiance. Craig diverges from his James Bond persona and does a completely new character thus displaying his excellent acting skills. Mara does a totally fantastic job as the girl with a dragon tattoo. A 8/10 for this another Fincher-made masterpiece."

"mikes-movie-review-onlin","8","2","8","15 April 2012"," ""A superb movie, rich with a plethora of intriguingly gruesome scenes""
","The opening credits alone are enough to dazzle and confuse viewers in David Fincher's newest feature. Audiences will experience an incredible - and at times shocking - journey through the world Stieg Larsson created and David Fincher now brings to life. The casting was very well done, with supporting stars like Steven Berkoff, Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Robin Wright rounding off a powerhouse cast. Once you get over the prejudice of seeing Daniel Craig as an action star, you realise he's a good fit for Mikael Blomkvist. But the true star here is Rooney Mara, the relatively unknown actress gives an Oscar-worthy performance in the coveted role of Lisbeth Salander. Stealing each of her scenes, a young new actress shows her incredible talent.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't read the novels (or seen the Swedish adaptations), the film revolves around two central characters. The first, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a reporter found guilty of libel. Having lost most of his life savings he is hired by a wealthy Swedish business owner named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). Vanger wants Blomkvist to write his memoirs for him, though in actuality Blomkvist's role is to uncover the truth behind the disappearance of Harriet, Henrik's niece. The Vanger family all live on a large island but rarely talk with one another, they're the kind of wealthy old family with creepy and reclusive members, as well as ties to Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>The second lead character is Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). Lisbeth is a young girl who has been rejected from society, placed in the care of multiple guardians, she has been abused by many and left to live with whatever energy she has left. She seems willing to crawl up into a hole and to hide from the world, but when hit, she hits back five times as hard. This is what makes her such a compelling heroine for audiences. She's quite the opposite of your typical busty blonde female character in thrillers who lack depth and motivation. Lisbeth shows off her fierce bite, particularly when she is raped by her most recent guardian Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), she fights back in a way that most people would never even dream of, but Bjurman certainly gets what he deserves. <br/><br/>These two characters' stories interweave later in the film when Mikael requests a research assistant. His investigation on the dissapearence of Harriet uncovers a much larger series of murders throughout Sweden, and he needs an assistant to help him get through research and follow leads. Lisbeth works as a researcher for a Stockholm security firm, and she's extremely thorough in her reports- often crossing into illegal means of data collection. Together these two characters work through piles of documents as they unravel the elaborate mystery that surrounds the Vanger family.<br/><br/>Writer Steven Zaillian remains very faithful to Larsson's original novel, changing only a little at the ending to keep it fresh without ruining the story. I'm extremely pleased that David Fincher directed this movie. With such great source material, Fincher works his magic upon this film. His camera work greatly reflects the story and characters, with Blomkvist moving around in still frames while Lisbeth is almost constantly followed by a moving camera, the audience often looking over her shoulder. Fincher is a master at building suspense in dark and stylish thrillers, and he shows it here. Even as I knew what was coming because I've read the book, David Fincher kept me in suspense for many scenes.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a superb movie, rich with a plethora of intriguingly gruesome scenes. The cast is terrific as they subtly unveil the secrets of the Vanger family, and the direction by David Fincher brilliantly portrays the characters while allowing for both plot and character development. Rooney Mara also stands out in a break-out role which deserves at the very least a nomination from the Academy. While The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo does have its flaws, it remains one of the best films of 2011."
"Hellmant","9","2","8","1 February 2012"," Fincher's remake about the same as the Swedish original.
","'THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>David Fincher's English-language adaptation of the popular Swedish novel 'Men Who Hate Women' by Stieg Larsson, the first in the 'Millennium' series trilogy (which were first adapted in to films in Sweden in 2009). Fincher's remake stars Rooney Mara in the lead role of Lisbeth Salander, A.K.A. 'the girl with the dragon tattoo' (which is a performance she's received an Academy Award nomination for), and Daniel Craig as Mikael Blomkvist. The screenplay was written by Steven Zaillian.<br/><br/>The story in this first chapter revolves around journalist Mikael Blomkvist taking on a missing person's case in which he's asked to travel to a remote island and solve the disappearance of his employer's niece, who went missing over 40 years earlier. Blomkvist just had his reputation tarnished by a corrupt businessman and is looking to clear his name, which his new employer, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), promises he can help him do (if he works on his niece's case). Mikael believes the disappearance of Vanger's niece has to do with a series of serial killings and enlists the help of a computer hacker (Lisbeth Salander, who was hired by Vanger to research him) to help him catch the maniac.<br/><br/>I'd rate the movie about equal with it's Swedish counterpart. Once again I loved elements of the movie and really wanted to love the entire film but found it just a little too long and dragged out. Fincher's directing, editing and entire visual style is once again superb, Mara is outstanding and the score (by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) is mesmerizing but the pacing is just a little too slow (at least at times). Probably due to the filmmakers once again staying just a little too faithful to their source material. Lisbeth Salander is an all time classic 5 star action heroine role though and I look forward to seeing more of her in future American adaptations.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8CEO75Pj0"
"samuelding85","8","2","8","8 January 2012"," It Makes Us Looking Forward to The Girl Who Set Fire on the Hornet's Nest
","It takes a great challenge for a movie director to do a remake of a popular movie, especially when it is based on best selling novel. David Fincher has taken the challenge to do a remake of the highly popular Millennium Trilogy, and he did it. He has delivered a splendid American remake of the Swedish drama series, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Daniel Craig takes up the role of Mikael Blomkervist, and Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander. Together, the trio have given us the feel bad movie of Christmas.<br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo marks the first chapter of Millennium Trilogy, with Mikael the journalist and Lisbeth, a computer hacker, working together to investigate the case of a missing girl, Harriet Vanger. Harriet was believed to be murdered by one of her family member when she goes missing 40 years ago. At the same time, Mikael is under trial for defamation of a entrepreneur, while Lisbeth is surviving from a rape which could have unlikely to happened on her.<br/><br/>While Fincher gives a fully explained details in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2009), which was based on a short story written by F.Scott Fitzgerald, it takes a challenge to summarize a 644 pages story written by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson into a 2hr 38 min movie. Fincher not only did it, but also makes the US remake truly lives up to the novel. Audience get a better understanding on Lisbeth's lifestyle and attitude towards her surrounding, such as being reserved at work, living as a bisexual computer hacker, survives from rape and develops affection on her working partner Mikael. To understand how Mikael turns Millennium magazine into a magazine that exposes corporate scandals, it can be seen from the way how he investigates the disappearance of Harriet Vanger. This is how we see Fincher wants to tell the audience on the working style for Mikael without repeating Mikael's working style, which was featured at the beginning of the novel.<br/><br/>Editing plays a very important role in this US remake. In the first half of the movie, Mikael and Lisbeth were presented as two different persons with very different lifestyle, which goes concurrently without overlapping each other. Towards the next half of the film, both met each other by working in the investigation on the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, which eventually leads to the discovery of the sinister secrets of the Vanger family. The pace is fast, direct without making one feeling bored. Rather, it engages the audience, making them wanting to know more. This is another reason why the movie is a success. What it lacks, however, is a deeper exploration on Lisbeth's personality. While it was explained in the Swedish version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it was not seen in the US remake.<br/><br/>In some way, the US remake makes up what was lacking in the Swedish version. The opening credits are created specially for the US remake, compared to the usual credits run over on movie scenes. This gives audience the reason they should arrive the theaters early to catch them. Observant audience will know that the opening credits covers the title of the trilogy: a dragon tattoo on the black female body (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo), a burning matchstick and a burning body (The Girl Who Played With Fire) and hornets flying out of a girl's mouth (The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest). The credits are marvelously accompanied by Karen O, Trent Renzor and Atticus Ross modern reprise of Led Zeppelin's The Immigrant Song.<br/><br/>With a marvelous US remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, it gives us the reason to look forward to the US remake of The Girl Who Played With Fire. Now, all we want is to revisit Mikael and Lisbeth, the unlikely pair, to unveil more dark secrets."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","8","7 January 2012"," A pretty standard movie for most part but that's not necessarily a bad thing of course.
","For me personally, this movie was not that much special to watch but then again this might be due to it that I have seen too many English detective-series already, so that might explain why I wasn't that impressed by the story and why everything came across as quite standard. That's not a bad thing of course but it did prevent me from seeing this movie as anything spectacular, surprising or that very involving.<br/><br/>In that regard, this perhaps is also a bit of a disappointing movie, also when considering who was at the helm of it. David Fincher movies are always something great to me but there is basically nothing about this movie that screams David Fincher out at you. It might just as well had been directed by a totally different director.<br/><br/>The movie in essence is a whodunit. It just takes awhile for the movie to finally get there and make clear to you what it is all about. Seriously, when looking back at it I don't really know what the point of its entire first hour was. The introduction of all of the characters- and the setting up of its plot lines, could had all been done much simpler and quicker. Actually because of its first hour, I had a really hard time getting into this movie. But yes, eventually I did, when the story started to become more focused.<br/><br/>But then came the last 20 minutes, or so, along. The movie was beginning to suffer from the same problems at that point again. It went on for too long and the movie really gave you the impression it should had all ended way sooner because the story felt pretty much rounded up already. With its 158 minutes, it's a really long movie to watch and there was no reason really for the movie to be as long as it was. It's probably only so long because they were afraid to leave out some elements from the books because it might anger some of the fans of it, which could had harmed the movie financially. But really, purely from a movie perspective, lots of the stuff and even some of the characters should had been left out. It would had made the movie and its story more focused and less fragmentary and confusing to follow at times.<br/><br/>Really, this was still my biggest problem with the movie; the story felt very fragmentary to me. Basically it had a story of characters going- and talking to each other but most of the time I was actually wondering 'now, who is this?', 'where is he going?', 'why is he going there?', 'why is this character or story-element relevant to anything?'. I know this is an usual thing for a thriller-mystery to do but the movie does it in a bit of a messy way, which doesn't always make things look connected to each other.<br/><br/>I'm probably sounding like I hated this movie but that is of course not the case. It's just so I had issues with it, which all prevented me from seeing this as a great or successful movie within its genre. It's a good movie but not really one I am ever likely to see again. At least not any time soon.<br/><br/>And that's really all this movie comes down to; it's certainly a good enough movie and really not an horrible one in any way or form but really all together, not all that special.<br/><br/>There are still multiple things that make this movie better than just average, the acting being one of them. I especially liked Daniel Craig in his role and the movie also has a really solid supporting cast with actors such as Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, Yorick van Wageningen, Steven Berkoff and Robin Wright involved.<br/><br/>I still foremost liked watching the movie, just never fell in love with it, in any way.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Having waited before committing to try out this story - I've been burned before and really hated 'rated' oddball films/book adaptations/translations, I have to admit this flick really does pack a punch. A worthy effort that belies the author's knowledge and understanding of an underworld we hardly ever get to see properly. Casting was spot on - I really can't believe that George Clooney was even considered for a role - he's far too full of himself and that's what is telling about the acting in this film. Everything spoken is almost understated - there is a delicacy in the way people in the Nordic countries speak that contrasts with the weight of what they say. This was perfectly conveyed in the English version of the story. Full marks for that and for making us believe that these English speakers were not English/American. I am now convinced that I will gain more from the books and will likely revisit the film again afterwards. ps.

"aem1078","9","2","8","5 January 2012"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is great!
","I am a huge fan of both the original books, and the Swedish movies, but this movie is a major improvement on the Swedish movie. Essentially, the books could be used as movie scripts, with little done to alter them, and this movie pretty much does that. My biggest complaint is that Lisbeth appears to be wearing ""gang pants"" instead of Goth pants throughout the movie. I don't see her wearing pants with the crotch around her mid-thighs, as that would restrict her movement too much, and she is more likely to be wearing skin-tight pants.<br/><br/>They did a good job with the denouement at the end, with Hans Erik Wennerstrom, and also the concluding segment is excellently done. Overall, I was skeptical going in about this movie, and came out excited about seeing the remaining two movies. The original Swedish movies are not nearly as good as they could be on Girl Who Played with Fire and Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. They portrayed the Millennium staff as a bunch of gutless wimps, when in the books, they were journalists like Steig Larsson, willing to risk their lives to get the truth out to the public! I hope that these productions will stay true to the books on this!"
"piotr-messiaen","8","2","8","4 January 2012"," Pointless arguments over remakes
","Could we stop these endless debates about remakes? This latest version is not a remake, it is another interpretation of a book. Any work of art (high or low) can be re-interpreted, and there is no reason why a talented director like Fincher shouldn't present us with his version. (We don't whine about new interpretations of Shakespeare.) There are two criteria for evaluating whether a remake is justified: financial and artistic. I doubt the producers will be disappointed if it isn't a blockbuster - they could have avoided the R classification - and artistically, it seems perfectly valid: the direction, cinematography, soundtrack are superior, and the performances are at least as good as the original.<br/><br/>Again, it is pointless to try do compare Rapace and Mara: each offers a powerful perspective on the character. Craig, has been rightly praised, but for those who felt him subdued or 'blown away' by Mara - please recognise that acting is an ensemble activity - he has been praised by Mara for his generosity - and his role was not only that of a somewhat insecure journalist, on the skids, but also a complementary foil to Mara's. The role and the interests of the film required him to tone down the charisma and 'act'.<br/><br/>All in all, an invigorating and stimulating new take on the book."
"BrianLlywd","8","2","8","23 December 2011"," A Decent Doppleganger?
","***Update*** I just screened the Swedish trilogy... They are riveting. The Fincher picture is better filmed, but isn't. Riveting that is. The Swedish characters have more depth, they aren't expanded into iconic figures as are Finchers', they are more real. Rapace would NEVER show a romantic interest in Blomqvist as Mara does at the end of the US pic; there's an expectation that everyone should swoon over Daniel Craig. Which is off kilter. She would never buy him an expensive gift - she would barely offer a thanks. We'll see what the next two are like.<br/><br/>Back to my review of the USA version . . .<br/><br/>Having watched ""TGWTDT USA"" last night I'm not really convinced that it needed doing. Yes I liked the plot changes; they tightened up the story and allowed time to be spent in a few other parts of the script (notably in the rape and sex scenes). But was it worth $100 million to do a remake when the original is still playing on movie channels? Probably not. <br/><br/>The opening credits are impressive, but seem to relate more to a new ""Batman"" than this picture. A sign of having way too much money available in the budget. They got the film off to a little bit of a confusing start. <br/><br/>I admit to not being a Daniel Craig (Mikael Blomkvist) fan, frankly he reminds me more than a little of an evil gnome of some sort, a Rumpelstilskin (which does however fit well with the Nordic locale of this picture). He does his usual perfunctory job in this film adding nothing really that we hadn't seen from Michael Nyqvist. For me, he was a little too fit and hunky for the role; Blumqvist is a journalist not a fitness trainer and needs the associated love handles and pot belly of a professional scribbler. Was I the only one who noticed the resemblance of Blumqvist's daughter in the movie to Michael Nyqvist? <br/><br/>Rooney Mara is very good in her role as Lisbeth Salander, but not any better that Noomi Rapace. She (Mara) does borrow so much for her performance from Rapace's work, that it's difficult to give her full credit. I think Rapace, from her acting, was more believable as a hacker, as a victim and as a vengeance taker. (I will admit that I'm always suspicious when an actress from a billionaire family gets a plum role or recording contract which work against my consideration of Ms Mara. {""Daddy can I be a model, an actress and a singer today?"") <br/><br/>Where this production catches up to the previous version in my rating is in its cinematography; a hundred million goes a long way to creating exactly what the writer and director want the audience to see. And this production certainly does that. It is brilliantly filmed. The picture also is notable for its dramatic and highly visual scenes of violence and sex, perhaps the most graphically accurate ever put to screen. <br/><br/>Good on David Fincher. Well done."
"charcoalgypsy-3","10","3","15","21 December 2011"," Stunning and Subdued, a Perfect Film
","Having read all the books, and watched the Swedish versions of the films, I could not be happier with Fincher's film. It is spot on. That je ne sais quoi of the stunning and the subdued in harmony, that is so difficult to achieve, but so necessary to film like this, is flawlessly executed.<br/><br/>I think Reznor was an excellent choice for the soundtrack, and he did a phenomenal job. I never felt as if the music was out of place or intrusive.<br/><br/>There are a few story changes, but ultimately they make for a better movie. I'm sorry to have to disagree with those of you who prefer the Swedish films, and think the first Swedish film is better. The cinematography in Oplev's version is excellent, the acting is first rate, but ultimately the film is a disappointment. It is incoherent, and oftentimes jarring. Had I not read the books before watching Oplev's version, I would not have been able to follow it. Fincher's film is nearly perfect. Every change has a purpose and benefits the film.<br/><br/>It goes without saying, Rooney Mara is absolutely amazing. But I also thought Daniel Craig was an unexpected, and wonderful, choice. For those who claim Mara outshined him, yes, she did, and no, she didn't. Who is the shocking, scene-stealing, surprising one? Salander? Or Blomkvist? Craig played his part true to the novel. He is a subdued fellow. He is not dramatic. He is never over-the-top. He does not brood. What were you people expecting? Craig was Blomkvist. Had he acted any differently, it would have changed the story, and not for the better.<br/><br/>Whether you have read the novels or not, see the film. It will bash you over the head on the one hand, and slowly seep into you on the other. I still can't stop thinking about it."

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the Americanized version based off the original Swedish trilogy. I haven't seen those films, but after watching this mesmerizing thriller by David Fincher, I might have to check them out. The general consensus I hear is that this is a necessary remake and there are some differences. This film is dark, thought-provoking, and features two very unique characters. In other words, this is typical David Fincher.<br/><br/>This film is about how a journalist Mikael Blomkvist along with hacker Lisbeth Salander investigate what happened to this woman who disappeared many years previously.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara bring this film to an elite level. I never thought Rooney Mara could pull of this role but somehow she did. Everything from that haircut to her personality, she became Lisbeth. She also has the best redemption scene you will ever see. Daniel Craig is really grim but interesting as Mikael.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a dark thriller with quite a few twists. I couldn't see these twists coming from a mile away. There are some very violent scenes including visually-explicit rape scene but they work well with the content. This film also has very good editing which it won an Oscar. The screenplay is also very good and it has very fresh dialog. I didn't expect much out of the film, but David Fincher made this work. I rate this film 9/10."

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a heart-pumping thriller that captures you in its grip of horror and intrigue until the final second.<br/><br/>Check out my full review here at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/girl-with- dragon- tattoo.html<br/><br/>It is methodically calculating as it counts down to the discovery of the wolf in sheep's clothing. The cast is phenomenal. Rooney Mara (Lisbeth Salander) steals the show with her brilliant intellect, her seductive appeal, and her ruthless defense of the defenseless. She stands apart among a top cast in David Fincher's masterpiece. Daniel Craig (Mikael Blomkvist) plays an embattled journalist who has been tricked into trading in his credibility for a story. He is a great investigative journalist who has a vulnerable side.<br/><br/>The ageless Christopher Plummer (Henrik Vanger) is the wary, kind uncle (and former CEO of the family business) who has been searching for the murderer of his dear niece who vanished years before from the island Henrik and his family (and relatives) have occupied for decades. On the day of her murder only family members were present on the island, all of them together in one place, and no particular evidence pointing any one person in particular.<br/><br/>After the embarrassing imprisonment of Blomkvist after losing his libel case made against Hans-Eric Wennerstr√∂m, a Swedish billionaire industrialist, his Millennium magazine is faltering and Blomkvist is approached by Henrik to investigate the murder of his niece, Harriet. Blomkvist takes a step down from Millennium with the promise of a hefty compensation and solid evidence against Wennerstr√∂m if he can crack the cold case of Harriet's murder. He is welcomed to the family's isolated and frigid island, off the coast of Sweden.<br/><br/>Blomkvist interviews the remaining family members living on the island searching for clues. His investigation really heats up after he finds photographs of Harriet the morning of her murder in town attending a parade. He further ascertains that he needs access to the company's records in order to discover who the killer is. In order to comb the family business' archives, he hires Lisbeth Salander, a pierced, tattooed, goth computer hacker and private investigator, and the same young woman who investigated his past before Henrik hired him.<br/><br/>Blomkvist and Salander have a complicated relationship in the film, as partners, lovers, and confidants. As they research all of the details surrounding the murder, they discover that it isn't just Harriet who has been murdered but woman all over the country that have been marked as cold cases are cropping up with ties to Harriet and Harriet's family. <br/><br/>The rising action in the film builds enormous tension as Blomkvist pokes around somewhere he shouldn't be and Salander uncovers dark secrets of her own.<br/><br/>Director David Fincher does a remarkable job with the horrifying discovery of the perpetrator of the murders and then the character's realization of how deep they've gotten themselves. It is terrible and wonderful all at the same time.<br/><br/>The film has graphic sexual content which is not suitable for younger audiences or anyone sensitive to sexual content. It is persistent throughout the film.<br/><br/>My Score ‚Äì Overall Rating: 9.75 out of 10 Plot: 9 out of 10 Character Development: 10 out of 10 Acting: 10 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 10 out of 10"
"stowevt024","10","2","9","24 December 2011"," Rooney Mara > Naoomi Rapace
","I first read the book, ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" a couple of years ago. I watched the movie,the original Swedish Version with English subtitles, shortly thereafter. I was mesmerized by Rapace's character portrayal of Lizbeth Salander. Once I read that there was going to be an American version I was rather circumspect once I found out that Rooney Mara was going to play the part. Now after watching the USA version of the movie last night I have to say that not only did Miss Mara live up to the role but she exceeded my expectations. Both versions were fantastic but I liked the USA version better. I can only hope that Ms. Mara will play the part again in the sequel. There were some parts of the movie that dragged a little bit in the beginning but all in all I loved it."
"edhubie","10","2","9","22 December 2011"," Rooney Mara Best Actress In a Movie!!!
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is brilliantly done in ways better then the book and way better then the 2009 version. Though I didn't dislike the 09 version I thought they left out parts from the book that I thought should've been shown. David Fincher's version you pretty much don't have to read the book. Follows it amazingly. Took parts out that could and needed to be taken out and shorten parts of the book with beautifully done shorter scenes to get the point across which was better then the books longer sequences. Even put a little twist at the end that didn't effect the story and was in my opinion better then the book original. Best Fincher opening sequence movie title which he's been known for in the past with Trent Reznor and Karen O's remake of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant song. Reznor does a great job with subtle music that sets the mood and matches exactly the emotion you feel in the scenes in the movie and story.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig of course is great as Mickael but Rooney Mara easily steals the movie in her performance as Lisbeth Salander. How she played Lisbeth is exactly how I pictured her. The way the book describes her quirks and how she holds and smokes her cigarette Rooney did perfectly. She plays the blend of toughness and vulnerability that is Lisbeth Salander in perfect blend. Making herself beautiful behind the tattoos and piercings that Lisbeth is known to be in the books. I want to see at least an Oscar nod for her role. As much as I love Keira Knightly and Natalie Portman I can't see them in that role after seeing Rooney Mara play her. That's how perfect she played her."

"jasontheterrible","3","1","3","21 June 2018"," Far inferior to the Swedish version
","Because this one is so different from the original film in Swedish, I do not think I can be fair. I hated it, especially the ending, which was downright cruel, and unsympathetic. I generally despise films with bad endings. I doubt people who have seen this and enjoyed it will enjoy the original, so I am writing this for those who have seen neither. <br/><br/>First and foremost Noomi Rapace's characterization is far, far superior to Mara. It is so gritty, unflinching, and desperate, that just watching her makes one tense. The subtitles did not bother me because the dialogue is not rapid and the steady revelation of very interesting plot twists can be handled easily. <br/><br/>What no one in any of the other reviews has mentioned is cinematography. The Swedish version is very bright with the cold winter glare filling every room. Every scene is so revealing because of this and it counts in the more lurid scenes. The American version is dark and so poorly lit one cannot see the most important scenes well. This is a huge flaw in judgment in my opinion.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the ending in the original 2009 Swedish version is so much better. All the actors have more range, sorry to say, than the ones in this version."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","3","6 September 2016"," A good thriller, with one caveat
","David Fincher's adaptation of the intensely popular Scandinavian crime novel is quite exemplary in many respects. The sprawling story of the novel is condensed and brought to life on the screen by a very skilled scriptwriter; the cast of seasoned performers bring the various characters from the page to life very well; and Fincher's direction is as ever very, very good, which makes this a stylish and easy watch.<br/><br/>However, there's one huge caveat to go with this review: a prior adaptation of the novel already exists, namely the 2009 Swedish version featuring Noomi Rapace. The problem with this Hollywood version is that it's not as good as the Swedish one, even though it has a bigger budget. The Swedish version already did everything perfectly and can't, honestly, be improved upon; take Rooney Mara, who tries very hard as Salander, but who can't match Rapace's embodiment of the role. And Daniel Craig is Daniel Craig; he's no Michael Nykqvist. So as good as this version of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is, it was already done in a more authentic way, so there's little reason to watch."
"ironlion106","7","1","3","30 April 2015"," A Severely Underrated Film
","David Fincher is truly the master of book-to-movie adaptations. And with such a successful and dark book as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo to work with, you'd think that this would be a recipe for success. So what did this movie lack to be so ignored and not talked about by the general public?<br/><br/>Nothing. This movie lacked nothing. It is a beautiful display of acting, musical score, cinematography, and directing. The reason that this film is is unfairly underrated is because the wrong audience came to see it.<br/><br/>The audience that came to see this movie had never seen a film like this before from David Fincher (because he had never done anything like this before). They came with the wrong expectations and as a result, they were unsatisfied. So what is the ""right"" audience?<br/><br/>If you are one who likes extremely dark, demented movies that are driven purely by dialogue, disturbing imagery, and great directing and not by action or horror movie scares, then this movie will most certainly not disappoint."
"RbDeraj","7","1","3","5 February 2015"," A Dark Mysterious Thrill
","As someone who has not read the book or seen the original Swede version, I felt like the film left some questions undisclosed. It had a lot of characters and even towards the end I felt a little overwhelmed with all of the story-lines just like Mikael at the beginning when he is learning the Vanger family tree. When Martin is finally caught and disposed of, they never really give an explanation of his motive only that he did not kill his sister. The writer seemed to think that that was enough, but I felt it lacked a believable reason.<br/><br/>The ending was obviously a set up for a sequel and it almost seemed like a distraction. Was this film about Mikael Blomkvist? Or the girl with the dragon tattoo? Or the mystery of the disappearance of Harriet? It was almost as if they were telling three stories at once and didn't really focus enough on each one. The relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth was came out of no where and was just weird as it didn't seem fitting with her personality. The performances were all excellent especially Roony Mara. I would also applaud the makeup for their transformation of her character and also the special effects team for the wonderful opening credits. While it did have its faults, I found it thrilling, pretty well made, an interesting plot, and it would make me want to see a second film if they ever make one."

"ThomasDrufke","9","1","3","4 September 2014"," A Brutal and Riveting Crime-Mystery-Thriller
","One of the things that kept me away from this movie for so long was how graphic I had heard it was. But I have become prone to gory and graphic films over the years so what better time to watch it than a month before David Fincher's new film, Gone Girl is released. I really like all of Fincher's movies and I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is among his best. All of his movies have a dark tone and look to them. This is no exception. He sets this beautifully creepy world perfectly and puts his actors in the right position to be successful. I haven't seen the original trilogy so I'm unable to compare for now, but I can say that Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are perfect for these two roles.<br/><br/>It's hard to watch a movie with Daniel Craig and not automatically think James Bond, and have him not be the most intimidating character on screen. Mara is downright frightening but also charismatic as Lisbeth, the troubled young woman who struggles to find her way in life. But she's good at one thing, investigating. It's her job to help Craig in finding out what truly happened to Harriet, the granddaughter of Henrik, the man who hired them. As you do with most mysteries, you begin to suspect every suspiciously acting character shown. I have to say it was pretty hard to identify just who was involved. Fincher did a great job with storytelling here, and making us second guess ourselves several times.<br/><br/>When Mara and Craig do finally team up about an hour in, the film takes itself to a new level and the intensity amps up. I did find it strange that Mara didn't think twice about working with Craig, especially after illegally investigating him. One of the most incredibly acted scenes was with Skarsgard and Craig in the basement cellar. The back and forth is fascinating and the way Skarsgard thinks exactly what he's describing is normal is astounding. But even then Fincher keeps twisting the story. Which is one of the problems I had with the film, it seemed like there were 3 or 4 different endings but it kept going. And the actual final scene wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped considering it's unlikely they will film the two sequels.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the better crime-drama-mystery-thrillers I have seen. The intensity throughout kept me on the edge of my seat and I didn't know what to expect next. It's this type of directing I am looking for in next month's Gone Girl. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the best thrillers in recent memory and is up there with Fight Club, Se7en, and Zodiac as his best overall film.<br/><br/>+Mara's performance was captivating <br/><br/>+Intense and riveting <br/><br/>+Dark tone is beautifully captured <br/><br/>+Craig is not a bad*** <br/><br/>+Unpredictable <br/><br/>-Last scene not satisfying <br/><br/>9.0/10"
"kundan-krishna99","9","1","3","15 August 2014"," Enchanting Suspense
","The Girl with the dragon tattoo is a mystery thriller. The story revolves around Michael Bromkvist(Daniel Craig), who is a journalist having a hard time, facing humiliation after losing a defamation case. He is approached by Henrik Vanger, owner of Vanger Industries in Sweden, who asks him to investigate the sudden disappearance of his grandniece named Harriet 40 years ago.Harriet's disappearance has been portrayed in an enchanting way with the realistic and nostalgic environment of the 1960s. Michael reaches the ancestral city of the Vangers, and meanwhile, stumbles across Lisabeth(Rooney Mara).She is a brilliant hacker, and is convinced by Michael to work for him. There is an attempt to kill Michael, which suggests the involvement of one of the Vangers . Michael and Lisabeth team together to unearth the family history of the Vangers, and the family discovers that along with their mighty reputation in the country, they also inherit a dark side.<br/><br/>The highlight of the story is the gripping screenplay, which keeps you wondering who's the culprit. Though slow with a running time of 158 minutes, it never lets you feel drowsy. Actors do justice with their characters, which is something you expect when you have James Bond fame Daniel Craig amongst the cast. But the show-stealer is Rooney Mara, who portrays a psychopath's character perfectly with a precise Russian accent. Overall, the movie deserves a watch because it is one of the best portrayals of a mystery that we've had in a while."
"Naptownbrown","Null","1","3","3 May 2014"," Excellent Murder Mystery
","The movie titled Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is about a journalist named Mikel Blomkvist (actor Daniel Craig) that is being sued by a powerful man named Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m (actor Ulf Friberg) for slander. During this time, Mikel is being investigated by Vanger Corporation with the aide of Lisabeth Salander (actress Rooney Mara) who happens to be appropriately named because of her illegal talent of hacking computers to gain personal information during an investigation. Because of his legal troubles, Mikel is contacted by the lawyer of Vanger with a proposal that we will find is hard to refuse. Henrik Vanger (actor Christopher Plummer) invites Mikel into his home and asks him to investigate his family history in order to discover what happen to his niece and to help write his memoirs. Over 40 years ago, Harriet Vanger disappeared from the island of Hedested and the family believes she was murdered even though the body was never found. The theme of this movie revolves around murder and mystery and it seems this trademark is related to one section of this family.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig done an excellent job with his portrayal of Mikel and you almost have sympathy for him while he is going through his troubles and relationships. Rooney Mara played her role as Lisabeth as well as could have been played. She went from a Gothic chick to almost a sex symbol during the movie while remaining her hard edge. The rest of the cast and crew did excellent jobs as well. One thing that impressed me the most about this film is the editing and the scene transitions. During most of the film you had two scenes going at the same time switching back and forth.<br/><br/>This film reminds me of another murder mystery that involves the killing of women and girls and that film is titled Kiss the Girls which is about a film about a man named Dr. Alex Cross (actor Morgan Freeman), who goes to North Carolina to help find his missing niece. When Alex arrives in North Carolina, the police informed him they believe his niece is part of a serial killing being done by a person calling himself Cassanova after the great lover. The main similarities are the killing of the girls, the investigating to discover the killer, and how the killer is eventually discovered.<br/><br/>The director, David Fincher, kept the film moving at a fast pace which forced me to keep my eyes glued to the screen because I didn't want to miss any key elements of the film. He also kept the lighting of the film mostly dark which added to the mystery and wonder of the film. During the beginning of the film, each scene that Lisabeth was involved in was dark with a lot of shadows and how ironic is it that her first scene where she's in that light is when she discovered her guardian is passed out on the floor of his apartment. The irony is that during her darkest moment it's most lit scene until that point of the film. I would also say this film involved two main characters which are Mikel and Lisabeth which is normally a hard thing to do in film. I believe another ironic area of this film is how everyone in the Vanger family seems to know how the other family members would react to Mikel even though most of them don't talk to each. Yet, when Mikel approaches them each family seems to be willing to help.<br/><br/>This film is definitely a murder mystery with a twist. Who would have thought that Martin was following in his father's footsteps. Also, the fact that Harriet is the one responsible her father demise, but Henrik said he drowned in the lake because he was drunk. It's great what Mikel discovers about Anita. These are just a few of the twist and turns involved in this film. I was a little disappointed in how the film ended for Lisabeth but life isn't fair."

","The words of describing this movie is really hard to be found. its kind of controversial. its a smart story of a young woman, expert in using computers who helped a journalist in his search of a missing woman for forty years. the movie has a lot of twists and turns. some scenes are very harsh. a lot of scenes reminds you of European cinematography but just remember that a Swedish writer wrote the novel. the hair, the make up, the set decoration are just how they supposed to be to get the best outcome. Daniel Craig had the opportunity to give an amazing performance I'm not really sure that he succeeded in that (your judge). although Rooney Mara gives a stunning performance (my opinion she worth the Oscar, but she was competing Meryl). i would definitely recommend this movie. the movie shows the reality as it is, maybe with a little bit of exaggeration when it comes to the background story of the girl. cant wait to see the next movie!"

Daniel Craig performed his role as Bloomquist with excellence, a character in complete contrast to 007. The story followed the book, leaving out certain details on how the girl gained complete control of 'everybody's' computer. (It was through a pro' hacker and she paid him a substantial sum.)<br/><br/>Spoiler warning. The spoiler is for anyone who has read the first book, so stop here.<br/><br/>Spoiler warning.<br/><br/>I was surprised and disappointed about the change in one of the characters and the deletion of another at the end of the search. It seemed to me the director and producer couldn't be bothered with the work involved. It was a complete diversion from the book and the German movie version, which in my opinion was much better because of its authenticity and can recommend it to German speakers or anyone familiar with the language. The one thing that saved this film for me was the superb acting from all round."
"DubhDoo","10","2","10","19 August 2012"," A faithful, brutal and mesmerizing adaptation from David Fincher
","I am a fan of the Stieg Larsson Millennium Trilogy and the Swedish miniseries; finding the books to be emotional, suspenseful and engrossing, while finding the miniseries to be very entertaining and satisfying. However, unlike many people, I did not groan when it was announced that David Fincher would be re-adapting it the novel, but instead was intrigued to see where he would take the source material, considering his impressive background in the genre with Zodiac and the brilliant Seven. As the cast and crew came together, everyone seemed well-suited to the film; and while the film's production gathered pace, my anticipation was high. Fortunately my expectations were met.<br/><br/>One aspect which struck me upon first viewing was the script's faithfulness to the novel, something which I particularly liked; and while I don't mind an adaptation occasionally straying from the source material (like the Oplev one, which I thoroughly enjoyed), this Dragon Tattoo retained some of my favourite things from the novel that were absent from the Swedish adaptation - such as Holger Palmgren's importance to Lisbeth, Pernilla Blomkvist, the Hedestad cat and that brilliant ending (Fincher beautifully realized this on screen to powerful effect) ‚Äì for me, these faithful, but important inclusions helped the film feel truer to the overall tone of the novel. ""The adaptation Stieg Larsson would probably prefer"", as one critic remarked.<br/><br/>Having only seen Rooney Mara in The Social Network, I was curious to see how she would portray Lisbeth and after reading some early interviews, I didn't doubt her commitment, which I found blatantly apparent with her on screen transformation. I loved Noomi Rapace in the titular role, but I'm not here to compare the two. Mara's Lisbeth is a joy to watch, capturing the character perfectly and just how I envisioned her whilst reading the books; she is defensive, introverted and vulnerable with an undying magnetic presence. When Daniel Craig was cast as Mikael Blomkvist, a number of people were concerned that he may bring his 'James Bond' to the role; however this was, fortunately not the case, as he proves very likable and convincing as the journalist, and like Mara very true to Larsson's creation. Their scenes together are blissful; their lines bounce off each other, while their chemistry crackles like a roaring fire. <br/><br/>I'd also like to favourably mention Steve Zallian's great screenplay, Jeff Cronenwerth's gorgeous cinematography (which depicts the frosty landscape wonderfully), the deservedly Oscar-winning editing from Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall and Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' brilliant score, which finds the duo composing a score even better than their Academy Award-winning work on Fincher's previous effort.<br/><br/>One thing I want to make clear is that this is not a remake, nor was it ever; it's a re-adaptation, as pretentious as it sounds, that's what it is. Don't believe me? Well then, read the novel and watch both; and even if you prefer Niel Arden Oplev's, this Dragon Tattoo is still not a remake. This is an excellent David Fincher adaptation of a fantastic novel. It's dark, emotionally resonant, grisly, captivating and mature."
"Cecil_B_D_DeeVeeD","9","2","10","28 December 2011"," if you are in the mood for a grown up movie skip the Ghost in the Protocol and give the Tattoo Lady named Lisbeth a chance
","In re-reading my other reviews at stusblogs, it occurs to me that I have very few words of praise for the movies I write about. I realize that the rule of ""Nothing good to say, then keep your mouth shut"" doesn't apply in politics or film critiques, but I'm not sure the opposite - ""Nothing bad to say, then keep your mouth shut."" - is true either. So in the interest of a more balanced approach, I offer this review of a movie I thoroughly enjoyed.<br/><br/>Full disclosure - I have not read the Stieg Larsson novels that serve as the foundation for this movie. I once tried to listen to one of his novels in a books on tape format and had to turn it off before I fell asleep and crashed into a tree. I am sure that curled up in front of the fire and diving into Larsson's slavish attention to minutia is a pleasant alternative to slogging around outside in the dead of a Swedish winter. But I'm a Robert Frost kind of guy with miles to go before I sleep and promises to keep. So unless you are candy for my consciousness and swift on your predicates, I really don't have time to indulge.<br/><br/>I went to the movie with my wife on a day off kid duty. The grandparents were pinch hitting so we were able to see an adult movie in a real theater for a change instead of renting one at the video store and waiting until the kids were in bed and we were too tired to watch and enjoy it. She had tried to read The Girl with the Dragoon Tattoo and got bogged down about a third of the way in. Her one hesitation when I suggested the Girl over the Ghost was her apprehension that the movie would mirror the book's plodding pace.<br/><br/>Not to fear. In spite of it's length - 140 minutes which is almost two movies in today's Hollywood - the movie holds your attention and keeps you waiting for the next twist as any good suspense should. I won't belabor the plot. If you're one of the brave ones who read the book, then you know the story. You can enjoy the editing and decide if the essential elements of the narrative were preserved in the film script. If you haven't read the book, then enjoy the mood and measure of a tale that probes the dark side of human nature in a way that few films dare to do anymore. Be prepared to glimpse the heart of darkness as much as a film can show and not cross the line into the grotesque and prurient.<br/><br/>And while you are swept up in the mystery and revulsion of serial murder and family violence, take time to celebrate the actors and their performances. Christopher Plummer will probably get a supporting actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the guilt ridden patriarch.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Rooney Mara deserves an Oscar for her rendition of Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed lady who bears no resemblance to Groucho's Lydia. I suspect Streep will get the nod for her Margaret Thatcher interpretation since the Academy loves to pat itself on the back for bringing history to the screen. But my non-vote goes to Rooney who has made an incredible transition from professional football royalty to silver screen artist.<br/><br/>If you are passing out awards, I think you can skip Daniel Craig. I still fault him for reducing Bond to a one dimensional cut out caricature. Craig's range as an actor starts at A and ends at A. This approach doesn't work for Bond but it is perfect for Mikael Blomkvist, the disgraced, womanizing journalist who retreats into an historical Who Done It to find redemption and a way back to his soulless, philandering ways. Blomkvist really is the hero you love to hate.<br/><br/>Bottom line - if you are in the mood for a grown up movie that will leave you with something to talk about once you leave the theater, skip the Ghost in the Protocol and give the Tattoo Lady named Lisbeth a chance to entertain you."
"jewishboy98","8","2","10","26 December 2011"," David Fincher has made a brilliant film.
","Having never read the book I went to see The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo without any preconceived ideas about the characters or how the story unfolds. I therefore realise that this film may not live up to expectations of the book fans but in terms of a piece of cinema this is definitely as good as Fincher's previous work. <br/><br/>For those who have not read the book, the story portrays disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is asked by ageing patriarch Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the murder of his favourite niece, Harriet. The titular character, Lisbeth Salander, (Rooney Mara) is originally hired to do a background check on Blomkvist but is eventually drawn into his intricate and dark investigation. <br/><br/>As usual Fincher makes, what he can, fast-paced and thrilling but does find time for the heartfelt among the cut-throat action. Although the film is quite long it does not feel at all dragged out and overly long. <br/><br/>Mara is absolutely fantastic as Lisbeth Salander and gives a delicate and vulnerable aspect to the otherwise hardened and vicious girl. Daniel Craig shows off his already established talent as Mikael and Plummer, with his limited screen time, takes centre stage and steals the spot light from his colleagues. The rest of the cast do well but most of the plaudits deserve to go to Mara. <br/><br/>If you can stomach this fast-paced, gritty, dark and disturbing tale I urge you to go and see it not only because of Fincher's fantastic direction or Mara show-stopping performance but for the riveting and irregular ride you are in for."
"WaspEnterprises89","8","2","11","18 May 2013"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Review
","In a nutshell, I feel that this film was the one that stuck closely to the novel compared to the Swedish version and Rooney Mara managed to convey the character of Lisbeth Salander accurately to what I'd imagined in the novel.<br/><br/>The film introduces the audience to Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig), a journalist, who's convicted of libel against Hans-Erik Wennerstrom. Blomkvist ends up receiving a call that he's needed in Hedestad to solve the disappearance of Harriet Vanger, who's the niece of a CEO of a family corporation named Henrik Vanger (played by Christopher Plummer). Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara) is an exceptional hacker who works for a security firm and she's the one that provides all the information regarding Blomkvist to Vanger. Later on in the film, Blomkvist ends up finding out about Salander and the profile she did about him and brings her into the investigation to help him solve the mystery.<br/><br/>Although this film isn't without its flaws, I consider it miles ahead of the Swedish version. This version managed to stick as close to the novel as it could and it had a talented actress who helped bring one of my favorite female characters to life on the big screen. In the Swedish version, I felt that Noomi Rapace was wrong for the part of Lisbeth Salander, because she was a little old for the part and she wasn't skinny enough. In the novel, she's described as anorexic looking and I feel that Rooney Mara fit the part in both the emotional and physical aspects. Mara's Salander gives off the impression that she can be easily overtaken, but looks can be deceiving in the sense that she can take down whoever crosses her path. With Rapace's Salander, she wasn't portrayed as a well-rounded character. I felt that her portrayal was very one-sided. Mara's interpretation of the character felt realistic to the events that happened within the film. One of my favorite scenes is when Bjurman, her guardian, enters an elevator in the apartment complex that he lives in and thinking that it's some random individual in the elevator with him, Salander catches him by surprise.<br/><br/>Some of the negative things about the film are Daniel Craig's performance and a few questionable scenes that could have been written differently. Craig's acting wasn't bad, but I felt that he could have made an effort to put on a Swedish accent. As far as the questionable scenes, I felt that the scene where Blomkvist tries to escape from Martin Vanger's house and he ends up getting caught by Vanger and even though Vanger didn't have a gun on him, Blomkvist doesn't run, but accepts Vanger's invitation back into the house. I felt that they should have stuck to how the scene was written in the book.Without spoiling too much about the film, I also think they should have written the part regarding about what happened to Harriet Vanger more how the book laid it out.<br/><br/>Aside from the negative things about the film, I would highly recommend this film for people who've read the novel and who haven't read the novel, because the positive aspects of this film drown out the negative aspects. It evokes an interesting atmosphere (akin to some of Tim Burton's films) and it has an amazing music score.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"caroeb","3","2","11","2 April 2012"," An interesting cartoon
","David Fincher (director) and Steven Zaillian (screenplay) accomplish a solid, if limited, vision of Stieg Larsson's internationally acclaimed novel. If that required making a dark cartoon of the title character, she's an unusually interesting one that apparently appealed to the filmmakers: the underdog/heroine with ready-made (by Larsson) makeup, wardrobe, and ""attitude."" With a personal story that could be tweaked to ""keep it simple"" but is, by its nature, compelling. No worries about a sequel; ""Lisbeth's"" story is tweaked into movie-style completion in this film. Something about international high finance to gratify ""Lisbeth"" before she rides into the sunset on her motorcycle.<br/><br/>If Rooney Mara's acting struck me as robotic, where's the harm? ""Lisbeth"" = ""tough;"" robots = ""tough."" To add a little - realism, is it? - she doesn't have to act just a little ""vulnerable,"" she just moves through the plot element emphasized by the filmmakers to imply that she is, a little. Within their vision, a glaringly unrealistic element, in my opinion. And her halo slips while she viciously performs an unnecessary cruelty. But we suspend our better judgements when we are watching a cartoon, anyway. No big deal.<br/><br/>Tweak the internationally acclaimed plot a little more, and the respected investigative reporter, ""Mikael""/Daniel Craig becomes the (surprisingly well acted) perfect foil, an absent-minded professor type who bumbles his way through his part in an investigation while our heroine saves the day. (To make sure we don't miss his bumbling, Stellan Skarsg√•rd's character calls attention to his idiotic behavior, chalking it up to human foibles). No point in throwing out the investigation of a decades-old mystery completely, as it adds its own ""spice"" to the titillating mix. Besides, it's a ready-made (by Larsson) way to bring in ""Mikael""/Daniel to elicit ""Lisbeth""/Rooney's ""vulnerability."" But no need to dwell on any details of why/how two seemingly unlikely, previously unacquainted people manage to solve an ""unsolvable"" mystery. (BTW, Chris Plummer overacts his part: he brings poignancy and gravitas to this throwaway ""sub""plot).<br/><br/>I did mind the film editing, which unbelievably won the 2012 Oscar. But if you're already familiar with this story and you keep your wits about you, or if you use mind-enhancing drugs, you should be able to follow along some of the rushed through, chopped up plot elements chosen by the filmmakers to sort-of-include in this tale.<br/><br/>Overall, if you don't find the caricaturization of a punk ""tough cookie"" to be offensive, you should find this movie enjoyable. Sort of like a ""real-life"" Batman ensemble, with very nasty sex. If you might prefer characterization over caricaturization, and a story of two excellent and complementary detectives, the Swedish film of TGWTDT is for you."

Daniel Craig did a good job. The title character, his assistant, the girl with the tattoos and facial piercings was too bizarre to be believable. There were too many scenes of sex and torture. The plot also was bizarre. The author's anti- Nazi bias was evident. I don't recommend the film. I rated it at 6* only because of the good photography and acting by Daniel Craig.

"mgd_m","4","1","4","10 March 2019"," Flawed
","Mild spoilers ahead. This movie has several flaws. First, it starts too fast: the audience is abruptly thrown in the middle of an ongoing plot, leading to that ""wow, I think I missed the prequel"" feeling. Then, the two separate storylines about Craig and Mara take too much to merge. Third, the main plot about the serial killer is quickly forgotten when the movie adds another half an hour describing the closure of the trial, the scam, and the relationship between Craig and Mara. This is a mortal sin, because while you can do that in a book, its adaptation should take a different approach; I really dislike this kind of double-ending. Lastly, there was a lot of unnecessary violence and sex. While I have not problems with that when it's necessary, this movie left me with the feeling that they were included to artificially inflate both the story and the characters' appeal.<br/><br/>That said, TGWTDT is just a detective story with an extravagant lead character. Probably the worst movie by Fincher, even if it will entertain you for a couple of hours."

","Everybody says that this is a great movie; the box office, the Oscars, the bigwig critics, even the viewers' reviews all over the internet. But you know what? I have a mind of my own. And this is not a great movie by any mean. It is a bad movie, if not very bad as well!<br/><br/>The story looks like the worst Agatha Christie imitation. It sets up a mystery, in one place, and crowds a dozen of suspects, with no clues for you. That's the perfect way for the viewer to lose their interest, since nobody relayed on their inelegance, or admitted it in the first place. It's where they tell you ""Be just a viewer. Not try to think. There are more smart people in the movie to do that for you!"" So, I couldn't care less about a mystery that couldn't care less about me!<br/><br/>The pace is stupidly condensed. It's like a TV series that has been compressed, not even abbreviated. There are almost 3 hours that feel like 5 hours long. And to add more fuel, the editing intended butchering every single moment, with exhaustingly snap cutting that made the shot length range between one second and less than a second, to the extent of not figuring out many points, or listing appropriately to many lines. It's like being in a restaurant which puts the food in front of you for only an instant. Hence I was ""smelling"" subjects, for 3 consecutive hours, and it's no way for anyone to be satisfied!!<br/><br/>..And this won the Academy Award for the best editing?? There is something deeply wrong, not in me, but in the movie, and - accordingly - in the Oscars!<br/><br/>So the lead character Mikael Blomkvist had a fling with the title character for what reason?! Because she let him smoke unlike his boss / mistress?!! Basically, why in god's name that girl had sex with him, or rather fell in love with him?? That I didn't even have a possible answer to!<br/><br/>Every review refers to the genius way how the Swedish landscape was filmed. I didn't see anything genius, nor distinct, about it at all though!<br/><br/>45 years, and nearly all the crime's witnesses and investigators are alive, with sharp memory?!!<br/><br/>All the TV sets, in every part of the world, is on, and showing NOTHING but the news of businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m. So, whether there is no other channels or news on the planet, or there is no other way to give info in the scriptwriter's mind!<br/><br/>The serial killer has a room in his mansion, where he tortures, murder, and tears up women, for 5 decades, and his dear beloved wife, who lives with him in the same mansion, doesn't know a thing about it. Hmmm, far-fetched? No, it's TOTAL NONSENSE!<br/><br/>..And he films his crimes? Why?? To provide a full evidence against himself later?!! And what about the paintings that the grandfather receives? Why not to trace their sender back?? And if Anita gave her identity to Harriet, where did Anita go?? Ahh, maybe they said it somewhere but the editing slaughtered it. But if the movie's makers think that I may watch their work again to search for that; then they can't be more mistaken, because they didn't seduce me to do so by any way, not dramatically or cinematically!<br/><br/>The title character is shown as invincible ALL LONG. She's super smart like a walking Google, can't be beaten by anybody, and achieves victory every time so easily. This is boring. Moreover, if James Bond is described as unbelievable, then it's at least an admitted fantasy, but when The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo insists on realistic tone, then she's yet more unbelievable!<br/><br/>There is a mandatory lesbian sex scene in every Hollywood movie during the last 15 years. Honestly, I'm deadly sick of the obvious compulsion, the endless repetition, and the cheap commercial supplication of that. In this manner, I bet you, the children cartoons will include it too, very soon!<br/><br/>Then look at the movie's universe. It is rotten to the bone. Yes, I know that it's familiar in noir to present rotten places, characters, deeds. However, this time the relationships were deformed to inhuman degree, and the events contained many horrible and emetic images. Not only this, the movie made that always drugged and killer-wannabe title character as the most brilliant and pure character around. If that was the movie's substance and goal; then I hated it, before I couldn't buy it!<br/><br/>David Fincher. What are you doing man?! Once, you've done Se7en and Fight Club. And then, you're doing Zodiac and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Do you have a schizophrenia in terms of quality? Well, following your movies assures that clearly!<br/><br/>I liked the creative opening titles, the moment when Daniel Craig improvised catching the water bottle. NOTHING MORE!<br/><br/>All in all, let anybody love that movie, let the Oscar give it 1000 awards, and let the studies delude the people by buying reviewers, or even writing praising reviews under false names on the internet. Let them do whatever they want to do. The most important thing is: I'm not a parrot. Or in other words: THIS IS UNBEARABLE TO WATCH!"

","If you have seen David Fincher's previous movies you should know what to expect. However, this one is probably one of the best thriller/mystery movie that you will ever see. The premise is that a girl has been missing for the past 40 years and in order to know the reasons of her suspicious disappearing, her father deploys a journalist to solve this mystery. Daniel Craig is solid as the protagonist but it is Rooney Mara who steals the show with an electrifying performance which is quite unlike anything she has done in the past. Apart from having a commanding screen presence, her accent is spot on and she definitely deserved the accolades that she received. Visually, the film is a delight and the editing is crisp as well. Overall, the movie went by in a breeze despite its relatively long runtime."

Rooney mara did an awesome job in this film. With no hesitation and shame, she made the film more realistic. This film was banned in India, however i don't know the reason. Maybe our government is just a bunch of idiots. The director did full justification to the novel. The pace of the film is good and the locations are just outstanding.

The total role commitment from the star Rooney Mara is captivating - undoubtedly that is her movie. Crime, mystery and suspense that stay with you to the end.

So I guess pleasurable anal sex is worse to watch with gma than anal rape, but I digress. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was an excellent film start to finish. Even the opening credits were fresh and raw with music by Mr. NIN himself. Set the tone perfectly. It was cool to see and hear it on the big screen.

","It's not necessary to read the trilogy by Stieg Larson or have seen the original film with Noomi Rapace to judge this film. The most intriguing female literary character to emerge in recent years was interpreted beautifully by both Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara. But Rooney Mara excelled in displaying the fragile and ferocious aspects of Lisbeth Salander in a performance that was nominated for a Golden Globe/Oscar. This film, directed by David Fincher, raises the story two notches above the original movie with Academy-Award winning editing, masterful cinematography, and solid acting by all lead and supporting actors. Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Henrik Vanger is quite impressive. Daniel Craig gives a capable portrayal of Mikael Blomkvist, the discredited journalist solving a mysterious disappearance for Henrik Vanger. To write a review after many others have contributed much analysis pro and con begs the question ""Why bother?"" Here, I must recommend the film with a strong warning. The great failing of this film is Fincher's decision to push the envelope and introduce near- pornographic elements; here, sadistic sexual assault. Ironically, Rooney Mara's gutsy and believable performance leaves you wincing or fast-forwarding. Whether this follows the book or not, Fincher takes you into forbidden territory. IF one can get past this hurdle, you have an intricate story full of suspense. While no one under 18 should view this film, it is worthwhile for the compelling and memorable performance by Rooney Mara."
"cnycitylady","8","1","4","16 January 2013"," A gritty and harsh, but interesting tale
","This Gothic story is not for everyone. There are some very harsh elements in here that those with a weak stomach won't be able to sit through, but if you can grit your teeth and take it in, the ending result is very satisfying.<br/><br/>The story follows two characters, Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, an ostracized genius. You see how different their lives are until they begin to work together to find ""a killer of women."" Once they are united for a common cause you begin to see just how similar they really are. Yes they have different approaches to the problems but at their core they are the same. And you get the feeling that that is why they get on so well.<br/><br/>The direction of this film is wonderful, the world they live in is very gray and lethargic. The grayish tinge gives the film and story the sinister and insidious feeling that someone is watching you, that something terrible is about to happen, and its this affect that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This feeling is also elevated by the numerous side characters that surround the two main ones; No matter what personality they assume, you as the viewer have trouble trusting them.<br/><br/>The acting is credible at its worst and wondrous at its best. Rooney Mara, a relative newcomer to mainstream movies, outshines everyone she is working with in this movie. She captures her characters awkward, self reliant, brutal but caring nature so naturally that you can't help but empathize (or at the very least sympathize) with her. She was nominated for Best Actress and it was deserved. So in character was she that you would think she was a tom-boy in actuality (when in reality she is quite the opposite, very girlie is what she is.) Daniel Craig (an actor whom I wasn't too inclined towards) delivers a believable performance as Mikael when he portrays all of the characters confusion, sweetness and incredulous-ness; he also has good chemistry with Ms. Mara and when the two of them were in a scene together the movie really took off.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a mysterious, dangerous and beguiling good time. I would recommend this movie to any and everyone because it was splashed on screen so accurately (more so then the 2009 Sweedish version in my opinion) and hypnotically that you will want to see it over and over again."

","There have been occasions where I've seen an English language remake based on an original foreign film version and liked it just as much as the original, these include The Ring and Let Me In (Let the Right One In), I was surprised to see this one directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network) in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book rather than the original, but I love both equally. Basically, set in Stockholm, Sweden, co-owner of Millennium magazine, journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has ruined his reputation losing a libel court case against corrupt businessman Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m (Ulf Friberg), but he is given a special assignment by business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). The rich old man wants Blomkvist to pick up the investigation of his missing grand-niece Harriet who disappeared forty years ago and may have been murdered, he only agrees to investigate because Vanger worked alongside Wennerstr√∂m and has damning evidence that may help him in court. Meanwhile investigating Blomkvist is brilliant but damaged researcher and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Rooney Mara, from the remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street), also she has mental incompetency and is therefore under state legal guardianship, lawyer Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen) is appointed to be her guardian after the previous had a stroke. Bjurman abuses his authority and has her perform sexual favours for him to get money or whatever, starting with blowjobs and then he violent rapes her, but he didn't realise she had a secret camera filming it, and next day she returns to tazer him, tie him up, rape him with a dildo, and blackmails him to give her good progress reports and give her control of her money, and to make sure he remembers she tattoos the words ""I am a rapist pig"". Going through a notebook from Vanger, Blomkvist is trying to decipher written names and numbers in a notebook, his daughter identifies them as Bible references, and to help him with his research Vanger's lawyer Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) recommends him to see Salander who he knows is researching him. With her computer skills she finds a connection between a series of murders of young women killed between 1947 and 1967 and the way that they were killed, the Bible references seem to be clues as to how the victims will be killed, and during their time together Salander and Bromkvist become lovers, she is unaware he is already lovers with Erika Berger (Robin Wright). Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsg√•rd) is identified by Henrik's brother Harald (Per Myrberg) as a possible suspect, and doing her research Salander uncovers that his deceased father Gottfried and him did indeed commit the murders. Trying to get more clues Blomkvist breaks into Martin's house, but he is caught out trying to get away unnoticed and Martin chains him up, and attempts to kill him using a bag for suffocation and is about to stab him, but Salander arrives in time to stop this and chase Martin out, until they speed on the road, Martin crashes his car due to the icy road, and he dies when it blows up. Before he died Martin did admit to the other murders, but not to killing Harriet, so Blomkvist is nursed back to health by Salander, and in bed she admits that at twelve years old she tried to kill her father, and recovered he goes to see Harriet's sister Anita (Joely Richardson) because he is convinced she is still alive and her sister would know where she is. After waiting some time for Anita to contact Harriet and following her movements, Blomkvist correctly deduces that Anita is actually Harriet herself, she explains that she changed her identity and ran away because her father and brother sexually abused her for years, and she saw Martin kill their father in self-defence, the real Anita smuggled her away, after years however she tearfully returns to Sweden and reunites with her grand-uncle Henrik. The rich old man keeps his promise and give the journalist the evidence he wanted Wennerstr√∂m, but it turns out to be useless, but Salander on the computer proves the businessman has been doing wrong, and Millennium publishes the article about him that ruins him and forces him to leave the country, she also hacks into all his accounts, and travels in disguise, to transfer, into various accounts, the sum of 2 billion Euros. The end sees Wennerstr√∂m found murdered, Salander tells her guardian she is in love with Blomkvist, but before she can give him a Christmas present she spots him with Erika, and heartbroken she throws away the present and rides away on her motorbike somewhere. Also starring Geraldine James as Cecilia Vanger, Goran Visnjic as Dragan Armansky, The Secret of Crickley Hall's Donald Sumpter as Detective Inspector Gustaf Morell, Tony Way as Plague, EastEnders' Martin Jarvis as Birger Vanger and Alan Dale as Detective Isaksson. Craig gives a good cool performance as the disgraced journalist given an assignment, Mara is just as fascinating and engaging as Noomi Rapace was with her feisty, clever and sometimes dangerous attitude, and the supporting cast members, including Skarsg√•rd and Plummer do their parts really well also. The direction by Fincher is well paced, the story remains pretty much the same as the original Swedish version, but with a couple of new additions in terms of action, it does not feel like you are watching the same film, it is a brilliantly watchable crime thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Original Music for Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

","Hey everybody! Thank you so much for joining me again for another movie review. I am going to be reviewing the mystery thriller, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. David Fincher, the director of such works as Fight Club and Seven, was nominated for two Oscars for the films The Curios Case Of Benjamin Button and The Social Network. I'm a big fan of David Fincher's work. I love how he combines great stories with good cinematography. Sometimes the cinematography takes a back seat in his films and you get so involved in the story that its such an enjoyable experience. I have definitely taken notes for some of my future movies to come. Some cool things to look for in Fincher's films is how he uses low key lighting with green or blue tinted color temperature. The other thing I liked-- and I used in my short film--I adopted his idea of often featuring several single frames that flash on the screen in the middle of a scene. You know, when I watched the film I enjoyed it. I feel like the movie did the novel justice, but the only problem I really had with it was that it took too long to get to the point where you start to see the relationships between the characters develop and how they react with each other as the story unfolds. Like me, you might loose the interest of your audience but, then again, I understand the concept of building suspense, so its a love hate relationship with that aspect. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 American mystery thriller based on the Swedish novel by Steig Larson. The film stars Daniel Craig and Rooney Marie and tells the story of journalist Mikael Blomkvist's investigation to find out what happened to a woman from a wealthy family that's been missing for over forty years. Persoanlly, I love the story and even throughout the movie the director was able to build suspense and get you thinking or trying to figure out for yourself who was the culprit. Thats something I truly love about filmmaking when your able to involve your audience without really involving them. That is a technique I'm trying to figure out myself. What really impressed me about the film was how long the process took for it to finally go into production. Sony Pictures began development of the film in 2009. It took some time for the company to obtain the rights to the novel. The film's script took over six months to write which included analyzing the novel, but with a budget of 90 million they were off to Norway and Switzerland to shoot for seven months. Overall I enjoyed the dark, grim tone of the film, but the ending left me either wanting more or confused. It was brutal and entertaining. I think we get to see a new side of David Fincher and I'm interested to see what's next. I give it 9 out of 10 movie reels. Join me again for another addition of film reviews from a filmmaker...."

","An investigation where there are no clues left to find, little if any cooperation from those around you, any of whom could be the killer you are looking for. What's the plan? Is there one?<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig) is co-owner and writer for Millennium magazine and has recently suffered a professional setback that could bankrupt him and his publication. An unscrupulous man with alleged criminal dealings has won a libel suit that might end his career. Soon after, however, Henrik Vanger (played by Christopher Plummer) makes him an offer. Find out who is responsible for the disappearance and likely death of his niece Harriet 40 years earlier. He also believes that whoever's responsible is a member of his family. The family that lives on the same large estate they did during the disappearance and somehow manage to avoid speaking to each other. Blomkvist is promised a substantial salary in addition to evidence that will bring about the demise of the man who brought the libel suit against him. When he asks if he might employ a research assistant, Vanger's (Plummer's) lawyer recommends the woman who did the background check on Blomkvist before they hired him. A troubled loner with a peculiar appearance by the name of Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara).<br/><br/>Now I have no doubt that the books on which this film and its 2009 Swedish language predecessor were based on are better than the movie. Not because I've read them. In actuality, I haven't read a book since high school. But since people who do read the books first ALWAYS say that the book is better, then it must be the case. It couldn't possibly be an effort on their part to sound and feel superior. Putting that aside, Craig as Blomkvist was a surprisingly wise choice and Plummer, along with others, make for an intriguing, albeit despicable Vanger family. But the real star is Rooney Mara as the brilliant, beautiful, and unstable Lisbeth. Despite a few small roles in other films and guest appearances in numerous television series, Mara's most recognized for her performance in The Social Network. That role was child's play compared to Lisbeth. This is truly a breakout performance that, one would hope, could bring a slew of bigger roles and a long successful career."

I would definitely recommend this movie to others who enjoy the mystery/suspense genre, however because of the vulgar/disturbing aspects of this film, it may not be for everyone (certainly NOT children).<br/><br/>This movie is long (2 hrs 37 min), although it didn't feel like it. I was very much wrapped up in the mystery/characters/storyline that the time flew by. I look forward to seeing the other movies in the series!"

","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 mystery/thriller based off of the book by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson. The plot takes place in Sweden, where big shot journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Crieg) finds his money, job, and, most importantly, his credibility gone after being sued by the international company Wennerstrom. Soon after, out of nowhere, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporation, calls and offers Mikael a job. When they meet, Henrik asks him not only to write his memoir, but also to investigate what happened to his long missing niece, Harriet. <br/><br/>After Mikael arrives on Hedeby Island, he soon learns the dark secrets of the Vanger family, and the long line of hatred among family members. Soon after, Lisbeth Slander (Rooney Mara), a surveillance expert and computer genius with a very troubled past, is hired to help. Together, Blomkvist and Slander work hand in hand to solve the mystery of what happened to Harriet Vanger almost forty years earlier. In the end, the surprise is bigger than any of them could have ever imagined. The award winning music in the movie has a big part in setting the events about to happen, and stressing those events. The sound crew in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo did a great job of making the music realistic, or how it subtly flows between actions. Yet in some areas, such as the opening, it seems too loud and vulgar to go with the quiet settings of the upcoming events.<br/><br/>This movie, directed by David Fincher, gives us a deep look into the lives of two very different people, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Slander. However, for those looking for the perfect ""book-to-movie"" handover; we're going to have to keep looking. Although the main plot stays close to the book, the ending starts to drift to far from Larsson's writing for my liking. Also, Lisbeth is given a slightly more innocent, emotional attitude, rather than the ""rough tough"" attitude she is given in the book. Overall, it's a great thriller by a great author and great director."
"eshwarmail","8","1","4","13 October 2012"," Not the best of Fincher's work but a damn good one nevertheless.
","Tense atmosphere, lucid locale, intriguing premise and a breakneck speed defines this latest movie from David Fincher. Have not seen the original but loved every bit of this. Rooney Mara literally blew me off considering what she looked like and how she presented herself in the previous Fincher's flick 'The Social Network'. Such thrillers are hard to come by these days (mostly because each time the plot cannot be set to remote locations with limited access to technology or make them periodical).<br/><br/>Daniel Craig (Mikael) is an investigative journalist who just lost a case of defamation on whom he wrote an inconclusive article. On the verge of being bankrupt, he gets an offer to write a biography of a wealthy patriarch in his twilight years and most of his life was influenced by the disappearance of his niece 40 years ago. Once he smells malice in the story, he recruits a malnourished, abused but a brilliant computer expert to help him solve the case.<br/><br/>My synopsis adds nothing to what you already do not know and barely scratches the surface of its plot. The story comprises of an assortment of interesting and sketchy characters and the treatment is of orthodox whodunit style. The scripts invests a lot on ideologies of its principle characters which finally justifies what they do when they do it. The director though an expert in this genre considering Se7en and Zodiac does an excellent job here too placing more emphasis on the setup and atmosphere than the actual thrills which works wonders but I don't think he outdid his earlier mentioned work. Rooney Mara steals the show with her portrayal of a person who is difficult to be accepted by the society and leaves a lump in your heart while portraying her fate with subtlety towards the end. Background score is apt and cinematography is dreamy. The movie also boasts excellent production values in presenting the very short periodic aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Not the best of Fincher's work but a damn good one nevertheless."

","Checked out the movie ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"" starring Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, and Christopher Plummer. When I first saw the previews with this movie I was very intrigued! I was like thinking to myself, ""what is going on in this movie?"" There's a cool looking girl with wild hair and tattoos all over the place. Plus the title of the movie is ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."" I thought it was one of the most intriguing movie titles I had ever heard. It just made me wonder. Then I remember looking at other titles like ""The Girl That Kicked The Hornet's Nest"" and ""The Girl That Plays With Fire,"" and I was thinking, ""is this a trilogy or something?"" Then I find out its an international best selling trilogy novel! Even though I didn't see the other movies and I didn't read the novel I just had to look at this movie. It was wearing on me. I just had to know what all the excitement was about.<br/><br/>Now that that is out of the way, I honestly felt like the movie was okay. I didn't feel like it was one of the best films of the year and I felt a little confused...and empty. As far as twist goes this movie was kind of like dangling a carrot in front of a rabbit, but not quite letting the rabbit have the carrot. When it seemed like it was time for the rabbit to have the carrot, the carrot was still not delivered to him. Then what I felt like was an awesome climax was even a climax. There was still more to the story that wasn't bad, but they could have let Henrik be the one to give Mikael the evidence for the Wennerstrom case. I felt like there wasn't a need to show how Lisbeth got the evidence and eventually got him killed due to financial swapping. I understand she loved him and love will make you do some crazy things but he warned her and I thought the movie was suppose to be about solving a case that deal with a woman that was missing for 40 years.<br/><br/>Then the sub plot...I'm just going to call it Lisbeth versus Nils was questionable. I say questionable as far as, should this have even been in the movie. Its not about the gruesomeness of it at all, I just felt like there could have been a different sub plot of a different way to show that Lisbeth just has bad luck with things...<br/><br/>Okay, it is also important to keep in mind that there is a lot of dialogue in this movie. So there are going to be moments were you might get a little bored, but at the same time you have to pay attention to understand the little details and clues that are giving to you though out the film. Its also important to know that there are going to be some parts of this film that are going to be hard for the eye to see. There are some disturbing parts and gruesome parts in this film! So if you're not a fan of that, you might not want to watch this film. I say that because I know there are people that do not like to watch stuff like that.<br/><br/>I tell you what I do like about this film. I did like character Lisbeth(main female character) in this film. She was sharp, smart, different, cool looking, and interesting to watch though out the whole film. I will say it was interesting to see how she handles things and what her response would be to certain things that happened in the movie. I also like the fact that she got some revenge and you will know what I'm talking about once you watch the film. I also enjoyed the different feel of the movie too. This movie felt different for reasons I can't quite explain, but enjoyed.<br/><br/>I'm giving this film a 6.5 out of 10. This film is overrated to me, too much hype. There's no real twist in the movie. Plus I felt like there were things that could have been done different and things that didn't need to be in this film. I love different just like the rest of the world, but when you put in it movie form, the movie has to gel and be delivered properly."
"RainDogJr","Null","1","4","27 January 2012"," Calm down, kids, ""Dragon Tattoo"" is not a masterpiece! I quite enjoyed it, tough
","Sometimes the hype for something gives you the excitement and the anticipation. But sometimes what happens is the exact opposite. I didn't believe the hype for anything THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I stayed away from the books, the Swedish films and the American version. I read in twitter someone who was like ""this is the very first time I ain't rushing to see a David Fincher film in its opening day"". While I'm not crazy about Fincher, I do love most of his stuff. And since ZODIAC (from 2007) I have been there, with great expectation, for the new Fincher picture. ""Dragon Tattoo"" was the exception for me too; I just wasn't waiting for it. But after all, I did ended watching it on the big screen during its first week in my city! My sister (a huge fan of the books) went to the opening day on Friday, loved it and then took me to the cinema yesterday. * Did you like it? * Of course when the credits rolled she asked me that. The first thing I said to her was that it was really damn long, but that yes, I did like it.<br/><br/>Let me be clear: ""Dragon Tattoo"" is not a masterpiece. It's very enjoyable, but for all the kids who were truly impressed I will have the following few words: calm the f*** down, I have seen this many times before and I have seen better (from Fincher himself)! Hell, I even thought this was some sort of KILL BILL as more than just one person (especially the women) was praising a lot the "" fearless girl getting revenge of a pig f****** man"" thing. But that actually is just a small part of the film. Pretty much it's a subplot of a subplot, if that makes sense. We have like two different films going on. The film of Daniel Craig's character Mikael and the film of Rooney Mara's character Lisbeth. The first one is a classic murder mystery story¬Ö <br/><br/>I'm a huge sucker for this kind of murder mystery thing and I really loved some of the elements. The setting is classic. I think the last time I watched something similar was in THE GHOST WRITER by Roman Polanski: main character leaves home (here Mikael travels to an island in Sweden) do a extremely well-paid job for one man; he settles there and of course there will be some strange things¬Ö mystery, it is. The whole thing going on in the island is quite interesting, and it works: it's an island that is owned by a family of powerful businessmen, and also some former Nazis. And pretty much there's not great communication between them. Anyway, my only problem with this whole setting was the language thing. I guess it was a difficult situation for Fincher, and I appreciated (even as a guy who, like I said, haven't read the books nor watch the Swedish film trilogy) the fact that he didn't move the story to, for instance, the US (think in LET ME IN). It would have not been the same. But then again, why not at least have the supporting Swedish characters speaking nothing less than Swedish? I would have loved that for sure. <br/><br/>And on the other hand there's the central figure of the film: the girl with the dragon tattoo. Miss Rooney Mara, I applaud you. I didn't even realize she was the same actress with the small yet important role in Fincher's previous feature THE SOCIAL NETWORK! Her character is, as needed, very likable. I guess the thing I enjoyed most of this film was that it builds the two most important characters by separated and when they finally meet all the expectations are covered. I mean, we know we are watching everything for that important thing that is their meeting. It's a great kind of entertainment, with Craig and Mara really on fire. Think in SE7EN. There's brutal stuff here too (about rapists, serial killers and the Bible ‚Äì and yes, the word Bible fits perfect in that sentence!). Even tough our two detectives are actually a journalist and a hacker, there's great police stuff too (with Macbooks and scanned old photos everywhere). However, and sadly, the film eventually drags a bit, and falls to be pretty ordinary. And ordinary may not be the problem but just that there's nothing brilliantly shocking anymore. Something's missing, and that something is a key factor for not having me rushing in order to see the Swedish trilogy or read the books. <br/><br/>*Watched it on the big screen on January 25, 2012"
"petermerricks","7","1","4","25 January 2012"," Still not the book, but a bit better...
","I know it is always difficult to be faithful to the book, but I viewed it on the basis that if I hadn't read the plot, would I have understood everything. Both my wife and I agreed that it was difficult to follow on that basis.<br/><br/>I do give it credit for being better than the Swedish version which was raved about at the time, but I'm afraid that that one was even more confusing.<br/><br/>In the Swedish version it did not explore enough the relationship being built up with Lisbeth and Mikael.<br/><br/>I felt the US version was better with the casting, and I found Lisbeth very believable in this version, and truer to the book. Daniel Craig was a good casting too.<br/><br/>I feel that I need to watch the Swedish version again to reacquaint myself.<br/><br/>I suppose that the books were simply too good."
"CagedinSanity","7","1","4","18 January 2012"," Dark, very dark.
","Spoilers in this review, pretty much immediately.<br/><br/>The only reason I allowed myself to watch this movie is because I read firsthand that the rape victim gets her revenge. That alone got me through the scene, and her revenge was much more glorious than the 'parental guideline' implied (It was just a bare-bones 'this is what happened' anyway).<br/><br/>Barring that, it was a great movie. There's little else for me to say beyond one minor complaint; It took too damn long for the two main characters to become connected. Beyond the fact that the titular ""Girl"" investigated the journalist, they remained unconnected throughout most of the movie, which I didn't like. I expected more interaction, so that when their sexual encounters came along I wouldn't be as confused.<br/><br/>And I was very confused. Obviously this is a girl who shook of her rape to an extent and was, as I read somewhere, ""Sexually overt"", so it's not the fact that she was 'back on the saddle' right away, but more so WHY she's giving herself to this man. I just can't figure that out. That will bug me for a while, as I try to figure out some logical conclusion.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Daniel Craig should have put forth some effort into an accent, given his name, location, and pretty much no sign that he was anything but Swedish. But it didn't bother me too much, as his acting was fine.<br/><br/>Other than all of that, it was a grand movie. Very dark, and didn't screw around with the subject material. I applaud it for that."
"mistarkus","9","1","4","9 January 2012"," Ultimate Contemporary Film Noir
","The ultimate contemporary film noir was created as modern information gathering and communication techniques took us through an evolving mystery that was filled with interesting characters. <br/><br/>The dark story and Gothic style created an edgy moodiness that enhanced the intrigue and made an exciting experience. The mystery was multi-layered, well thought out and although a bit horrifically fantastical was still absorbing. There is a tremendous level of decadence and perversion in this mystery which had similar overtimes to the classic Silence of the Lambs. It focuses in on, what I heard was an alternative title to the novel, violence against women. And one of the most intense revenge sequences that not only menacingly satisfies but at the same time smartly adds a level of momentum created one of the best individual scenes of the past year.<br/><br/>Even more than the intriguing mystery, the creation of one of the most mesmerizing, interesting characters enhanced the experience. A thrilling character to get to know, the ""Girl"" became the ultimate strong anti-hero/feminist even more so and more developed than ""the Bitch"" in Kill Bill and Sigourney Weaver's character in the Alien movies. Richly dark and edgy her Gothic anti-society appearance blended well with the way she holds herself; angst ridden and moody. Despite the evilly rebellious exterior she is incredibly technologically savvy, brilliant, tough, and nearly fearless. She has a fiercely independent sense of self. The sense of self made her confident and self-actualized sexually yet adding a layer to this greatness was a level of vulnerability. Her vulnerability was not only the traumatic kind, but simply the minor kind which we all have in our lives and can relate to. The kind where minor imperfection and mishaps occur, the kind where she can't get exactly what she wants, the stuff which we all experience. This created a relatable individual despite her renegade appearance, and almost supersonic abilities and therefore she is a character we feel for and understand. We got to know this soul as she merged with the intriguing mystery.<br/><br/>There was an initial switching back and forth between the mystery and the character creation. This blended well together so that there was never a dull moment.<br/><br/>The story was a bit horrifically over the top and the abilities, almost powers of the ""girl"" put the movie on a borderline reality/fantastical realm. The character's strength and sexiness will be hard to forget."
"davidgee","7","1","4","5 January 2012"," Only intermittently thrilling
","I approached this without preconceptions, having neither read the books nor seen the Swedish movie version. This big-budget version has an appropriately Scandinavian feel to it: bleak, wintry and dark. Some of the characters attempt a vaguely Nordic accent; others (including Daniel Craig) wisely do not.<br/><br/>The movie gets off to a slow start and goes on far too long. The pace only picks up when Mikael realises he's pursuing a serial killer and recruits Lisbeth to help with his research. The unmasking of the killer is not an enormous surprise, and the killer's 'back story' is out there in the twilight zone with the early life of Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>Craig is much better cast in this kind of movie than as Pierce Brosnan's substitute. Rooney Mara will be an actress to look out for, although I thought the SM scenes with her lard-ass 'guardian' were superfluous to the central plot and a bit too unpleasant to watch. An interesting movie, but often tedious and only intermittently thrilling."
"mariared-849-823291","10","1","5","13 February 2014"," I liked it!
","I usually hate remakes especially when the original movie is so good, but in this case I liked the American version more then the Swedish one. I think that the American version had a more mysterious movie like vibe, instead the Swedish one was more clinical, almost like a documentary. Physically, the Swedish Blomkvist doesn't look too good so I wasn't looking forward to see love scenes with them. I preferred if there were no sex scenes with them together as they were as gross as the rape scene in which appears yet another lecherous character you don't want to see naked. Craig and Mara made more sense together and the age difference between them didn't put me off."
"motezart","9","1","5","7 February 2014"," Dark and suspenseful- Overall Well Done
","Thanks to David Fincher, the world now has Rooney Mara to admire (and stare at). She plays the Goth misfit Lisbeth in this film, her first lead role, and she's actually pretty good. She does revenge particularly well. A fierce character, while not dominating every scene, Rooney dominates the film. She is the one we think a hour later.<br/><br/>I will not try and compare her performance with Noomi Repace's, whom I also love to watch. Both do Lisbeth their own way.<br/><br/>When Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) gets into some political hot water and needs to get out of Stockholm, he takes a job as an investigator in the Swedish countryside trying to solve the mystery of a disappeared girl, but there are people that do not want him to to find the answers. Eventually he teams up with Lisbeth and they work on the case together.<br/><br/>In the first part of the film, the intersecting story lines between the two main characters are done with skill. Many scenes are not action or dialogue based (they are just visual), yet all they all add to the story. The decision to film this version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Sweden, as opposed to swapping it out for some American city, was a well made one.<br/><br/>Since so much of the story is told in images, kudos goes to the editors Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. Both are long time collaborators of Fincher, and they've both won multiple Oscars, including one for this film. I get the suspicion that they worked extra overtime on this movie; there are just tons and tons of scenes, a complete 180 from the style of Panic Room.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Rooney and Craig really builds throughout the film as the two work great together. The irregularity of the pairing makes it much more interesting and intriguing to follow than most typical, on-screen romances.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not the most depressing of all Fincher productions, but it's still pretty low down there, and I mean this in the best way possible. It's either always raining or cold outside while sometimes this environment is contrasted against interior scenes that are pristine, white, clean. Tension. Clean rooms don't seem to appear often in Fincher films, and as expected there are many others that are dark and dirty.<br/><br/>The film ends in a reasonably satisfying way leaving us hanging, waiting for the sequel.<br/><br/>Errata: I could have gone without the final Stockholm scene when Lisbeth is riding her motorbike through the streets as it snows. A similar situation occurred in The Wolverine (2013) where Logan rode a motorbike through the mountains in Japanese winter. These situations would never occur. Motorbikes and snow are never a very convincing combination (for me anyway).<br/><br/>More reviews at getthebonsaw.blogspot.com"

"iamyuno2","8","1","5","4 January 2014"," Faithful Re-Creation Of The Swedish Film
","A very well-done film - and it rivals the quality of the original Swedish film it obviously emulates, in style and substance.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is great here as the male lead - it's one of his best performances. <br/><br/>And the story is told with all of the edge and darkness of the original. I didn't feel the need - having seen the original - for its being re-made, but a friend took me to this film and it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>I disagree with reviewers, however, who argue that this film makes a feminist statement. Yes, a woman is abused here; but men are abused in other films, and in real life too. We're all human and we all face trouble from time to time - which is why we can also sympathize if not empathize with the female lead as she struggles to overcome a difficult past. You do not have to be a woman to feel her pain or root for her search for justice, if not revenge. We root for her just as we root for a Wyatt Earp when his brother is killed and another maimed by a band of outlaws. This is a story about injustice and a corrupt system that protects some very bad people - not unique in the annals of history or film (which is why we all can care and relate to it).<br/><br/>Well done. Worth seeing.<br/><br/>Does it rise above the level of its genre, that of a ""thriller""? I'm not sure. That's why I did not give it 9 stars. But it's an exhilarating and intense ride and rivets you to the very end."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","5","1 January 2014"," A complex, dark mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing till the end
","The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo begins with disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who is battling a massive libel case which has the potential to destroy both Blomkvist and his family. Things take a turn for Blomkvist when wealthy industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) offers to get the case against Blomkvist dropped if he can solve the 40 year old mystery surrounding his niece's disappearance. With the help of investigator and expert computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), they both try to get to the bottom of what has happened to Vanger's niece.<br/><br/>I really like films that keep you guessing and this film did precisely that. Although it is a rather slow film, it was always interesting. Every single segment in the film was like another piece being added to the jigsaw puzzle. Blomkvist's investigation isn't made any easier by the fact that Vanger's family don't really speak to each other after the little girl's disappearance and therefore he finds that he has to conduct separate investigations with each family member.<br/><br/>This is initially structured as 2 separate story arcs; Blomkvist is investigating the disappearance of Vanger's niece whilst Salander is investigating Blomkvist, but she also has her own problems with her sleazy guardian which leads Salander to investigate him as well. Once she has completed her investigation on her guardian (I won't reveal plot points here, so you'll just need to watch the film), Salander is invited to assist Blomkvist in solving the missing girl's disappearance. She, in effect, becomes Blomkvist's research assistant.<br/><br/>As well as the film being constantly engaging and constantly leaving you in suspense, I also found the character of Salander to be fascinating; her dark and multi layered complexity made her very interesting. I also thought that Rooney Mara was excellent in her portrayal of Salander and managed to balance her emotions really well; at time she was rather meek and quiet, but there were also times when she showed that she wasn't a woman to be reckoned with. Daniel Craig was also very good in the lead role and the rest of the principal cast all did an OK job, but for me it was Rooney Mara that stole the show. Fincher's direction was also spot on.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of mystery films and films that keep you guessing, then TGWTDT will be right up your street. It is a slow burning film so it will require patience, but the pay off makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE; I haven't seen the Swedish version yet, but having enjoyed this version I will be sure to check it out."
"robinski34","8","1","5","15 September 2013"," The Girl with the Older, More Intelligent (Swedish) Sister
","(I meant the film) To start with I have to eat some words. I said in another review that I wouldn't see this film because I didn't want to tarnish my memory the superlative Swedish original and as a (very) minor protest against the crassness of Hollywood in remaking it, but I did see it after all.<br/><br/>It's an excellent cast, even if there are only two Scandinavians (the superb Stellan Skarsgard, and Yorick van Wageningen as Bjurman) among the main players. Daniel Craig is, thankfully, not all action, which would have been inappropriate. Christopher Plummer is faultless as Henrik Vanger, and Steven Berkoff delightfully mysterious as his lawyer Frode. Skarsgard's portrayal of Martin Vanger is also superb, although the character's more subtle traits have been lost between book and script.<br/><br/>The inevitable question is how does it compare to the original film? The answer, pluses and minuses. Rooney Mara's performance is excellent, but I found her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander a bit too repressed, almost dispassionate in places, compared to Noomi Rapace's definitive original, and I was not entirely convinced by Yorick van Wageningen's take on Bjurman, although it must be an exceedingly difficult role to play. Craig's Blomkvsit has much to recommend it, but I think he is too dynamic compared to Michael Nykvist's original. As a whole I think Fincher's version is a bit too slick, diluting the sense of dogged investigation that serves the source material better.<br/><br/>Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's soundtrack for Fincher's last, 'The Social Network' is note perfect, here I found it invasive to begin with, and although the musical interludes settle down, the soundtrack is close to dominating in places where the drama should have centre stage.<br/><br/>All in all I am glad I saw it, it's a great film, but more a remake of Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 screen version than a new adaptation of Stieg Larsson's book, nonetheless well worth seeing if you can handle some violent scenes ‚Äì but do wait 2 or 3 months then see the original Swedish films too (if you haven't), they are superb."
"jubakala","8","1","5","29 December 2012"," The original is SO MUCH better
","I have nothing else to say but, watch the original Swedish trilogy. The first part of it, and the whole trilogy as well, is 100 x better than the American version. I understand the reason to try to make the ""Hollywood version"" of this story, but it was and is, just an insult towards the original. Although I am from Finland, I must say that Swedish movies beat the Finnish ones practically every time, and this is not an exception. <br/><br/>I admire Rooney Mara's work on The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, but still, Noomi Rapace is the original and only Lisbet Salander. Period. Again, watch the original and let's hope we'll never see the parts II and III for the American copy. Original is always best."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","1","5","17 October 2012"," A mostly pointless film, but well-made and gripping
","I always thought an English redo of TGWTDT (or the Men Who Hate Woman as the original Swedish novel is clumsily titled) was utterly pointless. From watching the end result you'll be mystified as to where the $90 million budget went (the 2009 version cost $13 million). Thankfully the movie itself offers a bigger mystery to distract you from that, but globally the 2009 movie was far more successful and made more money. It seems that $90 million was spent simply to appeal to Americans who couldn't be bothered reading subtitles.<br/><br/>The story is mostly the same to Niels Arden Oplev's interpretation, with a few relatively minor deviations and contractions. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig, not even bothering to attempt a Swedish accent) is disgraced journalist who is hired by Henrik Vanger, a wealthy old businessman, to solve the 40-year-old disappearance of his favorite niece Harriet. He takes the job to keep busy while his name and reputation turns to mud.<br/><br/>Mikael throws himself head-first into the case but soon requires an assistant and so he recruits Lisbeth Salander, a misanthropic genius who did the background check on him. Together they uncover decades of dark family secrets and the wrath of a still active killer.<br/><br/>Like Niels Arden Oplev before him, David Fincher almost gets the balance between visual and verbal storytelling right, but loses his grasp on the multiple characters and references to dates, places, and people. Some of the dialogue that should orientate the viewer regarding such things is too quiet, quick, and mumbled. Inattentive viewers will not find this film easy to follow. It does however have far superior photography to the 2009 version, which I thought looked flat and plain and was shot nasty Super-35. Fincher's incarnation is shot in lovely 5K Redcode RAW and is far superior when it comes to atmosphere and mood.<br/><br/>Not exactly a film to watch with your grandparents (curiously, the screening I went to was filled with OAPs) but a solid mystery for grown-ups who want something deeper than the average episode of CSI."
"Hitchcoc","8","1","5","25 May 2012"," Will They Continue the Series?
","I know the first thing I'm supposed to do is to compare the original with this American remake. To be quite honest, I don't really see much to justify the remake. Of course, we aren't asked to read subtitles. The character of Lisbeth is a bit more harsh in the latter film. But I didn't really get much new information in the second film. It is obviously more polished and more skillfully produced, but that isn't always the best. I enjoyed a bit of the darkness of the original. The bad guys are just as bad. The rape scene is more graphic. I am also curious to see if Daniel Craig or the other principal characters are interested in moving things along. For whatever reason, I am really taken with the entire story but feel satisfied that the story has been already been told. I always enjoy another angle, another interpretation, so I'm hoping that they do decide to add to the opus."

"laurascheri","Null","1","5","22 May 2012"," A good film from a difficult novel
","This might not be Fincher's best film. ""Fight Club"" and ""Se7en"" are masterpieces, and masterpieces are rare. However, there are various reasons why I like this film.<br/><br/>Compared with the recent Swedish version, the story is tenser, the rhythm less slow, the characters better casted. Craig gives us a much more convincing interpretation of the role of Blomquist. Mara is as good as Rapace was. The sub-plot relating to the strictly journalistic aspect of the story has been given less accent, and that contributes to concentrating our attention on the main plot.<br/><br/>As for the rendering of the novel, all adult readers and movie-goers know better that great directors give their own gist to stories. Sometimes directors change radically stories which are good as novels, turning them into very good films. Think about what Ridley Scott did from Dick's ""electric sheep""...<br/><br/>Mature audiences do not expect the director to transfer all the details of a book into a film. Maybe young kids are disappointed if they do not see all the characters and situations they have read in a book exactly turned into a film. This is why, for example, 2 films had to be made from the latest Harry Potter novel. Adults appreciate synthesis, immature audiences want analysis.<br/><br/>What I liked most is Fincher's unmistakable touch. Of course, if you don't like Se7en or Fight Club you will shudder at some scenes which are indeed violent. Violence, however, is necessary to the plot, and only a great director like Fincher can describe the depths of a perverse mind."

","this is my favourite film at the moment. It's so good. The only thing i wish they did was make Lisbeth look more like how she did in the book with the hair a short as a fuse and the clothing. And also those little changes that don't make a big difference but i wish the didn't change. Like not mentioning Lisbeth's mother and Mikieal finding out about Lisbeth's incompetence and the incident with her father when she was a child. But i didn't actually mind the ending i though it was actually just as good a the original ending. Apart from that its the best film i've ever seen :)you should definitely watch if your looking for a clever, complicated and interesting film."
"estreet-eva","7","1","5","12 April 2012"," Well-executed particularly given some tough source material
","David Fincher of the brilliant ""Fight Club"" is to be congratulated in his success in translating Steig Larsson's smartypants, hyper-violent, dank steampunk novel into an entertaining movie. One wishes Ron ""Opie"" Howard could have shown the same skill in his dismal filming of the Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"". Fincher does not shy away from presenting the convoluted, vicious story of intrigue in the very foreign country of Sweden as written. This trust in the material, which Howard did not show, reveals an acceptance of the fact that this story was inexplicably popular among book clubbing housewives. Fincher presses the accelerated right from the beginning and does not let up through the entire 2 and 1/2 hour run-time risking losing viewers as the twists of the mystery unfold. Although tough to follow and often tough to watch the intriguing story winds up like a really good episode of ""The X-Files"". Also to be congratulated is the Academy of Arts and Sciences who recognized that newcomer Rooney, quite literately, put her all into what is ultimately an unpleasant and unattractive character. It was a nomination and maybe even an award that was well-deserved. Daniel Craig, who need to carry the film given the constraints of the largely non-verbal Salandar character, makes for a passable Blumquist. Stockholm native Stellan Skarsgard excels portraying a mixture of bourgeoisie charm and generational psychopathy. In short, it's a tough sit but a rewarding one."

Though Daniel Craig's Mikael is interesting, it's the character of Lisbeth which fascinates the most and affects the audience. Mara infuses her character with gloom and rage.

Overall acting was good, i thought Mara did a good job as Sahlander although Naomi Rapace was excellent and she will always be Sahlander.<br/><br/>I know some complains at the disturbing scenes in the movie and i feel they are even more disturbing in the Swedish version, but a movie that moves you in any sort of way, whether its disturbing, funny, romantic or in an angry way i think is reaching its goal.

"Ryan_MYeah","9","1","5","3 February 2012"," It kinda tries your patience, but David Fincher and Rooney Mara excel.
","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is David Fincher's follow up to The Social Network. It had some serious hype behind it, and for the most part, lived up to it. The movie begins with promise in the form of a stellar opening credits sequence (They had me at Karen O.), and leads into a very unnerving two and a half hours of suspense and mystery.<br/><br/>The movie has to juggle together the narratives of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. This type of back and forth cross cutting between the two is a bit on the uneven side, but when David Fincher's involved, such a thing can be expected, and forgiven. From head to toe, this is a Fincher film, and it's probably his most brutal film since Fight Club, so it's never an easy watch. He's enlisted expert crafts people that nail his style, including Jeff Cronenweth's brooding, sometimes claustrophobic cinematography, and a moody (if at times grating and overplayed) score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that works nicely in the film (Thanks more to Fincher and his music editor than the composing duo), but makes a hideous listen as a stand alone.<br/><br/>Though I praise Fincher's direction, I still have issues with the script and with the pacing. I don't always think the script quite ties everything together as well as it should, but that may have a bit more to do with the editing. It's not that Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter's work is bad, In fact, it's actually good stuff. But the second hour of the film tends to drag, as does the ending, which goes on much longer than it needs to. I'm willing to be forgiving up to a certain point, but Fincher was really trying my patience.<br/><br/>Oh well, you can at least say that it wasn't a wasted experience, if only because Rooney Mara is spectacular in this movie. She not only looks the part for Lisbeth Salander (complete with excellent makeup), she vanishes into the role. This character is troubled, sexual, intelligent, and completely scary. Mara manages to convey subtle, filtered emotions, also topped with the occasional humorous sprinkle, to the point that I forgot that she was even acting. Undoubtedly one of the best characters of 2011.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

I found out that an American version was being made and was excited to see it. <br/><br/>On IMDb I remember seeing that Carey Mulligan was attached to play Lisbeth and then later on it changed to Rooney Mara attached. At first I was disappointed believing that Mulligan was the perfect choice for the film but when I saw Mara on the screen I knew she was pitch perfect.

","although i agree to some extent with the generally accepted critique of the final act and that of the source material, i found myself completely engaged and involved. the vision of Stieg Larsson's work through the eyes of David Fincher marks the return of his dirty minded leanings under the guise of beautiful, pale images and ominous atmosphere. accompanied by a rather inhospitable decoration to the environment, everything that takes place on the island is of precise darkness/coldness (literally translated in the lack of a heating instrument in Mikael's residence). The film is largely built around contrasts: Mikael/Lisbeth, Stockholm/Island, present/past, youth/wisdom.. there's also the supposed similarities between Harriet's past of abuse and trauma and that of Lisbeth, helping to expand on the story of the investigation and giving hinted insight into Lisbeth (a fascinating character). the film adopts a consistent parallel narrative between Mikael and Lisbeth, that is a great model of precision and tempo; This is to delimit two distinct sides that are continuing to attract before joining in and creating a second parallel story that will maintain the narrative to the end (using a technique of voice-overs spilling into scenes that follow).<br/><br/>there's a lot to say and admire in Fincher's assured and matured technique and plot devices. same goes for the performances, especially Rooney Mara. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo captures something essential in its too main characters, and ultimately makes Lisbeth a compelling cross between a guardian angel and an angel of death; humanized."
"Robert_duder","10","1","5","25 January 2012"," Brilliant, dark, unhinged, beautifully haunting
","There was so much talk and anger over an 'American' Version of the Swedish version of The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. I hope that the final product puts much of those angry words to rest because David Fincher scores again with one of the greatest dark mystery thrillers I have ever seen. I went in with mediocre expectations, I have never read the book and don't particularly care to. Everything about this movie simply works, much the same as Fincher did with Social Network a year ago. The beautiful music, the breath taking dark and twisted setting of Northern Sweden, the brilliant characters (edging out any performance from the original film even), and the fact that they held nothing back including the violent rape scene and the vengeance scenes that followed. It is the definition of an epic with multiple stories all surrounding the main plot of an ages old murder mystery. From beginning to end I was riveted and just constantly stunned by the darkness and the gritty feel to the film making it easily one of the best films of the year and I might ridiculously shut out by the Academy for everyone except Rooney Mara.<br/><br/>I might have completely given up on the Academy Awards if Rooney Mara hadn't gotten a nomination because in my opinion she single handedly gives one of the best performances I have ever seen on screen. She is brilliant, absolutely haunting, twisted, emotional and driven as the socially inept, deeply scarred but intellectually brilliant Lisbeth Salander. I have no doubt she took a page from the performance of Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version but adds levels that Rapace didn't touch. Daniel Craig proves he's not just James Bond by playing disgraced reporter Mikael Blomkvist. I think he just blew away the role compared to the original Swedish version. He added depth, layer, compassion, and a level of the anti-hero the character was meant to have. His odd but palpable connection and chemistry with Mara's Lisbeth is brilliant. Christopher Plummer adds immediate class to the cast although he has a sadly very small role but does well in it. Stellan Skarsg√•rd is also excellent as Martin Vanger who gives Craig a run for his money. The supporting cast is good enough including Plummer and Skarsg√•rd, but Craig and Mara bury anyone else.<br/><br/>As much is the film about Craig and Mara's performance as it is about the setting of this film. Its dark and cloudy and very grey all throughout and it just haunts you and rivets you to the screen. The film isn't perfect, I think setting it in Sweden but having people with English accents is a bit much to overcome but it won't take away from the brilliance of this film. Fincher truly surprised me with Social Network, a movie I had no expectations of and blew me away, and now this film. It isn't for the faint of heart and the rape scene is absolutely brutal, as is the actions she takes after, but you can't but be in true awe of everything this film is. Brilliant! 10/10"
"IronBallsM","Null","1","5","23 January 2012"," A very good and intense mystery thriller.
","Reading a bit here, it seems to be a key to enjoying this film is NOT reading the book or seeing the Swedish movie.<br/><br/>This is one very well structured and intense mystery thriller. It boarders on over-the-top in terms of adult theme but I was riveted and intrigued every step of the way. The performances are incredible and Rooney Mara deserves every bit of praise that she has generated for her portrayal of this complex and troubled character. There are a few logic flaw moments but they don't hinder the film at all. I do like that they gave us what amounts to a sequel tacked on to the end of the movie. Once the main plot is resolved, we get a resolution to a secondary plot that I didn't think they would go in to so thoroughly. It was like watching a later director's cut version of the film without having to wait for the DVD. That's what happens when a studio let's a big name director release what he wants, good for them."
"virindra","8","1","5","22 January 2012"," It even got better and better.
","Due to some internet problems this is the second time I have to write my review for this movie. But here it comes: I have heard of this millennium trilogy and I was very curious. But I never saw the movies in the Swedish version. I never read the books which are sold very well. Now this Fincher's version I could not resist seeing in the cinema, so I just went.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was beautiful. Dark images, computer animated. Very beautiful. The transfer between these dark (black) images and the actual movie was not very well. This movie is about Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who agrees to investigate a several murders on women on an island. At the beginning I saw that Stellan Skarsg√•rd was in it. So I already knew that the odds were big that he had something to do with it. Good actor though, I don't hope he was chosen for this movie because he only was born in Sweden.<br/><br/>When the story goes on, we gets to see what this girl Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) has to go through in her daily life. That was very bad. I'm sorry, I don't know how to put this into words. I really felt sorry for her. No woman should go through something like that. I know that this just is a movie, but these things could happen in real life, or even worse. That got me thinking. Some people are really sick. Good acting from Yorick van Wageningen here. Good actor, liked him in Winter of wartime.<br/><br/>Like Robin Wright gets prettier every year (most women don't), this movie gets better and better. When you think the movie is over, it isn't. The story goes on and on and it's a good story. As a viewer you really get treated on a good movie. Good acting, good story. It is worth the money.<br/><br/>As we have seen the bad life of this young girl Lisbeth Salander, you really want the best for her. So does she want that for herself. At the end of the movie she hopes for a life with Mikael Blomkvist and is left all alone in reality. So I am asking myself what would I have done, but that does not make the decision of Mikael Blomkvist easier to understand.<br/><br/>Very, very good movie. I cannot wait for the next two movies. I know, I can read the books or watch the Swedish version, but I am spoiled with Fincher's version now."
"Avwillfan89","9","1","5","22 January 2012"," The adaptation the book deserved all along
","Let me start by saying David Fincher is one of the best directors in Hollywood today and his films are truly unique and artful. In this brilliant movie, his technique for cinematography and quality is top notch and apparent from several of his other movies dating back to 1995 (Se7en). <br/><br/>Rooney Mara really is the real Lisbeth Salander from the books. Although Noomi's version was just as good - she didn't physically resemble the Lisbeth from the books. Mara's Lisbeth is hard, socially inadequate, vulnerable and child-like. In the books she is constantly portrayed as looking like a child or a teenage boy, and her physique and interpretation are spot on. <br/><br/>Daniel Craig's Blomkvist is also a lot like in the books - slightly unemotional and dedicated in his left wing beliefs as a journalist in the Millennium magazine.<br/><br/>As for the comparisons between the Swedish film version and the book itself - I thought there were both good and bad things. First I'll start with the bad things - the debate between Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist concerning whether Martin Vanger should be understood for his actions because of his terrible dysfunctional relationship with his father is omitted (in the Swedish film and the book, this is an important understanding of the difference between the two characters) - Lisbeth's line to Mikael after she saves him from Martin, asking permission to kill him (Lisbeth doesn't ask permission) - the absence of the scenes between Lisbeth and her mother - Lisbeth telling Mikael about burning her father alive (we don't find that out until the second installment of the series, least of all from Lisbeth's own mouth) and finally the circumstances involving the encounter of Miriam Wu by Lisbeth. <br/><br/>Now the good things involve mostly around the fact that - apart from a few of the bad things I mentioned earlier, it's very faithful to the novel. The actors are perfect in their portrayals and the writing is terrific. There's a twist in the circumstances of the missing girl, which for me was refreshing since, after reading the book so many times, the events in the film were quite predictable. I'm also glad they changed the event of Lisbeth breaking her computer, instead of having the crap beaten out of her by random thugs for being female, like in the Swedish version (which didn't make any sense - plus there was enough violence done to her by Bjurman), she bashes a robber after he took her computer.<br/><br/>Overall absolutely terrific movie that deserves a few Oscar nominations, especially for Best Picture and Best Actress. There are some extremely horrific rape and revenge and animal cruelty scenes which are hard to swallow but it was still generally good thriller entertainment. I congratulate everyone who worked on the movie and for being daring enough to make it so different from the rest of the Hollywood movies out there."

The rest of the new ensemble was outstanding as well. The sexual aspect was more vivid and emotionally charged.

"a-ozornin","9","1","5","17 January 2012"," The most atmospheric film of the year
","This was probably the most waited-for movie of this winter, and you can quite understand why. David Fincher, the director behind the Fight Club and the Social Network, took on the bestseller detective by Stieg Larsson and invited Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara to play the lead roles. On every account that should have been a good movie.<br/><br/>But Fincher defied odds twice. Not only had he turned rather boring book into pretty strong plot. He actually filled the Larsson's universe with atmosphere so palpable, you almost see it filling the room from the screen. He didn't lie when he put in the trailer the phrase ""The feel-bad movie of the year"". It goes against all the Christmas sweetness and fluffiness, it is unsettling and provocative. It realistically depicts psychopaths, rapists, murderers ‚Äì all the dark sides of life. With almost documentary accuracy he depicts rapes and tortures. This slow-paced movie filled with carefully written dialogs and naturalistic violence, has nevertheless powerful catharsis, inevitably approaching you like the mansion in the trailer. This is not the detective in the usual sense of it ‚Äì the actual case is solved in less than an hour. This movie was built solely for the purpose of the atmosphere of darkness, and to expect anything else from it would be a miscalculation. <br/><br/>Of course, such powerful atmosphere would not have been possible without the right cast. Rooney Mara, who played in the Social Network under Fincher, is a perfect Lisbeth ‚Äì very smart outcast, who nevertheless needs love and attention. Cynical and unemotional on the outside, Lisbeth is vulnerable and caring ‚Äì this is a very difficult role to play convincingly, yet Mara is up to the task perfectly. I have to praise Daniel Craig as well. After this movie I realized, that the Bond role is simply not for him. His Mikael Blomkvist, intelligent but very down-to-earth, is perfect, and I believe this is the type of characters that suit Daniel the best. He plays Mikael on ease, in a stark contrast with Bond where he tries to live up to expectations and make a serious yet ironic face.<br/><br/>There is one flaw with the movie, the missing bit of the overall puzzle ‚Äì I am talking about Mikael's daughter and her relationship with her father. The line is told just to put a tick in the respective column; there is no exploration, no purpose ‚Äì nothing that would illuminate why the character was brought in the story in the first place. Other than that, all the characters are fantastically written and played, they are dark and insane yet convincingly alive.<br/><br/>P.S. The opening credits. These are not so popular nowadays, and the last opening credits that I liked were from the Watchmen. Fincher revitalised the old tradition and introduced amazing credits to the tone of the Immigrant Song, seen in the trailer. For some reason they remind me more of Bond movies than generic credits, but they set the right tone straightaway.<br/><br/>VERDICT: One of the most atmospheric movies of the season, dark, unsettling and insane. WATCH: if you are tired of the Christmas craze and sweetness, or just want to plunge into the world of psychopaths.<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"

","Last night, I walked into The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo fostering a number of prejudices. I couldn't understand why David Fincher would direct a remake of a bestselling novel. I scoffed at the idea that Americans are afraid of subtitles. I sighed impatiently after realizing that the running time was two hours and forty minutes. I ended up enjoying the Hell out of it.<br/><br/>As the opening credits explode on screen, Fincher sets the tone for what is a brutally confident and visually aggressive thriller. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian says, ""Nothing in the movie quite matches the terrific opening sequence,"" which pounds its way into your head through its use of a ""nightmarish, amorphous vision in liquid monochrome."" What transpires next is a rather even-handed introduction to a trilogy based on the characters of Stieg Larsson. Sure the movie has its flaws ‚Äì like why does Daniel Craig keep his English accent, or the clich√©s and scenes that almost drag the film down a number of dull meanders ‚Äì but it is the malevolent and at times perverse intensity that etches its way into your mind long after the film is over.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara is Lisbeth Salander, a vulnerable private investigator and hacker who becomes involved with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a discredited journalist hired to uncover a murderer in a wealthy feuding family. The pair are brought closer together by the sinister secrets that begin to unravel after Lisbeth cracks a mysterious code.<br/><br/>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo features a number of solid performances, from the conflicted Mara and cardigan-wearing Craig, to the array of memorable characters such as Lisbeth's vile guardian or Mikael's distant wife.<br/><br/>Also, following their Oscar-winning collaboration on The Social Network, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are back with yet another menacing hard-edged score, as violent synthesizers rumble. The film opens with a soaring industrial cover of Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin (as heard in the popular trailer for the film), with Karen O's voice giving it a distorted exposure during the slick silver montage.<br/><br/>Even when it really slows down, the movie never drags, and at least you can get a good look at a sickly world inhabited by cyberpunks, twisted Germans, ferocious degenerates and Daniel Craig in spectacles. A very powerful first move by Fincher, who gives this remake some brutal purpose."
"BlairMcLovin","8","1","5","14 January 2012"," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Review
","Having been underwhelmed by the original Swedish adaptation I was excited to see if Fincher could elevate the admittedly flawed source material to the extent that he has been able to in his past films. Fincher succeeds through his deft control of the production, managing to craft an absorbing mood and narrative that is engaging and compelling cinema, in lieu of the shortcomings of the novel.<br/><br/>Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography captures the Swedish landscape just as beautifully as he handles the cubist architecture of the buildings and offices and how the characters interact in these spaces. This element improves on the original for in the lengthy exposition and moments where you're not entirely sure what the characters are talking about/researching, the images are still of a quality that you remain invested in what the film is trying to convey whether or not you understand it.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic across the board with even minor characters given memorable portrayals. Mara and Craig have a great chemistry on screen, and although I found the romance to come out of nowhere (as it does in the novel) it was handled well by both actors even if it does not seem realistic considering Salander's previous interactions with men. The lengthy epilogue suffers from a lack of tension since the mystery has been solved by this point, but because it is so well handled and the montage of Salander pulling of the heist is easy to follow, the scene is appreciably well handled even if seemingly tacked on.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the source material did not have a great deal of thematic depth, and the film as a result has little to read into other than the nihilistic vibe consistent across all of Fincher's efforts, it is memorable as a thrilling and exquisitely built ride, but a surface level ride nonetheless."

","A little more than a year after gaining critical acclaim for The Social Network, David Fincher is at it again, adapting another well-loved story for the big screen<br/><br/>In The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Fincher seems to have extended stylistic leftovers from his previous outing and supplanted them into his newest effort with much aplomb.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, this is a remake ‚Äì disaster could have prevailed. Luckily, the modern day auteur (seemingly unaffected by Hollywood execs) is incapable of making a bad film.<br/><br/>Even his worst film, Alien¬≥, is actually so well crafted and unique in vision, that for all its problems, it manages to avoid pitfalls of a picture obviously sabotaged by producers.<br/><br/>On the basis of my viewing experience, the Americanized version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a stark and grittier product than its Swedish counterpart. That's right, it's a superior remake.<br/><br/>Both director, and writer (Steven Zaillian) do an intelligent job of keeping, adapting and removing various parts of the novel to benefit the film's flow. The dialogue is natural and terse, allowing characters to consciously step on each other's lines to add a sense of authenticity.<br/><br/>One of Fincher's most undervalued talents is his attention to character nuance ‚Äì avoiding clich√©s of stilted performances, which in essence builds the unique universes he's so revered for.<br/><br/>The film follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and his experiences in Sweeden during the investigation of a 40-year-old murder. Hired by the wealthy Vanger family to uncover clues to the murder, Blomkvist ends up using the assistance of an accomplished but socially awkward investigator Salander (a equally sultry and scary performance by Rooney Mara).<br/><br/>The bulk of the two and a half hour film consists of observing Blomkvist and Salander as they unravel the lurid mystery from the isolated Wanger Island.<br/><br/>By building both characters up front, the audience is compelled and completely indebted to the investigation. Fincher uses his great eye for imagery and pacing to really sell the picture ‚Äì particularly in scenes that could have fallen to contrivance, or dullness.<br/><br/>For instance, one set piece shows the two characters in separate locations compiling research and fitting final clues together. About ten minutes into this sequence it dawned that there had been almost no meaningful dialogue. Instead, the entirety of its structure was just a series of pictures, computer screens, printed words and reaction shots. It was also one of the most intense and suspenseful sequences of any film from 2011. Saying it's impressive would be an understatement. This is Fincher working on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Mara is a revelation as Lisbeth Salander. Both physically and emotionally, she goes all-in with her portrayal. From the multiple piercings to the detailed tattoos and punk aesthetic, it's hard to believe that it's the same sweet girl who opened The Social Network as Mark Zuckerberg's girlfriend.<br/><br/>One cannot discount Craig's performance either ‚Äì a fine partner to Mara's bold interpretation. In addition to the two stellar lead performances, Fincher gets great acting out of Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard and Joley Richardson.<br/><br/>Fincher does not hold back in portraying adult material here. From two horrific rapes scenes to the depths of torture and mutilation, the film confronts uncomfortable visuals in bleak whites and murky shadows. These scenes are necessary, though, as the audience ends up feeling empathy for the characters, which, in turn, helps ramp up tension.<br/><br/>Overall, this is masterfully crafted 'action' film ‚Äì one that makes you think as you recoil or guffaw at its sinister subject matter, or streaks of black humour imbued throughout. Fincher, again, has proved himself a master, elevating his clout amongst Hollywood's most intriguing talents. You can call it a remake, but I prefer to think of tit as a superb continuation of his style and mood so effectively refined in 2010's The Social Network. Heck, he even got Trent Reznor to come back and do the score."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Swedish journalist Mikhael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has had his credibility shattered after losing a court case brought against him by a giant corporation for printing an alleged in-truth. With his career hanging in the balance, Mikhael accepts an offer from an eccentric man named Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to locate a girl who went missing over forty years ago. As he digs deeper into the case, he uncovers a pattern of serial killings that may hint at the girls disappearance, as well as a dysfunctional family that want to tear each other's throats out. Mikhael finds he must join forces with troubled, socially awkward freelance journalist Lisbeth (Rooney Mara) who was involved in gaining insider information about him to his enemies in court, in order to get on top of a deadly net that's closing in on him.<br/><br/>Not a town known for it's creativity and original ideas (and, with a recession blazing, even more so) Hollywood has a history of adapting foreign films that have gained a cult status (that it's dubious whether they'd have got had they actually been from there originally) and turning them into bigger budget productions that are often, to say the least, not as good as their source material. Thankfully, this is not the case with David Fincher's adaptation of Sieg Larson's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the first of what promises to be a trilogy of adaptations of novels in the series.<br/><br/>Having seen the original film, and been impressed with the visceral way it gets under your skin, there were few genuine surprises in store for me here in the way the story pans out, but it remains a compelling murder mystery, as well as a dark, unflinching glare into the heart and mind of a serial killer, which Fincher handles the way he's handled similar themes before in films such as Zodiac and Se7en. The Hollywood style has naturally granted it a sleeker, glossier look than it's Swedish inspiration, but it still maintains a dark veneer through out, which is matched by the style and the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Performances wise, Craig is an inspired choice in the lead role, his intense acting style perfect for the role, while Mara is a revelation as the unfriendly, unsociable but troubled and sympathetic young woman. Since they're the main driving force of the story, it's fitting they're all playing related characters, but as the support cast the likes of Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard and Joely Richardson are a credit too, really creating the impression of a family where everyone hates each other's guts and each are holding secrets from each other that could serve to shatter.<br/><br/>With a 158 minute running time, and having to live up to the standards of such great source material, Fincher's film would have to pull a real cat out of the bag to work and, thankfully, it's done it, the first Hollywood slant on a series of works that will hopefully set the tone for the rest. ****"

Yet after seeing this film, I've been looking at buying the box-set of the Swedish version, I'm hooked.<br/><br/>The title sequence seemed to me like a more disturbing Bond, especially with Daniel Craig appearing. I suppose the fact that they were a tad disturbing, should have set me up for a couple of hours of me shying away from the screen, to be honest, I'm not sure I've got the stomach for it. The acting from both Craig and Rooney Mara along with the impeccable story line made me stay.<br/><br/>Apart from the few unsettling moments, it is very frank and candid, creating a funny repartee between Craig and Mara.

","Both the original Swedish version and Hollywood's rendition have followed the book so closely that the user review on the former probably covers 70% of the ground for the latter.<br/><br/>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132620/reviews-155<br/><br/>What remain to be done would be just a few notes on the subtle differences.<br/><br/>Under David Fincher's inimitable helmsman style, the stunning opening credits, both visual and audio, grab your full attention. Employing a fully Hollywood cast (resisting strong suggestion to retain English-fluent Noomi Rapace and counting Stellan SKarsgard as ""fully Hollywood""), Fincher made a wise decision of shooting the authentic Scandinavian landscape. The story-telling is more fluent and some intimate and accessible, as expected of Hollywood. To compare the two as uncut and refined diamond may be taking the metaphor too far but not entirely inappropriate.<br/><br/>Reportedly with fiendish hard work under relentless demands of the auteur, Rooney Mara has done a marvelous job in the almost unbelievable transformation from the pretty, smart but otherwise unimpressive Harvard girl in ""The social network"" to the iconic ""Dragon Tattoo"" girl. Daniel Craig has brought more personality to the character of Mikael than unassuming Michael Nyqvist but this is neither compliment nor criticism to either. This may be as simple as Craig's firmly ingrained James Bond persona. Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard and Robin Wright have given performances that should satisfy their respective fans."
"msmith5484","8","1","5","11 January 2012"," Compelling mystery thriller - a little long
","I admit I didn't care much about this until I heard David Fincher was involved. I loved his work with Fight Club; Se7en; The Social Network; The Game. I liked his story telling with other movies I thought were just OK (Panic Room; Benjamin Button; Zodiac) I was aware there was a book and a first movie, but I didn't know anything about either as to content. I really liked it. The story was interesting, the acting superb, especially Rooney Mara (I will be looking for more from her), the cinematography is excellent, the direction well paced and suspenseful. But, to begin with, the main title sequence seemed out of place. It looks more like the opening of a James Bond movie - weird. Also, and these are dramatic changes, mostly to shorten the film (158 min. is a bit long) I could have done without all the business about Lisbeth's guardian, both the one who has the heart attack and the one who rapes her. I realize it's 'gritty' and is supposed to show how she's abused but fights back, but, I thought the subway scene where her bag is stolen and she fights to get it back did the same thing, only quicker. Actually, I don't know why the whole thing is there - she's a genius hacker - she could just plunder peoples/companies bank accounts - there's no need for her to go asking anyone for money. I think maybe the author had a rape/revenge fantasy he wanted played out. Also, I think it would have been better if she hadn't sexualized her relationship with Mikael, he would have made a better father figure and would have made their relationship more compelling. I think Lisbeth is a fascinating character, I would have liked to have learned more about her and how she lives her daily life and how she became an investigator - maybe that's in the book. I really like the look, atmosphere and pacing of Finchers movies, this is no exception. He is a terrific storyteller. I will always be interested in what he's doing."
"Litmonster","9","1","5","11 January 2012"," I just love Daniel Craig
","I saw the original version two years ago, which was very close to the book. I don't like it much except for Noomi's performance. Maybe because we don't see lot of Swedish films, I just don't find the actors as attractive as those in this re-make version. I don't feel any chemistry between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth, not at all.<br/><br/>In the new version, I see more emotions, more female emotions attached to Lisbeth by Rooney. The ways she talked to Palmgren, the way she felt for Mikael and the ending. I don't remember seeing Noomi's facial emotion in the ending. Of course, Daniel is as handsome as in 007, even it is said he has put up some weights for the role(I don't feel much difference except with less muscles).<br/><br/>And for Daniel, this is the second film that I saw recently for non-action Daniel Craig. Dreamhouse is too sad. But this one is funny and clumsy. You just can't imagine how clumsy a 007 would be. The way he mumbles when got shot and Lisbeth is like taking care of someone much naive than she is. And the sex, I have to say, it's very 007 style and it's more beautiful than the old one. Just want to see more.<br/><br/>The plots are more reasonable, giving credits for the created Mikael's daughter, the old version Cecilia (I don't see any points in the original book for Cecilia's affair with Mikael). Also for the humors.<br/><br/>The last but not the least, the musical in the beginning is very powerful."

He has just lost a libel case where he exposed a Madoff-like villain, but could not prove his facts without revealing his sources. He is about to lose his life savings and his magazine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Swedish multimillionaire Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plumber, ""Priest"") has hired a leather-clad, pierced, tattooed young woman (Lisbeth Salander played by Rooney Mara, ""The Social Network"") to investigate Blomkvist using her internet uber-hacking-powers. Vanger has a mystery he needs solving: His niece has gone missing and presumed dead for forty years. However, he receives an anonymous gift from her that only she would send. He wants Blomkvist to find out who is sending the gifts.<br/><br/>But Blomkvist cannot do it alone; he needs the help of the very person who did his background investigation - Lisbeth. Now, it is up to him and his unlikely companion to uncover the coldest of cold cases. And we're off¬Ö<br/><br/>I've never read the 800-page tome (by Stieg Larson) that inspired this movie, but I did see the original Scandinavian version. The Hollywood version is every bit as good as the original, and then some. The first difference is the amazingly complicated and detailed CGI opening credits. I felt as though I was watching a Bond movie intro. The other big difference is the longish aftermath. The ending goes into a good bit of detail about what happens to our characters after the thrilling climax. I have to say I enjoyed both additions. <br/><br/>I do have one complaint: The original film made Lisbeth appear to be the aggressor in her relationship with Blomkvist. She even appears to have manipulated him. This new version has changed that relationship. I preferred the original ending. Sadly, I cannot say which is more true to Larson's novel.<br/><br/>The plot had the potential to be incredibly complex. It involved at least a dozen members of Vanger's family. On top of that we had to constantly switch between 1960's Vanger-family and current-day Vanger- family. However, the director (David Fincher, ""The Social Network"") had Blomkvist post a family tree on his cabin wall with pictures of old- family and current-family. It was a very nice device which allowed the audience to keep all the players straight.<br/><br/>I have heard that some people thought the depiction of sexual violence was gratuitous. The rape scenes were not easy to watch. However, they were certainly no worse than the original Scandinavian version. I think there is no good way to portray rape. Panning to curtains blowing in an open window doesn't do justice to the violation of the victim. Whereas showing the details of the act may, by some, be seen as titillating. I felt that the director had the balance right. It was clear our victim was being hurt in a most personal way, without exploiting the act for entertainment. This was most clearly demonstrated as we saw the victim in the shower later that night with cuts and bruises over a third of her body. If any movie-goer experienced voyeuristic pleasure in the rape scene, then it should have been snuffed-out by the shower scene.<br/><br/>The movie clocked-in at about 2 hours and 40 minutes. And while it was longer than most movies, it didn't disappoint. The mystery, action, and unfolding lives of the protagonists made the time slip by. However, there is no good reason to rush out and see this movie in the theaters. In fact, it is a good one to curl up on the sofa with someone you find dear. So, for a good retelling of a now-classic tale, but a bit on the longish side, I recommend you wait for the instant download."
"tom_moggridge","9","1","5","9 January 2012"," David Fincher striving towards the role of auteur?
","David Fincher's take on Stieg Larsson's; The Girl with the Dragon tattoo may not stray too far from its original working as a novel but in it he does manage to bring the first chapter of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist's story to life in his own, almost auteur Esq, way.<br/><br/>On returning to the thriller genre Fincher has pulled out all the stops in making his latest picture whilst making no apologies for not holding back on the, sometimes gut-wrenching, visuals. Elements of his previous works such as; Fight Club and Seven can be seen in the title sequence and shocking images that are visible in all three films along with those of his other movies, giving Fincher the feel of a rising auteur, perhaps comparable to an early Tim Burton or Scorsese, in what could be a key picture in acquiring Fincher such a title.<br/><br/>Of course fans of the original novel will be aware of the difference in the plot towards the end, in which the killer receives what he is thought to deserve for his sadistic and torturous ways, in Fincher's version, perhaps considered a comparison between that of the American and Swedish justice systems? Also noticeable - along with Craig's 'none Swedish' accent, which serves well in casting Mikael further apart from the Vangers and his Swedish counterpart - is the performance of actress Rooney Mara and her portrayal of Lisbeth Salander. Mara displays a vast range of character emotions from naive and feeble anal rape victim to almost, psychopathic, ruthless revenge artist. She provides a star performance for the audience which is both gripping and compelling and it is hoped that she will escape being type cast as the 'freaky, abnormal, punk' and go on to provide us with further star quality roles in 2012.<br/><br/>In short Fincher's take on Larsson's Swedish set novel can be considered a must see by all cinema lovers, delivering exceptional performances from a well put together cast and pushing Fincher into the role of the auteur whether knowingly or not."

"EUyeshima","8","1","6","5 July 2012"," Complex, Propulsive Thriller Feels Chilled but a Superb Turn by Mara Kicks It into High Gear
","Having never read the late Stieg Larsson's 2005 source novel, an unforgivable oversight I know, I didn't know what quite to expect with this 2011 crime drama beyond what I already knew of director David Fincher's generally dark-hued work (""Fight Club"", ""The Social Network""). For instance, I didn't know the film's narrative would be bifurcated until the midpoint of its 158-minute running time. One side of the movie belongs to the girl of the title, Lisbeth Salander, a deadened goth-punk computer genius, and the other side belongs to Stockholm journalist Mikael Blomkvist whose latest expos√© of corporate evil about a billionaire Swedish magnate has been declared libelous. Disgraced and broke, he accepts a private investigation job offered by Henrik Vanger, an elderly industrialist who would like to resolve the 40-year-old mystery of his murdered niece Harriet in the Swedish hinterlands up north. The list of suspects, Blomkvist is told, includes several members of Vanger's dysfunctional family, eccentric fascists and Nazis still living within walking distance from his manor.<br/><br/>Obviously, as Blomkvist gets closer to the truth, his life becomes more endangered. Juxtaposed with Blomkvist's investigation is Lisbeth's unenviable existence back in Stockholm. Having just compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Vanger, she has just been appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, due to her state-declared mental incompetency. Bjurman abuses his authority by forcibly raping her. Lisbeth eventually regains control of her life by blackmailing him in the most degrading manner possible, an act of revenge both horrifying and satisfying. Blomkvist decides to hire Lisbeth to help him uncover the connection between a cryptic message written in a notebook and a series of murders that occurred from the late 1940s to the mid- 1960s. The labyrinth plot escalates into a series of increasingly revealing connections between Harriet's disappearance and the entire Vanger dynasty, in particular, Harriet's brother Martin, now the CEO of the Vanger Corporation, and their estranged sister Anita, living in London with no desire to reunite with what remains of her family in Sweden.<br/><br/>At the same time, Lisbeth and Blomkvist become romantically involved, which naturally brings its own set of complications but also provides the impetus for a final act of revenge. I assume screenwriter Steve Zaillian's adaptation of the source novel remains faithful, but just as important, he manages to present an elaborately plotted thriller with most of the necessary details presented intact. Fincher does an impressive job propelling this complicated story with dazzling cinematic technique and handles the more lurid moments with the same professional ease he displayed in ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac"". However, the meticulous emphasis on procedure sometimes disinfects the movie to the point of making the principals feel more like plot devices racing toward the resolution. At certain points, the plot developments feel as cold as the wintry Scandinavian setting. Despite this tonal discord, the cast works effectively within the story's convolutions and conventions. Even with a variable Swedish accent, Daniel Craig is able to submerge his cool Bond persona just enough to play the wry, middle-aged investigative reporter in a compellingly human manner.<br/><br/>Christopher Plummer as Vanger, Joely Richardson as Anita, and Robin Wright as Blomkvist's married editor Erika all play their roles with precise authority and surprisingly convincing Swedish accents. In more challenging roles, Yorick van Wageningen as Lisbeth's abusive guardian and Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Martin are even better. However, it's Rooney Mara (Mark Zuckerberg's scabrous girlfriend in the opening scene of ""The Social Network"") who really gives the movie both its mystique and emotional wallop. With pale eyebrows, shapeless clothing, and awkward manner, Mara's Lisbeth concurrently craves attention and deflects it with almost every movement. The actress makes her character's savant skills and photographic memory perfectly believable and most of all, makes Lisbeth's seeming passivity quietly heartbreaking with a modicum of expression. It's a superb, star-making performance. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth deserves mention for capturing the severity of the chilled images needed to convey the story, while the original music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provides an appropriately haunting undercurrent."
"Turfseer","6","1","6","10 June 2012"," A Scandinavian 'Blowup' that keeps your interest despite significant contrivances
","On the surface, the American version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' directed by David Fincher, has a lot going for it. Despite the slow exposition, the story picks up when Daniel Craig as journalist-investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, is hired by Swedish magnate, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, who vanished from the family compound forty years earlier in 1966.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is how Blomkvist, with the assistance of Goth-like computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, partially solves the mystery, mainly by discovering clues buried in old photos taken at the time of Harriet's disappearance. One is reminded of Antonioni's 1966 film 'Blowup', which was released in the same year the murder mystery in 'Tattoo' is supposed to take place.<br/><br/>There are other well done scenes in 'Tattoo', particularly the harrowing rape scenes where Lisbeth is violated by her court appointed guardian and later when she turns the tables on him, an example of vigilante justice. Equally as gripping is when Blomkvist is imprisoned by Vanger's serial-killer nephew, Martin, who tortures the journalist but is saved by Salander, who arrives in the nick of time.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly excellent, including Rooney Mara, who plays the glum, rebellious 'damaged goods' ward of the state, with aplomb as well as the always solid Christopher Plummer. The bad guys are equally as menacing--only Daniel Craig, seems out of place, as he doesn't seem like he's from Scandinavia. To be fair to Craig, the script saddles him with a rather deadpan part, with Blomkvist the least interesting of the principal players. One unfortunate shortcoming in the Hollywood version is that there's mention of a number of characters with a 'Nazi' past, but the nature of that connection is never explored in any detail whatsoever.<br/><br/>Despite a thriller that keeps one's interest to the end, nagging questions remain which tend to lessen the film's overall impact. For starters, we find out little about the nature of the lawsuit, which Blomkvist loses at the beginning of the film. Why is the crooked businessmen, Wennerstr√∂m, so evil? Vanger seems to think so, and promises to give Blomkvist the evidence once he completes his assignment. But Blomkvist tells Vanger at film's end that the 'evidence' is meaningless and we never find out what it's about. I realize that in a film such as this, which is already quite long, the scenarists don't really have a lot of time to explain all the, but still, the reason why the whole story is put in motion is principally due to the main character losing this lawsuit. And when Lisbeth hacks into Wennerstr√∂m's computers and steals all his millions, do we really care? And do we really care when he's murdered? In reality, Wennerstr√∂m is really a cypher of a character.<br/><br/>I also wonder why Vanger hires Blomkvist in the first place. Wouldn't he have done better to have hired a private investigator or someone involved closer to law enforcement? I realize Blomkvist is an investigative reporter but he's also the co-owner of a hip magazine--hardly the type of person to take on such an assignment. Yes, of course, he's just lost his life savings and he's desperate but the entire arrangements seems a bit odd. There's also the issue of Blomkvist's competency--he's just lost that lawsuit and even though Vanger likes the idea that he opposed Wennerstr√∂m (who's a long term rival), the fact that he made accusations without proof, wouldn't have impressed a real life Vanger, who would have probably gone for someone whose past, in contrast, was squeaky clean.<br/><br/>Even if one is willing to suspend one's disbelief regarding Blomkvist taking on Vanger's proposal, the whole idea that the brilliant Lisbeth would allow herself to fall into her evil guardian's clutches more than once, seems pretty incredible. Just like Blomkvist, who stupidly ""miscalculated"" about the lawsuit, Lisbeth admits to misjudging just how sick (as she puts it) Guardian Bjurman really is. And what about Lisbeth running out of money? Wasn't she paid a fair amount by Vanger to investigate Blomkvist before he hires him? You would have thought she would have had some money left over to the buy that new computer. And since she's so clever, why couldn't she just go out and get another freelance assignment to pay the bills, instead of relying on her pervert guardian? If she's smart enough to steal three billion dollars from a mega-rich businessmen, couldn't she have hacked into a lesser fry criminal early on, put a few bucks into her account, and avoided being dependent on Bjurman?<br/><br/>Regarding Lisbeth, there were a couple of other things that seemed a little 'too easy'--for example, Martin forgetting to lock the doors behind him when he went downstairs to torture Blomkvist. Lisbeth just walks right into the house (no alarm is triggered to warn hi-tech guru, Martin) and she then all too easily slips into Martin's torture chamber and saves Blomkvist from a horrible death. And wasn't it sort of a little too easy for Lisbeth, to hack into Wennerstr√∂m's accounts? But this is Hollywood, so anything can happen, no? <br/><br/>Finally, I was curious about Vanger's assumption that Harriet had been murdered. He states that Harriet couldn't have gotten off the island since none of the boats had been used and the police had prevented everyone from leaving. But the next day, the police relented...SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD...and that's exactly how Harriet escaped--in the trunk of her cousin Anita's car, who had helped her. Why didn't this scenario occur to Vanger? Had he followed through on such an assumption, of course there would have been no movie!<br/><br/>If you're not too picky about Tattoo's contrivances, you may find yourself enjoying this tale of suspense. For more critical and/or discerning viewers, you may end up with the conclusion that this is by no means a masterpiece."

The time frame, however is contemporary Sweden and has an interesting premise; it was committed on an island connected to the mainland by a bridge, but which was blocked at the time of the murder by a car crash - no one got off the island, no one got on.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is investigating at the behest of Christopher Plummer, the patriarch of the family, who wants the answer before it is too late as he is elderly. Rooney Mara is Craig's assistant, a semi-autistic social cripple with a Goth look. Plummer adds immeasurable stature to the film and Mara has obviously worked hard to create an off-beat character and succeeds too well. I thought her characterization was off-putting and couldn't work up much sympathy for her, and that she detracted from the story, which as mentioned was first-rate.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book or see the Swedish version of the film, but this picture was too long, with gratuitous scenes of the stars in coitus, and efforts to depict Mara's character as beset with troubles. Also, there is a back-story of a libel suit against Craig, which some people might find interesting (I didn't). I just felt it could have been cut down to a better, shorter version with additional editing, but that's just me. In movies I don't think that more is better. If they make movie versions of the other two books they should de-emphasize 'THE GIRL' stuff and just go with the mysteries, as this one was really very good."
"ajs-10","8","1","6","8 January 2012"," Just as good as the original.. but for different reasons...
","Having seen the 2009 Swedish version of this film I thought it might be interesting to see how Hollywood treated it. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The location and key elements of the story were kept the same, but obviously a bigger budget allowed for a more cinematic experience. I will give you my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>When journalist and Editor Mikael Blomkvist is sued by a businessman he had written a story about, he finds himself with no savings and a reputation in tatters. Fortunately, an industrialist, Henrik Vanger, wants him to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, over forty years ago. Before engaging him, Vanger had Blomkvist investigated by a security firm who had used the pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker Lisbeth Salander as the investigator. We follow Blomkvist's investigation along with events in Lisbeth's life (which are sometimes quite hard to watch). Eventually Blomkvist reaches a point where he needs an assistant and Lisbeth is recommended to him. This is where things start to get really interesting¬Ö and also the point I will stop my little summary. I don't want the Spoiler Police on my doorstep as 3AM (again).<br/><br/>Beautifully shot and very well produced; David Fincher has a well deserved reputation as a filmmaker and it shows. Great performances all round; Daniel Craig did a great job as Mikael Blomkvist, as did Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, she had a very tough act to follow in Noomi Rapace but I thought she acquitted herself well. Also worth of note were; Christopher Plummer as Henrik Vanger, Stellan Skarsg√•rd as Martin Vanger, Steven Berkoff as Frode, Robin Wright as Erika Berger and Yorick van Wageningen as Bjurman.<br/><br/>Having seen the original I cannot but fail to make comparisons and I must say this version is just as good. I say that because I found this one a lot easier to follow, the storyline has been streamlined somewhat. Also, the production is far more elaborate; it obviously had a much bigger budget. As far as performances go though I think the original has the edge; to me Noomi Rapace played the part of Lisbeth Salander so well that anyone else playing that part was going to struggle to top it. Don't get me wrong, Rooney Mara did a fine job and if I hadn't seen Noomi Rapace in the role I may well have been singing her praises. I have given this version the same score as the original and I'm very happy to give it my seal of approval: Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 8.2/10 (based on 20,621 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 86/100 (based on 190 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

"nancysinger1011","9","1","6","7 January 2012"," Remember- it's a three-part series, people!
","Each time I read another review that began with, ""I have not read the books..."" I despair. This is the signal for another review that does not understand the most critical point of all. You cannot ignore the fact that this story sets up a series; therefore a lot of exposition occurs that does not pay off until the later books. That's just how it is.<br/><br/>This movie is a film adaptation of the first part of a three-part series. Part 2 picks up immediately where Part 1 leaves off, and so on. It's one long story that just happens to be presented in 3 individual books (actually, the full scope was purported to be 10 books; interrupted, tragically, by the sudden death by heart attack of author Stieg Larsson). <br/><br/>You may think a scene or character or other part is ""contrived"" or whatever, but MANY aspects of ""Dragon Tattoo"" exist only to connect to or set up things that are explained in the later books. It cannot- and should not- be expected to exist solely as a stand-alone movie. The characters live on, and a whole lot more happens to them as the books progress. <br/><br/>""The rape scene is too violent!"" everyone's screeching. Yes, it's violent. THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT. The entire series predicates on the violence and injustice perpetrated on Lisbeth, from her childhood forward. The Swedish title of the book is ""Men Who Hate Women"" and the books are strongly colored by that throughout. Before writing these books, Larsson witnessed a brutal gang rape, and did not step in to prevent it. That event changed his life- it drove him to tell a deeply complex story of a world and culture where men are free to abuse women in a myriad of ways to further their own ends. Lisbeth's character is the focal point of that message. She endures- survives- such an unspeakable spectrum of abuse it's heartbreaking. But there are also good people, those who try to do something about it. And ultimately the message is one of hope, because despite all her ""disadvantages"" Lisbeth manages to triumph despite her past. Her past drives her to help solve a series of horribly violent murders because she, more than anyone, knows what men are capable of when they choose to hate- and hurt- women. <br/><br/>I have read all 3 books and seen all 3 Swedish versions. I prefer Fincher's ""Dragon Tattoo"" as it much more effectively represents what I imagined when I read the book. That's my personal barometer. Compared to the book, some things were left out and some things were changed. It was a very long book and I know better than to expect an exact representation. The same thing happened in the Swedish version. But the changes were not the same. I think the new version made better choices in terms of the things they chose to leave out/modify, and the end product was improved.<br/><br/>What I missed most in both movies is the inner narrative. Being inside the characters' minds, and hearing their inner voices, reasons etc., is such a key part of the books. This delivers so much insight and depth and is not able to be communicated in the movies. So you rely on the actors to deliver that ""inner voice"" via their performances. I though Mara succeeded much more than Craig in achieving this. To me, overall his Mikael did not deliver much beyond the surface. As Lisbeth, I felt Mara much more effectively embodies Larsson's character as the books portray her. Rapace, in the original, was too tough. Mara is almost a perfect match for how I envisioned Lisbeth when I read the books. So if the defining criteria for ""which movie is best"" = which actress was a better Lisbeth, then Fincher's wins as far as I am concerned. If you've read the book, I think you will like this movie. If you have not, I recommend you read it. Not just to make the movie better-but because it's a great book. Then read the next two."
"zuperkrypto","8","1","6","7 January 2012"," Great movie!
","I'll start by saying that I've never read the book that this movie is adapted from. I did however, see the 2009 movie prior to watching this one. That was a mistake. I really enjoyed the 2009 version and I couldn't help but to think about it as I was watching this new one. See, the problem is that up until the one hour mark, this movie is too identical to the 2009 version. Almost scene for scene. After the one hour mark it changes and it delivers a different interpretation of the rest of the story. As far as the actors go Daniel Craig is top notch while Rooney Mara, unfortunately, is not as good as the previous actress that played the part. The chemistry between Craig and Mara is fantastic but the story is definitely not as detailed and well paced as the 2009 version. As I mentioned before, I never read the books so I am not sure which of these films would be more faithful to the source material so I am basing my comments only on the movies themselves. As a stand alone movie The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a great film. If I had to chose between buying the blu ray for this one of the 2009 version I would drop my cash on the one that came out a few years ago."
"clockonthewall8","6","1","6","5 January 2012"," The movie forces me to need to read the book to iron-out what is going on.
","I did not read the book. I don't necessarily want to read the book, but the movie is very slick to look at which, I like very much. I prefer not to have to go back and research any book that a movie is based-on in order to follow the details I think are missing in the movie. That said, the original Swedish version of this story is much easier to follow than in this American version. The intensity is lacking in the American version and I was not as captivated by Rooney Mara as Noomi Rapace, who is far more compelling on screen than Rooney Mara in this role. Craig was miscast here, and I like him as an actor dashing across a roof like a scalded cat, but not here portraying an editor. Plummer is perfect, as usual. Without resorting to comparing the book to the movie, which is inappropriate I think, this American movie version is simply bland by comparison. I was spellbound and hypnotized by the Swedish version, but unfortunately, just mildly drawn to the plot and characters which in my opinion were far too restrained in the drama they brought to the performance, no doubt designed for overly sensitive American viewers. It would help also if the dialog were easier to hear. What's up with all the whispering? I'll just have to rent the video and play it with subtitles on to discover what is being said. Don't get me wrong - the movie is very watchable as a kind of long music video. I intend to watch this movie several times to see if my negative impressions last over the long run. As movies go, without comparing them to the books they are based on which is unfair, I say see this movie and then see the Swedish versions and decide for yourself."
"MRavenwood","8","1","6","1 January 2012"," Swedish Version is Darker and More Violent... but
","Swedish Version is Darker and More Violent... but don't kid yourself, the American film *clearly* required a serious edit to pull it under an X rating for violence alone. I'm not put off by the way the filmmakers have presented this material; it is tasteful and not gratuitous. Sensitive persons will be bothered by the violence and implied violence against humans and animals, however. The Swedish version has better costuming for Lisbeth, but it's easier to work with the romantic notion of Daniel Craig's Blomkvist. Most importantly, the American ending leaves in a scene that clearly demonstrates Lisbeth's emotional state. This becomes important for the subsequent stories. For the above two reasons alone, I would advise viewers to see the American version if they are only going to bother with one. On style, I prefer the grit and darkness of the Swedish version. It's more noirish. Absolutely not suitable for kids."
"harj-41-607090","7","1","6","1 January 2012"," A thoroughly entertaining film with a few flaws
","I often feel that there can be a tendency or at least a temptation on the part film makers who attempt to film a blockbuster novel to try too hard to live up to the expectations of the audiences. How much easier must it seem to film a relatively unknown novel (such as ""Silence of the lambs"") and be able to expedite your creative flare knowing that there may not be unfair expectations playing In the minds of the audience. In the case of this film, we are not terribly disappointed however the film could perhaps have been trimmed by twenty minutes or so. Furthermore, ¬†call me old fashioned but I don't see why it is necessary to include sex scenes in the detail that the makers of this film have. The chemistry between the characters feels much stronger and is often more exciting when their relationship is handled more subtly and where more is left to the mind of the viewer. For this reason and a few others, I don't think that this film will become a classic adaption of a blockbuster novel, but will remain a 'must watch' film which will always carry with it some excitement."
"CinemaPat","Null","1","6","20 December 2011"," Short review based on first impression.
","Let me preface this by saying that I haven't yet read the books or seen the original Swedish films. I will have a full review of this version as it compares to the original films soon.<br/><br/>David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network) put together a tight and suspenseful film. I thought the acting was great, specifically from Rooney Mara who plays ""the girl"". She is phenomenal and one of the sexiest characters I've seen on screen this year. Daniel Craig was good, but didn't blow me away. He was still James Bond, but now with reading glasses. The pacing and script were wonderful, but I thought Fincher foreshadowed the ending and also felt that they should have re-arranged the conclusions a bit. There were a few story lines that came to a close at different times.....so when one ended you still had a couple more to get through. Unfortunately the first story line that comes to a close is the most intense one so the remaining time is kind of ""meh"" to the viewer since they invested so much emotion in the first storyline. Hope that makes sense. It was a great movie, but if you've seen the originals you may want to wait until this one goes to DVD/br. Full review to come."
"brando647","9","1","7","1 July 2012"," Fincher is Perfect for this Adaptation
","Being a major fan of David Fincher, I was determined to see this film from the first time I saw the trailer. I had no knowledge of the novel it was based on and I was only vaguely aware that there had been a Swedish version of the same story released a few years prior. All I knew was that Fincher hadn't let me down (I don't quite count ALIEN 3), and the trailer blew me away: moody and high contrast, lightning-fast pacing set against the tune of Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"", and the film was marketed as the ""feel bad movie of Christmas"". I was sold. Based on the international bestseller from Swedish author Stieg Larsson, the movie opens with journalist Mikael Blomkvist disgraced in court when he's found guilty of libel against business mogul Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m. With his journalism career in jeopardy and his magazine on the verge of collapse, Blomkvist is approached by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve a forty-year-old mystery. Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared from their home an island in Hedestad during a family gathering when she was sixteen-years-old. Vanger's family consists of former Nazis, bullies, and businessmen, and it is Vanger's belief that one of them killed Harriet. Unfortunately, the case has been cold for many years and Blomkvist struggles to find a new angle. He enlists the aid of Lisbeth Salander, a social outcast with a torturous past and elite tech skills. Together, Blomkvist and Lisbeth find themselves hunting a serial murderer from nearly half a century ago.<br/><br/>I loved this movie when I first saw it in theaters in 2011 and I probably should have commented on it then, as I have since overdosed on the Millennium trilogy. I have seen all three of the original Swedish versions of the films and read all three novels, so at least I feel I've been exposed to each version enough to form reasonable opinions. And my opinion is this: Fincher's film is the best version of the novel. Not that the original wasn't really good, I just feel Fincher has a better talent for visual storytelling. Whereas the Swedish version was shot very clean and felt as if it was shot as a cable movie, Fincher's is all about the style. The Swedish winter is harsh and bleak, and the colors are toned down so the whole movie has an excellent contrast that fits the dark tones of the story. Because THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is an incredibly dark tale, regardless of which version you see/read. Violence, rape, incest, betrayal, murder, and torture¬ÖFincher wasn't kidding when he advertised it as a ""feel bad movie"". His movie doesn't feel like a television drama; his feels like a living nightmare at times. Fincher has proved he's a master of visual tone (see SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB, etc) and this movie was perfect for him. I do agree though that it might have been a little presumptuous for Fincher and Columbia/MGM to remake a movie a mere two years after it was released merely because it was a foreign film and, you know, Americans don't want to read their movies.<br/><br/>Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian did just as well with the source material, keeping incredibly close to the novel and cutting only portions of the story that wouldn't be missed. I wish they had included the stronger religious undertones to the original murders because I feel Fincher could have done it well, but I understand why a lot of elements were cut. The movie already clocks in around two and a half hours, and it can feel it's length at times (especially towards the middle of the film), but it never grinds to a halt. The end of the movie goes on a bit long but there are a lot of loose ends to tie up in the story. Fincher has also done an excellent job on recasting the movie, with both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara pitch- perfect in their roles as Blomkvist and Salander. Major respect to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace, because they did great work on the original, but I thought Craig and Mara were perfect here. With a supporting cast including Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsg√•rd, and Joely Richardson, there is a lot of great talent at work here. This movie isn't for the faint- hearted but any Fincher fan knows what to expect from this movie, and he delivers. I'm sure even most Millennium purists will agree, regardless of which version they enjoyed better, Fincher's movie is a great adaptation."
"terrellrobinson71","9","1","7","23 June 2012"," The Pierced, Tattooed and Bisexual Woman in Black
","I have always been a nerd for mysteries, especially something like the Millennium Trilogy. I read all the books written by the late Swedish journalist Steig Larsson and I have seen all three of the original films starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist as Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist. I was obsessed with them and I got my head into these suspenseful mysteries filled with sex, scandals, betrayals, deceit, revenge, rape and those MacGuffins where you know what's going to happen next, but you have no idea what it'll turn out to be like. That's why I was a bit obsessed and excited of seeing David Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". My surprise is just the same as the original and the book: a rather intense, sexy, dark and twisted mystery-thriller that packs on the chills and thrills. The plot is simple: Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) was a journalist who knew right from wrong, having been accused of libel against a formidable businessman. Until he's been hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy man in his 80's who wants him to look for his missing granddaughter, Harriet, who disappeared years ago. That's when, of course, we get drawn to this story when the bisexual, pierced and tattooed computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) join Mikael on this ride. But while they are researching the truth and trying the piece the clues together, they realize that the Vangers have some disturbing secrets that should be kept in the closet. There is much to love and like about this adaptation of the first book of the Millennium trilogy. First, Fincher and his cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth makes the film more complex than the book and the original. Plus, it's more of a direct adaptation that remains faithful to the book with a few additional changes, thanks to Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian. Now I couldn't possibly imagine Daniel Craig, also known as James Bond, to play a figment of Steig Larsson's imagination, but he plays it cool, smart and quiet as a journalist who hits hard, but only does it on his magazine. Plus, I love the moments when he has his glasses draped below his face. Noomi Rapace was excellent at playing Lisbeth, now we have Rooney Mara (who you remember as the ex-girlfriend of Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network"", another Fincher masterpiece) who excels as Lisbeth and she makes the character her own and that's what great about it. The supporting cast is superb, including Stellan Skarsgard as Martin, one of Henrik's grandsons, who has some dark secrets too. Robin Wright is slight, but terrific as Mikael's lover/editor Erika Berger. Yorick van Wageningen plays, what I think is, the most disturbing and creepy version of Lisbeth's guardian Nils Bjurman you'll ever see. And Joely Richardson as Anita Vanger who plays an important part of the story. (Just wait, you'll know.) It's a complex story that obviously gets under your skin and will never let you go until the final shot. Reading the book and following it along with the film, there's a lot more skin than the original and there are some disturbing moments that even I remember from the book that translates well into the film, like Lisbeth's rape and her revenge that comes after that. I think David Fincher is a great director who knows how to make his scenes clear and perfect. He even uses enough details to make sure that this is not the same ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" that you remember 2 years ago. While the movie quickly shifts between journalism, disturbing violence, family drama, sex and sadism almost too quickly, the film is more intriguing and more intense than what you have expected to witness. See this movie. You will be entertained, shocked, surprised and mesmerized. It's worth a try."
"rebecca-ry","7","1","7","18 April 2012"," A Very Well Adapted Film
","'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is a very well adapted film from Stieg Larsson's first book in the trilogy. Having read the book and viewed the Swedish original film released in only in 2009, I did not have great expectations. <br/><br/>David Fincher has worked very hard on this picture, the direction is very well done. The script works a lot better than the original film, it takes the time to explain a bit of the back stories of Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist which helped people understand aspects of both the characters and the plot. <br/><br/>The plot itself was explained in a style which stayed very true to the novel, but also managed to explain everything so people would not get confused by certain aspects of the story. <br/><br/>The acting is excellent, Rooney Mara performs very well and is almost as good as Noomi Rapace. Daniel Craig was perfect for the character he played and has shown he can play more diverse roles. Stellan Skarsgard's character is very interesting and his acting is very well done.<br/><br/>Fincher had Trent Reznor (who also did the soundtrack for 'The Social Network') and Atticus Ross do the soundtrack for this film which had a great impact in some parts of the picture.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is very good. It's not the best film Fincher has ever made but it does stay true to the original book and has adapted very well. For people who have not read the book I would thoroughly recommend you do so and then watch this film. If you do not like extreme violence and adult themes then this film is not for you, as shown by the film's 18 rating."

I really loved the original (I haven't read any of the books though) but I was worried about how this one would be but was very excited to see it. I though the casting was perfect but the original Lisbeth was so tremendous that I couldn't see how this could be as good. One of the first things I noticed was how similar Mara looked to the original actress. As the movie went on I started seeing more and more similarities to the original. I realize that this is based off a book so they will be similar but this to me felt like almost a shot for shot remake. It's been a while since I saw the original but it felt like almost the exact same thing.

"Marcelo_Dos_Santos","6","1","7","5 March 2012"," Nice work from David Fincher
","Not having seen the original Swedish version and not knowing anything about the author, the novels or the previous films and sequels, I approached this movie just as it is: a new work from that genius called David Fincher.<br/><br/>After a long, complex, Hans-Ruedi-Giger-esque, not-contents-related main credits sequence ‚Äîunless you can see something at a deep symbolic level‚Äî (and, fair is to say, so eye-catching that you find yourself having a big trouble trying to read the credits texts itself) but nice anyway, Fincher loses (for the first and only time in the movie) sight of his objectives and the narrative he's trying to tell. Yes, very scarce in Fincher's work, he drops the ball and spends at least 10 minutes trying to introduce the characters to the viewer. And he completely fails.<br/><br/>After this ‚Äîthe critical period when some percentage of the audience very well could think ""This doesn't make any sense"" and replace the DVD for ""The Birds"" or something), he finds the path again, more precisely when the viewer discovers what the mcguffin is and what the characters and supposed and expected to do to find it out.<br/><br/>The movie goes on as a very effective thriller, with all the classic ingredients to maintain you nailed to the seat, and a handful of superb actors that deliver just as needed, and better.<br/><br/>The dark, oppressive, claustrophobic visual treatment gives the atmosphere, and the obvious Fincher's directing skills conduct the narration in an impressive, brilliant manner.<br/><br/>That's true, this is not a Fincher masterpiece, but, as a standalone picture (and not trying to compare it with its Swedish precedents), this movie works, and functions very well indeed. The disembodied, fleshless violence (at times for no reason at all) represents the jungle in the middle of Scandinavia, and the characters' struggle to find a dark, elusive truth conducts the action until the interesting ‚Äîyet somewhat foreseeable‚Äî climax.<br/><br/>All said, if you forgive those clumsy first minutes noted above and wait for the plot to develop, this film could become a very enjoyable experience, particularly for Fincher's visual style fans.<br/><br/>Worth seeing? Yes."

I really, really wanted to love this movie and waited with great anticipation for its opening for months. Alas, I left disappointed. And judging from the other movie-goers reaction, I wasn't alone.

","This was the best film of last year. No exceptions. There were a few small problems, but they are outweighed by the massiveness of the brilliant stuff.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>The changes to the end from the book (namely how it works out with Harriet) feel almost as though they were trying to save a trip to Australia, and not trying to make the story better for the screen.<br/><br/>The Fantastic:<br/><br/>Firstly, the best thing is that was all that was wrong with it. How often do you see a book adaptation where a massive fan of the book has one issue? Second, Rooney Mara is brilliant as Lisbeth, even better than the annoyingly Hype Noomi Rapace, who did do an excellent job in the role, but has been out done by her English language counterpart. Third, Fincher's cinematography. Cinematography is the equivalent of readability for a film. Fincher managed to make his film as eye searing and addictive to watch as the book was to read. Fourth, no lame skimping on the nasty bits. All of the nasty bits in this film were not at all scaled down from the book (and definitely scaled up from the Swedish version). People walked out the theatre in droves. Fifth, the opening titles are brilliant and totally unexpected, but still show images and concepts from the book in a brilliant ingenious was that really ties this film to it's two inevitable sequels. Sixth, the soundtrack and editing. Awesome from Zeppelin to the eighties song with the name I cannot remember. The fantastic images and the brilliant soundtrack blended to completely mess you up."
"UnknownRealmsDotNet","8","1","10","22 July 2012"," Fincher at the top of his game
","Fincher is back to doing what he does best -- gritty, dark mysteries. With a scene that feels directly lifted from the diabolical 'sin' of Seven, this is not a film for everyone. It is, however, intricately crafted, brilliantly filmed, wonderfully scored and well acted. Even the opening credit sequence is a blast. Reznor also brings another great score (although this time doesn't create a hauntingly memorable theme like in Social Network). It is the story, however, that is the weakest point. While the mystery is interesting, it could have been trimmed a great deal. About by an hour. For that is about how long it takes to get to the real story, for things to get going. While it would mean to edit out Fincher's signature scenes (the one I mentioned before), I believe it would have made the film better. I believe the whole side plot about Lisebeth and her care worker don't really push along the story. It doesn't really provide the motivation for why she would become interested in this case (which is what I think they were going for). The ending too was a very odd note. It wasn't connected to what the story was about (the story wasn't about Makel and Lisabeth's love) and leaves an unsettling and unsatisfied feeling. But those nitpicks aside, this is Fincher at his best, and it is a great film."

","Fabulous performance by Rooney Mara. I was awestruck after watching the film. According to me this film depends heavily on performances and a sensational story. In acting she has stolen the show. What might look an ordinary story in the book is presented as a sensational film. David Fincher is a mind blowing director. Looking forward for the second part.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>The movie is very fast paced. Things are going to happen all the time that are going to keep you on the edge all the time. Character of Rooney Mara is charming and a nice role model for females. She is one of those characters on whom you can rely all the time for your optimism. What matters most in a film is a magical story and when combined with fine performances alongside crisp direction, blockbusters are delivered.

"KangarooBeStoned","Null","1","13","27 December 2011"," A Year's End: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo
","When it comes to multiple adaptations of the same source, people will inevitably compare them to one another; they feel that they must in order to validate their opinions on which is ultimately superior. It happened with Martin Scorsese's The Departed and the Coen Bros. True Grit. This nonobjective way of thinking has hit David Fincher with his new film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. This is important to bring up because you will not witness such trivialities in this review. You will instead read a critique of this movie on its own merits. Viewpoints will not be bogged down by preconceived notions that ""remakes"" are inherently inferior to the original product. The desire for comparisons is wholly absent.<br/><br/>David Fincher's ninth feature film sees him directing a second adaptation of the literary phenomenon, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, scribed by author Stieg Larsson. What started with his films Se7en and Zodiac is continued with another take on the procedural genre. Dragon Tattoo, however, fits more closely with the latter as it too features an investigative journalist driven by personal and emotional desires to solve a 40-year old cold case. Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), having lost credibility due to being convicted of libel, is called upon by an older gentleman (Christopher Plummer) plagued by a relative's untimely death. The request is simple: Blomkvist is to discover the murderer and reap the reward that will be bestowed upon him. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), the identity of the woman the film's title refers to, goes about her daily routines to survive and is eventually thrust into the chaotic investigative world Blomkvist operates best in.<br/><br/>Dragon Tattoo is perhaps Fincher's most brutal film, in terms of the violence and the subject matter. His work is usually riddled with cynicism and how the world revolves around the meaning of that term. That is still the case here, but it's taken to another level. As the original Swedish title of the novel suggests, there are men who really do hate women. This point is hammered into the audience very bluntly; there is no room for subtlety.<br/><br/>Lisbeth Salander, portrayed exceptionally well by the once-lackluster Rooney Mara, is contrasted with the life of Blomkvist. While he attempts to rebuild his life and reputation, hers continues to decline as she suffers a personal tragedy with a relative that leads to a spiral of emotional and physical destruction. This contrast between Blomkvist and Salander is where the film shines the brightest. The investigation, while highly entertaining and intriguing, is second to the character work. We feel the pain both protagonists endure as they go about their routines before they eventually come together as one to solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger's unfortunate demise.<br/><br/>The methodical nature of the film is on point. This is shown through the investigative techniques employed by our heroes. What's marvelous about the investigation is that we, as the audience, aren't the only ones scrambling to keep up with the plethora of names that play a role in the mystery. Blomkvist himself is taken aback by what he has to keep up with. Even the camera-work is used as an indicator of the laborious process in the investigation: the slow, fluid movement of a drive up to a mansion; the panning to a character reading copious amounts of paperwork; even close-ups on computers when new information is discovered. That's what makes Fincher's work in this genre brilliant: he utilizes everything to make the journey every bit as exhausting for his audience as he does for the characters.<br/><br/>Dragon Tattoo isn't perfect, by any means. It's not even Fincher's best work. The problems that exist lie in the narrative after the climax. While it's still engaging, it seems to fall flat and doesn't resonate with what came before it. The audience is exhausted by the trials Salander and Blomkvist endure, and the abrupt ending, after a short cool down, is just as jarring as the abrupt introduction prior to the title sequence. The ending leaves something to be desired, namely that another installment should be on its way. That may happen over the coming years, but the abrupt ending coupled with wanting more is not a good thing.<br/><br/>As noted above, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not David Fincher's best work; that honor still belongs to Zodiac due to its impeccable narrative, suspense, and downright brilliant filmmaking by all parties involved. Dragon Tattoo is another worthy entry in the procedural genre that will be difficult to top by anyone else working within it. It and Zodiac will make for a wondrous double feature."

","It's David Fincher. So, the movie is dark, bleak (visually and tone). But it really works in every way here, because of the story. Mikael (Daniel Craig), an investigative reporter denounced for.. basically ""fake news"", is hired by a the head of one of the biggest companies of Sweden to investigate an old unresolved crime, which could involve people from within the big family that owns it. The other plot is about Salander (Rooney Mara), a private investigator with psychological problems. Eventually, both would join forces to figure it all out.<br/><br/>The acting is really good and convincing (if you don't care that they speak in english. It's a problem...). Rooney Mara makes believable a, sometimes, over the top character. The movie fells like a more realistic and emotional ""Seven"". The editing is superb, without a boring second, even when we have tons of exposition (to make us understand the places, characters and facts of the story). The score is great and the production superb.<br/><br/>In some ways, this is like ""Zodiac"", but without the ""based on real life"" restrictions, the exploration of the characters, victims and victimizers and all in between, felt complete and better. Maybe it's just me, but I think it explores the power dynamics in society that we accept which allows people to suffer alone and lets others to impart suffering ""in front of our eyes"". Anyways, between the great story and the great Fincher, we got a little masterpiece."

","This is an outstanding mystery which is even better in the print version, but still a very credible job for a movie.<br/><br/>It has an outstanding and extremely complicated mystery which twists around considerably before all the secrets are revealed. The characters in the movie follow the trail brilliantly and with a few breaks in their favor.<br/><br/>First the warning. This movie contains an absolutely brutal rape. If such a thing can be not exploitative, this is an example of that. It takes place early in the movie and works to establish Lisbeth's character as well as the very dark nature of the movie and the subject matter in it. And that is not the only ugly perverted scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara appears (in this movie role) as one of the ugliest and most sexually unappealing women I have ever seen as a significant character in a movie while not being over the age of 30. That just adds to the character. (She still manages to be naked in several scenes from several angles. Again, somehow it is not exploitative.) Mara is superb as Lisbeth and Lisbeth is something of a superhero. I fell in love with her despite what I said about her appearance. (Of course I have read all of her subsequent adventures which may contribute to my hero worship.) Lisbeth is supremely intelligent, courageous, and unique. But most of all, she is principled. She has a set of rules that not everyone will agree with, but she is absolutely loyal to them.<br/><br/>Blomkvist is a hero and a jerk. He is brilliant and an idiot. Perhaps my biggest complaint with him is how his actions affect Lisbeth in the end, but I suppose that those actions are totally within his established character. In some ways it is the saddest moment of the story."

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","16 November 2018"," Fincher, Zallian, Mara, and Craig are invaluable.
","The release of the sequel to this movie that just came out is somewhat disappointing to me. I don't mean that the movie itself was disappointing, I didn't even see it. Just the fact that it was released far too late without the essential elements of what made this original great. Having never read the book, I wasn't able to follow the story as well as I would have liked to. My brother explained some things to me as we were watching it, which helped and I could tell that it was probably a difficult book to adapt.<br/><br/>When analyzing a movie, I nearly always focus nearly all of my attention on the story and the writing because that is what compels me in most cases. However this was a rare exception. The story was interesting enough in a plot sense, but I had a hard time getting invested in the mystery side of it. The ending similarly was not totally disappointing, but not entirely satisfying. But what kept me most interested while watching this was David Fincher's awesome style, and the compelling performances of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara. I would gladly have paid for another movie with those same people attached to it, especially if Steve Zallian wrote the screenplay again.<br/><br/>But sadly, that didn't come to pass. Without turning to far away from actually talking about Dragon Tattoo, I want to briefly say why I'm opposed to seeing The Girl in the Spider's Web. Mostly, it seems like the studio is scrambling to get money out of it and I want to say to them, ""sorry, but you had your chance to do that and you blew it"". I can't say for sure, but I think a direct sequel to Dragon Tattoo would have been more financially successful than the poorly reviewed sequel that just made $7 million in its opening weekend. That number would be exponentially bigger (yes exponentially) if someone had realized how much power Fincher's name has.<br/><br/>To be fair, this wasn't the best Fincher movie, but that is a high standard to live up to. However, it still showcased his ability to work with great actors and great writers to bring characters vibrantly to life. If you prefer the Se7en and Zodiac side of Fincher, you'll probably like this. However, it lacks the same social critique/nihilism of Gone Girl, Fight Club, and The Social Network. If you are not a Fincher fan, I would still recommend this as just an overall quality movie. As I've said, it's not the most compelling story, but this is filmmaking at its pinnacle which makes it worth a watch. Overall Rating: 7.8/10"

The beautiful compositions juxtapose the picture's underlying darkness, with the two-strand structure dancing delicately around its destructive characters and contemplative detective work, and there's a real sense of an ominous under-layer to even the most innocuous of moments, moments which are never far from ones of pure, unrelenting evil manifested in unexpected but eerily true-to-life ways.

They both covered the material well but it turns out the Hollywood version was more engaging (if you can call a film about rape entertaining -which had prevented me from viewing either version for a long time). Lizabeth, the tattoo girl character was even more bizarre in the American version. I liked Daniel Craig in this role better than his James Bond outings. Each version had its strengths.<br/><br/>The part about the flowers being received annually was so obviously from the missing girl was dubious as a mystery.

","I've nearly watched this several times, and when I actually did watch it last night, the intro really made me think I wasn't going to like it... Visually, the intro reminded me of (the awesome) Daredevil intro., but sadly only because of the slick graphics and 'flowing liquid'.. Musically it made me expect some kind of fast-paced dark, violent action thriller. It's like a frenetic, dark Bond intro. The film is more moody, and apart from a few scenes, generally much less frantic. <br/><br/>They got a good, 'meaty' story going with Lisbeth I thought, but then spoiled it by almost forgetting about it. There was a particularly awful scene involving her, which I thought they'd play out more, but she dealt with it in her own way, then there was only a brief return to it later on.. I don't see the point. It wasn't part of her history: it just happened.. and it didn't seem to affect her much: her relationship with Mikael could've been much more interesting if they'd weaved that into her character. As it was, I wish I hadn't seen it. There could have been more to Mikael's character too. I believe that it would have worked better if their relationship was platonic: he could have been the guardian that she never appeared to have had.<br/><br/>I dislike unnecessary violence, etc. in films. It often seems to be added in to please certain audiences, and I feel like that about some of the scenes in this. Overall, it was okay, but why do this remake? Apparently the Swedish version is pretty good. This version even had most of the actors doing Swedish accents.. except 'Bond' who didn't bother.. I got a little lost with all the similar names.

It's full of disturbing twisted people and the whole plot centers around a family that did horrible things in the past. These bad/disturbing things are rehashed when a journalist (Daniel Craig) is hired by the family patriarch (Christopher Plummer) to solve a murder of a 17 year old female relative that occurred 40 years ago. Daniel Craig enlists the help of a state ward (Rooney Mara) to assist him in researching exactly what happened to this teenage girl. The plot/trailer combined with the stellar reviews is what attracted me to this film, and I'm glad I was attracted to it. First of all, the performances by Mara, Craig, Penn, and Plummer are all incredible and on point. Mara's performance should be especially recognized, gosh did she ever deserve that academy award nomination. Her character is so raw and rough and complicated, and she plays it wonderfully throughout. I 100% recommend this movie to all mature audiences. Notice I say MATURE audiences, the rape scene is graphic and is sure to disturb, keep that in mind if you can't take that stuff, and there are several other graphic sexual scenes with extensive nudity.

","This film is an adaptation of a book by Stieg Larsson, telling the story of a research journalist investigating the disappearance of a young woman from an old and renowned Swedish family. Directed by David Fincher, the film is very good, and although I have never read the book to weave comparisons, it tells a story that quickly catches our eye. Visually, the film is extraordinary, with snowy Scandinavian landscapes, a very careful cinematography and a misty and enigmatic environment, which has a special strength, as if hiding something. The soundtrack, by Trent Reznor and Ross Atticus, is a plus to build this mystery environment, that is both seductive and menacing. The actors did an excellent job, in particular Daniel Craig (perhaps his best film work, except his performance as 007) and Rooney Mara. Both were at their best level and gave their characters great strength and depth. However, I still enjoyed watching the work of Stellan Skarsg√•rd and Christopher Plummer. The worst part of this luxurious cast is, however, the vain attempt to imitate a Scandinavian accent, which is always forced and very artificial. If this was the intention, it would have been more honest to hire actors of Scandinavian origin. I noticed that Craig did not make this mistake so much and I realized, reading a little, that the actor also disagreed with this choice. Too bad the cast did not follow his example. But this is a forgivable sin in a movie with so many qualities."

","David Fincher's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an American remake of the Swedish film of the same name, which has gained a considerable cult following over the course of three movies. While I have not yet seen the original, I can safely say that Fincher's adaption is an immensely thrilling and darkly seductive shock to the senses.<br/><br/>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is certainly not for everyone. While the same can be said for mostly all of Fincher's other films, Girl features a very dark and bleak story paired with a screenplay that never hesitates to show us the brutally twisted details. While what I am explaining does sound exhausting and nihilistic, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is so beautifully shot, meticulously detailed and excellently acted that it is hard not to feel strangely addicted to it's twisted subject matter.<br/><br/>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo features an incredibly talented cast including Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer and Robin Wright. While Plummer's and Wright's performances are quite impressive, the spotlight is focused on our two main characters played by Craig and Mara. Daniel Craig's performance is really just great because he does an excellent job of showing us that he isn't James Bond in this film. He appears vulnerable and increasingly paranoid as the film progresses, and Craig even took it upon himself to gain quite a bit of weight to even further accentuate his character's normality. While Craig does a great job convincing us of his weaknesses, Rooney Mara simply owns this film by doing the complete opposite. Rooney Mara's Lisbeth Salander is one of the most memorable and intriguing female characters of modern cinema and remains one of my favorite movie characters of all time.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara's portrayal of the young and eccentric reporter is absolutely spellbinding. Mara completely gave herself over to the role, getting real piercings, bleaching eyebrows and extreme hairstyles. She went through such an amazing transformation that I couldn't recognize her as an actress, further adding to the depth and realism of this character. The way she delivers every line and performs even the slightest actions is utterly mesmerizing. Her mannerism is just simply so cool, for lack of a better word. She does what she wants and will back you up completely if you're on her side, and while it can be a stretch to say she is a ""role model"", her independence and ability to stand up for herself is admirable.<br/><br/>Along with excellent characters, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo revolves around a darkly intriguing mystery. Sadly, the depth of this mystery is never quite realized. I expected this mystery to become a labyrinth of motives and clever clues, but the surface of possibilities is barely broken as the ""clues"" used to solve the case are shockingly simple and frankly not that interesting. I really wanted to get involved with the case and it's sickly subject matter, but I was having difficulty trying to care as our characters so easily peeled back layer after layer of this seemingly ""unsolvable"" mystery. Despite this, the location in which our story takes place is absolutely perfect. Reminiscent to something out of an old mystery novel, our story takes place on a secluded island who's only inhabitants are all related. As well as looking visually gorgeous with snow lightly blanketed over the rustic mansions, the environment is incredibly effective at creating tension. We are placed in a scenario where literally no one can be trusted and are forced onto an island with them. There is almost always a constant feeling of unease that only becomes greater as we are exposed to Craig's increasing paranoia. We feel just as trapped as he does and as certain events unfold in the story, we desperately want out.<br/><br/>One issue that I had with Girl is the final 20 minutes. By this point, our mystery is solved and Lisbeth is handling some personal business for the benefit of herself and Mikael. While I did enjoy this part and it's sub-plot as a whole, how disjointed this sequence felt did become a slight distraction. I respect that Fincher used this sub-plot to develop Lisbeth further as a character and while it did give us some insight on her capabilities as a complete badass, it ultimately felt kind of rushed and didn't fit in with the rest of the film. <br/><br/>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo could have been a perfect film had it realized and fully developed it's mystery plot and cleaned up the last 20 minutes a bit. Despite these issues, Girl is still an excellent film from masterful David Fincher. It's haunting beauty, unsettling tone, tightly written dialogue and disturbing subject matter paints a bleak, yet intriguing picture. All of Fincher's trademarks and the incredible talent of the cast comes together to form a completely addictive and darkly seductive product. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo showed me things that I may have not wanted to see but I still found it strangely hard to look away."

","The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen when you finish watching this movie you will feel violated. That is a positive that a movie can stay with you and leave that impression with you weeks even months after watching it. A lot of that is due to David Finchers direction he doesn't hold back in the violent and disturbing scenes and moments he leaves the viewer to just look and it shows how much he respects the viewer to take it. This movie looks stunning especially in the snowy landscapes that are just amazing to look at and allows you to take in the atmosphere that is being created. The performances in this movie are some of the best that Fincher has ever produced with Rooney Mara absolutely stealing the show she's amazing in this movie and gave one of the best performances I've ever seen and should have taken home the Oscar for her performance but her performance depends on her chemistry with Daniel Craig and they have fantastic chemistry with each other because you feel as if they are themselves when they're together. Daniel Criag and Christopher Plummer still pull their wait in the movie and are both fantastic in their respective roles. First and foremost this is an investigation movie so that investigation has to be compelling and it absolutely is like so many of Finchers previous films you absolutely get invested in the mystery and are desperate to find out who it is allowing the user to try and guess the murderer on their own. My biggest and really only issue with the movie is the ending. Not the ending to the mystery no that's a great reveal but I have always thought that Lisbeth suddenly falling in love with Michel because it just feels out of place with the rest of her character arc and leaves you some what unsatisfied. Other than that I absolutely adore this movie and I really wished than the other two in the trilogy would have been made by Fincher. 96%-A"

","The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011): Dir: David Fincher / Cast: Rooney Mara, Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright: American adaptation of the successful novel about that one pivotal character whom is more dangerous than at first thought, and in several ways. It stars Daniel Craig as a journalist for a struggling magazine. He is under an embarrassing lawsuit but is sought after by Henrik Vanger, who seeks answers with regards to the disappearance of his niece in 1966. He believes that someone within the family murdered her and makes a generous offer for answers. Unfortunately he suffers a heart attack and rendered to the hospital. Against family wishes Craig continues with the case and gradually places his own life in danger. Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander whose financial guardian suffers a stroke and her financial security is offered now at the price of rape. These scenes are not easy to watch, nor is her retaliation when she turns the tables, but she is located by Craig when he learns that she hacked into his computer to research for Vanger before he hired him. Great supporting work from Christopher Plummer as Vanger, and Stellan Skarksgard as his nephew Martin. Compelling, disturbing and total suspenseful, the film's one flaw might be within its multiple climaxes that seem a tad long. Otherwise David Fincher creates another winner with a visual title sequence that may remind viewers of his title sequence for Fight Club. Flawless acting from all involved, particularly Mara who proves that the neglected underdog can make a lasting impression. Score: 9 / 10"
"trapp_p","7","0","1","23 February 2016"," Put up with the subtitles
","A very disappointing attempt at this story, ideal for a movie. The problem lies in the casting of both the main characters. The books make it quite clear that Mikael is a middle-aged fairly unfit financial journalist - and as such Daniel Craig is completely miscast. He is far too worldly wise and 'dangerous' to fit the picture painted of Mikael in the books. Fine actor, does a great job of playing the part but too macho. 'Lisbeth' is described as being very petite, indeed she is often mistaken for a young boy, and as such Rooney Mara is also a poor fit for the character - particularly if you have seen the Swedish version in which Noomi Rapace is excellent in the part. Again I accept that Rooney played the part well but she looked wrong, she was too tall and didn't fit the image. You could argue that reading the books prior to seeing this film (and seeing all three Swedish films) was a mistake - and that your image of a character may be wrong - but in this case the late Stieg Larsson (who wrote the books) was very clear in his description of the main characters. I note that no attempt has been made to film the other two books - hopefully that will continue. The original Swedish films are excellent, marred by the subtitles of course, and I think that this is the way to enjoy this series of books. The English language version could have been so much better than it turned out."

","I liked Dragon Tattoo. It was well shot and exciting at times, but I can't get over the fact that the film feels so pointless. I mean, an adaption of the book was done only 2 years previously, and the two films aren't that different. If anything, the original is better acted and has far more closure. So what's the point in making a new version where you hardly change anything? Some scenes felt literally copied and pasted into the new films. Perhaps if I hadn't seen the original I would have enjoyed this more, but it's just that what I liked in this movie (and I liked a lot!) was already present in the original.<br/><br/>The acting was so-so. Craig seemed his usual disinterested self, and Rooney Mara gives a good enough performance but one that doesn't match up to her Swedish counterpart. I found myself struggling to keep up with all the members of the Vanger family unlike in the other version where you are given enough time to get to know everyone. <br/><br/>Best Scene: I wondered if, being an American film, this version would sanitize the rape scene. But know, it's almost as disturbing and difficult to watch as in the Swedish version."

","The sheer Adrenaline-driven pace of the movie let the audience spellbound along with the timely shocks amidst. David Fincher delivers another masterpiece with the magnificent performances of Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig. Although the movie slightly drifts from the novel in the end but still can be regarded as one of the best thrillers of our time. <br/><br/>The movie is driven upon the centralized character of Lisbeth Salander- a troubled but genius rebel, trying to fit herself in this world with a destiny surrounding myriad of troubles waiting for her. In the parallel an-about-to-lose-everything journalist given an impossible task and a chance to redeem himself- to find a girl's whereabouts missing for 40 years. The hunt combines the fate of both protagonists and led the unfolding of haunting mysteries beyond imagination. <br/><br/>What I really liked is the movie perfectly captures the psychology of Lisbeth's character. Though I'm more of a novel guy, I really admire Mara's portrayal on celluloid. She is a rebel, vengeful and vulnerable whereas Craig's character is more determined and rational. Although some of the sadistic and sexual depictions (along with a quite graphic rape scene) in the movie may offend a variety of audience but they somehow illustrate the animalistic and cruel nature of human's sheer hatred. Overall the movie lingers quite up to my expectation. Technically well-refined, well-acted and well directed with a good score. Not comparing with the Swedish Version, still Fincher justifies himself and leaves us with the potential of continuing the series."
"blakiepeterson","10","0","1","6 August 2015"," A Superb Whodunit
","Lisbeth Salander is the kind of character that would normally be cast aside as the female counterpart to our testosterone infused hero, appreciated but still under-appreciated all the same. But Salander doesn't live in the constraints of your average thriller: she exists in the kind of thriller that only rarely dives headfirst into theaters, the kind that snakes along the wet pavement with effective grit while The Prodigy plays in the background and cigarette smoke suffocates the misty air. She's not a sexy Angelina Jolie but a deceivingly sexy goth-punk, bleached eyebrows and all. Underweight and independent, we're immediately drawn to her: she's a heroine that doesn't look like a heroine but ends up saving the day and stealing the show.<br/><br/>In the Swedish adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" (unseen by me), Salander was portrayed by Noomi Rapace with, as Roger Ebert puts it in his review of the film, ""unwavering intensity"". In the American adaptation, released in 2011, she is played by Rooney Mara with ferocious authority, calm and cool in the most dangerous of situations, deadly when she needs to be. Mara disappears so completely into the role that it will be hard, I imagine, for most audiences to succumb to her powers in a different role without referring back to this one.<br/><br/>""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" would already be an excellent murder-mystery if it relied on story alone; its stunningly structured characters (and the cast playing them) work as additional shots of caffeine that give the plot enough staying power to keep our interest for the 158 minute running time (which zig zags along with the agility of a rabid cheetah). It's unconventional, moodier than your average Chris Nolan foray and more misanthropic than your misogynists, misandrists. But the cynicism is intoxicating, as if David Fincher reconfigured the glamorization of death in murder ballads and threw them onto the screen for us to inhale. Yet ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" doesn't tread into contrived darkness; it strolls along cloaked in convincing darkness, so hypnotizing because it knows the brutality life has to offer and doesn't just stand by like a victim. It wants to fight back, setting fire to the past and coming alive in the treacherous electricity of the present.<br/><br/>Though the film is entitled after its central heroine, the lead of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", in actuality, is Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), the newly disgraced co-editor of ""Millennium"" magazine. Having just lost a libel suit against tycoon Hans-Erik Wennerstr√∂m, he plans to take a much-needed vacation, gather his thoughts and figure out where his now-controversial life will be headed next. At least, that's where he thinks he's going: after hiring Salander (a gifted hacker) to conduct an extensive search on Blomkvist, business giant Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) invites him to his barren island home and proposes the unproposable; if Blomkvist investigates and eventually solves the 40-year-old murder of his grandniece, Harriet, he will exchange unreleased information about Wennerstr√∂m that could give Blomkvist's career a much needed needle to the chest. Complications arise, however, when Blomkvist and Salander join forces and dig deeper into the Vanger family's shocking past; there, they find long buried secrets better kept unearthed than out in the open.<br/><br/>The leads of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" are not of Tom Cruise clean-cutishness but of fragmented Max Rockatansky depressiveness, committed to bringing justice to the corrupted nooks and crannies of the world but hardly able to provide closure to their damaged psyches. That's what makes the film so tremendously sensational; while the story magnetizes with its abundance of second guesses, false leads, and red herrings, the leading characters are compelling enough to work as fragile individuals who could head a meaty character study without all the sin-infused iciness. Throughout the course of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", Salander is raped, Blomkvist shot, tortured, stalked; Salander tells horror stories of her past, while Blomkvist continuously puts his life on the line for his career. But consider that Larsson's original material doesn't allow them to become victims of their own tragedies (Salander gets satisfying revenge on her rapist more methodical than Beatrix Kiddo could have ever dreamed, while Blomkvist repeatedly regains composure after having his world shattered over and over again). They are survivors. Craig and Mara are outstanding.<br/><br/>More poised to get under your skin than most films, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is an unforgettable experience, from the eery crackling of Fincher's atmosphere to Mara's staggering transformation. A must."

Each new story was so engaging in fact that I forgot all about the other plots until they came up to the foreground again, surprising me and making me want to see more.

","Innocence is a state we presume until further conviction, and for good reason. This notion of initial innocence is troubling in convoluted situations and potentially blinds us, though.

From the elusive Lisbeth to the spiteful Vanger family, the character growth and background surrounding each and every individual is intriguing. Not only are the actors and actresses strong in their respective roles, but the overall environment and atmosphere produced by each particular setting emphasizes the mystery and eeriness involved in every step that may be your last.<br/><br/>The detective work and plot development was interesting (though not necessarily new), but the cast making their parts unique and truly special makes this film one to watch.

"stephenrtod","8","0","3","17 March 2013"," Life is seldom either/or. I much prefer both/and
","Years ago, I blundered into Stieg Larsson's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" I think I was guided there by one of the wonderful book gurus at our local Kazoo Book store.<br/><br/>I was stunned and fascinated by Larsson's ability to weave a thriller, a mystery, a complicated series of romantic relationships, each separate yet all connected to a maverick discredited journalist who is given a second chance to bring down a shyster, avaricious financial predator.<br/><br/>I read all three books in the trilogy, then listened to each them on CD audio book as I drove long distance and around town. Accomplished actors read Larsson's words with clever use of dialect, accent, interpretation and use of silence, pauses and emotion. I began to wonder just how influential the translator was in the production of Larsson's books; he passed away before the books' phenomenal success.<br/><br/>Looking at Larsson's literary prowess prior to the publication of this series, I felt as though I were looking at the life of Peter Jackson, who produced The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Both auteurs had enjoyed a strong modicum of success before their respective hits, but it would be like comparing The Beatles or the Eagles teenage fledgling attempts at composing and singing and instrumentation, with their grandiose later successes.<br/><br/>Enter Daniel Craig, and Rooney Mara, and Robin Wright, with a great writer and director propelling this reboot. Craig tries mightily to be a puppy dog kind of guy, the sort of men women are irresistibly drawn to. Women may be drawn to Craig, but not for those reasons. He is still very much in his James Bond mode with his body builder physique and 8% body fat,in this American rendition of the Swedish novel/movie. The Swedish movie grabbed me immediately because characters like Eric Berger played totally convincingly by Lena Endre, instantly become the character. No doubts. No qualms. The Swedish movie evinces the aura of believability, verisimilitude by feeling like a documentary of the original novel; however, the Swedish movie, unlike the American version, can be readily comprehended by an American audience, by any audience that has not read the book.<br/><br/>I like Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Harriet's grandfather; he's at the top of his form. But the actor portraying that same role in the Swedish version is dead spot on. It's in the eyes; the forty year pain of running a high-powered corporation coupled with 40 years of personal loss show up in the crumbling, but brave, demeanor of the Swedish actor. Plummer is a skilled thespian playing another role.<br/><br/>Robin Wright is a gorgeous woman, but she walks through this role, probably trying for a minimalist effect. I believe instantly that the dark intense fire in the eyes of Lena Ender every time she looks Michael Nyqvist in the eyes is real, smoldering, to die for.<br/><br/>Rooney Mara does an excellent job of portraying Lisbeth Salander, but Noomi Rapace's interpretation is not-of-this-earth. She put so much authentic preparation in that role that her subsequent acting roles have severely paled in contrast. She even seems out of place in the second Robert Downey, Jr. Sherlock Holmes sequel because she's still in her Salander role to some extent. I'm not sure she'll ever break out of it - unless she's prepared to inject the same gestalt effort into each every character the way she did with Lisbeth. Some child actors never do adapt to the metamorphosis to adult actor. Some can. Mickey Rooney managed it, but a pale shadow of ""Boys' Town"" with Spencer Tracy.<br/><br/>Nyqvist's portrayal of Bloomqvist is also spot on. More than a bit out of shape, he has the eyes, the demeanor, the tender vulnerability that women like Erica and Lisbeth and even the ultra-secret Swedish operative Monica, would-be Olympic gymnast, who works out two hours a day, finds absolutely entrancing, that effortless come-hither quality that Nyqvist projects. Craig's appeal is much more alpha-atop-the-macho-food-chain. Craig was excellent in ""Layer Cake,"" and for audiences who have not read the books and seen the Swedish movies, he will help make millions for this version; however, the American translation is so convoluted at several points, it occurred to me that had the plot, characters and the very ambiance of Larsson's trilogy not been coursing around inside of me, I'd have been lost, or, at best, very confused.<br/><br/>The American picture is doing well. I wonder how it will play in Sweden? I hope that screenwriter, Steven Zaillian, director, David Finscher, and the cast learn something fundamental, i.e. If it ain't broke, don/t fix it. <br/><br/>The Swedish adaptation of the second book in the trilogy,""The Girl Who Played with Fire,"" was merely acceptable compared to the first film. The third Swedish film, based on the last book in Larsson's trilogy was so very chopped to pieces and badly edited, I was crushed. That book is the very best mystery, thriller, murder-romance-suspense novel I have ever read. I was an English teacher for 43 years and have been attracted to stories like this since I was 12.<br/><br/>You can't make a silk purse out of sow's ear. No, it isn't that bad. My father who did not read much but was an avid movie fan and I often argued about movie-to-book adaptations. It was impossible to convince him that the movie lacked something, that a two hour rendition of a novel that was hundreds of pages of events and powerful nuances, could possibly be better. Movies are like outlines, or lie-detector tapes, of the books they purport to represent. Books fill in lavishly, profusely, what movies may merely indicate or suggest.<br/><br/>I could be totally mistaken. I am, after all, a human being, and I have my biases. But, if you're curious, just for fun, watch the Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" and see what you think. I'm glad that both versions exist."

","After seeing Hollywood massacre Tinker , Tailor, last night, my expectations were very low going into another remake. However, this was a much better effort. Taken in its own right, the Hollywood version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a pretty good thriller - until the last 25 minutes, which where clearly tacked on to pave the way for the next installment. Still, the story moved along with a nice brisk pace. Sometimes too brisk. The other obvious problem is the failure to make the tangled Vanger family tree clear. Most of the time, I had no idea how the various family members were related. It was very confusing.<br/><br/>As Hollywood remakes go, it was good try. But they just could help selling out. I guess they assume that the US public couldn't take someone as edgy and threatening to middle class values as the original Salander. Compared to original version, the movie suffers badly because Hollywood took a lot of the edges off Lisabeth Salander. They kept most of the surface features, but underneath she was a very different character than the Lisabeth from the original. In the original, she was clearly a hacker. In the Hollywood version, she portrayed more socially acceptably as a researcher, who, by the way, could get around computer security. This was minor compared to the character transformation. The only shot of her in the spiked hair is in the beginning of the Hollywood, in what you might call a half spike. You never see the full Lisabeth punk look. They completely gilded her menace, and most of all, her strength, independence and her ""I don't care"" attitude. The final scene was 100% contrary her nature in the original. It was a classic Hollywood sell out. They just couldn't handle the Lisabeth from the original.<br/><br/>Part of the problem was Rooney Mara, who seemed like a nice girl from the suburbs in a costume and not a like a feral survivor who would set her father on fire and extract violent revenge on whoever crossed her. Try as she could, she just wasn't believable when she says ""I'm crazy."" Her features are too regular. She looks too normal. In contrast, Noomi Repace has those angular features that make her look like she's ready to taser you any moment."

","I'm probably one of the few people staying who came to this movie knowing nothing about it at all. I never saw the exclusive films even though I noticed I should and, while I was aware that the tale was some way of key with roots in history, I had more of a ""Dan Brown"" type tale in my ideas and I wasn't sure if I would like it. The beginning features of the US version used me even more as I wasn't sure what these deeply figures were about or if they were a indication of the movie to come. Fortunately after the impact of the features the movie does settle down somewhat and more of a tale begins to be advised. The tale begins with a identical framework; Mikael's being one, Elisabeth being the other, then they fulfill. At least four minutes at the beginning seem to offer only as coming back tale for a sex-related attack, which indicates that surroundings can completely be known as gratuitous, and not from being visible, which it is. They could have easily reduced it and instead started with the next encounter between those figures, which advised you, everything you needed to know about Elisabeth and what formerly took position. Mikael's element of the story in the same way belonged in the returning story that should have been begun later. Then at the end, the movie goes on for another 20 minutes after the tale is over. The whole aspect of this seemed to be to set it up for the sequels, but it was so rushed. They could have designed a whole adhere to up based on those minutes alone. Shorter like that, it's quite not satisfying, especially to an audiences having out to keep. Contemporary feminism regarded by and publicized by normally chauvinistic modern naturalist consumer-culture seems to be the ideological form of this movie and thus most likely it's movie director.

Fincher's movie is more amazingly taken for sure. But was that value the remarkable resources and is that not the higher travesty that the organizations and the staff believe that we need spectacular noticeable perspective to adhere to a exclusive upsetting story?

","I've read all the books in 2011, while watching the Swedish movies on television, translated in French. I've enjoyed both of them a lot, even if I have to admit, like a lot of people, that the 2nd and 3rd movie were not as good as the first one. This David Fincher's movie might be seen if you know nothing of Stieg Larsson books and movie adaptations. If you do, it's better not watching it. I'm afraid to say this version is adding nothing to help us understanding Larsson's world. One of the saddest thing in Fincher's movie is the different accents used by the actors. While Rooney Mara is using a guttural and rough accent as Lisbeth Salander, Daniel Craig and Robin Wright are talking with no accent at all. It's just enough strange to bother any listener except for Americans. Besides that, it's well made and Mara is as good as Noomi Rapace was, except for the fact that seeing the US version after the Swedish movie is rather awkward: because there is nothing new and astonishing in the latter. I repeat: it's a must to see it if you haven't seen the previous ones. Otherwise, you won't lose your money, but maybe your time."
"wizzardSS","6","0","5","3 July 2012"," Sitting on the Fence
","Following the incredible success (both critically and commercially) of the 2009 Swedish trilogy of Stieg Larrson's novels, Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon to offer a version that is more accessible to those who hate subtitles.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed the Swedish version, I was very sceptical that Daniel Craig and co. could improve on the story. But, credit where credit is due; having read the books, the American version follows the story far more accurately than its Scandinavian counterpart.<br/><br/>Usually when adapting a novel, making it as close to the book storyline is a sure-fire way to win over those that are fiercely loyal to the author, but for some reason this adaptation is missing something. Daniel Craig is not too bad as Blomkvist, and contrary to what I thought before I watched it, he actually shakes the James Bond image easily.<br/><br/>A big problem though is Rooney Mara's Salander. Both her and Noomi Rapace (the Swedish Salander) correctly keep the female protagonist cold and secluded which is the big appeal to the unique character. But, the book makes a big deal of Salander ultimately having morals, no matter how far removed they are from normal. As a result, Rapace makes her Salander amiable whilst Mara just makes hers repulsive.<br/><br/>This difference in the Salander interpretation isn't the only thing that's different in the cultural representation. The American version attempts to retain the Swedish locations and, to an extent, the Swedish accent. Despite enjoying the inclusion of various Swedish actors it occasionally had me reaching again for the subtitles.<br/><br/>As a result, this film sits on the fence as to whether to stick or twist. Should it aim for the hardcore fans? I think there was a missed opportunity for reaching out to those who had never been acquainted with the series before. Perhaps setting the film in American might have worked, like it did for Get Carter. Perhaps not. Rather than just going for revenues, why not just take a chance? As I said, credit where credit is due. It's not appalling, and its not appealing. It's a film that right down the middle. Right on the fence."

"TheFamilyBerzurcher","Null","0","2","27 April 2012"," An Ambitious Adaptation Proves Too Much
","To begin a not-so-warm evaluation of our American interpretation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, it is important to congratulate Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsg√¢rd, and Daniel Craig on fine work. Mara is imagining a character that is ripe for praise and potentially less difficult to portray than immediately evident but she does so with precocious poise.<br/><br/>Elements of Fincher's visual style are commendable. His sense of space and focus lend a volatile but complex depth to every scene. Indeed, certain moments can only remind us of Nick Ray's unequaled perception of bodies and their relationship to the frame. Only Ray didn't blur out his backgrounds with such energetic whimsy. Nonetheless, Fincher frequently locates the viewer, both spatially and temporally, by giving an unusually profound gravity to properties and objects. Anything from a set of keys to a lipstick stain can be imbued with moral and informational subtext. There is a scene where a villain (unbeknownst to the audience at that point) pours out a bottle of wine. It's so mild, but it's a genius hint. Watch the scene. It's a marvelous addition. These images are fleeting though, and this director has yet to reach the point where visual keystones are given sustained energy. Fincher's relationship with technology is ripe with opportunity for a more nuanced interaction -- we can only hope that he grows into that connection. Moviegoers will be familiar with the color palette in Dragon Tattoo. Digital color grading has made for a host of gray-blue films. Here, shades of gray have become the status quo. The film does take place in the winter and in Sweden, but the absence of color becomes tiresome by the end of the first act. Fincher's team of editors and designers do give two scenarios vibrant yellows -- flashbacks and Lisbeth's ultimate swindle. While the shift in color does serve to locate the viewer like the objects do, it doesn't compensate for the general lack of energy within the frame. The yellows seem to pull from Harriet's hair and Lisbeth's wig, making a dubious evaluation of fantasy and history.<br/><br/>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo qualifies as a thriller/mystery, replicating the events of a wildly popular Swedish novel by Steig Larsson. It involves a middle aged journalist who is hired to solve a private murder case. He enlists the help of a troubled but gifted young woman. They develop a certain type of relationship. The location of the film within Sweden inspires a shrug. Why not move it to America and change the names? This would be much preferable to the strange international accents that populate the film. Does British English substitute for all European nationalities now? I love the Swedish language. It's haunting and broad. But the interjections of signs and specific words during Dragon Tattoo are nothing short of alarming.<br/><br/>The film lacks a healthy center of gravity. The dual protagonists deprive it of urgency, as there is no pivot for 80 minutes, a long time. Novels can accomplish this narrative with diligence and patience, but there isn't enough time for that here. The material is simply too ambitious for a film -- Swedish or American filmmakers. Something has been lost in literary adaptations of the post-studio blockbuster era. Filmmakers seem determined to include as much of the full scope of detail as possible. Literary adaptations were more thorough many decades ago. And this was done by being more concise -- having someone around who doesn't know anything about literature to say ""Cut it."" While the characterization is quick and successful, the mystery falls apart because of this lack of gravity. In Plummer's first appearance, he dictates the terms of the plot in precise detail. Fincher's talent is beyond spoonfeeding. It's no longer necessary. The frenetic energy of the book is lost in the forceful explanation of the material.<br/><br/>Dragon Tattoo also lacks the energetic montage sequences that highlight Fincher's best work (Se7en, The Social Network). His education in the distracted tempi of the music video applies itself only when the imagery is a careful collage, of which he is very capable. Dragon Tattoo plays more like a fractured series, functioning at breakneck speed. Indeed, some transitions of scene and critical information sets are lost in this unnecessary visual haste. Even in the credit sequence, we are greeted with rhythmic editing to an interpretation of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song,"" as arranged by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The song is a fine choice, working in textual and textural contexts. This team of composers have certainly established themselves as bold and stylish inventors. By now, it has come to seem like their hard, information-aesthetic is married to Fincher's deep grays. But their gnawing pulse could be precisely what a filmmaker like David Lynch or Paul Thomas Anderson could blossom into a revolutionary context.<br/><br/>It seems imprudent to comment on the thematic content of the film, as that would be better suited for literary review. But in a story with so much potential for speaking critically and deeply about the nature of sexual abuse, it is sickening to see triumph created out of a genuine rape, no matter how disturbing or deserving the victim may be. I'm speaking, of course, about the encounter between Lisbeth and her guardian where she get's more than the upper hand. It speaks volumes about our relationship with film when savage revenge inspires an enthusiastic response from an audience. In fact, Dragon Tattoo seems to miss a bold opportunity to comment on film and voyeurism in the numerous instances of photographed or recorded violence. Were the filmmakers more intentional about this, the project could have revealed much about the very real and very scary human fascination and preoccupation with observing sex and violence. In our lives, there's no mystery to that story. It's a fact. And we all pay money to see it every day -- on our TV's, computers, and at the movie theater.<br/><br/>68.600"

One example; I do not think that a Swedish girl in has a diary entry written in English, specially when you considered that the writer of the diary is a 14 or 16 years old girls. I know they have a good education in Sweden, but.... come on, it is more logical to have a teenage girl writing her diary in her own mother tongue.<br/><br/>Of course I suspect there is a bit of commercialism on the movie.

"doggydog2312","6","0","3","29 February 2012"," Well shot remake with a nice soundtrack. Yet...
","OK, I might not be the most unbiased reviewer here. I met with the series not by reading the book but by stumbling onto the Swedish original movie when it came out, liking it, but being disappointed by the sequels. Moreover, I've only gotten to reading (and finishing) the book the day before and the day when I watched the movie. So the memory might be too fresh not to cause interference with the movie itself. I wasn't too thrilled about the idea of a remake to begin with. The concept is just unnecessary. Catering to ""people"" who are too lazy to read subtitles. So yeah, the industry does seem to actually make an effort recently. At least with high-profile stuff like this one. The cast is impressive and it's directed by Fincher. Hey! Fincher! The soundtrack is by Ross and Reznor too! I'll put it bluntly. It was dumbed-down where it shouldn't have been, diluted and rehashed in places where it wasn't necessary. Some of the characters are more simplified and hey! Why not rehabilitate the Nazi bad guy and make him just misunderstood. And then repeat Larssons's biggest gaffe, the mislead (and here I'm restraining myself from expletives) mentioning of ""arms trade with the Usta¬öe"" from the 90s. For the misinformed, NO SUCH THING EXISTED IN THE WAR IN EX-YUGOSLAVIA. Except in Serbian propaganda of course. Larsson should've known better, being what he was (his usage of that term is therefore even more baffling), and, in the end, should one expect from filmmakers to review his writing? It IS, in the end, a pretty heavy insult. Yeah, it's well shot, yeah, they actually set it in Sweden, with some people actually getting the pronunciation names, surnames and places right, some neat touches like papers in Swedish, etc. The soundtrack rocks, effort has been made. And yet... it didn't win me over and I actually felt that the viewers are being patronized at times (""ooh magical hacking"" for example), not something I care for. My memory might be playing tricks but the most memorable scene of the Swedish movie - Lisbeth's revenge, seemed completely dumbed-down for me. And what the hell? Did they make that sadist show something that seemed like remorse before he was tasered? Why? Why was pretty much every bad guy in the movie made more, well, human? Product placement? Sure, the book itself had plenty of that actually, intentionally or not. Not the stuff that ended up in the movie like Coke and McDonalds but hey, what was to be expected? As I said, I'm hardly unbiased, but I did watch it hoping that my suspicions and fears would turn out to be unfounded. They weren't. However, I find myself unable to judge how someone who's not familiar with the series, both in book and movie form, Sweden and some of the references would like it."

It was fast-paced, gripping and played out well. Rooney Mara was very good in my opinion, and Oscar-worthy too; I found more than a handful of reviews that said she was 'boring' but that isn't the case, it takes a lot of boldness to shoot those more-than-usual explicit scenes and she did them with almost a Lisbeth-like quality.

","I have read the Steig Larssen book and also saw the 2009 Swedish film ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" That 2009 movie was already a very good film adaptation of the best-selling novel. That movie also featured an iconic performance by Swedish actress Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander, the titular character. I do not really know why this American version even had to be made, especially during these days of globalization. However, with big names such as director David Fincher and star Daniel Craig attached to this project, and now with its 5 Oscar nominations, I felt compelled to watch this version as well.<br/><br/>The story is already well-known. Journalist Mikhael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) was commissioned by industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery behind the 30-year disappearance of his beloved grand-daughter Harriet. Blomkvist sought the help of an unlikely investigator Lisbeth Salander, a strange-looking Goth girl with a shady past herself. Together Blomkvist and Salander unearth the dark and demented secret that had haunted the Vanger family all these years.<br/><br/>Granted, this American version had superior technical aspects, most probably because of its bigger production budget. It deserves the nominations it got for its breath-taking cinematography, tight film editing, and excellent sound work. Rooney Mara, whom I first saw in ""The Social Network,"" undergoes a total change of look to portray Salander here. It must have been tough for her to create a different Salander performance distinct from that of the already acclaimed Noomi Rapace performance just two years before. Mara's Salander was quieter, more aloof, but more sexually aggressive. I cannot say though that it surpassed or was more memorable than Rapace's Salander.<br/><br/>Therefore, if this will be the first film of ""Dragon Tattoo"" that you will watch, you are in for a very stylish and exciting ride by David Fincher. However, if you had already seen the Swedish original version, you will really wonder why this version had to be done at all. There was nothing really very wrong with the first film to deserve this immediate remake."

","¬®You will be investigating thieves, misers, bullies. The most detestable collection of people that you will ever meet - my family.¬® The American version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has finally arrived and it was as good as I expected it to be considering David Fincher was at the helm of the project. Fincher has made some excellent movies and this one will rank among my favorites along with Seven, Zodiac, The Social Network and Fight Club. I really wasn't a big fan of having this movie remade since I considered the Swedish version was great, but when I heard Fincher was going to direct it, I didn't doubt going to see it. I was hooked from the beginning although I expected this movie was probably not going to be as dark as the original. I was surprised this Hollywood production actually went to those dark places the original one did and that the Lisbeth Salander character was played so well by Rooney Mara. The best thing about the Swedish version was Noomi Rapace's performance as the girl with the dragon tattoo, but in this film Rooney Mara really performs at the same level and reaches that same intensity bringing to life once again one of the most memorable female roles I've seen. The movie is not easy to watch, it has some dark and raw scenes, but the story is so well written and Fincher's direction is just brilliant that it makes the film worth seeing all over again despite haven seen the original films or read the Millennium novels by Larsson. Despite knowing what was going to happen I really enjoyed the performances, the scenery, and the sound editing of this film. It might not be better than the Swedish film, but it does live up to it and perhaps now a broader American audience will actually become familiar with this bestselling novel. I still recommend the three original Swedish versions as well.<br/><br/>Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist who works for Millennium magazine in Sweden and has recently been sued by a business tycoon named Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg) for libel against him. The truth is that Blomkvist has been framed and the proof he had against Wennerstrom was false so he loses a lot of money in the lawsuit. It's during this time that he receives a job proposition from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a former CEO of the Vanger group, who lives in an isolated island along with the rest of the members of the wealthy family. Henrik has hired Mikael because he wants him to investigate what happened to his disappeared niece, Harriet, who he believes has been murdered by someone in his family forty years ago, although police officers haven't been able to find any clues over the years. The reason Henrik hasn't given up looking for the killer is that every year on his birthday he receives a portrait with a flower as a gift from different parts of the world that he presumes is from the killer. He says that the killer has to be someone from the family because there was an accident on the bridge the day Harriet disappeared and no one could get in or out of the island on that day so it couldn't be an outsider. Henrik's brothers were all Nazi sympathizers during the War and he suspects any of them could be the killer. Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is a computer hacker who is pretty good at what she does, but is a very troublesome teenager who has very poor social skills. She dresses like a punk, has several piercings, and a dragon tattoo on her back. She was hired by Henrik to follow Mikael during the trial and make sure he was clean. When Mikael asks for an investigator to help him solve the mystery, they recommend her to him and they begin working together forming an unlikely alliance. They soon discover however that digging up the past could bring them trouble.<br/><br/>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has several good things going for it beginning with the excellent story written by Larson. It has a lot of suspense and thrills, it works better than most mystery films. Zaillian really does a great job with the adaptation of the novel. The second thing it has going for it are excellent characters and good actors playing them. Rooney Mara, Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgard are all excellent in this film and they have rich and memorable characters to interpret. Lisbeth Salander has to be one of the best female characters I've seen in an action film in a long time. Her side story is a nice compliment to the murder investigation, and in the next two sequels the film shifts its focus mainly back to her. I still think this first novel is better than the next two so I don't expect the next movies to be as good as this one (at least that's how they played out in the Swedish films). The cinematography in this film is also great, setting the dark tone of the film. The film has recently been nominated for 5 Oscars including Best Cinematography and a Best Actress nod for Rooney Mara. I think it got snubbed for a Best Picture nomination (it was better than some of the movies nominated). This isn't a movie for everyone: it is dark, it has some strong scenes (a difficult to watch rape scene), but it is a well made thriller and among the best films of the year.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"SDAim","8","0","3","29 January 2012"," Decent enough remake of a better Swedish film
","I think that, for the most part, this was a perfectly fine remake of the Swedish 2009 film, but that's exactly the problem. Why do something that's already been done better -- and not that long ago, to boot? Everyone was very good in their roles -- I think finding Rooney Mara for the lead was key, because if you don't have the right Lisbeth, the whole thing goes downhill fast. But it did seem kind of weird that they're all supposed to be in Sweden, yet everyone is speaking English. Again, a reason to see the original and leave it at that.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me was the ending -- please stop reading if you don't want a spoiler. When they showed Lisbeth going to Mikael's house with a gift for him, and she sees him emerging with his arm around Erika, Lisbeth is obviously upset and hurt. She throws the expensive jacket into the trash, and vrooms off on her motorbike. In the original film, we surmise that Lisbeth and Mikael's relationship wasn't really anything more than friends with benefits -- in fact, I don't remember them having sex more than once. Lisbeth seems like she'd have a L*O*N*G way to go before she could be intimate with a man in any meaningful way, so the whole last scene in the U.S. remake didn't really ring true to character. I left the theater wondering if the director did that to make her more likable to American audiences -- can we not handle the fact that Lisbeth is a very damaged young woman who isn't going to see Mikael as her knight in shining armor? At least they didn't have Lisbeth and Mikael ending up ""together"" as a couple -- that really would have been insulting. Gee . . . Erika or Lisbeth -- who would any guy in his right mind have gone for?"

Anyway, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo already existed, written by a Sewdish writer, Stieg Larsson. The title wasn't chosen by Finch but that doesn't exculpate it from its huge stupidity. The story is also very poor and uninteresting, but Fincher gets away with it thanks to three or four aspects: Daniel Craig, like him or not, he's good; Rooney Mara, she's a stunning performance, perhaps the real deal boosting her to a big career and Lisbeth Salander, a great inspiring character, quite implausible situation when you meet her the first time. Fincher leaves there a window of curiosity opened. I doesn't seem like his remaking the following two parts of the trilogy, and there's quite well evaluated Swedish version of it. Just to end in some sort of summary, Mikael (Daniel Craig) is a journalist hired to solve a case of a teenage disappearance and requests the help of Lesbeth (Rooney Mara), this severally troubled woman detached from society, but with great informatic skills especially when it comes to hacking. 7/10"

","I have not read the books but loved the first Swedish version. It came across to me as so genuine, so different, so shocking, and non-slick that it was utterly engrossing and believable. Of course much of this was due to the Noomi Rapace's portrayal of Lisbeth Salander, which was stunning and so uniquely wonderful that you couldn't believe any other actress wouldn't ruin it. <br/><br/>This was the great surprise of the Hollywood version. Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth was equally compelling, albeit different. She deserves much credit. Well done.<br/><br/>The strengths of this version were predictable: better visually, more moody, more slick, more artistic. So were the weaknesses: less gritty/realistic made it less compelling...more like a Batman movie. Because a Hollywood version has to have romance all of a sudden Lisbeth was after Mikhael, which lacks credibility considering her character....Lisbeth would never chase any man.<br/><br/>As the rape and torture scenes had to be toned down they were less shocking and upsetting. And the requirement for a stronger, handsomer leading man made Craig's version seem less vulnerable and intellectual.<br/><br/>While I greatly preferred the original film, this version probably can be more easily digested by a US and perhaps mainstream audience, which I'm sure was the producer's intention. If that opens up the amazing Lisbeth character to a wider audience I can't argue.<br/><br/>Now I'm off to finally read the first book!"

Conan and Lisbeth each have their lives take a serious wrong turn at an early age. About a decade later opportunities arise to quest after a longed for revenge. In the process, each in their own way, becomes the most ferociously powerful hacker of their age. When Lisbeth cracks open a Macbook Pro I know that somebody somewhere is going to get cleaved fully in half, as sure as if Mr Olympia went totally berserk with a razor sharp broadsword. She even gets the opportunity to do some damage with an ax in true Barbarian style. Each communicates with dirty looks and mono-syllables if there is any anything communicated at all. All this silence and brooding is what was missing from the new Conan. It's like some black hole of hate, nothing escapes - especially not small talk. You should look at Lisbath/Conan and feel that here is someone who can destroy you at will. You will never ever get on Lisbeth/Conan's good side, don't even try."

","Does the international sensation The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo live up to all the hype? In my estimation, no! There is no denying that the story is amazing. The book may be amazing, and the original Swedish version of the film might be equally amazing, but David Fincher's adaptation of it is not. From the very beginning it seems as thou he's trying to turn this story into something it's not, a sequel to Seven. The story is fantastic, however, there are so many odd names and so many mumbled lines thrown at you so quickly, that you're easily confused. At many points in this film I was confused, and even when the killer was revealed, my reaction was ""which one is that?"" Besides being confusing, the film has about an hour of footage that has nothing to do with the main story and just adds to the overall confusion of the film. Like I said, the story is really good, the actors were really good also, but the film was just very long and confusing, and to be honest, I really wasn't all that impressed by it."

","I try to stay away from details if I give a review of something. I do not like to spoil the movie for others.<br/><br/>If you have read the book, prepare to be somewhat disappointed. The way things happen in the book, and what happens (or doesn't, or are completely made up) are entirely different things.<br/><br/>I saw the original Swedish version of all three films. They stuck much closer to the books, however, the subtitles were lacking at times. The fault I find with the American version of this film is that it seemingly tries too hard not to replicate the Swedish films. Replication is not a bad thing when it reflects how the story was actually written. When you see the film and your brain is yelling ""that's not how it happened at all!"", you tend not to be as happy as you would be if the movie were putting the characters you had read of into real people, doing what happened in the book.<br/><br/>Now, if you have not read the books, you won't have the same perspective. The only thing I could write for the people who have not yet read the books is this: The movie is slow for about the first hour. After that it picks up and is a decent show. <br/><br/>As for the lower rating, the reason I feel it deserves a 6 rather than a higher score is only because they do not follow the books as closely as they should have in my opinion."

","For those who watched the previous Swedish films (but not read the books), this movie is pretty good. In fact, it honestly felt like I was just re-watching the film again for the second time -- there were few differences between the two of them.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that the Swedish version had a little more weight to it, but if you have a serious aversion to foreign-language films, this movie does a good job of making you feel like you didn't miss anything as far as a 'remake' is concerned.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you can watch the Swedish versions, I'd recommend them either instead, or watching them sometime -- either before watching the English versions, or later.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to get into why I felt the Swedish version was better without revealing spoilers, but suffice to say that this version isn't bad either. I gave the Swedish version a 9/10, and I'm giving this an 8/10.<br/><br/>Hope this helps."

","This wasn't too bad. It wasn't GOOD but it wasn't too bad. Basically I went merely to get out of the rain. I was already soaked to the skin and two things had backfired earlier in the day. I was passing a Multiplex, checked out the fodder and this was the best of a bad bunch. I saw the first two Swedish films but took a rain check on the third. Also I've never read the novels. But it held my attention. More so as time went on. I wouldn't go so far as to actually accuse anyone of Acting but on the whole the majority of the cast phoned it in adequately. I'm not sure if I'll pursue it when the other two legs are released but as an escape from torrential rain I guess I could have done worse."
