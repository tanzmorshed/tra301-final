","Just watched it again yesterday - it's striking how good the action is compared to the ridiculous dialogue. I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first ""let's make a quick buck"" entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn't treat the material with the respect it deserved. When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful. It's hard to take characters or a story seriously when nearly every sentence spoken resembles lines from a parody of cheap science-fiction and horror movies from the fifties and sixties. But despite all those flaws I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects. Whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of Giger and the previous films. So if you can get past the silly characters and you're able to ignore the more obvious shortcomings (like the idiotic decision to make the film PG-13) you're in for a fun ride. My vote: 6.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"

","A team assembled by a billionaire investigate a heat signal that reveals a pyramid below the surface of a whaling station in Antarctic. However, the pyramid is a hunting ground for Predators who kill Aliens as a rite of passage and the team find themselves caught in the middle of their hunt.<br/><br/>It shouldn't have been mixed, Paul W.S. Anderson's AVP: Alien vs. Predator was more so unjustly panned by critics and fans due to the hype and anticipation. It has the feeling of an Alien film, a great premise, good cinematography, some amazing effects and a fine score.<br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson is successful in bringing the franchises together, respecting ideas from both Alien and Predator movies. I haven't seen a bad film that he's made and I'm not sure why there is such a geek gang hatred against the mans work. The ever-improving Uwe Boll he is not! The strong leads include Sanaa Lathan as the heroine and Raoul Bova. However, unfortunately actors Carsten Norgaard as Rusten Quinn and Tommy Flanagan as Mark Verheiden disappear far too early. Overall the acting is good, Lance Henrikson shows up as the 'real' Bishop but some of the characters lack development and the editing feels choppy in places.<br/><br/>The Predators and Aliens look great apart from some badly executed CGI. It not Ridley Scott or John McTiernan, but Paul Anderson pulls off the almost impossible task of putting these to aliens together on screen.<br/><br/>If there was not an Alien or Predator film prior to this it may have been haled as a science fiction adventure classic, but alas that's not the case."
"zumo-16908","7","39","45","25 December 2016"," Pretty good for what it is
","Some say that AVP is silly and that the plot is thin, and they are right, but this movie is not about realism or story depth. Its an action movie where people are hunted by terrifying monsters and get killed without discrimination. This is a slight depart from the original Alien movie and Predator movie which had a more serious tone, so i understand why some may be disappointed by AVP. But if you expect a solid no-brainer action movie that entertains the viewers with suspense and action without taking itself too serious, then you get exactly that. It is a joy to watch all the right people get killed and the right people survive their encounter with the aliens and the predator. The main character is actually quite likable. Its not like in Prometheus, where you'd grow increasingly apathetic with each silly decision made by the characters."
"fiore2","7","93","117","2 August 2009"," Not sure why it got such a bad mark from most people
","I went into this expecting a horrible movie. From all the reviews that I read I thought it would be HORRIBLE! I've seen many, many worse movies than this.<br/><br/>A previous comment stated the movie went a bit too fast in explaining things and developing the characters. While I can certainly agree on the former, the latter, well, you just know most of the people are going to get wasted so character development isn't that necessary. We came to see Predators hunt and fight with Aliens.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like was the movie showed the Aliens more powerful than the Predators. I believe the canon shows the Predators are much more powerful than the Aliens. Regardless, I liked this movie.<br/><br/>This movie surprised me because there were many things I didn't expect. Were some scenes over the top? Absolutely, but this is Hollywood and we're talking Aliens V Predator here :) IF you are a fan of these genres you really should give this movie a chance."

"TheMovieDoctorful","9","39","50","29 December 2018"," The Most Underrated Alien Film (And My Personal Favorite)
","The original Alien vs. Predator film is my favorite Alien movie. Note that I didn't say it was the best Alien movie (Even I wouldn't dare call this a better film than Alien or Aliens), but it is easily, without a doubt, my personal favorite entry in the franchise. It's easily its most underrated entry, far exceeding the expectations of a PG-13 crossover film with much more to offer than the intriguing premise of a fight between 80s monster icons. AvP: Alien vs. Predator is a film made with surprising levels of care in its characterizations, acting performances, themes and visual direction and it's a far better film than it has any right to be.<br/><br/>Of course, that PG-13 rating will always be a nuisance when dealing with a crossover between 2 legendarily brutal and violent film franchises. You can tell the film is significantly holding back on its violence, and while AvP is still able to retain a surprising sense of dread and suspense despite this, I can't help but feel that there is a truly scary movie underneath all the heavy censorship. The action scenes, while impressive, do tend to get somewhat ridiculous and nonsensical at times. Not Kong: Skull Island nonsensical, nowhere near that level, but still somewhat silly.<br/><br/>The beautiful Sanaa Lathan's performance as Lex Woods is absolutely incredible. In fact, I may actually prefer her performance and character to Ripley of the original series. She commands such a powerful screen presence and authority on her vocal delivery and her facial acting is beyond exceptional. Lathan is an incredibly convincing crier and scenes that require her to be emotionally tormented or horrified are some of the best performed in the entire franchise. Lathan's arc from cautious bystander, helpless to save her teammates from violent death, to strong warrior couldn't be written better and Lathan's switch in the 3rd act into a more angry, fearless character is performed with such passion and conviction. I fully believe that this is the kind of battle-tested fighter who could take on an Alien Queen with nothing but a spear and a chain by the end of the film. AvP is noticeably interested in the concept of how leaders watch from the sideline, while heroes out their lives on the line against even the most insurmountable odds of failure. Lex begins a leader and ends a hero, largely through witnessing the strength of her employer, Weyland.<br/><br/>Speaking of, Lance Henrikson (Recently discussed in my review of Pumpkinhead) is almost as excellent as the aging industrialist Charles Weyland. He subverts much of the expectations one would have for this kind of character; a billionaire industrialist, and descendant of the notoriously ruthless Michael Weyland. Bishop is fearless, proactive, bold and motivating and Henrikson does a wonderful job capturing the aging Weyland's strength, humanity and ""never say die"" spirit. His noble sacrifice to help Lex and Sebastian escape was a genuinely saddening moment, but no other end would seem more appropriate for such a hero.<br/><br/>A big reason why I love AvP so much is its themes of sacrifice and just how selfless and sacrificing these characters are. Lex, Weyland and Sebastian, all seemingly ordinary people, are fully ready to give their lives for one another on the expectation that the same would be done for them. There's a real camaraderie to them, a sense of heroism that's not only lacking in most casts of the Alien films, but in the casts of most team ensembles in general. Even the seemingly ruthless Predator Scar goes through a rather satisfying arc from lone wolf to loyal and sacrificing hero through his time spent witnessing Alex's heroism. Odd as it sounds, his borderline romantic interactions with Lex are genuinely satisfying. There's a weird chemistry there in a sort of ""Beauty & the Beast"" kind of way and both Sanna Lathan and Ian Whyte play it surprisingly well in their body acting. Also, kudos to AvP for being the first Predator film to actually give us a Predator with a personality in the oddly comedic Scar, small character moments like his prank on Lex or his cocky scoff at a ferocious chestburster are rather charming.<br/><br/>The special effects work is still stunning to this day. Those who watch the film now may be surprised at just how much practical effects work was done on this project rather than CGI and it certainly pays off. The Predators and Aliens hardly ever look fake, yet the film never has to sacrifice much in the way of speed to make their fights look natural. It gets to the point where I almost have to look for shots of them that look bad.<br/><br/>I'm no Paul W.S Anderson fan, but his visual direction here is absolutely incredible. The dusty, shadowy halls of the ancient temple maze work much in the same manner as an especially effective Haunted House; Gothic, claustrophobic and with the added danger of constantly shifting surroundings making escape almost impossible. The very limited use of music and nail biting sense of tension and pacing that Anderson stages his kills with are as chilling and creepy as those of any R-rated Alien film. Anderson's shots of the majestic, seemingly endless expanse of Antarctica have such a beauty, even an artistry, to them. They almost feel more out of a Discovery nature documentary than an Alien or Predator film.<br/><br/>AvP: Alien vs. Predator is nowhere near the disaster it's made out to be, nor is it the brainless, soulless video game it's been unfairly maligned as. It's well acted, has strong characters and themes, gorgeous direction and excellent cinematography. For my money, it's the 3rd best Alien film. It's certainly 100 times better than either of the pretentious, nonsensical Alien prequels that Ridley Scott cranked out. (I'm picking Paul W.S Anderson over Ridley Scott. Hell is having a snow day.)"
"hudkos","10","35","47","6 October 2004"," I loved it
","(Possible spoilers). <br/><br/>Unfortunately, if you are like me you have probably been too young when the original movies such as ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" played in the cinemas to appreciate the whole big screen movie experience.<br/><br/>Especially the original 1986 ""Aliens"", which is in my opinion the best movie of all times with three climaxes that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. ""Aliens"" also influenced so much of many of modern sci fi military genre. It just goes to show you how little those old-timers at the Oscars committees know. Wouldn't know what the suspense is if it bit them in the a... Also funny when you look at some of those movies, especially ""Aliens"", and in retrospect you realize how superior they are to most of today formulaic crap they spit out from the production lines.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" was directed by the same director as the ""The Terminator"" and ""Titanic"" which have his distinctive directing style. <br/><br/>Once, ""Aliens"" played as a part of the film festival, and it was sold out to the legion s of fans who wanted to see it on big screen as oppose to DVD or Video. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it, and I can't forgive myself for it, but I do make it a ritual to watch it once a year even if on video.<br/><br/>""Predator"" itself was a quite a good movie with the governor. In fact two governors if I am correct; Jesse Ventura (Governor of Minnesota) and Arnold Shwarzenneger (Governor of California). (They also did 'Running Man' together).<br/><br/>The whole concept of bringing the two species together is plausible one. I mean hey, they are both alien beings, God knows what's out there in that void.<br/><br/>There were moments which were truly frightening. I was in a cinema with only few people and when a guy who went to toilet sat back down in a row behind me I jumped a little. There were moments which truly made me shiver in fear and suspense. Being stuck with those truly frightening creatures like the Aliens is a part of the ultimate nightmare. <br/><br/>What is noticeable about this film in particular is that both species are the stars of the movie. Both get screen time independently, meaning in previous movies the humans had to be close by or really look at them to be seen. Not here. Creatures almost act themselves. Humans are mostly relegated to targets, which makes the easy meat for picking off by both sides. Which is kind of realistic, they are archaeologist, not marines from the ""Aliens"".<br/><br/>The whole end of the movie is nicely done to be realistic and plausible (in that context). Seems to me Predator got more screen time. Maybe because of its humanoid side while the aliens were treated like animals appearing here and there to just kill you. Pity, as I am more of the aliens fan than the predator. <br/><br/>One of the greatest tragedies character fact wise, is that the alien creature has acid for blood that burns through hard material. Originally created for that ""Nostromo"" environment in its very first appearance (Alien, 1979) to make it more frightening and meaner when its only one of them on that ship. Now that fact has to be carried into other movies and it just makes them pain in the a... to kill without burning yourself too. It limits the possible fight scenes. <br/><br/>I hope they make more movies where the aliens could feature as characters. Smart writers can think of the ways, and although there is no Sigourney Weaver here (what a brave woman, what a great character) it still works for true fans. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you accept the movie in that context you'll truly enjoy it. It can't outdo ""Aliens"", but sure as hell delivers a lot of fun."
"shakermakerman","6","85","125","9 September 2007"," Not as bad as some people make out
","Reading some of the harsh reviews I thought I would comment. The big disappointment for me in the movie was the lack of gore , fox did get it wrong to make it a pg13 even though they tried to substitute it with monster gore. All that being said this movie is a visual master-peace, the effects are top notch with very good fight scenes and creature effects with the best looking Alien Queen to hit the screens, The story is pretty cool and it gives more insight of the Predators, It takes a while for the introduction of the creatures but once the ball is rolling its none stop action. Not the horror feast we all wanted but fun."
"jmanchak6","10","35","48","1 March 2010"," For some reason, everyone hates this, but I love it!
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>I just like this movie because I saw it when I was younger, and when you're young, you just love any movie. I didn't see any of the Alien or Predator movies before I saw this, and maybe that's why I like it. I like to believe that the general audience (ie me) liked the movie, while the die-hard Alien and Predator fans hated it. So I started thinking about how they wouldn't like this. And I came up with these conclusions: <br/><br/>1) The fans were disappointed by the fact that this was only PG-13, not R. All of the previous films were R, so less violence in this, which ain't good.<br/><br/>2) There aren't a lot of scenes where aliens and predators are fighting. It contains more scenes of humans running away from aliens and predators, and once in a while, the aliens and predators get on each other's nerves.<br/><br/>3) Lance Henriksen was in the film, which basically messes up the continuity of the entire franchise. It's different if it was just a 10 second cameo, but they give him a huge role.<br/><br/>Why do I like this film? Because it gives me a great sense of nostalgia. I enjoyed the special effects, and I thought that the plot was great and fun. Plus it is pretty scary (if you're 8).<br/><br/>I don't know, just try the film out. That's all!"
"mrphantasm","10","53","78","20 December 2004"," In a difficult scenario Paul W.S. Anderson succeeded.
","Alien Versus Predator starts great and then it gets better and better. We have the two deadliest space monsters of the last twenty years and thankfully they are not involved in a production full of clichés.<br/><br/>Paul W.S Anderson is not afraid of risk. When the easier thing to do would be showing the creatures killing some humans from the first seconds of AVP and minutes later have them killing each other for an hour, the director creates suspense and develop the main characters without losing the rhythm of the movie.<br/><br/>The story has interesting characters (Lance Henriksen as Charles Bishop Weyland is a real sign of respect for the fan). It is highly remarkable that the cast involved play intelligent adults, luckily there's no high school students; so many years have gone since the last sequel of Alien and Hollywood could perfectly spoil it again using people like Sarah Michelle Gellar or Matthew Lillard. The way the script uses the strong elements of both mythologies is very clever as it is the display of personality of the main Predator. After all, Predators are a extraterrestrials with more sophisticated technology than humans, they don't communicate with the earthlings until they prove to be worthy the communication.<br/><br/>Almost all of the action movies use and abuse CGI nowadays but AVP uses these FX wisely mixing them with puppets, that results in a film not just a video-game. The results are bombastic in that aspect, and there's enough blood from the Aliens and Predators to satisfy the thirst from gore fans.<br/><br/>And what about the confrontation of the ugly-faced stars? Unforgettable. AVP has some of the most powerful images created in any of these franchises mainly in the confrontation sequences."

","So there is this book out there, by a wonderful writer named Stephen Perry. He wrote and Alien vs. Predator book years ago. I loved the book. I loved it, and obviously lots of other people did too because it was turned into a large graphic novel. <br/><br/>So what does this have to do with the movie? It's the same awesome story! Sure there are differences, but basically, it's the same story about clan respect and the thrill of the hunt. <br/><br/>This one has a group of three ""preteen"" predators out on their trip to man hood, a group of would-be scientists, and a group of ""freezer burnt"" aliens.<br/><br/>The hunt commences, and action ensues!<br/><br/>As for the spoilers - here they are. The predator/human relationship. How many people thought it was supposed to be some kind of stupid love story! IT WASN'T! In the book, this was explained a little better I think, and would be a lot easier for others to understand. It's a show of respect. He accepts her as a predator because she kills an alien. In the book - the predator she saves was originally one of the high ranking predators. He's ended up on his own, and the girl saves his life. In show of mutual clan respect, the Predator marks her, and they go on fighting ""the good fight"" so to speak.<br/><br/>either way - loved the movie. If you hated it, give me your extra tickets and I'll go see it again!"

","Another great movie spoiled by bad initial critique. And most people jumping on the bandwagon. They moved production of this movie out of Hollywood and lots of people virtually lost jobs to some east European studios where they shot most of the scenes. Lots of anger was present in Hollywood about this, no surprise that initial reviews were strictly negative. This movie is superb in nearly all aspects I watched it more times then all the prequels combined. I like the lead actress and Henriksen as Bishop Weyland, some crew man are actually more interesting then the crew in some Alien prequels, and of course the CGI is finally watchable and say state of the art, not some lame blinking LEDs all over."

In fact , this is the first Alien film, and also the first Predator film, to get a rating other than R . This was a project that had floated around for about 10 years , it was only when director Paul W.S. Anderson did his verbal pitch to the suits at 20th Century Fox that anyone showed any real interest . This horrifying as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , filled with action , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . This nail-biting picture contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , thrills , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and passable acting .

This is a brutal , considerable violent and exciting sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s , 90s and 2000s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably thrilling action movie with a strong cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Based on the comic books by writer Mark Verheiden, creator of the first Alien vs Predator comic series and the first story involving both species , contrary to popular belief, the comic was released prior to the infamous shot of the alien ""skull"" in Predator 2 (1990). The Alien vs. Predator story crossed over virtually all forms of media before becoming a feature film . There was a successful comic book series, toy line, multiple video games, soundtrack of the PC game and even a trading card series . Breathtaking as well as bloody slaughter sequences took long time to shoot and were extremely difficult to make . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . Top-notch special effects by SFX designers Tom Woodruff Jr and Alec Gillis , after the opening credits are shown, they have brief cameos as technicians who discover the heat bloom coming from the pyramid . The animatronic Queen was controlled by a motion-control rig which could save her movements digitally . The ending part is particularly exciting with Sanaa Lathan battling the malicious alien and with impressive scenes that took various weeks to film . The star and support cast are pretty good such as Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Lance Henriksen , Colin Salmon and Tommy Flannagan .

","25 years ago Ridley Scott scared us with his terror in space original ""Alien"" in which technically adept director, James Cameron elaborated on successfully in ""Aliens"". Then came the concept of an advanced race of aliens that hunt for sport using state-of-the-art technology in the box office smash, ""Predator"". The 1991 sequel, ""Predator 2"" featured an in-joke at the film's climax where Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" skull is observed as being a trophy inside the ""Predator's"" spaceship, and that idea launched the 1993 Super Nintendo video game, the Stephen Perry book and not to mention various graphic novels that pitted the two species against each-other in a mega-war between the races.<br/><br/>Now its 2004, and director, Paul W.S. Anderson (producer of Resident Evil) finally decides to bring the idea to the big screen in a slam-bang action showdown. Beautiful survivalist, Sanaa Lathan is recruited along with a group of scientists by Weyland Industries' Charles ""Bishop"" Weyland (Lance Henrickson) to journey to Antarctica where a satellite observed the ancient ruins of a pyramid under the ice that dates back before the Egyptians. It turns out the the ""Predator"" race designed the structure in order to breed the parasitic ""Alien"" creatures in order to hunt for sport, and human beings were the unfortunate hosts. Now as the body count piles up, resourceful female hero must combine wits with the hunters in order to defeat the enemy. Sound familiar? This is hardly new terrain, but the action is exciting enough, the special FX top notch, and fans of ""Alien/Predator"" films will appreciate the effort. Lance Henrickson is the perfect candidate for Weyland, and Lathan shines through as the tough but gorgeous female lead. This has plenty of thrills, homages to the original films and the combination of the treacherous Arctic landscape and Egyptian archetypal symbolism is very unique. The unrated version is the way to go of course, and provides a bit more action, but either way this is good stuff for fans of these films. Behold, the sequel, AVP: Requiem comes next!!"
"MovieAddict2016","4","392","727","13 August 2004"," With its shameful rating, poor acting, awful writing and mediocre direction, 'AvP' disappoints the fans at every turn, and will probably leave non-fans feeling a little wishy-washy. Fox has taken two of thei
","We don't go to see movies about dueling alien species for deep themes and intricate character development, but a little sympathy would be nice. I didn't feel any sympathy for the characters in 'Alien vs. Predator' because they were all unlikable clichés: The Heroine, The Hero, The Nerd, The Tomboy, The Gruff Leader, et al. These carbon cut out characters we've seen in hundreds of other films are all assembled together by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) in 'AvP' to venture into the Antarctic, where they uncover an ancient pyramid recently discovered by Weyland's multi-million dollar satellites hovering about in space.<br/><br/>The movie is based, of course, upon the iconic 'Alien' and 'Predator' films  the rights to which are both owned by Fox Studios. The concept for the project originated with 'Predator 2' (1990), when a cop (played by Danny Glover) ventured into a Predator spaceship. There, in the 'trophy room,' was the distinct skull of an Alien.<br/><br/>This small in-joke reference (similar to that of Freddy Kruger's claw appearing in the 'Evil Dead' sequel) sparked a phenomenon of fans speculating as to the meaning behind the very brief big-screen insinuation. And due to strong requests, the two fictional species were finally united together for a string of comic books, videogames, novels and action figures in the early-'90s. By the year 2002, 'Alien vs. Predator' had become one of Fox's most profitable off-screen franchises. So, it was only reasonable to demand a film be made. By October 2003, production was underway, with sets in Prague being assembled.<br/><br/>And the film's director, Paul W. S. Anderson, has always excelled at set design. In 'Event Horizon' he perfectly captured the dark essence of the 'Alien' series; with 'Resident Evil' he managed to mimic the Gothic structure of all great zombie movies. But, to be honest, that's about it. He's never been any good at three other vital elements of film-making: story, characters and direction. 'Alien vs. Predator' - a project that took 14 astonishing years to bring to the big screen (longer than 'Freddy vs. Jason') - doesn't do much to change this.<br/><br/>Yes, his set design here is fantastic (it's no surprise that a great amount of pre-production work went into creating these enormous surroundings). The pyramid is buried deep within the wastelands of the Antarctic (2,000 feet, actually), which provides us with some great cinematography and stages.<br/><br/>The plot could have used extra work, though. After venturing deep into the pyramid, the team of scientists soon realizes that the pyramid is - surprise, surprise! - actually the home of an alien hive. And furthermore, a pack of teenaged Predators -- on an annual 'manhood' hunting ritual -- are there, too, and they begin to draw the humans into their fight, using them as bait.<br/><br/>The movie's cast is comprised of many newcomers and they are all unimpressive. Sanaa Lathan ('Out of Time'), as Alexa, the heroine, is rather annoying. Raoul Bova, playing the hero Sebastian, is the most likable of the characters, but even then, he's simply no Arnold. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the dialogue is completely lame. Sure, 'Predator' had lame dialogue too ('Knock, knock!') but at least it was funny and delivered with charisma. This movie unfortunately takes itself way too seriously. I've heard many people quote lines from 'Predator' over the years ('I ain't got time to bleed!' being a popular one). I can't imagine anyone ever *wanting* to quote dialogue from this film.<br/><br/>Even Henriksen seems like he's just in it for the paycheck. (His character, Charles 'Bishop' Weyland, is the billionaire who  according to 'Alien' mythology -- creates the Bishop androids seen in 'Aliens' and 'Alien 3,' which are modeled after his own image.) Is it any coincidence that the only returning cast member from either series of films happens to be the same actor whose career has devolved into straight-to-video duds recently?<br/><br/>However, kudos must be handed to ""'AvP's' creature effects artists (mainly Tom Woodruff, Jr.). I had expected lots of CGI, but there are also many close-ups of the Predators and Aliens played by thankless actors in suits (and some good IL'-fashioned animatronics). Kevin Peter Hall (the original Predator) passed away shortly after the release of the film's sequel, but Anderson has comprised an acceptable team of replacements (most of the actors being some seven feet tall!).<br/><br/>That, and the set design, and one or two OK action sequences, makes 'AvP' adequate for 'regular' cinema-goers expecting nothing more. If you're just looking for the average Saturday night blow-'em-up action flick, you could certainly do worse. But, for any true die-hard fans of the films, this movie continually disappoints  and worst of all, due to its restrictive PG-13 rating, the fights (which take place all too often and rapidly become boring) are all over the place. We are not 'allowed' to see anything, which hinders the flow of the film. There was more violence than I had expected, but still not enough. (For the record, 'AvP' is the only film from either of the two series to ever receive an under-R rating.) After negative test screenings, Fox Studios decided to go against the will of the film's own director and brutally chop the movie apart so that it could fit into a more marketable age demographic. (So, the awkward flow in many of the sequences cannot be entirely contributed to Anderson's directing skills.) The day the official rating was released, fans across the world united online to protest it. I can't say I blame them.<br/><br/>I had personally been looking forward to seeing this movie for quite some time now, being a fan of both 'Alien' (1979) and 'Predator' (1987). Yet I tried to view 'AvP' unbiased, and judge it on its own terms, as a movie, and not particularly a sequel. It was a difficult task, but the truth of the matter is that the film  as a stand-alone project  is still not particularly enthralling. With its shameful rating, poor acting, awful writing and mediocre direction, 'AvP' disappoints the fans at every turn, and will probably leave non-fans feeling a little wishy-washy. Fox has taken two of their greatest franchises and turned them into a joke. 'AvP' is nothing more than typical action fare which, all considered, isn't much of a compliment at all.<br/><br/>2.5/5"
"jaywolfenstien","Null","196","361","10 September 2004"," Paradoxial
","Most people going into this film want to see one thing: Aliens and Predators rip into each other. I suspect a great many geeks and lame individuals inhabiting message boards of every corner of the internet will complain that this film spends too much time with the humans when the name of the film is 'Alien versus Predator' and they couldn't care about the humans, and another sect will whine about how shallow the film is to jump right to the big fight as soon as it can possibly set it up. <br/><br/>The nice thing about the Freddy vs Jason premise is the fact that most of the Elm Street films and none of the Friday the 13th films had any substance to them, so throwing the two juggernauts into a battle rumble with each other with a side of useless characters and uninspired plot shouldn't have phased anyone but the most deluded of fans. I really liked FvsJ more so than all but the Craven-driven Elm Streets and the all the F13s.<br/><br/>Alien vs Predator is quite a bit different since I love Ridley Scott's Alien and James Cameron's Aliens, and though I don't hold Predator 1 & 2 on the same level, I'm still pretty fond of the original Predator film (been too long since I've seen Predator 2). The Alien series (and to a much lesser extent, the Predator series too) has always been about depth . . . so to just throw the two monsters at each other and let them rip into each other really does not do them any justice and strips away what makes their films so good to begin with. <br/><br/>So . . . AVP takes a middle path. It attempts to build up the characters to an extent, it attempts to give a valid reason for both the Aliens and Predators to be in the same location, and it attempts to do it as quickly as it can. How well does it succeed? I found myself wishing it would either slow down more or pick up the pace. <br/><br/>I'm very pleased to see the stylish Paul Anderson lead this tangled and difficult project. His nods to the original films, in jokes, and slower paced setup were much appreciated from me. Ninety minutes of guys in rubber suits cut with CG monsters fighting constantly just will not cut it. I felt Anderson rushed the setup (or the studio rushed him); but part of me did grow bored of the characters rather quickly, and I did want to see the Alien and Predators get together sooner than they did.<br/><br/>The lingering time between bouts did create more tension and anticipation for the coming fights, which I admired, and when the beasts finally sank claws and teeth into one another I found myself more or less satisfied. At first I felt somewhat let down by how seemingly easily a few Predators went down; however, then I remembered these things were fighting Aliens with bare fists and blades when Space Marines were getting slaughtered with state of the art artillery. <br/><br/>A classless director would have started with a bang, ended with a bang, and had a boring parade of bangs. When I want meaningless, yet entertaining, bangs I buy firecrackers and save myself both time and money. Paul Anderson strived for something more, and pretty much came through. While I did like the film and the idea of Aliens and Predators fighting it out, I couldn't help but compare it to the superior films that inspired it. As fun as AVP is, and as much as I like Paul Anderson . . . he is not Ridley Scott and this is not Alien."
"drummerman92","7","37","61","18 March 2010"," Highly underrated
","Sure this movie might not have that good of a plot or characters but it had good action sequences and effects. I liked how this film revealed a little of the back story of the predators (since they have always been a big mystery) and it tells about how the aliens are the predators ultimate prey. Sure the plot had a few holes like how did the alien queen stay alive when frozen for that long? Or why the aliens acid blood dissolves the claws but not the spears or the bladed disc. But that is made up for with the fight scenes which i personally thought were exiting and very well done. And i thought it was interesting how the aliens used their own queens acid blood the burn through the chains and free her. My opinion on this movie is this Allot of people say it sucked but i think it was alright (partially because I'm a big fan of both series ans I saw AVP:R first) but if you don't have an open mind about this movie don't watch it, if you are a fan of the alien and predator franchises I would highly suggest this movie."

","...Before a possible showdown between the iconic monsters of ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" would occur, when they would cross paths on screen and battle to the death. There's a scene in ""Predator 2"" that occurs towards the end of the film, where Lt. Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) ventures into the Predator spaceship and accidentally stumbles onto the alien hunter's trophy room, and neatly placed towards the back amongst the various awards, was an alien skull. Those 10 seconds of film spawned over a decade's worth of rumors that one day these titans were going to go at it head-to-head, and that whoever won, we'd lose.<br/><br/>As a fan of both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises, I've been looking forward to ""Alien Vs. Predator"" for a long time, since that historic scene. I've admired the two monsters for years, collecting all kinds of memorabilia, including books and action figures; you name it, I've probably seen it.<br/><br/>With ""Alien Vs. Predator,"" director Paul W.S. Anderson has achieved something of a mixed bag. Undoubtedly critics will balk early into the film. They'll pick apart its MTV-style editing, bad pacing, and lack of spirit of a genuine ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" film. Die-hards will balk at Anderson's direction and the fact that he was even allowed near the film.<br/><br/>I had fun watching it, despite some inconsistencies regarding our two iconic monsters who like to either use humans as hosts for more of their hideous offspring, or trophies which can be displayed in their intergalactic showroom of skulls.<br/><br/>The story is that a massive, ancient Aztec/Egyptian/Mayan temple has been discovered deep below the surface of the Antarctic, and Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen of ""Aliens"") has assembled a team of the world's best archaeologists, which includes Alexa ""Lex"" Woods (Sanaa Lathan, who convincingly fills in the tough female role), Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova) and Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner) to accompany him in investigating it. But wouldn't you know it? They're not alone in this gargantuan maze of dark tunnels and ever-changing structures, and that a trio of Predators have come there to hunt rapidly reproducing Xenomorphs.<br/><br/>Well, I can tell anyone that the powers-that-be in Hollywood and at Twentieth Century Fox played heavily into the film's mixed bag treatment. If the movie fails, I'd blame constant executive and studio interference - the b*****ds in suits who decide they want to cater to teenage fanboys instead of the largely adult fan base that this film was originally built on. In doing so, they opt for action over story, more importantly, $$$ over artistic vision.<br/><br/>Anderson has remained faithful in preserving the essence of both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchises by casting no-name performers to combat the extraterrestrial foes, and by emphasizing ideas over action and special effects. On a sour, angrier note, the gorehounds will be sorely disappointed, since executives at Fox toned down the violence considerably as to release it with a ""PG-13"" rating, as to rake in every penny. Of course, that ""PG-13"" rating doesn't stop us from getting quick edits (read: no gore) of chestbursting sequences, facehuggings, and people being mercilessly slaughtered by the Predators.<br/><br/>I had faith that Paul W.S. Anderson wouldn't let me down long before I even saw the film; he doesn't, but I have a feeling that his film is destined for the same fate as David Fincher and his film ""Alien 3"" - that it will go down in infamy and only years after the director has disowned the film and controversy is still brewing, that the true vision of ""Alien Vs. Predator"" will surface and will finally earn the respect owed to it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"littlejimmy835","1","252","495","23 April 2006"," It's been two years, and I still can't forgive the unscrupulousness of this POS.
","Paul W. S. Anderson, the man who has directed previous travesties as ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Resident Evil"" doesn't fail to live up to his standards which consist of a horrible script, cheesy ""2 kewl 4 skool"" directing styles, weak cast, and every other weakness in a film you can think of. The only person who rivals his ineptness is none other than Uwe Boll. He has already ruined other franchises with his previous films, and now by directing and writing Alien vs. Predator, he has managed to ruin two movie series at the same time.<br/><br/>The story of this film is bay far the weakest aspect of this derision of a movie. All the previous Alien/Predator films had simple plots with good dialogue. Just simply there was a monster trying to kill the good guys, and they had to survive it. The stories were so uncomplicated yet incredibly well written that the viewer could not possibly complain that the story was bad. Alien vs. Predator however attempts to be a big, complex story with deep meaning to it, but it just comes off as being stupid and try hard. Paul, a complex story is good, only if you know how to write that is.<br/><br/>It's about a pyramid that is discovered on Earth in Antarctica. It turns out that this pyramid was part of the first human civilisation ever, that the Predators built it for the humans long ago, and in return, the humans worshiped the Predators as gods and acted as hosts for the captive alien Queens eggs that are in the pyramid, to make Aliens for the predators to hunt, not for sport like in the previous Predator films, but to prove that they are men. When modern day people go to investigate this pyramid, they become the new hosts for the Aliens that they Predators are going to hunt.<br/><br/>Not only is this completely unbelievable, (a pyramid in Antarctica? Come on) but it totally contradicts the previous Alien and Predator movies. In each Alien movie the point of the film was, ""Don't let the Aliens get to Earth or they will kill everything!"" Yet in this movie it was like, ""Oh the Aliens have been on Earth the entire time and it wasn't really that bad now that we think about it."" The previous Predator films are contradicted as well because the Predators are portrayed as creatures who are noble warriors, who actually respect humans and will help them if need be, rather than the ruthless merciless hunters who killed for sport and would kill a human just out of spite if he looked at him funny. Having Predators help humans build societies contradicts their nature, and takes away the mysteriousness and awesomeness of the Predator character. <br/><br/>But the thing is even as a stand alone film it's a very weak story. It can be compared to the later Jaws movies where you saw too much of the shark. Both extraterrestrial species are too in your face and have no mystery; leaving them just look like guys in rubber suits running around punching each other. Human characters have so little character development that often you don't even get to learn their names before they are killed, and so much more makes you feel like the script was made from a tipped over box of alphabet cereal. <br/><br/>Here's a perfect example of how bad the dialogue is in AVP. <br/><br/>FemaleTechnician: What is it? <br/><br/>Male Technician: It's a data stream from PS12.<br/><br/>Female Technician: Where is she? <br/><br/>Male Technician: Right above sector 14. <br/><br/>Female Technician: There isn't anything in sector 14. <br/><br/>Male Technician: The is now.<br/><br/>It is obvious in that piece of dialogue that Paul W. S. Anderson doesn't know anything about mapping or geography. Look moron, there is no such thing as this elusive ""sector 14"", things are mapped using latitude and longitude, bearings and such. Secondly for this Female Technician to have said on the spot, ""There's nothing in sector 14"" implies that she has memorised the presumably thousands of sectors all over the world and what is in each and every one of them so she can recall instantly off the top of her head that the isn't anything in sector 14. This is just one example of how cheesy and full of holes the very dialogue in Alien vs. Predator can be.<br/><br/>It is clear that a movie this bad was made only for the action, not the story. The thing is, in this whole move THERE ARE ONLY TWO FIGHT SCENES! If you are going to make a movie that has no good script which is only about the action, put in a decent amount of fighting at least!<br/><br/>AND THE PG-13 RATING?! Every other Alien/Predator film released before this one had and R rating. This film has been dumbed down for kids so much, that about 95% of the movies deaths or other injuries were off screen. You would see an Alien just getting near a guy before the camera would cut away, leaving you thinking, ""So not only do we have no story but we have no gore?! I want my money back!"" The line ""You are one ugly mother fer"" which is the trademark line of each other Predator film had the last word of it not filmed to keep the low rating! Yet earlier in the film they said, ""I hope it kills every fing one of them!"". Why did they decide to put the F word in earlier when it wasn't necessary, yet cut it out later when it was?! If they had of just shifted the F word to the ugly mother part then there could have been just as many F words yet still kept the trademark line!<br/><br/>It's a POS movie. The 1000 word limit has stopped me from going on."

Seeing this movie only eggs them on people! This is a movie that you immediately wish you could UNWATCH and erase from your memory banks.<br/><br/>I would be highly surprised if more time went into the script of this film than the actual marketing. I'm not even going to complain about the PG-13 rating because it is what it is.... just a bad movie.<br/><br/>Horrible acting. Pointless plodding sub-plots. Decent action sequences and a precious few cool moments in what should have been a fan-boy's wet dream. The lead in this movie is a demographic friendly woman with barely enough acting ability to make a shampoo ad believable. Any mildly entertaining characters were immediately destroyed in the first twenty minutes of the film with zero payout. Even the marquee monsters end up looking bored as the audience is lead along in a by numbers popcorn sales ploy."

","Many people castigate Paul Anderson for destroying both the Alien and Predator franchises. I must say that they have no clue and the director/writer is a true genius for having pulled this movie off. Notice that I did'nt say that this movie itself was great but it was a work of genius. So what is the movie like? It is by far one of the worst and most disgusting pieces of crap that will kill your interest in both the Alien and predator. But don't you get it? That's the point.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson obviously hates the fans of the franchises and has been hating them for a while now. He hates them beyond anything and they must be made to pay dearly and suffer. So in a brilliant plan, he manages to fraud the fools at Fox to give him the project. He did that despite the fact that his previous movies were laughable. Now isn't that just genius? Anderson has made a joke out of every single thing that made the concepts stand out. Your innocent curiosity will make you sit through his parody in hopes of some big twist but it never happens. Scene after Scene is one joke after another. How can anyone possibly imagine a bullet-time mode for an Alien attack? All this has been done very intentionally and nobody realises that. Once you've watched this movie, there's nothing you can do about it. You've lost and Anderson has won. His revenge on fans is complete. Hes also left room for a sequel by including a predalien birth at the end, further putting a big hole in future stories. He makes a ton of money too. Genius.<br/><br/>Oh, I should have said EVIL genius.<br/><br/>UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR INTEREST IN ALIENS AND PREDATORS KILLED OFF, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."

","Many fans want different things from this film. Many fans, including myself, were hoping to see lots and lots of action. One Alien & Predator battle after another. Some fans were hoping for a edge of your seat, truly terrifying horror movie much like the original Alien. No matter what you want, hope, or expect from this film you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>The direction this film takes is a horror route. It tries to be like the original Alien movie in the sense that the horror has to come more from the characters and their fear than from the monsters themselves. Paul Anderson tries to show as little Alien & Predator as possible without being ridiculous and let the actors & characters sell us the fear. Now this sounds like a good approach to a film and normally it would be. Here however it is the reason the films fall flat on its face. The problem being is that the characters aren't interesting and their actually paper thin cut outs. And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.<br/><br/>But as I said, Paul Anderson tries to hide the monsters and show as little as possible much like the formula Ridley Scott & James Cameron used for their films. And thats where the film fails. Fans come to see this movie to see Aliens & Predators fighting. They don't come to see Sanna Lathan and the other people run around a dark pyramid. Fans didn't wait 14 years to see paper thin characters run around all over the place. They go to see Aliens & Predators.<br/><br/>The film should have taken the action route and gives us large amounts of AVP battles. However Paul Anderson only gives us ONE, count them One, true fight scene between an ALien & predator. And that fight scene doesn't occur until half-way through the film and it only lasts 2 minutes. 2 minutes. As a fan I did not wait this long to see a AVP movie only to have one battle that lasts 2 minutes.<br/><br/>Above I said ""true battle"" because there is technically another battle. It is between a Predator, Lex, and an Alien Queen. Much like the first AVP battle it is disappointingly short and 90% of the battle focuses on lex fighting the queen than it does focus on the Predator. After a while you begin to think the title ""Alien vs. Predator"" is inappropriate and instead should be called ""The Adventures of Lex"". Paul Andersons direction leaves out the two title characters.<br/><br/>The idea of hiding your monsters appearance till half way through the film and rely more on your characters is a formula that has worked in the past. It even potentially could have worked here but in order for that to happen you need to do one thing. Make the characters more interesting. If your characters are paper thin then the audience aren't going to care about them and then they quickly become bored. The film should have done is focus less on characters and more on the monsters. It amazes me so much on how the film lacks on what the title promises."
"seaview1","Null","71","135","12 August 2004"," Alien vs. Predator plays like a video game
","Twentieth Century Fox has taken two of its most popular sci-fi franchises and paired them in a Super Bowl of monsters in Alien vs. Predator. The result is OK entertaining but ultimately a pale version of the original classics, Alien and Predator. It helps to get some useful perspective. <br/><br/>The concept, while intriguing, is not entirely new. Quite recently, Jason (Friday the 13th series) and Freddy (the Nightmare on Elm Street) did battle as studios attempted to milk every last drop of revenue from waning sequels. Three-quarters of a century ago, Universal pictures became what would be the greatest horror film studio with Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, The Mummy, and Creature from the Black Lagoon among others. When it became apparent that each franchise was running its course, the natural thought was to pair their monsters in a showdown. Most prominent was Frankenstein Meets Wolfman. So it is no wonder that a clip from that very film shows up at the beginning of Alien vs. Predator.<br/><br/>Set on present day earth, a satellite detects a thermal event in Antarctica which triggers a hastily assembled scientific expedition financed by the Weyland Corporation. Its enigmatic head is Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) who wants to leave a legacy as his health begins to fail. Sanaa Lathan is the mountain climber/guide who leads the group to the thermal anomaly and discovers an ancient pyramid beneath the deep ice. Unfortunately, the explorers trigger a sequence of events including the birth of new Aliens via the dreaded facehuggers and the arrival of a group of Predator warriors ready for a new hunt. As the body count rises, the Aliens multiply in number and thus a battle royal is ready to commence. Will there be any humans left? How come nobody told the Nostromo crew in the first Alien movie about these critters? And what happened to the Henriksen character's namesake who reappears in the guise of Bishops 1 and 2 in later films? So many questions are left unanswered. <br/><br/>The plot does have plenty of holes and glosses quickly, almost too quickly through the story as characters we barely get to know or want to care about quickly perish. Fans of both film series will appreciate the multitude of references to the Alien life cycle and Predator code. There are a couple of inconsistencies which may nag the purists such as the rapid maturation of the Aliens from egg to adult in record time, and the ease with which the dwindling humans understand the whole scenario. In fact, not only do the humans quickly realize who the Aliens are, namely the ultimate quarry for the Predator hunter warriors, but that human beings have been used like cattle to perpetuate the Aliens every 100 years as game for the returning Predator race. Note that the film Predator 2 hinted at this very concept with a brief glimpse of an Alien skull inside a Predator spaceship. Alien vs. Predator also serves as a kind of prequel to the Alien films and a kind of sequel to the Predator films in its timeline. <br/><br/>Sanaa Lathan is actually good in the role of the guide and it is possible a better script and strong direction would have brought echoes of Ripley from the Alien films of old. The set design of the pyramid is fascinating though confusing with all of its ever changing mazes. The creature effects are not bad though reserved for the latter half of the movie. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon) does a serviceable job here and the PG 13 rating is designed for all those fans of the video games and comics featuring the Alien and Predator battles. Business should be brisk though limited to those loyalists who will find this installment diverting and certainly not the disappointment of Alien 3, or is it we've just lowered the bar a bit more?"

","If you give a toss about the story, stop reading. But believe me, this comment couldn't possibly ruin the film for you any more than Fox has. Spare a thought for Paul Anderson as he struggles to make a film that hasn't been neutered by the MPAA or a cowardly studio. Once Paul Verhoeven left America to resume his stellar work in Europe, I guess the MPAA had to have someone to pound upon. After moronic parents who took their single-digit-age children to see Resident Evil complained, I guess it was inevitable that future Anderson projects face an even bigger butcher's knife.<br/><br/>But I am getting ahead of myself here. There are two things that made the Alien and Predator franchises work. The first was human interaction. In essence, the films were about humans trying to screw each other over for power, with the titular enemy there to deliver the consequences of not working together. A non-subtle and somewhat shallow social statement, in other words. Then there's the gore factor. Once the human drama is set up, who cannot help but feel for the survivors as a marine's face is melted by Alien blood, or when a train full of commuters are torn to pieces by a Predator who doesn't fully understand what is going on around him?<br/><br/>AVP tries to set up the former factor with Lance Henriksen's character anxious to find the strange artefact under the polar cap before he dies. Unfortunately, where Aliens in particular excelled was that it managed to give every character a third dimension. Here, only Henriksen's character gets such effort. So every act of violence or mayhem is given a feeling of absolutely no consequence. It's almost like a video game.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson is on record as saying that he made the film with every intention of it being screened with the MPAA's R rating. Apparently, Fox, fearing it will alienate children, decided otherwise. Never mind that the audience which kept both franchises in the black are now either in their mid-twenties or middle-aged. Forget creativity or making something that people might enjoy. The lowest common denominator rules here. Those parents who complained when the studio didn't accommodate them because they were too stupid to realize a film based on a video game which is in turn based on Night Of The Living Dead might not be a good babysitter, I hope you are proud of yourselves. Meanwhile, if any studio wants to let Anderson make a film without tying his hands over his audience's eyes, I will gladly pay to see it multiple times. Trust me, you will make more money this way once backlash is accounted for.<br/><br/>AVP also marks the first Anderson film I have seen in which the shaky-cam technique is used. Here, they don't even bother to try and make their excuse that it puts the audience more into the action seem plausible. Every shaky-cam frame might as well have the phrase ""we are shaking this camera to preserve our PG-13 rating"" stamped across it in big, bold letters.<br/><br/>You may have noticed that I haven't said anything about the actual characters yet, apart from mentioning Lance Henriksen by his own name rather than that of the character. There is a reason for this. If a group of film characters became any more generic, they could all be played by the same actor. The Aliens and Predators do not fare any better. Seriously, why on Earth didn't they just base the script upon the first comic book series? These comic books showed more for the audience to get interested in with one issue than this film shows in its entire running length.<br/><br/>The story also shows every conceivable sign of not being thought through. The humans discover an alien temple a couple of thousand feet below the surface of a polar cap. Great, but wouldn't that mean it is basically submerged in the ocean? So when the intrepid humans decide to go and check it out, the Predators oblige them by firing a beam from Earth's orbit into said polar cap, tunneling the thousands of feet needed to find the entrance. I guess the budget cuts at NASA meant that nobody could notice the massive hulking ship above the Earth. I'm also guessing that Alien blood and armour made from Alien parts gives one special powers, such as the ability to stand below a spacecraft as it takes off without being burned by the thrust. Or did they just not see Danny Glover's race to get away from the Predators' ship at the end of Predator 2?<br/><br/>In short, this film insults the fans of both franchises, sci-fi action fans in general, as well as the basic principle of adults being able to watch and hear what they choose to. I strongly urge the viewing, DVD-buying public to give this film the butt, lest more be made in this kindergarten-oriented fashion. Fox, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves."

","Spoilers I thought they way the two series were brought together was about as well as it could have been. Going back in time before the Alien series began was fine with me setting up the Wayland Industry future development of synthetic humans and modeling them after the company's founder as a way to remember him and honor him fits well with his characters fear of not being remembered in the future after he's gone. i hope in future AVP movies the first of the prototypes again brings Lance back to his role again and again.<br/><br/>I've seen comments that the preds were not impressive. I'd say they were as impressive as in any other pred movie. This time, the aliens were much more impressive than in most of the movies. Alien intelligence was well displayed in this movie. The preds continuing to show ""sportsmanship"" in the hunt continues through both pred movies into this one which i think is a great link. Respect for a human who got a kill as well as mercy for the sick (unarmed people in both pred movies as well as a pregnant woman in pred 2) at least until the sick directly attacked the pred himself. I hated to see the first two preds taken out so quickly but the first was in the middle of conflict with the humans and let his guard down and was suspect to a sneak attack from behind. i thought the movie was great. much more interesting than the second pred movie and most of the Alien movies.<br/><br/>OK, one plot hole that i hated was the idea of a 2000 foot thick ice covering when the distance from the top of the ice (whaling village) was only a couple of hundred feet above the surface of the water (early scene looking down from water tower as well as later scene from same location). since it is an island, that means land is at least at the waters edge meaning not only is the pyramid below ice, but well below land as well. that cliff at the water tower should have been 2000 feet tall if the pyramid was that deep under ice but the perspective of the view and the size of the humans in the shot proved it wasn't near that high although the water was amazingly deep to be right next to shore of an island."

","Okay, I'll confess that the only reason I registered at this site is to tell people how bad this movie really is.<br/><br/>AVP is embarrassing, the whole thing gives you the impression of an empty commercial exploitation on the well-known monsters images.<br/><br/>Anyone who comes to this kinda of review sites and gives this movie a 10 out of 10 is either a Fox films employee or related to the film crew somehow. Don't fall for it.<br/><br/>The whole idea of teen Predators hunting Aliens to become ""real warriors"" is idiotic. How can you compare a high tech civilization that is able to travel space to Indians? Okay, maybe It is possible they would have the same kind of ritual, after all why can't highly developed species have their rituals...<br/><br/>I was intrigued about how the first time a Predator blew itself up on top of the Pyramid it did not damage the construction at all.... Of course, the second time that another Predator did that, the whole thing fell apart.<br/><br/>It is laughable the friendship among the hero-chick and the teen Predator. I could almost see them holding hands and running away in the end of the movie. It turns out that the Predator developed feelings for her. I wonder why the Predators first came down from the sky shooting the hell out of the other guys who stayed in the abandoned whailing facility, no questions asked. Still wondering...<br/><br/>I didn't like the ""new"" Alien life cycle. The face-hugger burst out as an alien in 40 seconds. This is truly ridiculous. Anderson did not even take the time to watch the original Alien movie.<br/><br/>On top of that, the cast is composed by a bunch obscure nobodies in shallow roles. Even if they were any good, the lines they received would just have made them look as bad as they did.<br/><br/>As an Alien and Predator fan I felt I was disrespected. If you are too, you will know what I am talking about"
"Manthorpe","1","80","156","31 August 2004"," Complete and utter failure.
","AVP fails on several levels. It completely fails as an addition to both series, and it fails as a film itself. When I heard Anderson was in charge of this project, I knew that it couldn't be good news.and then when the PG-13 rating came along, my fears were multiplied and confirmed. A huge fan of both series, I wanted more than anything to like this film and for it to at least be average. After all, I cannot think of many film ideas that have had more potential. This very well could have been the best action and sci-fi film ever created, only if it had a decent director. I actually gave Anderson a chance, a 10% chance of making an average film, and a 0% chance of making it into what it deserved and had the potential to be. Those who gave him more should be embarrassed. I'm embarrassed that I paid to see it, however, I have a unique way of justifying it. Since I paid for it, the only way I can redeem myself is to rip this excuse for a film apart in this review, which will be long, and tell everyone I know how much this film completely sucks and how the originals and all copies should be burned.<br/><br/>MASSIVE spoilers:<br/><br/>First off, it fails right off for having a weak and unbelievable story, all thanks to the brilliantly moronic Anderson. Full of holes. An ancient pyramid, reminiscent of the Cube, 2000 feet below the ice in Antarctica? Riiiiiight. Predators have hunted humans for years, so let's send some adolescent ones to go after the fiercest species in the universe, and hey, let's only have them do it every 100 years.Riiiight. A chained up Queen Alien that's also been frozen and imprisoned by some wimpy ass Mongoloid Predators that get schooled like little b*tches? Riiiiight. A Predator and a woman make friends and the Predator even makes a shield and spear for her out of an Alien carcass? Oh-f-ing-KAY! I'll stop, but it doesn't take a film professor to see where this is going. They might as well have put an Alien Predator sex scene in it. So much potential and this was what Anderson shat out.<br/><br/>Anyone with even a lick of respect for either franchise can see how utterly stupid this film was even before any production was set forth. It gets even worse. Why in the hell would you claim to be a fan of both franchises and then go against many things we know about both creatures and make yourself look like a fool? Easy, Anderson is a fool. Face-huggers now fall off within minutes of attachment, the gestation period for the chest-bursters is now also a few minutes.and, to top it all off their blood is only sporadically acidic. How's that for consistency? Want more? Why in the hell would Predators set up an entire human civilization to perpetuate their ritual Alien hunts and bring weapons with them that melt when they come in contact with Alien blood? If these things have been hunting Aliens for hundreds of years, you'd think they'd be smarter than that. <br/><br/>And while we're at it, let's change the way the Predators and Aliens look. The Preds in this film look like they have down syndrome with their masks off. The fact that they look like linebackers doesn't help either. The original in 1987 looked infinitely better and more realistic, not like some lumbering oaf in a rubber suit. And just to make them fiercer, as if it were needed, let's make the Aliens so that they can open their mouths as wide as a Muppet, particularly Guy Smiley, can. This is the material we waited 14 years for?! I actually felt sorry for the Predators in this movie, they're just sad. On top of looking like they rode in on the short ship, they get their asses KICKED. Colonial Marines did better against a HIVE of Aliens than the Preds did against a few running around.and these were friggin' Predators!!! I thought the Predators hunted the ALIENS? These Preds were sissies, and were about as stealthy as a rhino giving birth during an electrical storm. Utterly ridiculous. <br/><br/>The cinematography used is entirely out of place. The quick-cut editing used during the fight scenes is some of the worst I've seen to date. You can't see anything that's going on and you might as well not even see the fights at all. That's exactly what I was looking forward to after 14 years, especially in a film with 'Vs.' in the title. While some of this may be possibly attributed to the studio axing it to make it PG-13, the shots that are left are far too close to the action, leading me to believe that this may have not been the studio's fault as some Anderson supporters claim. It's truly confusing and annoying. Straight out of The Blair Witch Project. And let's not forget to throw some Matrix bullet time into a face-hugger sequence, we'd be lost without that. And for a film that is obviously meant to be action-packed, it certainly isn't. Half of its measly runtime is spent setting up this ridiculous scenario. Where is the damn epic showdown?! This was a Versus movie right?<br/><br/>End of 'spoilers'.<br/><br/>And to all of you people defending this film, what in the hell are you thinking? Just because you're a fan of both franchises doesn't mean you have to swallow this and embarrass yourself on these pages. We deserved more. If you are OK with this film and do find it enjoyable, you are completely void of any taste in film. I simply do not understand your mediocrity.<br/><br/>For having more potential than almost any film in the last decade and releasing this stank pickle, I give AVP 1/10. R.I.P. Alien and Predator."
"BrandtSponseller","10","51","97","8 February 2005"," Forget the naysayers, this film kicks butt!
","Series note: It is strongly recommended that viewers watch the Aliens and Predator films prior to watching this film. In order, the Predator films are Predator (1987) and Predator 2 (1990). The Alien films are Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997). While Alien vs. Predator isn't constructed as a chapter in a continuing story, watching the other films first will give you a more thorough grounding in the mythology behind the two series, bringing greater depth to this film.<br/><br/>Set in the early 21st Century (after the two Predator films to date, but before the four Alien films), the Weyland Corporation has discovered a pyramid buried under 2,000 feet of ice in Antarctica. They assemble a team of researchers and explorers to investigate, but when they arrive, they discover a tunnel already dug through the ice--a tunnel that wasn't there just 24 hours before. While exploring they uncover part of the history of the titular Aliens and Predators on the Earth, and may have just walked into the middle of a ""war"".<br/><br/>Despite my best attempts to avoid comments from the peanut gallery prior to finally watching Alien vs. Predator, I had heard a number of negative remarks. I can't for the life of me understand the negative reviews of this film. Often, disparaging remarks arise from the ranks of pimply, purist fan boys living in their parents' basement, who usually resemble the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons. But in this case, I can't even imagine why the purists would not like this film. It's perfectly consistent with the mythologies presented so far in both series, and the mood, pacing, story, cast and so on are also consistent with the other films. I can only imagine that the naysayers had already created their own Alien vs. Predator films in their heads long ago, and when this one didn't match their Cartesian theatrical versions, they blew raspberries. How they'd have low enough IQs to expect other creative minds to match their personal constructions yet still be able to speak and write intelligibly remains a mystery.<br/><br/>In Alien vs. Predator, writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson has managed to create a fascinating extension to the mythos of both creatures' worlds (not to mention human history), while building a bridge between the two story lines, all in a wrapper combining the suspenseful action sequences that both series are known for and the traditionalist horror trappings that are often found in the Alien series. He presents a similar ragtag cast of characters as are found in every film in both series, and in the tradition of the Alien films, gives us a somewhat surprising woman as the smartest, strongest and most resourceful person at hand.<br/><br/>I loved the sets and locations--the beginning of the film was a quickly paced travelogue of exotic locales. The main action takes place not only in Antarctica, but far under the ice is what is essentially a traditional Mummy film setting. It most closely hearkens back to Alien 3, but with a much more conventional Gothic horror atmosphere than Alien 3's industrial dinginess. The sets were beautifully built, shot and lit, with incredible production design down to the smallest details. There are also excellent little nods to films as diverse as the Indiana Jones series (beginning with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)), the Cube (1997) series, and the Stargate (1994) series. Some might be put off by such references, but they are traditional in the arts (not just in film), they're fun for genre fans, and they further deepen and cement an overarching mythos for many different films, all with a degree of pretense that they are set in the real world. If the alternate history presented here were true, then of course there would be similarities to the lock used on AVP's weapons-bearing sarcophagus and Stargate's portals--they stem from the same source, or similar sources).<br/><br/>I loved the creature designs here, and I thought the effects were among the best I've seen. The action sequences were exciting and suspenseful to me, the film was well paced throughout, and the cast was good to excellent (especially Lance Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan). I also loved the ending, with its opening for AVP2. I agree that I would have preferred the film to be a bit longer (I rarely think a film is too long) and I wouldn't have minded more gore, but neither of those facts actually affect the quality of the film in my opinion, they're too much personal preferences in my view to justify subtracting points for them.<br/><br/>If you've enjoyed any of the Alien and Predator films, forget the naysayers, Alien vs. Predator is comparable to the quality of the rest of the series. If you haven't liked most or many of the films in both series, ask yourself why you expected different with this one. If you haven't seen much of either franchise yet, get started!"

","Spoiler I just came back from viewing AVP and I have to say, being an Alien and Predator connoisseur, this was what ""Resurrection"" SHOULD have been. Hopefully Alien 5 will bring this kind of quality to the screen. As for AVP, it was excellent! The story, characters, and special effects were all ""refreshing."" The fact that the story takes place several hundred years before the first Alien brings new light to the storyline and promises new surprises! Weyland Bishop was great but I wish he had not died and stayed with the ""Company"" a little longer, but hopefully he will return as an Android in AVP 2!!! The power and strength of both the Alien and Predator were greatly accentuated in this film and give new meaning to the species.<br/><br/>Please do not underrate this film, the storyline is strong and has great potential. If you have not seen any Alien or Predator films, please watch them first before going to see AVP. Congrats to all and thanks for coming back Bishop! ---0000---TheMan..----..signing off...."
"dcobbimdb","10","9","13","13 August 2004"," Awesome movie! Worth the wait
","I loved this movie! I just got out from the midnight showing on the 12th and i have to say that this thing was awesome! I've heard a lot of bad hype stirring before the movie was released, but I'm hear to tell you it was great! I got everything I was hoping for. Looking back I can see how they could get away with it being PG13 and still not rob you of anything. Quite simply it isn't as bad to show aliens / predators getting stabbed, cut, etc and green / acid blood vs humans. In other words the things that happen in the movie, had they happen to a person, would make it R rating. They were very smart about filming the people dying as to avoid the R rating. So believe me there's some decent gore. A director's cut might also be good, but there was certainly nothing lacking in this movie from that standpoint.<br/><br/>The movie flow was great, kind of built up until things started to explode. Also, certainly gives you a new found respect for the aliens, the predators too, but you could really see the strategic intelligence of the aliens as they are obviously natural born hunters too. Watch out for that tail! The acting was good enough and I wasn't displeased with the performances of any of the actors, alien or human. I did like the story line and how the sequence of events that led up to a bad situation for the humans and the predators, giving a starting advantage to the aliens. I'd love to talk about specifics, but I don't want to give anything away. The running time was somewhere around 100+ minutes. Also, I loved the very end.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report there was very little CGI or at least noticeable CGI in the movie at all. The aliens and the predators looked very real / believable and moved very well too. Hats off to the creature creators and special effects folks. The fight sequences were great too. What I liked best is that unlike movies involving Human fight scenes where its show off time, the aliens / predators don't mess around and simply go for the kill. The fight scenes are pretty quick, but awesome!<br/><br/>Only complaints I have (and they're only few minor ones). It took 20-30 minutes to build up and it could have been little longer overall, but in saying that the movie delivered enough. If anything it left you with that feeling of wanting more, which is usually a sign of a good movie, and in this case it is too. They didn't explain how the predators or aliens could keep warm in the cold as they kind of bypass the whole temperature concept for both the aliens / predators, no biggie. I'm still at a loss as to how Bishop fits in and the whole timeline concept connecting the various Bishops, or if it's the same guy, great great grandfather, who knows. Didn't matter too much and the movie could have survived with out him as he wasn't really a key player, just a familiar face. The sound effects were great, but there was no real theme song or lack of a good one. So there's no tune or song you can hum that would remind you of the movie. Again these are very weak complaints.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 9.5 out of 10. There's very little I could think of to improve it to a 10, but the complaints are listed above. I'm glad I saw it opening night and will likely see it again in the theaters. Definitely one I'm going to buy when it hits DVD."
"kgb383","6","51","99","27 January 2005"," A decent action movie marred by an overly critical fan base, an irresponsible studio and director, and a broad shadow cast by its predecesors.
","Okay, so this isn't Alien or Predator. Did any of you really think it would be? Seriously, now. Let's get some perspective here. There will never be another Alien, or Aliens, or even Predator. What a lot of your die-hard fans fail to recognize is that this movie CAN'T be those films.<br/><br/>If they made it like Alien, namely much suspense and very little alien, we would have people balking at how it copies Alien or how you never see the aliens. If they made it like Predator or Aliens, namely with a lot of heavily armed guys blasting creatures down right and left, we would get people complaining and comparing it to those movies.<br/><br/>AvP is a movie that can never be as good as the films that came before it, for many reasons. First, and most obviously, it has some mighty big shoes to fill. It would be quite difficult to make a new Alien/Predator movie that could hold its own against the films that have come before, let alone one-up them in any meaningful way.<br/><br/>It also has an overbearing fan base that was way, WAAAAAY too demanding, a studio that is more concerned with raking in dollars than making sure they have a good and faithful movie, and a director that prefers to blame everyone but himself for his own mistakes.<br/><br/>Beyond all that, however, one must recognize the general malaise that weighs heavily on the Alien franchise. The bitter truth is that with each new Alien sequel that comes out, it becomes increasingly difficult for writers and directors to make new and exciting Alien movies. I mean, how many times can you see a face hugger scurry across the floor after a guy, or an Alien drone creep out of the darkness, or a queen rise 20 feet over some hapless victim? After 5 films, this is all old hat.<br/><br/>I give credit to AvP for at least maintaining the entertainment value of these Alien standards with some very well done special effects. Who cares if it's CGI? For all those who were so angry at AvP's CGI, you need a dose of reality. There is never going to be a non-CGI Alien or Predator movie again. Period. CGI is here to stay. Deal with it. At least they took the time to make AvP's CGI as authentic as they could.<br/><br/>Truth be told, AvP is a decent movie. It isn't the best Alien or Predator movie, and it isn't the worst. Beyond all the fake history and the screaming human victims, there were enough entertaining moments between the Preds and Aliens to prove that there is potential here for a great movie franchise.<br/><br/>All they need is for Fox to leave the film-making to the filmmakers, an extra 30 minutes, and an R rating........<br/><br/>.......and Bill Paxton.<br/><br/>;-)"
"biznizzman","1","49","99","8 July 2006"," IMDb Bottom 100 : #1
","Okay the real rank may not reflect on the actual IMDb database but this is without doubt one of the worst and most unpopular movies ever produced. Paul Anderson takes a royal dump on the faces of all fans of both the Alien and Predator franchises. Although one cannot say that everybody's a fan of the franchise, one simply cannot deny that Alien,Aliens and Predator were some of the best movies ever made and also commercially successful. Now how would it be if Pokemon had an episode with Aliens and Predators? Probably better than this movie.<br/><br/>How would it feel if your company once promised you a new computer, you waited for 20 years and finally got a 486DX266? The situation is similar. People forced themselves to think that AvP may possibly end up being a good movie despite being written and directed by a complete retard who could'nt direct if the existence of humanity depended on it. When they actually forced themselves to see the movie, if not out of curiosity, but out of sheer loyalty to the franchises only to get a feeling of being urinated on, they did'nt know what to say.<br/><br/>So how bad could it be you ask? Far far worse than anyone or you could possibly imagine. A bunch of F grade actors set off to Antartica after a technically fact and logic devoid discovery of an ancient pyramid under a whaling station in the Antartic. The first reference to the Predator is one of the F-grade actors referring to the full moon as the hunters moon - Ooooooooooooh scary! As if you did'nt know what happens eventually? They go into the Pyramid and get trapped.<br/><br/>Then the Preds come, the Aliens hatch, chestburst in 5 minutes, kill preds and humans, forcing one Pred to have a romantic scene with the lead idiot actress, blowing up all aliens, summoning the CGI Alien queen, throwing the Queen into the water and ending 1.5 hrs of the worst movie ever made. There. Now you don't have to see this movie and I've saved you. If the plot was'nt bad enough, the Aliens and Predators act like total loser, pathetic lowlife stray dogs which could'nt defend themselves for nuts.<br/><br/>I suggest that one read all the negative reviews on this site about AvP, have a good laugh and never ever see this abomination of a movie made by the world's crappiet and most untalented director. They should get quentin Tarantino to do a new Alien or Pred movie and undo the damage done, if thats even possible."
"bloodraven944","1","37","73","30 June 2006"," My vision...
","Well, I saw this movie for the first time today. I know, its been out for two years. Well, I heard all the bad press, and I didn't want to ruin two of my favorite franchises with one simple movie. But, I was bored, and decided that today, will be my day.<br/><br/>So, I watched it. Wow. I hate that I waited so long to see this movie. I put it off for two years, I should have seen it in the cinema.<br/><br/>Imagine hearing that someone was going to cut the skin off of your face. Now, imagine that you could have had it done right as soon as you heard about it, or you where given the choice to put it off for a couple years. Now, imagine waiting that two years, knowing that it's going to happen. Every day you just get one step closer to the worst pain you have ever felt in your life. Then the day comes, and as it is happening, all you can think to yourself is you should have gotten it done the day you found out, instead of waiting. Cause the pain is so much worse now.<br/><br/>That is exactly the way this movie was for me. EXACTLY the way it was. Well, maybe not exactly. This was actually worse than that! The plot had so many holes in it, I thought it was that pair of socks you have that you wear everyday, and have worn them since 1994, because they are you're lucky socks. Sure, they smell a little, and there isn't much cloth yet, but I can't just throw them away! Not only was the plot terrible, lets talk about acting, because apparently, they did not discuss it before casting anyone for this debacle! Cookie cutter lines muttered by people who's names you don't even know until they are about to die, and someone just screams their name saying ""God no! Please don't die! I've known you for five whole minutes! PLEASE GOD WHY! WHY TAKE....uhmm...Jonathon? FROM ME!!!! WHY!!!!!!!!!!"" And lastly, let's get down to the real subject matter. Aliens fighting predators. Seriously, how do you screw that up? You could have the two picking their noses and it would work. They could hold battle raps and it would be an entertaining fight (GROWL!!! SNARL SNARL SNARL!!! GURGLE GURLGE!!! YO MOMMAS A HOE!).<br/><br/>THERE ARE TWO FIGHTS IN THIS MOVIE!!! TWO!!! What? How do you get two fights in a movie that has a runtime of one hour and forty minutes? Wait, that is including the 12 minutes of credits, isn't it....yeah it is. Okay, one hour, twenty-eight minutes. TWO FIGHTS?!?!?!? And those weren't even that entertaining. Seriously, I told my friend to give me five minutes, and I bet I could come up with a plot outline that makes more sense and is a million times more entertaining. It took me all of thirty seconds to have an entire plot line written, and here it is for your pleasure: <br/><br/>Alien Vs Predator (the none sucky version) <br/><br/>Movie opens with a predator fighting an alien.<br/><br/>Then, more aliens come, and the fight starts to get real intense.<br/><br/>Then more predators come, and the fight gets insane.<br/><br/>This fight lasts for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>Predators win. The End.<br/><br/>Role credits.<br/><br/>BAM! See, you KNOW that is more entertaining. Now, Paul Anderson has made one really good movie, and two movies that were okay. Yes, he is a step above Uwe Boll...but still. How do you take the awesomeness that this movie could have been, and make a crap-fest of it all? Yes, crap-fest was the best I could come up with. The thesaurus didn't have anything under crap fest...except flapdoodle....which I considered for a bit.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie sucks more than any sucking thing has ever sucked. I give it 1 star."
"christian123","4","41","83","12 March 2005"," Some cool scenes but mostly a disappointment
","Alien Vs. Predator has some cool scenes and some other entertaining moments but mostly the film is a disappointment. The fast-breeding creatures from the Aliens films take on the headhunting space colonizers from Predator in a battle for the earth, leaving a poor team of Antarctic archaeologist's and the rest of us lowly humans trapped in the middle. The plot does sound like it has potential and if it was rated R it could have been a lot better. The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting. The death scenes are lame as you can't even see what's going on. Most of the action scenes are boring and that's a problem since that's one of the main reasons why a person may watch this film. The acting is terrible but its normal for this type of film. The most notable person in this film you might recognize is Sanaa Lathan but she of course doesn't add much to the film. The rest of the actors are of course bad and you have a better chance of laughing then being scared. The film is predictable because you know where its going and who's going to survive. The dialog is bad and funny but in a bad way, which is always a bad thing. Yet even with all this negativity I didn't completely hate it. Some of the action scenes were cool and its a pretty movie to look at, especially the creature special effects. Paul Anderson shouldn't be blamed as Fox wanted to edit the movie and make it earn more money. The films running time of 102 minutes feels a lot longer though. Rating 5/10 I had some fun watching this but this film is for hardcore fans only and even they will probably hate it."

","Having seen this movie trashed for the last couple of years I never made an effort to watch it. I finally stumbled across it last night. And it's nowhere near as bad as I expected.<br/><br/>I agree the humans were the weakest link. The Alien franchise gave us Sigourny Weaver. Predator 1&2 had Arnold, Jesse, etc.. plus Danny Glover. AVP presents us with 5ft Sanaa Lathan as our 'hero', whose two biggest battles include holding a pointy stick and cowering under a water tower. Note to Fox: heroes should be heroic.<br/><br/>While there were too few battles between the title characters when we did have them they were satisfying. I especially enjoyed how the 'lead' Predator took out a face hugger and an adult with a 'just a day at the office' demeanor. Of course that begs the question, if he was so slick with those too how did the second face hugger get to him from that distance? But I guess it was required for a possible sequel.<br/><br/>I think one major chance missed was the flashback battle royal. If only someone would have realized that it would have been much better to start the movie with a team already on site and translating the tablets and tell the entire story as a flashback like Titanic did. It would have saved the need to blow up canon to get to the action. And would have provided a smoother sequel preview by having the team discussing the 'legend' while the camera then tracks down several layers to a face hugger hatchery with Predator technology coming online for the ending.<br/><br/>Overall, sure it could have been better. But it could have been a historical suck-fest, ala Alien3, too."

To say that the franchises were healthy...well I'd take that with a grain of salt, again just my opinion.<br/><br/>The they did seem to follow the classic sci-fi horror formula in some regards with AVP but I still liked it. For the record I don't like any of the directors previous films."

","What an awful film, I saw this cheap low budget pile of Markytson crap in a sleazy hotel that just happened to have room service. At first I thought I was insane and then I saw that this was an actual move. Holy crap! I mean, crapping in your pants and then eating dish-water and throw up is better than this movie, it seriously gives Alien and Predator bad names. Oh, and who wins??? Let us see... (the following has been voted by the stink-bag country America, thank god I'm in France!!) HERE WE GO!<br/><br/>Predator: Gay-fighting, Jamican guy with dreadlocks and a silver mask, the shirt he is wearing shows his nipples and he has claws that slash people to DEATH. Sorry, but Arnold was too busy misguiding California to help with this movie. Lance Henrikson, an acting legend, co-stars opposite in this film and guess what? He gets his throat slit. >_< Damn, I hate it when they do that. Trivia: Lance was in Aliens (an actual GOOD movie by James Cameron) and Alien 3 (a bit of a fail, though) He eventually wins because it turns out he was a ""good"" guy helping (WTF?!) the humans?...(Then an alien bursts out of his chest and he DIES) <br/><br/>Alien: One of my favourite movies is ALIEN, and ALIENS and ALIEN 3, I like Pieere's ALIEN 4 but it was not as good as the first three films. They made the aliens here pretty bad-ass, more bad-ass then normal. It really sucked to see the Predator win because I was rooting for the Aliens. The Alien-queen is blown up, even though she's already been blown up FOUR F-CKING TIMES!!!! Well, the aliens do some nice killings but the gore is way cheesy. <br/><br/>Overall: A HORRIBLE movie, bad bad bad. The tagline should have been: WHOEVER WINS, FOX GETS RICHER"

","i know it's a little late to be commenting on this film but i am compelled to say that this is the most morally depraved, reprehensible film i have seen in a long time. i have no issues with the production values or fx, but this film suggests that we should be siding with a PREDATOR that enslaves other species, sets themselves up as gods, requires sacrifice, and ""hunts"" with honour. this film makes Jason and Freddie seem like regular folks. at least with them there is no pretense of honourable conduct. i pity the actors in this film, some of whom are classically trained and have done some good works in the past. children and people with the minds of children are going to be watching this film, readily available for rent and purchase anywhere. so it's OK to enslave other species for our entertainment, expect sacrifices, set yourself up as gods, and kill as a rite of passage or sport or culture. i didn't notice any predator eating their prey but they did take trophies. i sided with the ALIENS in this pathetic film. as dangerous as they were, they were victims. their queen was chained up and frozen. they were expatriated against their will. it reminds me of what some people do around here, shooting, albeit less dangerous animals inside enclosures where they have almost no hope of escaping. anybody who watched and enjoyed this film certainly aren't people i want to befriend. i voted this film as the worst of 2004 at the razzies. it didn't win, but it certainly did with me. this film should have an 18+ rating. Klingons have honour. these predators are like the worst of mankind. the only thing superior about these creatures was their technology. shame on the director, shame on the writers, and shame on the producers of this pathetic excuse for a movie, clearly showing that technological development doesn't necessarily coincide with any moral development. an offensive piece of garbage all around."
"frich71-1","10","13","23","7 January 2008"," I just re-watched this movie
","and I'm giving it a 10 because I hated AVPr so much more.<br/><br/>Let us speak the truth. AVP is not an earth shattering sci-fi epic. I personally find the whole idea of AVP asinine but if your going to do it do it good. In defense of Anderson, who has received so much crap from turd-brained gamers and AVP comic lovers, HE TRIED. He tried to come up with a concept that put the two alien species together and have a human element as well. The film is actually pretty slick. But that is its major problem, it is too slick. There is no attention to detail, no love shone by the director for any of the characters, ALEXA being the sole exception, but there was so much going on that ALEXA remains unsympathetic. I don't doubt the makers of AVPr love the characters but love ain't enough when making a movie. You have to be able to tell whether the script is decent. You have to be able to cast and direct appropriate actors. You have to be able to stage a scene. They are visual f/x guys but the f/x in AVPr are decent at best so even what they are supposed to be good at, they SUCK at.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was the pred hybrid hatchling. That is taking a stupid concept and dumbing it down even more.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I give the Director a solid B. The script I give a C-/D+. The acting I give a solid A (Sanaa Lathan did what she could with the part, but I thought the casting was great for what the movie was--the peripheral characters played their parts well--save for Colin Salmon, I just can't stand that guy (love it when he gets shredded by the grid laser in Res. Evil.) I really like Tommy Flanagan, this wasn't his best character but I think he must have owed someone a favor to take the part. And Ewen Bremner is just a great supporting actor. I hope no one tries to make him a lead and ruin him like they did Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>All in all I'd really give this movie a 6 but AVPr was so dreadfully wrong in so many ways that the 10 is to poke those little twits who gave AVPr a 10 and seriously think it is a better movie than this one.<br/><br/>The script for AVP sucks but it tries to follow a path from start to finish. AVPr starts wrong, goes in fifty directions which are all wrong, then ends as bad on down note as well. Same for the direction. Anderson got paid well I'm sure but he didn't have the love for the Alien or the Predator necessary to treat the characters as they were established in their earlier films. Other than that though Anderson actually knows how to stage and shoot a scene while the Brothers Dumbass do not. Anderson chose to go with cgi for the f/x while the Brothers Dip and Shite opted for rubber suits and dark lighting. But at least the cgi meetings between the A and the P were visible and viewable. In other words AVP was a professionally done movie (save the script) whereas AVPr was amateur hour from top to bottom."
"sharpefamily-1","1","20","39","17 May 2006"," AVP fans avert your eyes
","Paul WS Anderson has made a major achievement. He has made a film worse than ""Alien Resurrection"". AVP is a film for which I can think of a few people want Anderson shot for creating this rubbish. He tries to create tension by building up slowly but unlike Aliens where this worked , it just bores me stiff. He makes two massive mistakes with the film. Firstly the gore is gone in Great Britain this is the first ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" film not to be an 18, this shows as there is nothing worth even flinching at in the film.The second is that the film tampers with alien biology it actualty hurts. The only two major changes in almost twenty years were the addition of ridges on their heads in ""Aliens"" and the eggs being able to squirm in ""Alien Ressurrection"" Every other Aliens has the time between Alien embryo going in and chestburster coming out to be a day or so. Anderson turns this into mere minutes a shocking drop that makes me annoyed as a fan of the francise. I don't encourage illegal free downloads but that is the only way the purchace of this movie is a good price,a pathetic director at his most pathetic."

","... that was all that I could think of most of the time. What an awful film! Bad bad bad script: We don't get what we paid for - or we get to much! For instance: Why does everything has to take place in a pyramid under the ice? Okay, I swallow that one. But why does this thing has to move like ""The Cube""? Just to get a reference to another film of the director? The answer of somebody who liked the film was: ""Where else?"". And all the characters that the viewer might identify with? They all die a silly unnecessary death - but not unless they pump a little flat character into the fodder - ""I got children."". More character is not necessary... It is such a bad script, it screams. <br/><br/>Okay, bad script - enough of that. But what is it, that I - the paying fan - wants to see? The fight!!! I want to see the fight of the ultimate biological weapon and the ultimate hunter! But no such thing. Two Predators are killed in less than half a minute. Aliens are killed by the dozen. Listen, I don't want to see the kill, I want to see a glorious fight.<br/><br/>When there is a fight the camera is whirling like it was tied to a mustang with barb wire on his genitals. Thus, I - the humble viewer - make no sense of the whole she-bang. <br/><br/>I got to admit, a few nice references to the old alien movies (gets a point for that). But the silent terror, the feeling of claustrophobia and of fear is replaced by a video-clip mixture of mediocrity and below.<br/><br/>I wasted money and time. I wish I could get both of it back..."
"casperenkelaar","9","5","7","7 October 2012"," It is not as bad as people say it is!
","Alien vs Predator. I think the movie itself wasn't as bad as some people say it was. The arguments of scientific flaws are not reasons to hate a movie. You like or dislike the movie because of a plot and a good set. You have to belief that the set is not a set and that it is really there and you have to belief that what is happening could maybe happen in the real world. Most people disliked the movie because they say it wasn't as good as the alien-franchise. Personnaly I think the movie was great, the actors acted very good and the creatures looked realistic. The pyramid is a nice add for both creatures. The aliens where in almost every movie in a human designed environment with a lot of machines and metal. The pyramid is completely new and extremely well made. It looks realistic and not unbelievable. The plot that the predators capture and freeze an alien queen to make the ultimate prey is in my opinion a very good plot. It is a very wide thought and fits in the idea of the predators wanting to be the ultimate hunters. The thing that gets me the most is that the aliens are in fact smarter then the predators know. They where able to free the queen and escape. Some people think that if Ripley says that if the aliens would get to earth they would destroy the human race, why haven't they done it already because they are on earth for thousands of years. The fact is that if the 3 predators fail to kill and stop the aliens the elder predators would stop them, this can be concluded by the fact that when the predator and Alexa kill the queen, an entire space ship is watching them. They wanted to test the predator but they had everything under control! I am not speaking of alien vs predator 2 because nothing good is to say about that. I think that the bad reviews are based on fans of the alien-franchise that don't want an other perspective to their favorite movie( I am a big fan of the franchise so don't get me wrong). Of course some things are not as good as they could have been, the movie had not so much budget as they wanted to have, they had to somethings let things away simply because they couldn't afford it. The flaws about things that aren't correct aren't as bad as some people make them. This might come as a shock to you but even the alien and predator movies had these flaws, the difference is that you liked that movie because it was something new so you didn't mind. I think the movie is not getting all the credit it is worth. The movie was overall very beautiful to watch so I definitely suggest you watch it even when some people say it ruins the whole alien and predator franchise, don't listen to them, watch it and make up your own mind!"

","***WARNING, SPOILERS PRESENT!*** Quite frankly, I thought that AVP was pretty damn good when compared to the other continuing movies from both Aliens and Predator. Aliens (thats the second one) and the first Predator were my favorites out of those two, and they both followed the background story lines pretty close. I personally liked how they added that split-second visual of Bishops knife-stabbing thing with his hands within the first quarter of the movie. I watched that movie with a bunch of friends who were also Aliens/Predator fans, and for some reason, they didn't catch that. Also, one of the very few things I am not sure if I liked or disliked is the ending with the Predalien. It kind of makes you think that they'll have another one of them, but somehow I think it'll be thrown away just like how they didn't have a second Godzilla, what with the egg that was still left inside Madison Square Gardens to hatch and all.

"ghoulieguru","4","15","29","10 July 2005"," AVP (Anderson's Very Predictable)
","Paul Anderson makes movies that start off incredibly well. Every time I see a Paul W. S. Anderson movie, I watch the first twenty minutes and think ""Hey, this might actually be good!"" He raises expectations, gets you excited, pulls out all of his best tricks... and then somewhere around 30 minutes in, it turns to garbage. If you think about it, all of his movies from Event Horizon to Resident Evil suffer from this malady. AVP is no exception.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, I watched an incredibly stylized alien-like silhouette turn into a satellite. And then it cut to a high tech lab, and then out to the desert, and then out to some glacier. As Paul Anderson assembled his team of protagonists, the movie had a distinct ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or ""Jurassic Park"" vibe. In fact, now that I think about it, it had all the trappings of a Spielberg movie. The cherry on top of the sundae was when the wealthy tycoon Weyland, who was organizing the search party, turned out to be the actor who played ""Bishop"" in Aliens. I was on for the ride. I gripped my popcorn, I buckled in. I thought Paul Anderson had finally come into his own as a filmmaker... and he couldn't have picked a better time. Here was the unification of two of my favorite Science Fiction/Horror characters. If ever Paul Anderson was going to step up and be a real director, the time was now. I smiled, I squeezed my date's hand. This was gonna be great...<br/><br/>And then, it started to suck. Gradually at first, almost as if Anderson was thinking that if he just gave us a great opening we might forget about the fact that the rest of the movie was terrible. I figured things were going badly when the heroes enter a pyramid that they've found thousands (millions?) of feet beneath an arctic whaling station. Hokey, yes... but I'm still buying it. And then, our heroes venture inside this ancient edifice and are trapped inside the pyramid because they decided to take some Predator guns. You'd think these people never saw Raiders of the Lost Ark. I kept waiting for someone to bust out a bull whip. The only thing that was missing was the flying darts and the big boulder.<br/><br/>At this point in the movie, I got a really vivid mental picture of Paul Anderson standing in his living room, with DVD copies of Alien, Predator, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Cube laid out on the floor, and he's standing there taking a leak on all of them and laughing maniacally. I'm not kidding. That image flashed through my head.<br/><br/>Anyway, so when I finally shook myself out of it, there were people that were getting attacked by face-huggers that were bullet-timed a la the Matrix (and every other action movie since). I mentally added The Matrix to the DVDs on Paul's floor, covered with urine. These same people give birth to aliens a mere five minutes later. Suddenly the gestation period for aliens shortened by like three days. I think that might have made me angrier than anything. I just wanted to drive to Paul Anderson's house in the middle of the night, grab him and say, ""There are rules to think about here, Paul. Not a lot of them, but you do need to respect the movies that came before. I understand that it makes your job a little tougher because you want to tell a story about an alien, and you need to have it bust out of somebody's chest pretty early in the story... but you're getting paid a lot of money to figure out a clever way of making it work.""<br/><br/>But even so, I kept watching. I had come this far, I needed to see the title bout. I watched clunky Predators with ridiculous dreadlocks fight with equally clumsy Aliens. All I could think was, ""Gee, I bet it's hot inside those suits."" You could practically smell the latex. Still, there are some fun moments, so I keep watching.<br/><br/>And then the protagonist becomes best friends with a Predator and they go off to hunt Aliens together like Butch and Sundance. All of this comes at great expense as you are forced to watch our heroine playing a goofy game of charades with the Predator. When Predators start acting, you know you're in trouble.The end fight scene with the Alien Queen Mum is pretty good. I actually started to enjoy myself again in the last ten minutes of the movie. And then I remembered that I felt the same way about Resident Evil. That last shot with Milla in the city was great. It made me rethink my P.W.S. Anderson theory. Maybe he makes movies that begin and end really well, and then fills them with processed meat. If I ever choose to see another one of his movies, I'm going to walk out after twenty minutes, go get something to eat, and then come back for the last ten and see how I feel about it."

","I'm a bit of an Alien fan. I really enjoyed Ridley Scott's original film and his two official prequels (Prometheus and Covenant). While I haven't had a chance to watch or finish watching the other Alien films or Predator films, I think they are good films to watch if you enjoy really good horror and action.<br/><br/>I also figured, at the time, that an Alien vs. Predator movie wouldn't have done well. Also, factor in the fact that these films are no longer considered canon and I wasn't too interested in watching it.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I decided to watch it anyway and I enjoyed it. It's nowhere near as iconic as Ridley Scott's original nightmare in space, and fans of Prometheus will notice a lot of similarities. I thought it wasn't a half bad film. It was mostly a rehash of Resident Evil (which was ironically appropriate, since both AVP and the original Resident Evil are directed by Paul W.S. Anderson) with the Pyramid being similar to the Hive installation from Resident Evil.<br/><br/>Also, I recommend you watch the Unrated version, as it is a little more complete than the theatrical cut. Plus, more gore since it isn't PG-13."

For what it is (a crossover between two previous sagas, mixed with classic techno-ancient-pyramid adventure, all the ingredients for a low quality Asylum-type sub-product) it is imaginative, well realized, with rhythm and good action. The only big problem I see with this movie is that everyone knows the modus operandi of the two legendary alien species, so no surprises here. We all know what will happen, how the guys will die and how the aliens will behave. But, if this movie were made in a parallel world without the classic Alien and Predator movie, it would be a revered classic. Maybe I am biased because I enjoyed that old AvP videogame and comic. But, you know, I really liked this movie. Simply do not take it too seriously. Some people complains about the dialogues and I cannot deny there are some idiotic decisions (nothing compared with the infamous Prometheus, though). Anyway, they are a bunch of people trying to escape from aliens, so, what do you expect? conversations about ancient Greek philosophy? Just enjoy the ride and badassness of the Predators."
"liodavix","7","2","2","18 September 2019"," Six Aliens versus Three Predators
","A movie that could have been much more than it was.<br/><br/>The truth is that Paul Anderson did nothing wrong and achieved a pretty attractive film at the visual level.<br/><br/>The strong point of the film is that it is very light, it does not insist on telling us a heavy and convoluted story, but it gives us a small but interesting introduction about the arrival of predators to the earth, to get us fully into the great clash between the two creatures, in a brutal extermination fight.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite decent, although sometimes you notice too much computer effects in the movements of the aliens, but they are minor defects. The best without a doubt, are the sequences of the queen of the aliens, spectacular and full of tension.<br/><br/>
The actors are correct, the protagonist, Sanaa Lathan, is a beautiful woman and brings seriousness and character. From Lance Henriksen I can say, he is a crack and one of my favorite actors, whether his role is good or not, his presence is always appreciated.<br/><br/>The only problem of the film is that it lacks more ambition, since the only epicenter of the whole feature film is to see the desired confrontation between both species but this only occurs between three predators, of which two die quickly, and I think, too easily, and a few aliens, it is clear that it should have been something much more epic, with hordes and more hordes of aliens and predators destroying each other mercilessly. Here the truth is that everything is somewhat bland.<br/><br/>Anderson's address is correct and his work is not bad but I think that was not enough. Anderson is a less versatile director in commercial films but does not possess the genius and imagination of James Cameron or the psychological depth and sense of suspense of Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>In short, Alien vs. Predator is a well-made film at the visual level, with an effective but not masterful direction of Anderson, a story that should have been polished somewhat more but that works equally and a cast that although does not shine is the least solvent.<br/><br/>A film with some interesting ideas and sequences, but that remained rather in something failed despite being undoubtedly entertaining."

"The-Sarkologist","6","2","2","19 November 2018"," An Entertaining Gimic
","This is another one of those movies that for quite a while I was hoping that they would make. I guess, like a lot of people, it all goes back to that scene at the end of Predator II where Danny Glover sees an alien skull in the Predator's trophy room. Since that this literature, and computer games, had spawn exploring the concept, and finally a movie appeared taking the story to the new level.
So, what did I think of it? Well, it certainly met my expectations, though I would hardly consider it to be a movie that I would consider to be one of the all time greats. Sure, it is pretty gimicy, but I still believe it works, and it works well, and it does a pretty good job of merging the two films into a single universe. I have noticed though that there was been some suggestion that maybe the producers have decided to ignore this films and recreate the universes as separate universes, but the thing is that I actually still like the concept, and with the disappointment that the next two Aliens movies produced, I, like many fans, simply work to continue the idea of a shared universe.
Well, the film starts off with the discovery of a pyramid deep in the ice in the Antarctic, so a group decides to go and check it out. Well, from this start you can see where it is heading, and it is basically taking the same route as the countless of other Alien movies before hand - that is dump a group of people into a remote area, and then leash a horde of aliens onto them. Well, most films seem to only have one alien wandering around, though when you end up arming the protagonists, then having a swarm of them is probably better. Well, this film goes one better, and they throw in not only one, but three, predators into the mix.
So, the film basically runs as you would expect it to run, though we should remember that not only do with have Aliens, but we also have Predators, which means that both of them are having to deal with the pesky humans. Of course, as we can expect, there is a pretty high body count, and a very limited number of survivors. Of course, I'm not necessarily going to let you know who survives, but you can probably easily work that out anyway. As for the film, well, I liked it, it's quite fun, though I'd hardly say that it is a classic."

Although there weren't a lot of fights with AVP. There was probably like only 3 short fights. The first fight was actually not that bad;they actually made the fight with a good run time and a good battle. The second fight was actually not even a fight,it was more of just a gun war. For the third fight,I was actually expecting it to be a lot longer,because it was a queen alien and they only gave her an estimated 3 minutes. Although,it wasn't a bad 3 minutes. What I saw from this,it was a pretty good action movie when the aliens and predators were killing the humans,but with each other,it was completely rushed through. So if they ever plan to make another sequel,let's just hope you get a director that loves to make the type of movies that represent friend or foe.Like Freddy vs Jason.Although it wasn't the greatest movie ever,it was still better than the sequel."

","As usual, whether they are the ""die-hard fans"" of the ilk that must try to validate every detail (or themselves) or the couch critics who feel that ""critic"" means they have to be negative, the typical mass repetition of negative comments overshadows all the good in a HIGHLY ENTERTAINING FILM. Contrary to so many other reviews, the casting, acting, special effects, and even most of the story are quite good. Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen are excellent in their characters. Both Predator films were excellent.<br/><br/>In the Alien series, the top film was clearly James Cameron's Aliens. The first film, while original, was, in my view, flawed by so much filming in dim light as well as some of the deleted scenes which would have added to the film. Unlike Aliens, it also suffered from the fact that you don't really find much to care about in most of the characters, who are just self-absorbed, crude workers, on board for a paycheck. Alien 3 managed to create another film with nearly a whole cast of characters for which you can generate little sympathy or interest. The 4th film, the worst, takes this to a new height--I wanted to kill most of them!<br/><br/>In AvP, despite the criticism for lack of fighting, the fight scenes are very good, and there is plenty of action within the well-paced film. Seeing the Predator weapons against the Aliens' natural defensive and offensive attributes, was well written and filmed with great effects. From the many tributes and ties to the earlier films in both series, to the makeup effects, behavior, and ""purity"" of both creatures' intensity of purpose, this was a true resurrection of Aliens and a great next installment for Predators. Considering the abysmal concept and execution of the sequel, and the almost as horrible ""Predators"", I can understand why there was an attempt to ""restart"" the Alien series with Prometheus. Unfortunately, they started this series with almost everyone being as loathsome as those in Alien Resurrection--even the humanoid. Hopefully the sequel to that film will be as good as Aliens.<br/><br/>As an example of my point, Star Trek II the Wrath of Kahn is considered one of the best movies in the series despite the many idiotic an inexplicable choices in props, wardrobe, and other areas (e.g., 4-beamed hand phasers, WWII sized communicators with giant red lights, enough material in their button-up uniforms to wear in the Arctic), but you look past these flaws and ENJOY THE FILM. Ricardo Montalban didn't ""over-act""--he played the character to the hilt!<br/><br/>Watch the AvP movie. Have fun. And let the whiners concentrate on minutia and their inability to appreciate the actors and artists that created a great film. With all the horrible ""remakes"" and sequels that have been made, when a good one comes along (the latest ""The Thing"" for example-and Mary Elizabeth Winstead provided another great erformance)--try watching a film first or at least taking the negative early reviews with a grain of salt. Happy movie watching!"

","AVP: Alien Vs. Predator Surprisingly Good! 3/4 stars <br/><br/>Never had any interest in seeing this upon it's initial theatrical release as i had already saw another monster vs monster movie and thought it sucked...Freddy Vs. Jason so with that god awful movie in mind i had little and no interest in seeing yet another of my two favourite film franchises once again merge and do battle. Bored out of my mind last night flicking through the channels on my satellite i started watching the cut up movie that AMC had to offer on their Kevin Smith hosted Fear Fest (for those that do not know about what this is ...AMC usually air nothing but horror films on the weeks surrounding Halloween) Anyhoo...saw that a Predator marathon of sorts was showing along with Predator 1-2 AVP was on next so i'm it's not like i was doing anything anyhow...sigh...might as well have a look. Well i was surprised none the less on how quickly i got gripped by this movie (it helped a lot that Lance Henriksen co-starred) Although straying from both of the stories that these monsters who were yet to do battle originally came from in their individual franchises, what we get is a pretty impressive new storyline that has the Predators using an anciently buried pyramid in Antartica underneath the ice shelves. It seems many many years ago the Predators, who all the fans like myself know are hunters used to flock to this ancient site to do battle with the aliens that were grown there and those that did were considered amongst themselves to be the ultimate in warriors.<br/><br/>Now after the pyramid was once again re-discovered as a heat blip on a map by a team of researchers who decide to start an expedition and set up camp to start drilling only once arriving to the mapped out site find that someone/thing has already made a massive tunnel down to the pyramid itself, a hole that ceased to exist not 24 hrs ago according to their maps and calculations. Of coarse our band of scientists have to scale down the already made opening and once touching down at the pyramid itself quickly find out that they are not alone down there.<br/><br/>Great battle sequences between the two. I also found director Paul Anderson's vision of what the Predators uniform and battle helmets looked like as a much needed change form the equipment used in both Predator 1-2. Also we get to learn more and see the crab like creatures that pop out of the eggs that the queen lays, you know the ones that attach themselves to whatever crew member they find, faces and where something slides down the unwilling person's mouth laying an egg in it's stomach that grows quite rapidly, then comes crashing out of it's chosen human's chest? Well we see more of that creature's parts as well. Being a fan of both of these franchises like i had previously said...this was needless to say a cool side piece to have along with them. I enjoyed it and am going to now watch AVP Requiem as i have not seen that either."
"movieguy1021","3","24","51","15 August 2004"," Alien vs. Predator: 3/10
","I suppose Hollywood will never run out of movies, especially horror movies. Not only can they make endless sequels (there's been 10 Friday the 13ths?), but they can also have the characters fight each other in new movies (such as Freddy vs. Jason). That's the case with Alien vs. Predator, two characters that are both owned by 20th Century Fox who couldn't meet in real life but meet in an underground pyramid underneath Antarctica. Add into the mix a half dozen random characters played by people no one has ever heard of (save Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen), as you guess the order in which they'll die. Sounds like a fun time, eh? Uh, yeah, if you're a masochist.<br/><br/>A group of supposedly experienced adventurers (we see a few of them in various exciting activities in the beginning) travel down to Antarctica to see the aforementioned pyramid that is just found 2,000 feet underground. It turns out that both the aliens from the Alien series and the Predators from the Predator series fight each other. The humans are caught in the midst, as they try to escape. Stupidity ensues.<br/><br/>The whole plot is convoluted and stupid. These characters (who we don't care about at all) don't really do much for half of the runtime as we see glimpses of the title characters, when they attack for no reason at all. Then, halfway through, it turns out that some alien hieroglyphics (that humans can read quickly) are found in the pyramid and tell the complete history of the creature that created the pyramid (and more). It's quite possibly the stupidest thing I've ever seen...EVER! And then one of the creatures help the humans destroy the other...aargh. It's just so absurd that it crosses the ""it's so bad it's good"" line to ""it's so bad it's bad."" All of this is the fault of writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (who is credited in three SEPARATE credits, in a row, in the ending credits). His script is generic Hollywood bullplop, the kind you can get for a dime a dozen by any writer waiting tables in Hollywood. The directing is strictly PG-13 and MTV-quick cuts and cut aways as soon as a character's about to die, destroying what people liked about the Alien and Predator movies. By keeping it PG-13, it can get more people into the audience, but it takes out the language and the gore that the fans of the respective series liked so much about those movies.<br/><br/>All of this could be overlooked if it did its job: thrilled, or even entertained. Alien vs. Predator did neither. The only part that could be considered thrilling is the music, which could be found anywhere. And the most entertaining part of the movie is when I found myself laughing at how stupid the whole thing is. The action's incomprehensible because everything's the exact same color, and most of it's computer generated, which makes it basically uninteresting. Going back to Anderson's script, there's at least three or four elements stolen from other movies. There's a complete quote stolen from True Romance, a scene stolen from The One, the whole concept of the pyramid stolen from Cube...the list goes on and on. Something this unoriginal can't be exciting anyway. And it isn't. The whole movie's not worth it. Even if Alien and Predator movies are your six favorite movies of all time, don't see Alien vs. Predator.<br/><br/>My rating: 3/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence, language, horror images, slime and gore."
"disturbed_tigger","10","15","30","23 September 2005"," An intriguing, intelligent way for Aliens and Predators to battle.
","I loved AVP!This was one of the most imaginative films in the last decade! I had no idea of how Paul Anderson was going to be able to tie the two species together, but he did a great job! Also the fact that there was no romance/sex scene was a refreshing twist.This film is about a research party lead by Charles Bishop Weiland going to Anarctica to investigate a new heat source 2,000 feet under the ice. This is where the Predators from ancient times kept the Aliens for the ultimate coming of age hunt. Every hundred years the Predators would return and use their human worshipers as sacrifices to begin the hunt, ingenious. The characters were well written, without spending too much time on any one. The sets were stupendous, isolated and haunting. The Predators' weapons were new and improved without being laughable.I've been waiting for this flick for 14 years and was not disappointed. I ran out and bought the DVD as soon as it hit the shelves. Thank you for the comic art on the bonuses. Overall I give this movie a 10 out of 10."
"Tom16uk","8","8","14","27 May 2005"," Ignore the 'naysayers', this is a good film!
","Lots and lots of people are giving this film bad reviews for many reasons. What they fail to understand is... 1. The directing is superb 2. The CGI is surprisingly very realistic 3. The atmosphere and settings are great<br/><br/>Its true, this is a good. Finally after years of waiting, I cant say i'm disappointed, its a great face-off movie that truly shows what the Aliens and predators are like when there battling. What struck me first about this movie was the excellent CGI. In normal circumstances, were used to seeing poor effects in films these days, but the effects in this film are ultra realistic, and had to be used to make scenes where the Aliens and Predators get flung through walls!<br/><br/>The dark and dull setting of the Aztec Pryamid is great and builds up tension and suspense well, combined with the good directing that reveals where the Aliens are lurking around. I have to say though, its the Aliens that really make this movie. The props are make them look as though there real, and the close camera shots of its acid-dripping mouth are cleverly done, and taken from this first Alien film, as many other little scenes have been taken from Predator and Alien films. The lack of blood and gore is a straight notice as well - I guess the reason being because of the movie people wanted to keep the age limit down (tut tut), and this is a problem you have noticed with Terminator 3, a 12? What were they thinking? A 12 year old won't have seen the previous Terminator films!<br/><br/>The way the characters combine with the Aliens and Predators is great. I have to say though, it was strange at first to see (spoiler) Sanna being helped by the Predator later in the film, and it even makes you feel sorry for the Predator (uh oh) when it dies at the end. the film length was also a bit odd. The extended version, available on the basic DVD is just 1 hour 26 minutes long, so how long the normal version is I would worry about..<br/><br/>But with these niggles aside, its good entertainment - less blood and gore as in the films Predator and Aliens admittedly, but you don't need that to make a good film like this, which is what many people have failed to pick up. I would say watch it if you've seen the Alien and Predator saga's, and you'll be entertained."

","I do not care what the critics have said. This film is worth watching. I have been waiting for this film all summer, and have to say it was worth it.<br/><br/>I just wish a bit more gore and violence could have been added like the original Alien and Predator movies. Lets hope that on DVD release, the visuals will be beefed up for us viewers that grew up with these 2 franchise. Go see it, that is all I can say. I have seen the reviews and this film has been completely slammed. Well, I enjoyed the directors previous work. Resident Evil, Soldier, Mortal Kombat and Event Horizon. He has some pedigree and even though these films did not meet the critics approval, they met with the approval of the public, and to be quite honest, that is all that counts. Go watch this film as it deserves a sequel. If you thought Freddy V Jason was worth it! You ain't seen nothing yet!"
"CasterPawler","4","10","19","14 April 2006"," Where's the Alien vs. Predator part?
","As we all know, Alien is one of the greatest Sci-Fi/Horror films ever to make it to the big screen, if not THE greatest. Its sequel, Aliens, turns the original classic into a roller- coaster ride that has became a classic in itself. Also a masterpiece, Predator has won a special place in my heart for the ingenuity of its antagonist, the Predator. In the sequel, you see the skulls of all sorts of other alien species the Predator has hunted, one of which happens to be the Alien. You're confronted with a wonderful idea: What if a movie was made involving the Predators hunting the Aliens? What an amazing idea! There's no way you could screw it up! Naturally, Hollywood found a way to screw it up.<br/><br/>It begins with a group of annoying people collected from all around the world. They have all answered a call by Bishop? The android? Anyhow, Bishop has discovered a pyramid located deep underground in Antarctica, and he wants a team to drill down to it oh, crap, where have I heard this before?<br/><br/>Fortunately for us, the Predators have been watching the movie from space, and they'd rather go for a little swim in the Aliens' acid-blood than sit through an Armageddon remake. To spare the entire world the torture, they fire a beam from space and make a hole leading right to the pyramid. See, they're not such bad guys after all!<br/><br/>Ah, crap. We go back to that stupid expedition team. They're exploring the pyramid and debating what civilization built it. It's half an hour into the movie. I check the DVD box. Hmm Alien. Predator. Vs. Maybe they labeled it wrong? This is looking suspiciously like National Treasure.<br/><br/>Uh-oh! They have disturbed the pyramid and the Predators are going in after them!  maybe this is Predator 3? The pyramid shifts and the Alien eggs appear. Finally, a little Alien! But where are the Predators fighting them? Maybe the title should be ""Alien & Predator vs. Humans"", or perhaps ""Movie vs. Patience?""<br/><br/>Well, about ¾ of the way through, what remains of the expedition team (thankfully, only three) are running away from the Predator. One gets killed, and then the remaining two manage to escape when an Alien tackles the Predator. Whooo! Alien vs. Predator! Finally, it's over. Well, that didn't last very long.<br/><br/>After a few scenes which don't really matter, the female lead makes friends with the Predator. Wow, didn't see that coming. She kills the Alien rather than the Predator killing it. They go on to find the nest and reenact the ending of Aliens. The Predator dies, and a group of more Predators go on to reenact the ending of Predator 2. The end!"

","Two scary aliens, two fierce looking creatures, myths of the great cinema extended by Cameron and Scott are now destroyed, converted into forth-going idiots with no logic that fight with no reason.

The cast, a tribute to shortage of budget.<br/><br/>Its not even recommended to see it even to have fun. You won't. There is no actual entrance to see the movie as good. Its pale, frigid, boring, a carnival of fights between big monsters that tear their guts and slash green jelly like blood out of each other. Its not even worth it, Im trying to warn the reader of this critic to avoid this film at all costs! Or if you already saw it, to accompany him/her with their grief."
"lkgraves","6","6","10","17 August 2005"," What went wrong?
","I must preface my comments by first saying that on a purely visceral level, I did like Alien vs Predator. Alexa held her own very well. So well in fact that I would like to see her again. It was a real thrill seeing the predators and the aliens get it on. It was also cool to see humans totally out of their league on a battle field of dueling behemoths. True underdogs. For any of them to survive was a real triumph, yet I totally bought the rationale behind Alexa's survival.<br/><br/>Now for the criticisms: What went wrong? The predators have been going through this Right-of-passage training ritual for thousands of years. They built many labyrinthian pyramids, presumably getting better at it as time went on. So again, what went wrong? They are obviously aware of the current stage of human technological development because they lured us their with heat blooms to attract our satellites. Did they think we went there to ritually sacrifice our selves. If so, why did they kill everyone in the whaling station? Why was it so surprising that the team found their way to the predators canons? There were no obstacles. If we can build a satellite we just might be able to read hieroglyphs and figure out their sarcophagus calender lock which was based on our own planet's cycles. The predators boomerang charikons and their spears were made of metal impervious to the alien's acid blood (unlike their wrist bayonets that instantly melt on contact). Why wasn't the mother alien shackled with that stuff? And if the conveyor belt is designed to take her eggs to the sacrificial chamber, how did all of those other eggs get into the aliens incubation room. How was the pyramid designed to stop this? The poor design of the pyramid is inconsistent with the technological sophistication that built their ultra quiet ship with ultra refined controls. One last thing. The mother speared the predator through it's back and out of its chest with her tail and kills it. The tag scene has the predator/alien larvae burst out of the dead predator's chest. Why break out when the mother conveniently supplied a ready made birth canal? And more curiously, why was the alien larvae not killed when mom speared the host through the chest? And even more curiously, why did she kill the last predator. Alien 3 established that they do not kill impregnated hosts. Or was it because in Alien 3 the larvae was a mother alien? Which means that they will kill their young, but that is contrary to their previous behavior, except in Alien Resurrection (which I hated, so I will not go any further with that). Or should I just ignore this fact because very few people like Alien 3. Personally, I liked a lot about that one also."

","When I first heard this film was about to be released I was excited, I thought at last we are going to see a truly worthy Vs Movie unlike that ultimate pile of steaming cow dung that is Freddy Vs crappy Jason. How wrong I was!! Not only does this movie suck but it manages to rape and pillage all my happy memories of the awesome first Predator movies and the first two Alien movies, its as if the director said ""hmmmm, an excellent story of two great baddies, let me think of 10 possible ways that I could take a huge dump on this franchise"" the 10 ways we shall get to later on.<br/><br/>So anyway back to me watching the film, I decided to queue up patiently waiting for my ticket, eventually after getting the ticket I found that not only was I cramped in the theatre but I was wedged between two enormously obese geeks that hadn't showered in more the 2 years and could not help taking about how awesome it would be to blow the predator... Yet this was nothing compared to the pain I was about to endure, they soon became a distant memory and from the onset and the premise of this film making the predators gods I knew this was going to possible be the worst day in my life... no wait, make that the history of mankind. It has no continuity what so ever with the either Aliens films or the predator films, the predators are toothless and the aliens seem to wonder about aimlessly looking stupid, where the hell where the marines anyway I mean don't you think mankind can be represented a bit better then some geriatrics and losers stuck in the middle of the Antarctic armed with pea shooters.<br/><br/>Here are the 10 reasons why this film sucked 10. Aliens are on earth, the whole idea of the aliens movies was to stop them spreading to earth! 9. The predators establish them selves as gods, enslave the people and have them prepared for sacrifice, yet I'm supposed to swallow that these are the good guys after all.<br/><br/>8. The films tries to establish that aliens created civilisations... News flash morons its old news get over it! 7. The predators look like a bad WWE superstar with a one-line gimmick 6. Use of the line (variation of) ""one ugly motherfu*ker"" I mean how many damn times already, only Arnie can do this 5. Shifting pyramid, erm hello primitive civilisation... now you geeks (presumably the ones in theatre) ""are saying its predator technology"" really, great way to ensure that humans never find out about the aliens under the Antarctic and what a way to ensure no body knows you was on earth in modern times by establishing technology beyond even our standards today.. Morons and lets no forget cryogenics and the furnace that seems to burn like forever I hate you! 4. W. S Anderson Period.<br/><br/>Now the top 3 reasons this sucked so hard it gave me a haemorrhoid 3. She ran around in a t-shirt in freezing temperatures.<br/><br/>2. It seemed as if the predator would bone her any second 1. I checked the timing of this too can you can too, the first predator died and the one to follow exactly 3 mins and 24 secs later... yes I subjected myself to that s*it heap merely for that stat Don't watch this film unless you 13 and clueless, I did and now I'm writing this to you from the comfort of my cell that has white padded walls.<br/><br/>Burning your eyes out with Sulphuric Acid is less painful than this"

You need to think about the movie to realize it's good points. The good points of this movie are. Great special effects, awesome environment, and (the reason we all came to see this movie) The aliens and the predators duking it out. The alien and predators designs weren't that bad either. The weapons stayed the same as well besides a modification in the razor disc. I had been anticipating this movie ever since the jaguar game came out. And i was pretty happy with the results myself.

I found the character's middle name of ""Bishop"" particularly amusing, since that was his character's name in both the second and third Alien movies with Sigorney Weaver. Puns and amusements aside, this film does not disappoint. Lance gives another great performance in his role as the rich, dying man who has spent his life pursuing wealth and now wants to leave a legacy beyond money. Sanaa Lathan delivers a powerful role that is both believable and heroic, without being over the top. Colin Salmon (of the James Bond film Die Another Day) is exceptional as Weyland's assistant and representative. The film moves quickly and the actors are often overshadowed by the creatures as they fight to survive. Violence and gore make this one a no-no for the preteens, but the 14 and up crowd have seen as much gore on their X-Box or PS2, so they should be okay.

","Antartica, and an expedition is about to uncover a battleground for Aliens and Predators.<br/><br/>Whoever wins, we lose! So ran the tag line for Paul W. S. Anderson's prequel (?) to two fanatically worshipped franchises. Little was Anderson to know that it was the majority of cinema goers who would feel that they had ""lost"" their cash on coming out after watching this miss-matched effort. Though in truth nobody could seriously have expected a film to rival the best of both serials (Alien, Aliens & Predator), it's still right that us fans should expect the formula to be respectfully adhered too. We want character build up, we expect a group dynamic to function, and we definitely want the baddies to stay just that, as baddies.<br/><br/>It's not a total loss, though, even as Anderson all too quickly hurtles towards his ""humans caught in a cube like puzzle box"" blood bath, there is just enough back story and anticipation to tickle the tongue. In fact, when it all goes pear shaped and Xenomorphs, Pred-Rastas and humans are all lined up for slotting, it's damn near exciting stuff. While the pyramid/cube/maze design is pretty awesome. However, then the plus points are vanquished as the film quickly becomes kiddie friendly as gloop gives way to strawberry jelly, featuring a turn of events with our ""heroine"" that's so clumsy I'd be surprised if Anderson sleeps at night.<br/><br/>Still, it's obvious that Anderson loves both franchises and he in no way would have wanted to make a stinker. But he has made a very average movie, one that's got two things in its favour. One being that is the neat middle section, the other that it's not half as bad as the messy hack job that was AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem in 2007. 5/10"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","5","8","30 April 2006"," Whoever watchesthey lose (spoilers)
","I never thought a film would come along that would be so bad it would make Alien: Resurrection look like a masterpiece. But Paul W.S. Anderson has succeeded in performing that dark miracle, for Aliens Vs. Predator (or AVP for short) is a complete stinker.<br/><br/>You know the film is in trouble about two minutes in. There's a scene where Alexa, the main character, is climbing an icefall. Her phone rings and she actually answers it. Then when she gets to the top, and while she's still talking, she sees the person on the other end of the line standing right before her next to a helicopter. However, in the establishing shot only a few seconds earlier there was no helicopter in sight. How the hell did it get there without her hearing it? Very stupid.<br/><br/>Just as stupid is another's character's ridiculous intelligence. There's an Italian archaeologist who's been hired by Bishop to look at this pyramid that's been found under the ice. No sooner has he been shown a poor computer model than he's proclaiming the style is a mixture of various ancient cultures and that this pyramid therefore must be the first pyramid ever made. He's quick. And he's just as quick in the pyramid itself. He reads hieroglyphics like's he's reading the daily newspaper, he knows the meaning of each room that's contained in the pyramid (""this is the sacrificial chamber"", he says after being in the room for about a second) and he even understands the building's inner workings. This last bit leads to another moment of absurdity. The archaeologist proclaims that the Aztecs used the metric system, therefore the moving parts of the pyramid must change every ten minutes. Since when did the metric system have anything to do with time? And since when did the Aztecs use minutes? Did they wear wristwatches? <br/><br/>But one of the worst scenes is when the archaeologist and Alexa get stuck in a room. Again the archaeologist reads the hieroglyphics like he's thumbing the daily paper and spins a yarn about the Predators teaching man how to build temples and create a civilisation. You see, Rastafarian aliens taught us everything we know. Kill me.<br/><br/>But for sheer stupidity there's one moment that trumps everything else. A character is in the sacrificial chamber and he drops a glow stick down into the room below. Then later we see Alexa and a couple of other people wander into this room. She looks at her GPS watch and proclaims that this room must be directly below the sacrificial chamberwith the glow stick just a couple of feet ahead of her! Cocking Christ almighty.<br/><br/>Just as annoying as all this, though, is Anderson's fanboy attempts to doff his dunce's cap at the previous Alien and Predator films. 'Look, it's Lance Henriksen! Listen, one of the characters says, ""You are one ugly mother"" See, I made a satellite look like an Alien Queen. Oh, how I respect the heritage of these fine franchises.' Too bad he couldn't provide the film with a decent script, memorable characters or exciting action.<br/><br/>And I guess it's the action that hammers the final nail into the film's coffin. After all, it could have been at least tolerable if the action had been half-decent. Instead it's total crap. Take the fights between the Predators and the Aliens. They're more homoerotic than the naked fight between Oliver Reed and Alan Bates in Women in Love. Of course you don't get to see any floppy bits flapping about, but you do get to see an injured Alien flick it's tail and lots of acid into the face of a Predator in a very camp manner (I can imagine Anderson patting himself on the back at how innovative he is). And there's another hilarious bit when an Alien is injured on the floor. It reminded me of a scene in The Simpsons where Homer is negotiating with Mr Burns to get the dental plan back. When Homer wins he lies down on the floor and walks circles on his side. The Alien in this film does the exact same thing. Stupid Alien.<br/><br/>But even the penguins in this film overact. There's a scene where Ewen Bremmer gets spooked in an abandoned whaling outpost. Of course, we get the standard 'BOO, there's someone behind you moment' and then when Spud insists that there's something else in the room with them, a penguin waddles out. It's more of an old ham than the Alien.<br/><br/>And I feel sorry for Ewan Bremmer. He gets to play some bland sap that keeps going on about his kids. Of course he dies, which is the only good thing he does. But the other characters are dull, too. Alexa, in particular, is a waste of space. I can imagine that Anderson thought he was shattering genre conventions by making the hero a black woman, but he completely forgot to add colour to her character (and everyone else for that matter).<br/><br/>Almost as frustrating as this is the fact that we don't even get the pleasure of seeing these people die horribly; Anderson keeps violence at arms length  he cuts away from every screen death. And also, because his crap story requires it, people give birth to Aliens in about half an hour rather than the hours or days it used to take. Oh, and now facehuggers jump in bullet-time. Wait a second while I weep And on top of that, the main Predator in this film has an incredibly goofy face. Somehow make-up has got worse over the last twenty years or so. But what made me laugh/cry the most was the final shot: dead Predator gives birth to Predi-Alien. As if the hunchback yellow turd Newborn Alien in Alien: Resurrection wasn't bad enough"

The fact that the story takes place several hundred years before the first Alien brings new light to the storyline and promises new surprises! Weyland Bishop was great but I wish he had not died and stayed with the ""Company"" a little longer, but hopefully he will return as an Android in AVP 2!!!

The plot even slightly resembles the AVP comic that came out in the 1990s (for those few of you who actually read it). All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. It does have its problems, but if you are a fan of the series you should at least get a little bit of joy out of it (it may not be as good as the original Alien or Predator, but it DEFINITELY beats Alien Resurrection). Plus, the more people that see AVP and the more money it makes, the more Fox is ACTUALLY going to consider making a Predator 3, Alien V, and/or AVP2. w00t."

The studios' controversial decision to release this as PG-13 as opposed to R (since all of the other films from both series were rated R) translates into hardly any gore, lousy editing, and virtually incoherent fight sequences.

","I'm still scratching my head as to why folks didn't like this movie. It's got a great story, good cast, top-notch special effects and the action and fight scenes between the two infamous creatures is thrilling. It's definitely one you want to sit down with your kids and a pizza and enjoy it for what it is...a great sci-fi action flick, that will not make your top 5 of favorites of all time, but is definitely worth an evening in front of the tube. There are some unrealistic scenes, but we're talking about a movie where humans are unwittingly trapped between two alien species battling in a gillion year old pyramid under the Artic Ice Caps....were you expecting Lord of the Rings or Schindler's List? 
Anyway, this is one of the best examples of why you should ignore the whiners that thought this movie strayed too far off the original story of the aliens, or the critics that panned it for, well, whatever the so-called expert critics panned it for. The story does nothing to change the whole story of either species in the previous movies and is actually quite original. Sanaa Latham does good in the pragmatic and brave 'Ripley role' this time. Lance is great as a sick billionaire that can't wait to get down there and discover something that will change the history of humanity before he dies with cancer and Italian star Raoul Bova is great as another scientist that the team is glad that they brought along for the adventure. 
Watch the Director's Cut as it shows some more stuff that explains things a little better, about what happened to the first unfortunate souls that got caught in the crossfire of the two species."
"BrickNash","8","3","4","4 February 2018"," Good, solid action sci-fi.
","It's so easy to jump on a bandwagon when your a sheep, and that's exactly what happened to this movie. AvP is a solid action sci-fi film, and there' just no getting away from that. <br/><br/>To start with, it looks great! Director Paul W.S. Anderson (the man who gave us the ONLY good video game film ever in Mortal Kombat) has a remarkable eye for visuals, and here is no exception. It's a pretty film with decent CGI and some really stunning set design.<br/><br/>The story is interesting as well, and to address the elephant in the room, yes the first third of this film is pretty much Identical to the start of Prometheus, only AvP got there first by nearly a decade. When things kick off the action is fantastic and it's just a well made and fun film all round, plus it's GREAT to see Lance Herikson back, and he does afar better job as a Weyland than Guy Pearce.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. It's not as good as any of the first three Alien films not is it as good as the first two Predator films. There's a real lack of character development and most people there are just meat sacks waiting to be killed. Some questionable representation of the gestation cycle of the Aliens is on show here and having the lead teaming up with a predator was just a bad idea. Another fault is that, even though the action is fantastic there's just not enough of it.<br/><br/>Still, these minor quibbles aside I found AvP to be a great and fun action sci-fi film, with plenty of thrills, spills and monster madness. Infinitely better than the atrocious sequel which followed.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the sheep. Something being ""not as good as..."" doesn't automatically = ""Bad""."

","I love IMDb and think it provides an invaluable service, a time capsule if you will, of popular opinion. Every now and then however the review page has less to do with the quality of the film and oh so much more to do with human nature. And specifically the way we like to kid ourselves. AVP is a great example. Superficially, this film should not have worked. Superficially this yet another in a long line of cheap exploitative ""high concept"" sequels - Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, Jason meets Freddy, etc. But here is the kicker. This film was superbly done. From the opening sequence in Antarctic where something is discovered under the ice (how creepy is THAT?) to the scene where the giant ""breeder"" alien gets loose, to the clever mini-climax where heroine Sanaa Lathan gets props from her new Predator buddy -- these are the hallmarks of an entertaining film, and an effective film. But before we break out the champagne, let's pay attention to the elephant in the room -- the overall IMDb rating may be on par with a Bugs Bunny cartoon (and a bad one, at that) but there at last count something like 1500 IMDb members who have taken the time to punch the keys and weigh in with personal reviews. Not to belabour the obvious, but when you have 1500 people looking to opine on a film, whatever you may think of that film, it is anything but mediocre. Think about it..."

","Alien vs. Predator: 5/10: Aliens check; Predators check; Space Marines; umm Space Marines? Okay who took out the Space Marines and put in this fodder. <br/><br/>Some surprise moments and some thrills but not nearly enough and AVP is over way to fast. Everything is speeded up and suspense is simply zero. Both the entire series of Alien movies and the first Predator film depended upon moments of silence to build up the suspense. (Nothing really happens at all of the first hour of Alien for example.) <br/><br/>This movie on the other hand moves so much like a video game you will be reaching for the controller. The Predators look okay but the Aliens are too cartoonish and seem to change size at random. <br/><br/>The plot and the back-story are simply inept. What is wrong with an alien Queen in the New York subway system or Predators fighting in Iraq? Heck putting them in an office block, cruise ship or shopping mall at Christmas would be preferable. (The Predators take out the Orange Julius while the Alien Queen makes her nest in Victoria Secret.) <br/><br/>The fun of aliens on earth is watching them walk into a Seven-Eleven and taking out some customers not fighting in a silly pyramid that could be on any planet in the universe."
"Aaron1375","6","7","13","16 August 2004"," The Predator comes off as a bit wimpy in this one.
","All in all it was an okay movie, but it should have been much better.  It had its moments, but all in all it needed something more.  Mainly, it needed more alien vs predator and a lot less unknown gal and gang of merceneries running around pyramid.  This movie also makes the predator seem kind of wimpy...I came to this movie mainly to see them cause they have not been featured in a film since 1990, and they have only appeared in two films. They should also be able to take down an alien one on one if you can kill an alien with simple bullets as was seen in many of the alien movies.  Here though the aliens can take multiple stab wounds through the chest and body and still fight.  We are supposed to believe that the predators hunt these things as a right of passage, but if they were this tough I don't think any of them would have survived.  Still though it has some good action and there is one rather nice fight between the two combatants.  Still, this movie should have been better...I mean ""Freddy vs Jason"" was better than this one, at least in their fight you could see what was going on all the time.  Here sometimes you just couldn't tell.  This one was fairly predictable too as you knew something was going to happen when the predator and lady were standing over the ice and you knew what it was going to be.  A plus though for this movie is that I can not believe it got a pg-13 rating.  It is a very hard one at that and you can tell it was edited down so there probably will be an R version on dvd.  Not that I am going to get it, it was an okay time killer and better than the last movie I saw at the theater, but it should have been a better movie."
"pgray2","10","9","18","13 August 2004"," Good (for the most part)
","*SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>I was very pleased with the movie up to the part where Lex 'teams' up with the last surviving Predator. Done right, the teaming up could have been very well done, but they screwed it up pretty royally. What I didn't like was how the Predator cut up the remains of one of the dead Aliens making its spike into a spear for Lex and its head into a shield which I thought was pretty corny and retarded. The other problem I had with the teaming up was when the Predator and Lex were shown running side by side. This is bullsh*t. Realistically the Predator would have been needing to carry Lex or drag her in order for her to keep up with him. Aside from this again the movie went smoothly and without a problem (for me anyway) up until the part where Lex and the Predator are on the mountain together after escaping the pyramid and the screenshots make it out like they are going to kiss or something. That could and SHOULD have been done completely different. It's like the director/storywriter had his story set up to work well (and it could have) and then either goofed it up or half/assed it or both in these certain areas that I complain about.<br/><br/>Other than these complaints, the Predators and the Aliens were done very well, and all of the actors did a good job being serious. There could have been more storyline. I think the movie should have been another 30 minutes with additional suspense and lead-in with character development but for 1 hour and 40 minutes it wasn't as bad as it could've been.<br/><br/>For $7 I'm not upset that I saw it in the theatre, and I'll probably pick it up, but I gave it a 7/10 on IMDb where I gave Predator and Predator 2 a 10/10 as both of those movies were master pieces in my opinion."
"dunmore_ego","4","6","11","2 September 2005"," AVP: Audience Versus Padding
","The question is not whether an ""Alien"" can overcome a ""Predator"" (ignorant semantics, as the two non-human species in this film are both ""aliens"" AND ""predators""); the real battle is pitting the movie's Audience against its interminable Padding scenes. Can  we  survive? With my leg bloodied from the onslaught and a gaping wound in my side, I struggled out the theater exit, leaving two friends gurgling in the seventh row  hey, I'm no jar-head  I make no empty promises to ""leave no one behind"" If the subterranean walking scenes didn't finish them off, the inane talking scenes did.<br/><br/>Padding: 2. Audience: 1.<br/><br/>This Alien/Predator movie is akin to the nippled Batsuit  a franchise gone too far. It fulfills its purpose of keeping 14-year-olds off the street and thereby less likely to shoot up a school or get your daughter pregnant, which is small respite; all we can hope for  until the next over-breasted Lara Croft video game release or somnolent Harry Potter movie. But as adult entertainment  and let's face it: present-day adults, not kids, are the demographic weaned on the Alien and Predator movies  it is diversionary, but not involving; good but not great, glittering but no prize.<br/><br/>Both ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" were *sui generis* movies, the former spawning an adequate-bordering-on-lame sequel (Danny Glover in lieu of Arnold?!), whilst the latter, through canny screen writing and an uncompromising lead heroine, spawned three above-average sequels. Now, like the ""Highlander"" franchise, the mythos of *both* creations has been sullied to the level of soap opera and with the Marketeers wielding their pimp-witted power, no longer will any successive ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" movies exude the mystery or excitement of their progenitors, but rather, bombastic, overblown CGI and gratuitously-tweaked explosions for the action-figure teenboy market.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone movie  forget it! This movie's existence is predicated on our cognizance of the last 25 years of these iconic monsters. Without that foreknowledge the very existence of these creatures and their interaction will appear contrived. The plot seems cobbled together from drafts made by 14-year-olds playing with their action figures (much like George Lucas writes his plots): an ancient pyramid is the initiation ground for young Predators, who achieve ""Predator-hood"" by killing Aliens, which are kept captive in the labyrinthine pyramid by the elder Predators for just this purpose. At first, this seems mildly plausible, but then you realize that this exordium is shoving square storyline into round plot holes and demystifying not one, but TWO rapacious extra-terrestrial cultures into common Philo Beddoe barroom brawlers. Casting one's senses back to those heady days of the original movies, we remember that our enjoyment was piqued precisely because their antagonists WERE inexplicable; they were *truly* ""alien""; i.e. too much exposition makes for mundanity.<br/><br/>Except for Lance Henriksen (renowned B-movie ""That Guy""), all human characters were instantly forgettable, except for a guy whose cultured locution could easily get him mistaken for a black James Bond and the young female expedition leader, a la Black Ripley; in essence, humans are this movie's McGuffin, for any agent could have unearthed the battle-pyramid and a text crawl could have explained the back-story of the Alien-Predator symbiosis. Only reason we meet humans at all in this film is so that we may invest a modicum of attention in this tale which, literally, has nothing to do with our species.<br/><br/>Henriksen's role is anomalous: his character is familiar with Aliens (from ""Alien3""), yet when confronted by one, instead of becoming Mr. Corporation (as would be his character's wont), he burbles incoherently with the rest of the B-Actors. Then when confronted by a Predator, instead of dollar signs cha-chinging in his eyes at the discovery of yet another alien species, he goes Rambo on it and gets, subsequently, dead. But let me leave this trite conundrum to the fan-boys to clarify.<br/><br/>Terming one species Alien and one Predator is a point of irritating contention for me; these terms only exist in OUR viewer-reality, for in the movie, the creatures are only superficially identified as ""serpents"" (Aliens) and ""hunters"" (Predators). The substitute terms are a dead giveaway: hunters are ""noble""; serpents, well do we need to extemporize on a well-trodden metaphor? From the outset, we are led a merry road by the film-makers to perceive the Predators as ""the good guys"". No surprise, for in being prejudicially human, we are prone to siding with the more anthropoid of the two aliens, and ironically, the Predators assume the Arnold role in this movie - the musclebound ""heroes"", as it were. The movie rationalizes, sensibly, that the Predators only try to kill our human B-actors to re-acquire what was theirs in the first place  their weapons. Which puts paid to the movie's tag-line, ""Whoever wins  we lose."" Well, not exactly, for the Predators are portrayed as ""good guy"" sentinels keeping the roistering Aliens at bay So only if the PREDATORS lose, we lose.<br/><br/>Thusly, battle scenes ensue  with the predictably close-cut action and blurred whiz-banging - but the fights are only adequately directed and rather short, and it is just too incongruous viewing these two iconic monsters on screen together. Something just don't click. Either this would be a good Alien movie (for the Aliens are animated excellently, combining live puppetry with CGI) or a good Predator movie (the rugged masculinity of those 7-foot behemoths was enough super-cruel to power a small township), but - as Offspring advised  ""you gotta keep 'em separated."" <br/><br/>And for the record, the ""AVP"" acronym is so IGNINTLY ""skoolyard-bitchin"" that it REEKS of Marketeers grappling with the long-dead spirits of their nerd youth in pathetically trying to ramp up the street-cool of this geek-square movie.<br/><br/>Give up your day jobs, fellas.<br/><br/>Now gimme that spear  after witnessing those man-tastic pecs on the Predators, I'm going in - I've got two friends to save in the seventh row"

Once they enter it, they discover a race of aliens are inhabiting it, and that another alien speciesthe predatorsare using this temple as a hunting grounds for the aliens. And the humans are caught right in the middle Alright, I'll be honest. AVP is by no means perfect. There are many flaws/plot holes, a lack or gore and scares, and the CG is awful. But seriously, this is a HUGE improvement over the jaw-droppingly stupid ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"", Paul Anderson's previous film. Starting with what works here: The actors, especially Lance Henriksen, one of my favorite actors, all did a fine job. There was no actor who gave a wooden or bland performance, unlike ""Apocalypse"" which had it's fair share of awful acting. The creature effects, courtesy of Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr., who were also responsible for the creatures in 1990's ""Tremors"", were quite impressive. The aliens had very lively, fluid movement, and the predator make-up was top-notch. The pacing was brisk but never too fast, and the film has a satisfying (albeit predictable) twist ending. Thankfully, all the things I hated about the Resident Evil filmsthe bullet time shots, loud rock music, unbelievably stupid plot twists, lets-make-the-story-up-as-we-go-along writing and lack of credible performanceswere all absent from this film. There are many problems, yessuch as glaring plot holes you could march a parade through, and an obvious ignorance fore the time-line of the ""Alien"" trilogy (If the REAL Bishop is seen at the end of Alien 3, which is set hundreds of years in the future, how can he be in this film, which is set in 2004?!?!?), not to mention the occasional moments of over-the-top action (Such as our Heroin's escape from a HUGE explosion with the help of one of the predators), and the alien queen, once she shows up to do battle at the end, is one truly awful CG creation, especially the shots of it runningthose were B-A-D! There is also, as I said above, a disappointing lack of gore, though there is a lot of alien goop splashing everywhere, which is always fun.<br/><br/>Through all these flaws, though, I managed to enjoy AVP more than I had expected to. Give it a chance and you might like it. By no stretch of the imagination is this a great film, but it isn't all bad, either.<br/><br/>5.5/10."

Anderson doesn't show it on-screen that the predator actually does get the alien inside it, but smart screenplay unleashes the suspense when the last shot of the movie shows the alien bursting out of the predator.. which i thought was quite clever to WOW the viewers and create the perfect plot for the sequel!!<br/><br/>i'm a BIG fan of both movies, and was very happy with Andersons presentation of both creatures in the one movie, the story, the sound, action and overall feel was great. The creatures themselves were great, they looked much more powerful than in predator or the alien series.<br/><br/>i wasn't a big fan of alien resurrection simply coz of the acting.. very poor overacting by everyone.. and some cheesy dialogues was a major disappointment for that movie.. but AvP didn't have that although the actors were new..<br/><br/>another aspect of AvP that was great was the fact that both creatures were on the screen for a lot of the time.. Anderson really portrayed the power of both by showing the actual things on screen for more than 10 mins. Although the Alien series and Predator are GREATS and classics, these movies didn't show much of the creatures at all.. true this builds on the suspense and thrills but being a fan of the movies, its time that we really saw the two have greater screen time.. (especially considering we've seen both creatures before and know exactly what they look like)! AvP was made for the fight scenes and the creatures having face to face combat.. and this would have been impossible if the screenplay and direction was kept to that of the Alien series or predator as in those movies the creatures were fighting humans.. now its different.. the creatures are fighting each other and so it is a must that both creatures are shown with great power and great action scenes. The slow and suspense direction wouldn't have worked in this movie at all.. times have changed, and AvP is completely different to the originals.. therefore a lot more special effects to bring out the best of both creatures is a must and Anderson achieved that with great success..<br/><br/>overall.. the movie was fantastic.. well worth it.. second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth time!!"

","I wanted this movie to be good. I wanted it to be good, so bad. I wanted it to be the coolest in the set of aliens and the predator series. But it turned out to be such a flop. This Movie started out in a rather interesting fashion. I was into it. But than all of a sudden it just went to crap. . . My guess, is that they were all very excited to make this movie. Got there early and started out strong. . . than lunch hit, they left took a nap got back to the office late and really wanted to beat traffic to get home in time to see the Simpson's. So they looked at the clock, freaked out and threw the last hour of the movie together in less than 45 mins. I want to know what went through there minds, when they relied they had a summit climber out run a queen alien. I wonder to myself if they meant to tack on a slight love interest between the head predator an the lead heroin. Along with there ""dialog"" involving the explaining of the wrist bomb. . . I wish they would have taken the time to actually finish the movie they started."

","This movie was a Roller-coaster! W.S. Anderson did a great job. He is no Ridley Scott or James Cameron but he passed up Resident Evil 2 to direct AVP, and it was worth it. Well paced and cut beautifully, the minimalist narrative doesn't get in the way of the action, but still tells the backstory of the Alien/Predator connection every fan of both franchises has wondered about since Predator 2. The fact that the script dispensed with the human characters quickly was enjoyable. THE ABSOLUTE REASON to see this movie is the ultimate battle between the two not so nice E.T.s of the title. The pay off is gooey,gory, and full of acid blooded mayhem.GO SEE IT!"

","This movie was simply OK. Maybe not the right director for the job. The movie had its moments but it could've had a lot more.<br/><br/>It isn't Alien, Aliens, Predator, or Predator 2. But the movie is better then crap like Aliens 3 and Alien Resurrection two movies that destroyed a franchise, and two movies I don't even care to own in my library.<br/><br/>This movie did move too fast for an hour and 40 minutes, I could have seen it at 2 an a half hours, being a better story, a longer time frame for things to occur, and more intense fighting with more Aliens and Predators.<br/><br/>The Aliens were near flawless.<br/><br/>The Predators didn't use their cloaking enough, in a situation where they need to prove their worth. They know the Alien species is a far more superior species.<br/><br/>Yet the hunter in Predator used it all the time against Arnold and his rescue team.<br/><br/>I know I waited a long time for this movie but I could have waited a little bit longer for it to be thought out a little more.<br/><br/>The good news is that it wasn't so horrible that someone else can't pick it up and make it a huge blockbuster sequel with a big time director and a big time actor.<br/><br/>As far as the timeline is concerned it is accurate as can be. The Weyland-Yutani company would still know about the Alien species through Alexa with her story, the Alien tail spear, the Predator spear, and come on you think they won't try to go after the Queen alien in the ice.<br/><br/>Let's see a sequel on the Aliens home planet, or Predators home planet or some other worldly planet set just before Alien to describe the crashing of the ship. We all know that wasn't an Alien ship because that's not an Alien flying it. This is Ridley Scott's creature feature Alien prequel now throw in a human crash landing freighter with Hugh Jackman and you got a movie."

","i dunno where to start about this movie...i've seen bad movies in my life..BUT NOT like this one..i can recall this movie as the worst movie in the history of humanity. 1- too short and not like what we expected..it was barely 90mins..and god knows why all the actors and actresses died in the first few mins for them in the pyramid leaving the ""all mighty"" girl for a solo weak act. 2- we expected to see gore and a lot of blood scenes and endless action in this movie...but all we saw was a predator jumping from this wall to this wall...another couple fights between an alien and a predator and thats all and then u see the queen running were she was killed in a pathetic easy way -according to the director's vision, even my youngest sister could kill the Alien queen- and that doesn't go along with the cruel reputation we all know about the Aliens race and there malice we saw in the Aliens series. 3- the makeup was so lame..specially when the predator removes his mask -in a pathetic attempt to recall the original predator- and u just take a look at his eyes...u will see a very human eyes and he even looks so innocent..in the original predator movie, it freaked us out when he removed his mask and we all jumped when he screamed in Arnold's face...that was creepy. 4- storyline is so stupid..telling us the 2 races were in a war...while they were NOT...predators were just having fun by letting the queen breed..its like hunting contest..and when the predators fail..they bomb the place (OMG THE PLANET WILL DIE...SAVE THE EARTH!!!) even my dog could do better :D<br/><br/>take my advice...if u didn't watch it yet...Don't U EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!! i give it -3/10 (yes thats a minus)"
"poundapinthic","3","4","7","19 March 2007"," In search of new fans... they let down the old.
","To be honest when i first heard the news that AVP was being directed by Paul W S Anderson i was sceptical, mainly because i'd witnessed Resident Evil... a movie which he seemed to lose interest in after about 15 minutes! Don't get me wrong, it had some nice ideas and a couple of nice little bits here and there but the more i watched the more i was horrified... and not in the good way.<br/><br/>As a big fan of the Alien and Predator films (apart from Resurrection)i remained positive, watching small clips of Paul on the internet telling us he was a big fan of the franchise blah blah blah. The trailer looked good too! (school boy error, if the trailer is good the film generally is bad) So i sat in my seat at the local cinema happy as larry... it was the first time i had ever had the privilege to witness an Alien or Predator film at a cinema, but both in the same film... a dream come true! My first annoyance was when the certificate came into view... a 15? The film hadn't even started yet!!! For these films we need the 18, the people who want to see this movie are the ones who were 18 in the first place or have grown up with the film... i deserve the right to witness a full 18 rated film... it's double the monsters, that means double the carnage... it should by all rights be double the rating! So as i watched i noticed the gore was lacking! Killing machines from another world armed with mops and sponges?! If there is less blood does this mean the swearing has been knocked off? One of the things i loved about Predator 2 was the bad script with a swear word thrown in here or there! With the lack of bad language when the only swear word near the end of the film is emitted from the heroines lips it just sounds lame!!! (A tear roles down my cheek) My major hope would have been they had taken the main idea for the film from the'Aliens Vs Predator' Dark Horse comic series (the Randy Stradley script one), or at least an edited version! Nicely in the distant future, with a made up planet, with big open areas to battle in! Some of the shots with the use of CGI would have been amazing. A predator running through an open area armed with a sword-staff thing facing a horde of aliens, not as a short flash back!!! My rating for this film was a 3, maybe a little harsh but i felt very let down. There were some really nice bits sure, i enjoyed the Queen Alien fight, the Kung fu face hugger bit... not so much the almost wrestling esquire one on one but there, like Resident Evil, were things i enjoyed in sections! The bit with the Predator space craft flying over the unsuspecting guards' head I loved, the opening tease shot of the satellite as well. The problem in general for this film was the little things that as a fan i picked up on. The over-weight Predators with overly long dreadlocks and tarted up expressions... they didn't look disgusting enough as well as the aliens looked a bit too CGI at times! The lack of blood, the lack of swearing, it all added up.<br/><br/>I tried to like this film, i really did... but my willing suspension of disbelief was no way strong enough!!! I even bought it on DVD to listen to the commentary in hope that Mr Anderson might say sorry... i was let down! I can see Paul W S Anderson in the future being quite a good director, but i wish he wouldn't practise and perfect his art with things I hold dear! p.s. My new annoyance with this film is that I have just spent all this amount of time writing about this film!"
"shrallen","10","4","7","5 November 2006"," Not overdone
","Alien vs Predator was not overdone, which is the main point to its success to deliver a great movie, that involves crossover characters. It's the beginning of an franchise; the intro to an everlasting battle of superiority among species, Predators being the instigator by proving their worth as the universe greatest combatants and hunters. This is just a tip of episodes explain thru the comics; looking back at Predator 2, when Danny Glover entered the Predator ship he noticed skulls, behind a glass like case, from different creators across the universe including an human skull and an Alien skull. This is something already in the works since then, it makes sense; instead of senseless killing- it shows the history and elite tactics that Predators use to hunt their foe who are of great intelligence and instinct whether human or alien or whatever else in the universe they may find. It is a well done movie in which movie goers can look forward to a sequel."
"mstomaso","5","4","7","10 October 2006"," Entertaining but meaningless and silly
","AVP is one of Paul W. S. Anderson's better efforts. Inexplicably - I saw it during its theatrical run at the request of my spouse. I agreed to see the film mainly because I enjoyed Event Horizon (probably Anderson's best effort to date). Neither of us had ever played the computer game and despite my 30+ year interest in comic books, I had never bothered with the comic book. From what I understand from the reviews gamers and comic fans have given this film - my lack of familiarity with the game and the comic probably worked in the movie's favor. Check through the reviews here on IMDb and you will see that there are a lot of fans who are violently angry about this film - so much so that they have provided negative feedback to nearly every review that speaks positively about AVP and voted for all of the negative ones. In other words, having an opinion about this film, if it is not ""the right one"" can get you into trouble.<br/><br/>Despite his mediocre to bad reputation, Anderson's films have always entertained me. Entertainment is, I believe, all Anderson attempts. His movies are generally pretty shallow, very visual, and fast-paced. Do not go to an Anderson film in order to have an emotionally charged, deeply satisfying film experience or to be exhilarated by a sweeping, revisionist interpretation of classic fictional themes. Instead, bring popcorn and minimal expectations.<br/><br/>AVP is a silly story which could have been pulled out of the X-Files. There is a nest of Aliens buried deep below the tundra in the arctic region of Siberia and it has just reactivated for a ritual hunt by - you guessed it - a young 'predator'. The interpretation of the Alien here is that of Aliens, not the original Alien. Since I consider Aliens to have been the worst film in that series, and since I disliked the radical reinterpretation of the creature provided by that film, I could have been seriously annoyed by this, but the entire Alien series is in a different class of film from AVP, so I am not going to make an issue of this.<br/><br/>As the nest reactivates, an American millionaire's scientific team discovers the heat signature and prepares an expedition. As they arrive, they discover that somebody has beaten them to it. An entire mining camp has been set up to explore the heat signature, but what did the miners find? And where have they gone? What follows is about an hour and ten minutes (this is a short film and no time is wasted) of wild action and effects-laden scenes. There are relatively few surprises, and very little dialog (after all what would you say to a pair of grunting, hissing and roaring killing machines fighting it out under the ground in a set which could have been borrowed from the most outlandish Indiana Jones movie?).<br/><br/>Taken in its proper context, AVP is an OK film. It has little to do with the comic book and the video game, but it's a fun little romp nonetheless. The acting is passable. The script is minimal, and only permits character development for Henriksen and Lathan, and the direction is typically slick. The special effects are quite good, and the film is strongly visualized. Although some of the aliens scenes are almost comedically outrageous, the aliens are visualized more interestingly than in many of the recent films from the Alien series.<br/><br/>Keep your expectations appropriately low, grab a good supply of popcorn, and enjoy. If you are looking for something powerful and artistic, don't bother with this."
"eye_photographer","5","4","7","13 April 2006"," This could have been awesome
","This is a pretty fun movie - and it can stand on its own without the previous Predator or Alien movies, mostly because there is really no story - but should have been much better.<br/><br/>Some spoilers ahead......<br/><br/>This movie could have tied together all of the Alien and Predator films. For example, the Predator's ship should have looked like the Derilect in the original Alien. Considering how the movie ended, this would have been perfect.<br/><br/>By adding a few minutes (maybe more) to the movie, they should have has Weyland figure out what the Predators were doing (without letting the crew know, of course) in the hopes of catching an Alien while the hunt resumes. Of course, the accidental triggering of the pyramid was unavoidable and the movie could continue on as originally planned.<br/><br/>This would have solidified the motivations of Weyland-Yutani in the other Alien films.<br/><br/>So close........but still fun to watch."
"TensersFloatingDisk","5","4","7","15 December 2005"," Annoyingly average
","This is an average flick. Average camera work, average acting, average special effects, average plot.<br/><br/>That shouldn't be troublesome, but it is, given that this movie draws from two important, and well-established, science-fiction/horror mythologies. There was a lot more to work with here than the scriptwriters seem to have realized. Any of the Dark Horse comic series which revolved around Alien/Predator, and even some of the novels which were penned as tie-ins, made better use of the available material.<br/><br/>Where we should be getting a gritty exploration of how humans make their way between two extreme threats, and how we navigate lose-lose situations, instead we get a routine thriller with few actual thrills, and oddly slow pacing. Extended shots of the antarctic tundra, where there ought to be tense standoffs between humans and their interests and the aims of the two alien species. A waste of good potential."

Of course it had it's typical ""horror"" clichÃ©'s, as demonstrated by the penguin shuffling around the kitchen making the audience think it was a face-hugger. But that made it all the more fun. I absolutely loved the idea that the Predators used the Aliens for training.

If you watch it just for fun, then you will enjoy it. I think the main mistake people made was that they were expecting a film that was like the game. As I mentioned earlier, Alien vs Predator has had a lot of different styles/plots. You can't just focus on one telling and call it the original idea.

","14 years in the making and here we are: two of cinema's most infamous monsters (three if you count the humans) bash it up head to head to head. As a fan of the Alien and Predator movies and the AvP game I was very excited to see this movie come out and couldn't wait to see it. I was expecting just a guilty pleasure type of movie and that is just what this movie is. If you are not a fan of the characters basically stay away.<br/><br/>However even fans will be disappointed with this release. The story, acting, design, special effects, and action scenes are all pretty good and don't fail to satisfy, the movie's fault, and it's a rather big one, is the look and feel of the whole thing. The Alien movies are violent with R-rated level violence and gore. So are the Predator movies, and Predator 2 was even trimmed for graphic violence from an NC-17 rating to get an R. The game AvP is also graphically violent complete with dismemberment and spraying gore. People have come to know the Alien and the Predator as violent and terrible beasts, yet this movie is remarkably limited in all of that. It doesn't take a gore hound to realize that it just doesn't work the way it should, or more importantly, the way the fans expected it to. This is a film for a limited audience and it was made with a big downside: it just doesn't feel completely like Alien vs. Predator.<br/><br/>Taking a look at Paul Anderson's previous films like Soldier, Event Horizon, and even other video game adaptations like Resident Evil you can tell that this guy can make his movies no-holds barred violent. The only real explanation for the tameness of this movie is the potential cash revenue. They wanted money so they made a toned down, relaxed version of what should have been. However, fans will, undoubtedly, want to check it out. 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: violence, minimal gore and horror, and some profanity"

","After reading several reviews for this movie, I decided to wait for the DVD release. All of the reviews that I had read were universally savage. After viewing, I must say that I found it to be a lot better movie than I expected. I am not alone in this assessment. I have talked with at least six other viewers ranging in age from 22 to 57 and we are all in agreement that this film got a bad rap. No it is not Alien or Aliens but then they were fresh and new when they debuted.It is hard to successfully continue a series with the same character.

I was looking forward to the combination of both since 1990 when pred 2 came out. It's finally here and I wasn't disappointed. I'll admit there are somethings I feel definitely could have been done better. But this was in no way shape or form a bad movie. I agree it should have had more gore, and 2 preds that lasted alittle longer. The story back drop was interesting and I for one liked it a lot. Scientists think aliens helped build the pyramids. cool to think it might have been preds. The fight scenes where amazing. I hope it goes the distance and predator 3 is done, be nice from a preds point of view too. have the pred as the main character w/ the audience following him. be a nice change. alien 5 would be nice too. no ripley, lets face it, she died in a3. A4 doesn't exist nor should fox think of it as existing. Start a5 w/ a new direction. i would like to see something w/ the colonial marines again. those guys where bad ass. and as for avp, i would like to see avp2 w/ not just humans, but colonial marines, aliens, and predators. just like the video games on the computer. if you haven't played them. try and get them. they are hard to find but trust me their good. stories in avp 1 are not so good, avp2 on the other hand has quite an amazing story line worthy of some type of movie. people think of avp as aliens and predators going at it. and for the most part their right w/ the books and the current movie. however, w/ the video games, it's a fight to the finish between three species. Aliens vs Predators vs Marines. and that i feel would be the best for avp2. so sit back enjoy avp. if you don't that's cool it's your opinion, but don't bash people for liking it. it's one of those love it or hate movies i guess and damn did i love it."

To me he looks like a serial killer waiting for his next victim I'm still wondering and waiting for this guy to prove he actually has 'talent' and after this movie I doubt that.<br/><br/>I really don't understand how you can make this a bad movie, I think it was easier to make a good movie than a bad one but Anderson succeeded, how does he still get work? The in and out achievement by Anderson in this movie is to take two highly popular movie franchises throw them into a lackluster storyline topped off with a pinch of second rate actors who belong in street theatre and kill both franchises in a second rate train wreck of a 90 minute movie.<br/><br/>GOOD JOB PAUL W.S.

In the terms of the Alien and Predator series their are some massive holes. One that springs to mind is how, and I quote Predator 2, predators are "" attracted by heat and conflict."" Antartica is freezing cold and there's no people there so theirs no conflict although it can be argued that they are going to make conflict with the aliens. Also due to the fact Aliens can breath underwater, as seen in Alien Reserection, the Alien Queen Didn't die at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>But that doesn't really matter because you will enjoy yourself as you watch this movie. Most of the SFX are good although their is a bit much slow motion. The aliens and the predators look amazing and is good to actually see them as opposed to them being in the shadows/ invisible.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie has to be about half way in, when an alien and a predator fight it out. The alien kills one predator by surprise and then another predator attacks it and they have what has to be the best fight scene of 2004, due largely to the fact the result wasn't predetermined and you have to watch it to see who wins.<br/><br/>In conclusion AVP is a fun film to watch, but looks worse if you stop and think about what you saw. 7/10."

","I really liked the movie, BUT it lacked one thing... or should i say had something that it shouldn't have. PEOPLE! there shouldve been no human actors. only the aliens and Predators. it wouldve been so much better on the alien home planet. With say 6-7 Predators(fully armed). Regardless. I still liked the film but many people hated the fact that a human and Predator teamed up. I've seen the first predator more times than anyone on the Planet (over 350 times) and i wouldve written a script that wouldve blown away this one! But don't get me Wrong the movie was still very well done! I give it appx 3.5 out of 5 stars.. But i still liked it more than almost any other film this year!<br/><br/>Bill G."

","Every morning since I saw Alien Vs. Predator, I get up and thank God in Heaven that I didn't have to pay for my ticket to this heap of garbage. To put it lightly, it would have been more entertaining, much more exciting, and indescribably less painful to watch Whoopi Goldberg and Chuck Norris have sex. I've seen Troll 2 three times, and this movie still shocked the hell out of me with its predictable (and laughable) story line, and I'll not recover from it for years to come.<br/><br/>Also, this director is one of the worst of our time. Jesus. Who makes an Alien or Predator movie thats not rated R? For God's sake, it's rated PG-13 for ""horror images, slime and gore."" It's an insult to both franchises. If the originals weren't so great, this movie would have ruined them both for me. Way to go Anderson. I'd start calling him this generation's Ed Wood, but his movies are too horrific.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you really feel the need to see this movie, please, for your own sake, wait until it comes out on video and you can rent it. That way you can at least turn it off when your mind starts to go numb."

"siit","8","3","5","21 January 2006"," Better than most critics say, no where near as good as a fan's expectations!!
","Contrary to public opinion, I rather enjoyed AvP. Sure I believe it could have been better if it stuck closer to the book AvP:Prey, but it wasn't that bad.<br/><br/>I must admit having yet again a female as the all conquering hero and survivor is getting rather tedious. Don't get me wrong, I think Sanaa Lathan does a great and credible job of a person in her position and I love Ripley and especially the equality displayed in Aliens, it's just getting old hat.<br/><br/>I believe the history of four past Alien movies, two Predator movies, books, comics and the mouthwatering potential AvP stirred, it was hard for any movie to live up to that hype. Yet some of the action scenes in AvP is some of the greatest, liveliest, and most rewound and repeated scenes of ANY of the above bulk of the Alien and/or Predator franchise. I actually loved seeing the clash of these two titans, I loved how they re-established the way an alien is supposed to be; how perfectly ruthless, destructive and powerful they are. I thought it was terrific how they showed the trainee Predators on the hunt and their inexperience. And I believe the fights captured all this.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in Bishop's role. He did seem in it for the pay cheque and AvP never firmly and concretely stated the link of Bishop, his company (Weyland Industries) and the preceding four movies.<br/><br/>Overall I was happy to see the alien drone returned to its nasty and true H.R. Giger adaptation, and the Alien Queen is magnificent and accurately depicts her near unlimited power, strength and terror instilling awe. The predator whilst not Kevin Hall was fine for the most part. No other Alien/Predator franchise movie captures the raw power of these titans and in a brilliant manner than what AvP does... hence I fail to agree with other critics.<br/><br/>Yes I believe AvP could have been better. The script could have had more depth, the characters more involved and fleshed out. But overall AvP, while not as good as the first three Alien movies and the first Predator movie, is a very good and worthy addition to the franchise."

It is no where near the original Alien or Predator film, but it is great entertainment. My only complaint is the fact that they changed how the Predator looked. It would have been better if they kept the original design.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of sci-fi action, definitely pick this one up.

I want to point out I didn't take any of it to me since I had decided to see it the moment I heard it was in production. <br/><br/>I like AvP. Quite a lot. Although Paul W.S. Anderson may not be the best director around I think it's an improvement in the film's camera compared to Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Also the dark environment naturally eases it in AvP's case. <br/><br/>*Possible Minor Spoilers* The characters are cool. For the first time we get to see the predators from a deeper perspective, with flashbacks through Earth's history. The Aliens are intelligent, tough and very agile fighters and prove to me more than just a match for the Predators, which is quite entertaining.<br/><br/>The return of Lance Henriksen is enjoyable, also because he has a not-so-pity role and so carries the film forward. The loss of Sigourney Weaver is of course unfortunate but due to the time the action takes place, it cannot feature her. That would just complicate things even more.<br/><br/>Overall... I had a great time. Don't take in too much of the flaming on this movie. At least I can share my experience.<br/><br/>8/10"
"chrishn","7","3","5","31 October 2004"," Exactly what any true fan could have hoped for
","My expectations for AvP weren't high at all, especially because AvP has gotten a lot of bad press. After having seen it however, AvP is another example of how established reviewers completely misses the point of a movie. The idea of AvP obviously is to pit the cruelest race in the universe (Aliens), against the coolest race in the universe (Predator) and then place some humans in the middle to show how feeble we are. That's exactly what the movie does, and does it very well. <br/><br/>The story has all the stereotypical elements: A strange pyramid is discovered below the ice of the South Pole. The main characters are quickly presented. Naive humans venture inside the pyramid and discovers the truth about themselves and the Predators. The underlying plot is epic in proportions and a bit far out, but true fans are gonna love it and it has no infuriatingly loose ends. Tension builds up as the arena is being set for the final showdown. The humans know something is very wrong, the Predators enter the pyramid and the Alien queen lays her eggs. Next follows an hour of intense and very well made action. The humans do what they are supposed to do. They get separated, runs around screaming and ends up either in the Alien nest, or hanging on the wall impaled on a Predator spear. The Predators fight the Aliens and toy around with the humans, while they use all their cool gadgets. The Aliens kills or captures every living being they come by, and generally show their usual disregard for all other lifeforms.<br/><br/>Everything is aimed at the great action sequences while all the introductory elements are told sufficiently to make the movie work, but without any unnecessary details. The characters are quickly presented, which is great. Who on earth wants to dwell on personal development and intergroup tension, when the humans are just walking hosts/trophies (depending on racial perspective). The plot is quickly outlined and the humans discover the truth unnaturally fast by reading the inscriptions in the pyramid, which is great too. Who wants to watch humans run around playing detectives when it's the fighting we're looking forward to! The director - Anderson - knows this and dispenses with it during the initial 30 minutes. The remaining hour is great great action. It's an action movie and is neither scary nor violent, and even though violence and horror is an inseparable part of both universes, I didn't really miss it. Instead the movie relies on fast-paced action combined with hints to the previous movies + AvP universe, to keep its crowd entertained and it worked for me. <br/><br/>The acting is sufficient. The music works with the fast pace. The effects are great and the scenery is ambient and well made."
"The_Rook","10","3","5","13 August 2004"," My Enemies Enemy is my Friend
","Be advised, some spoiler information in this review. <br/><br/>I have good news and bad news. The bad news first, the movie is no Aliens. The Marines aren't here and most humans will not be kicking serious Alien booty. Instead the match-up is mostly Aliens and Predators and I was even a little disappointed in my favorite of the two, the Predators. A couple seemed to die to easily at the hand of an Alien. Why didn't they use invisibility more? Maybe they thought that would have given the Predators to much advantage. They don't even start out with their shoulder mounted artillery.<br/><br/>The good news, plenty of action, special effects, and a decent back story. Some of the characters are kind of cool even if most of them become Alien fodder. When a group is financed by a millionaire, gee he looks like the robot in Aliens, to explore a newly discovered temple buried in Antartica, things slowly build until they realize they are bait in a maze and survival is a full time job. Our heroine, Alexa Woods played by Sanaa Lathan, once again is female as in the previous Alien movies. She finds out that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Best to help the guards rather than let the prisoners escape. Not as cool as Alien, Aliens, Predator, or Predator 2, but still well worth seeing. No doubt they left it open for a sequel."

Of course there are many clichés and this movie will never be nominated to an Oscar, but I really do not understand some imbecile and unfair reviews that I have just glanced.

"Black_Rabbit","7","4","8","11 April 2006"," Not bad if you don't care too much for the Alien and Predator franchises.
","AVP isn't as bad to me as most reviewers here seem to think. Then again, by the time I saw this movie (just the other day) I no longer cared about the Alien series. I've never been a big fan of the Predator franchise either, though I think the Predator creature is cool.<br/><br/>I'll just address a few things instead of repeating what others have already said.<br/><br/><ul><li>No element of surprise and no gore. Well, the suspense in the earlier Alien movies just wouldn't have worked here anymore; we've already seen the other films and we know what's going to happen. No gore? Well... yeah true. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Thin plot and character development. Yeah, that's one of its weaknesses. I was just getting to know the crew members when... ""Huh? Dead already??""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cool action sequences between the Alien and the Predator. Actually I thought this was pretty cool. The Predator isn't really a good guy here, but you'll wind up rooting for him against the Alien. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Concept of ""Hunter's Moon."" These flashbacks were pretty nice. Breeding the Alien as ""the ultimate prey"" for the glory of the ""hunters"" who wish to prove their worth is an nice idea. - Relationsip between the Predator and the heroine. The human protagonist here thinks only of how to prevent the ""serpents"" (Aliens) from reaching the surface and doing harm to other people. The Predator only thinks of hunting down the ""prey"". His x-ray vision lets him know which humans are infected with the parasite and who isn't. He spares any human that is not infected (unless they try to hurt him first). When he sees one crew member beg Alexa to kill him because the Alien is already inside him, and Alexa reluctantly shoots him, she earns the Predator's respect. He sees her as a worthy hunter like himself. Toward the end of the film when the Predator knows that more of his kind will come, he leaves a distinguishing mark on her face so that his comrades could recognize it and not harm her. </li></ul><br/><br/>That part about the story appealed to me most. Nothing else could since the human characters weren't really developed in this film. But it's enough to make you respect the Predator and his hunter's mindset. They have their own rules, different from ours, but in a life or death situation we sometimes need to change ours as well. The tag line of this film should be, ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend."""

Yet it tells nothing new. Everything could be concluded from watching the other movies.<br/><br/>But it is still good, as it is an epic. Battle between two predators with men in between. With a choice of side and nature - to become predators themselves.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes are good, no Matrix-style camera angles and pace, but that made it even better. Everything moves fluidly to please the eye. In most movies with at least a bit of martial arts in them have it edgy, but here, where the huge predator is fighting perhaps the most agile creature in the universe, even predator's own agility can be seen.<br/><br/>It draws out well the different natures of the species - predators are trained hunters, ready for anything, aliens ruthless species that will do anything to survive and even human soldiers can be scared shitless.<br/><br/>Watch it, not for plot, not even nifty gadgets and great decisions, but the thrill of the hunt."
"Corky1984","Null","4","8","20 April 2005"," A wasted opportunity
","AVP could have been one of the best films ever made...however it must be considered one of the worst. Fans expecting plenty of action and violence will be very disappointed by this stale offering. It has obviously been heavily watered down to get a lower rating, thus allowing younger people to see it. This was a mistake. The film should have been an 18, no question. The Alien and Predator monsters are still fantastic creatures, but in AVP you get the feeling that they are barely exerting themselves. There is a distinct lack of blood and gore, and nowhere near enough firepower. The original Alien and Predator movies had all that in bucketfulls, AVP has a few lame action sequences, too many of them ending quickly and cutting away before the real violence can be seen. As for the cast, only the great Lance Henrikson adds anything to the movie, but he is underused. The rest are all Z-listers who can't act their way out of a paper bag. The wordplay is dire and you soon find yourself wishing they would all be eaten by the aliens! The plot is also poor. AVP suffers because Sigourney, Arnie and Danny Glover are all absent. One of them should have been included. AVP is a wasted opportunity that will leave true action fans cold. Don't bother with it, it only tarnishes the franchise."

","I must admit that I don't get why so many people dislike this movie. Perhaps the idea of crossing the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" universe had been set up for something way too grand, and it usually always did work out in the comic books. Personally I think that this 2004 release of ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" was actually a good movie and fulfilling to the two franchises.<br/><br/>The story is about a group of explorers and scientists traveling to a remote arctic area where they have found a pyramid-like structure deep under the ice. When they arrive, a perfectly cut hole at 30 degrees leads down through the ice to the ancient structure. When traveling to the structure, the group find that they are not alone, as it is an ancient site where extraterrestrial hunters used to breed xenomorphs for honing their hunting skills.<br/><br/>The movie is action-packed and is so almost from the very beginning. It kicks up into a high gear from the early beginning and doesn't really let down the pace. As such, this is a tour de force of action Sci-Fi throughout the entire course of the movie.<br/><br/>""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" does have a formidable list of actors and actresses, some which have far too little time on the screen in my opinion, but still nice that they were there. And the magnificent Lance Henriksen is there for the role of Charles Bishop Weyland, which was a nice reference to the future events of the ""Alien"" movie.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie were really good and they did so much for the movie. The alien design was great, as it always is, and so was the predator design. I especially loved the individual personal touches there was the individual predators. But lets not forget the set and the environment; are you kidding me? That was just awesome, so many nice details and cool effects to the pyramid. And the concept of it being set in a remote frigid region was also nice, as it added a sense of isolation and no possible means of help or a chance to escape.<br/><br/>I believe that this 2004 ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" movie really did justice to both franchises and added a good amount of depth and detail to the lore of both franchises. I found the movie to be really entertaining and it is the type of movie that you can watch again and again."

The end is masterfully filmed, with an Alien Queen chasing a Predator across the ice. To all you haters, this scene is BRILLIANT, easily a classic scene in an interesting film.

The players here are truly formidable. One is an insectoid hive creature living a semi-parasitic life style armed with acidic blood, sharp teeth/claws/tail, and an unmatched will to survive no matter the cost. The other is a hulking, crab-faced, infrared-seeing, reptilian humanoid with advanced technology, a strict sense of honor, and a blood lust for sport.<br/><br/>Weyland Industries (the future Weyland/Yutani Corp.) discovers a strange heat signature emanating from an ancient pyramid buried deep in Antarctica. Naturally, a team of various experts, mainly lead by Alexa Woods and Charles Bishop Weyland, go in to investigate and find a lot of intriguing things inside. However, this was all a trap. Many mechanisms inside the pyramid are activated and soon a hibernating Queen Alien spawns several offspring from the bodies of some of the explorers while three teenage Predators come in to hunt them as a manhood ritual. Can our team escape? Even so, whoever wins, we lose.<br/><br/>Many things in this movie are pretty cool. The fights between the two species are awesome, especially the first one with the Celtic Predator vs the Alien named by the filmmakers Grid. The story is especially interesting. It is inspired by the famous book ""Chariots of the Gods"" written by Erich von Däniken that explains the Astronaut Theory: early humans developed civilizations and built pyramids because they were visited by aliens who taught them these things, which I think is possible. The human characters are pretty likable too, which is hard to do when making creature features such as this. Alexa Woods, for example, is a strong-willed woman with a no-nonsense attitude and Weyland, despite his ambition to make history, does care for people.<br/><br/>I would have liked for this movie to be rated R instead of PG-13, but that's a minor complaint. Overall, this film connects the Alien/Predator story lines pretty well and I do recommend you watch this cool crossover as well as check out the various comics that are out there."

The characters are likable, the action is great, and it really pays tribute to the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchise. I think Paul W.S. Anderson is a very good film-maker and I would love to see what he does next.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I don't think they screwed it up with this one. There's actually a story to it, and that's what I think pays tribute to the other movies. They all had stories to them, and the characters are likable. So, all I can say is: James Cameron, blow it out your ass."
"moviemaniac008","7","2","3","21 April 2008"," I don't see why all the negative reviews...
","All right, this film is not the best, but it is enjoyable. It's a mixture of two great classics: Alien, with Sigourney Weaver and Predater with Arnold Schwarzenagger (I hope I spelled his name right). While this movie, which makes a great job of making the 2 races fighting and killing each other, it doesn't make it really a classic like the two movies I mentioned about. On the special effects side, the movie's visual effects were quite entertaining in the Antartica continent and the pyramid was enough to give a lot of shivers. However, while I was expecting a horror movie, I wasn't scared at all, so which is why I took a point off my review. So if you're a chicken, and you were wondering if this movie is good for you, let me remind you that it is NOT a horror movie. It's pure science-fiction.<br/><br/>On the acting side, some actors, like the character Sebastian or the character Weyland, were excellent. Where as Lex and a few others, they're supposed to do a job and I just hope that in the future films that they will be making, they will improve their job because I think most of the negative critics came from the point of view many of the young actors weren't convincing enough. Still, the job was still fairly well done. Since critics were generally negative (or mixed), I suggest you don't buy AVP: Alien vs. Preadator right away. Rent it first and then look forward to buy it. I know this might sound dumb, but I'm possibly saving you 10$.<br/><br/>So, while not being the best movie ever made, AVP: Alien Vs. Predator is still worth a shot despite it's Razzie Nominations (possibly wins, I don't know) and negative reviews. Once you have free time, go rent this movie or when it's raining outside, watch this movie. As I said, it's not the best movie ever, but good for you if you liked it and if you didn't, then I guess 1 hour 40 minutes of your time did not kill you like many of the characters in this film."
"knuckles_and_sonic","8","2","3","13 January 2008"," Flawed But Good
","A good movie this is. For one we can see everything clearly. The plot is average but we get to see a lot of fighting between the aliens and predators. The acting isn't good but this doesn't affect the movie too badly. I did feel that there should have been less build up to the fighting. We already know about the aliens and predators! The creatures themselves are great and no cgi can be seen. The action was good but they toned down the gore. The ending is understandable unlike its sequel which made no sense at all. If your a predator or alien fan then see it. The last 40 mins makes up for the rest of the movie. A solid 8/10"
"kyle-mcdonald","8","2","3","1 January 2008"," great installment to the alien and predator series.
","This is definitely the one of the best alien and predator movies because it has lots of action the story line is really good the actors are not that bad but they are not the best in the world but hopefully you see past that just enjoy the movie. The way they did the predators and the aliens are really good. The people who played the aliens and predators did it really good and i hope they do it again for aliens vs. predator requiem. So i am sure you will not be disappointed with alien vs. predator because it is a really good movie.

"halfband","7","2","3","27 December 2007"," Writers strike invalid!!!!! $#%+!
","Maybe they would pay writers more if they could come out with movies that were more entertaining. The movie seems like Aliens vs. Predator with the humans interrupting the movie. When I had seen the photos of the predator planet, I expected the predators to have a lone human stow away that witnessed/helped the predators on their planet battling the aliens. Then when I was watching the movie I had seen the deer in the forest and thought... Yes! maybe the aliens will impregnate the animals like the toy line Aliens/Predator, but no. I seemed like the movie was meant to be 3 hours long and they edited it down to 1 3/4 hours, leaving too much human story in and aliens/predator out. If it were the colonial marines (alien aware bug hunters) it might have been more exciting."
"M_Warren","7","2","3","22 December 2007"," Worse than you deserve, but still better than you'd expect.
","I'll make this quick, giving this film about as much of my time as it deserves. That sounds demeaning, but I don't mean it to be. Bottom line, if you're thinking of seeing a movie called 'Aliens vs. Predator,' you not only know pretty much what to expect, but you also clearly have nothing better to do. The title of this movie says a lot.<br/><br/>With that in mind, this film is a faintly pleasant surprise. It's no masterpiece by any vestige of a stretch of the imagination, but it's about as good as a film called 'Aliens vs. Predator' could be. People complain about the crummy plot and the butchering of the mythos of two highly revered sci-fi franchises, but aren't these foibles implicit to the title? What did you expect walking in? <br/><br/>Frankly, I'm glad there was a new storyline, shabby or not; it kept me much more interested than if they had tried to somehow combine the stories without warping them -and how exactly they might have managed that is a profound mystery to me. <br/><br/>To reiterate, you know pretty much all you need to know from the title. You're going to get some flippant action scenes involving characters who are largely disposable, punctuated by the occasional reference to the respective franchises and the traits of their respective monsters. Thing is, the action is a lot more well done, and the characters a lot less disposable, than a movie of this nature deserves. On top of that, many of the special effects are fairly top notch, paying the alien and the predator as much respect as possible, considering the bastardization inherent to letting them versus each other. <br/><br/>You already know, before reading this review, whether or not you plan to see it. I'm just saying that if you do, you'd be unreasonable to find yourself disappointed."
"brando647","6","2","3","16 December 2007"," A Bitter Disappointment for Franchise Fans
","I am a huge fan of both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises. In fact, the original 'Alien' is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. While I have never read the comic books and I may have only glanced over the video games, I still recognized the potential if both of these epic science fiction baddies were put on screen together. Sadly, when that day finally arrived that these sci-fi/horror icons were pitted against each other, it was a mediocre disappointment. Why must Paul W. S. Anderson does this to us? A quick synopsis for those who haven't seen it: billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (sound familiar?) hires a crew to assist him in investigating an ancient pyramid that one of his satellites detected in Antarctica. Upon arriving at the pyramid, 2000 feet beneath the ice, they are faced with the realization that they have wandered into a Predator proving grounds and now must escape as the two species duke it out.<br/><br/>Honestly, the movie wasn't COMPLETE trash. Just the fact that we get to see Aliens fighting Predators for the first time ever on screen gives the movie some brownie points. I've been waiting for this match-up for a long time and I was super-pysched to see it come to fruition. The special effects in this movie deserve some credit as well. The Aliens looked fantastic, and the blend of practical effects and CGI is near seamless. The Predators have a beefed up new look that makes them seem more threatening than ever, and we are treated to the usual arsenal of high-tech/primitive weaponry (with a few improvements).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in this movie, the bad outweighs the good. My first (and largest) complaint is the same as you've probably read in a bunch of other comments and message boards: why PG-13?!?!? This movie is a combination of the two greatest RATED R sci-fi horror movie franchises. So they throw the two together, they sugar-coat it to a teen-friendly PG-13?! NO! This is supposed to be a violent showdown and because of this rating, we miss out on some aspects that made the original movies what they were. All of the major violence (against humans anyway) occurs off screen in this movie, whereas we were treated to every gory detail in 'Predator'. In 'AVP', you might see some blood spatter on a wall but nothing more. While on the topic of violence, my other major complaint with this movie is the editing style. During the Alien/Predator fight scenes, most of the shots are too close and the edits to quick to really see what's going on. In a film like this, I want WIDE angles so I can see the battle raging! This isn't MTV, this is WAR! Finally, we have the story and the cast. The story is pretty basic and weak, but it was enough to move things along. I felt it took a little too long to really get to the meat of things, but when it does, it takes off. The cast were really nothing special. Sanaa Lathan plays the heroine, Alexa Woods, and doesn't come close to matching the strength of Sigourney Weaver and her role as Ripley. Lance Henriksen plays the role of Charles Weyland and is the only real acting strength in the entire movie. The rest of the cast (all 10 of them) are forgettable and die off relatively fast so it doesn't matter. Overall, this movie is worth watching at least once if you are already a fan of the franchises or the genre.<br/><br/>Now, let's just be glad Anderson will not be directing the sequel."
"pontram","8","2","3","13 December 2007"," This movie got a raw deal
","Maybe I'm the last one who passes a comment here about this movie. So I give it the good grade it deserves (i.m.o.). Seeing a movie is a very personal thing. You have some knowings, some anticipations, you have a background. I didn't anticipate anything special than an usual American action movie. I know the Alien movies, the Predator movies, the AvP2 game and all the Alien, Predator and AvP Comics. <br/><br/>So I SHOULD have been disappointed by the AvP movie, like many others here and around. But I was highly impressed. The atmosphere, the speed, the characters, even the plot, I was caught by it through the whole time the movie lasted. Note that I have some of the following most liked films in my background: Eraser Head, Brazil, La belle captive, Dark Star, Once upon a time in the West, Dr. Strangelove, Nosferatu (with K.Kinski), THX1138, Irezumi, Le clan des Siciliens, Needful Things, and so on. Now AvP is one of them. I liked the (simple, yes) storyline, I liked the nice girl, I liked the game, the Predators and the Aliens and their fights, and the fast and efficient cuts. <br/><br/>I liked poor Lance, and I liked the (triple) open end, where the Predalien hatches, the Queen sinks in the cold water (which should not kill her), and where the future of the heroine is unknown in an environment of usually minus 50° Celsius. <br/><br/>I liked the Idea of a situation where most of the humans are powerless, and the strongest of them is a compact sexy and brave woman. She is the only one who knows where to go. She is the only one who gets respect from the Predator. Maybe this is why so many of other (male ?) opinions here are nearly hateful against AvP; most of the men - when not all - are shown weak, a scarfaced mercenary is even the most fearful. This is against American habit. <br/><br/>The key scene is when she gives the final shot to her captured and Chestbuster bearing teammate, and the Predator is impressed. The Predators are someway careless, they believe too much in their strength than in teamwork strategy, and so they are overpowered in combat and the last of them is infested by a facehugger. The Aliens are also sympathetic for their strength and fighting skills - remember that they were born just a few hours ago.<br/><br/>Also the Queen and her wrath are amazingly shown. She has some sort of intelligence, so she calls her breed to release her with use of their acid blood. Who knows, for how long she is caught in the pyramid to serve Predator's game every 100 years. <br/><br/>I enjoyed every minute of the movie, and also I enjoyed reading later about mistakes and logical errors. AvP is illogical, and Aliens and Predators, too. The first Alien movie was outstanding, not merely because it was such an intelligent thing, or even deeply interpretable or whatsoever, but because it was an atmospherically horror premiere. And the first Predator movie - hmhmhm; greetings to Gov. A. from Graz. <br/><br/>Fortunately, AvP went its own way in the middle of the two main brands. The director leads us into a sporty hell where man is only needed as a host. It is easy for the Predators to activate man's greed, they know that someone will come freely and will feed the Aliens spawn (less freely). The Aliens are (if we go philosophical) the real victims, because they are only born for the thrill of the hunt. <br/><br/>There is no need to switch off the brain for AvP. This is a must, for example, if you see Ghost Rider. AvP is a fine B-Production with A-look-and-feel in some sequences. In my conclusion, AvP is one of the most intriguing movies of the last years, often underestimated and victimized. Whensoever Terminator 1 is now at a cult-like level, there is no reason for me why not AvP also. 8 stars only because of the many errors, otherwise it would have 9 stars (10 is only for Brazil and the others). And: Im definitively no employee of the producer's company."
"johnnyboyz","5","2","3","7 September 2007"," Mostly misses the mark, often in a way that is both long and even disrespectful to what preceded.
","Surely a mark has been missed when things which were once genuinely frightening have become merely incidental; when things that had the propensity to be quite terrifying now just seem to exist to fill runtimes. Take the scene in ""Alien v Predator"", Paul W.S. Anderson's 2004 adaptation of a comic book which became a video game, and features the much admired franchise monsters, whereby a Predator grabs a new-born alien mid-air as it leaps out at him - too flippantly, in my opinion. Or, worse still, the similar moment whereby a face-hugger is diced in half when it too makes an attempt on a Predator's presence. I can recall when characters creeping around alien infested corridors were once atmospheric and effective; here, reduced to inducing little more than a passing interest. What happened?<br/><br/>""Alien versus Predator"", or ""AVP"" if you're hip, begins with a young American woman named Alexa, played by Sanaa Lathan, climbing a Himalayan mountain. She's by herself, which means she's fearless and independent. Suddenly, some ice gives way - panic, but she negates this and gets back on track before calmly making it all the way to the summit. Lo-and-behold a chopper, which she must surely have heard, has already landed there and sees its inhabitants offer her a once in a lifetime opportunity in Antarctica. Nothing suspicious about any of this.<br/><br/>The opportunity turns out to be the chance to explore a pyramid, more synonymous with ancient civilisations based thousands of miles away, which has been discovered well below the ice. Think hard and you will be reminded of ""Stargate"". Others have been assembled, but only Raoul Bova's character Sebastian, who needs the money to fund an archaeological dig, has been afforded an introduction beyond Ewen Bremner's sheepish small-talking Scot. I kept thinking how difficult it was in earlier films in these franchises to pick apart protagonists and how impossible it was to tell whom would still be alive by the end. Though, to some extent, ""AVP"" does refrain from going so totally down this road as to completely terminate your interest.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, floating around in outer-space, seemingly undetected by Earth's advanced satellite technology, is an alien spacecraft inhabited by a platoon of Predators - the likes of whom had only previously graced our screens on two occasions, in Schwarzenegger's 1987 jungle-bound survival horror and an intriguing 1990 sequel which had some neat ideas. They watch everything unfolding in the pyramid's radius, before enabling the hapless explorers to enter it via an energy beam shot at the structure which melts the ice and creates a makeshift tunnel. Our crew head in, despite being fully aware that 'nothing man-made' could have created the tunnel and without informing any proper authorities on the discovery, which no one seems to have a problem with, despite the chap heading the expedition, Lance Henriksen, quite evidently appearing to be mad.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film, within the confines of the pyramid itself, is largely disappointing without being totally unforgivable. The crew make a few nasty discoveries about its history, although I forget what it was they were precisely trying to find; the film, we realise, is not really even aliens against predators, but aliens against some kind of adolescent predators who must prove themselves as warriors. The early parts are peppered with deep senses of foreboding. ""Storm's comin' in!"" one person glibly observes. Two other characters look up at the moon, so bright in the sky - one remarks that, where he comes from, 'that kind of moon is the hunter's moon'. It is difficult to take too seriously.<br/><br/>Up in space, the Predators all gather around a holographic device and watch what transpires, like it were some kind of piece of audio-visual entertainment in itself, or a wrestling pay-per-view. This is entertainment precipitated by the pyramid managing to manoeuvre its own walls in such a way that face-huggers are able to claim a couple of human victims in order to breed the aliens at all - leaving others to fend for themselves in contained crawlspaces, as if the walls knew exactly what to move and when to keep the ambling explorers forever in the dark.<br/><br/>Nearer the end, I was conflicted by which to be the most struck: the words of Brian Helgeland rattling around inside my head about how the lazy way out of any finale for a film-maker is to merely burn the set; the way an alien queen is knocked onto her side with a mere pointy stick, or how a Predator knew there was an escape route out of the pyramid at all having activated a rather large firework. I suppose, in an alternate universe where this is, in fact, the very first time we get to see either an alien or a predator, you might be able to find it in yourself to give the film a passing grade, but I think you would struggle to do so in this reality."

"TheHande","8","2","3","2 July 2007"," The Ultimate Showdown
","Alien vs. Predator is precisely the kind of movie I had expected. It's gritty, action-packed and dark but filled to the brim with cool moments that make it fun to watch. As this is a Paul Anderson film the visuals and the sound have been done brilliantly but its also structured and paced in a very cool way.<br/><br/>Actually I was a little concerned that the movie was a quite bit shorter than the other movies in the Alien-franchise, but the usual 90 minute-structure of Anderson's films is nice in that the movie never feels like it's dragging along. The film also has many humorous moments to keep it from becoming too serious.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can point out is that the film does feel a little too much like a blast from the past. Alien and Predator were both more effective back in the days of Cameron and that's probably a feeling that isn't gonna go away no matter how much you like the film.<br/><br/>All I can say is that Anderson did a great job in bringing the two franchises together and created a film that is fun to watch."

From there on, it's Aliens vs. Predators, with the humans caught in the middle.<br/><br/>Since AVP was panned by critics and hated by fans, I want to show another perspective of the film. I liked it. You might say that this movie needed to have an R rating since the originals were R rated. You might be right but I, on the other hand, didn't mind. You might also say this film isn't a classic. Well, you might also be right, but I, on the other hand, didn't mind it was an entertaining popcorn movie.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Alien or Predator, neither have I also seen the originals, which might be a reason why I liked this movie. Would it have affected my view on this movie have I seen the originals? Maybe but for a person who just went to see this film, that person will like it.<br/><br/>This film is the definition of a popcorn film: Fantastic CGI with great action sequences, a murky plot, and and is just entertaining if you want to kill 90 minutes. I must admit I didn't like the plot. It was too ridiculous with the dumb characters but still, it attempted to be a popcorn film and it succeeded.<br/><br/>For you people who are complaining Sanaa Lathan is trying to replace Sigourney Weaver: Shut up. Stop complaining. Lathan is not trying to get on the spotlight. I liked her performance in this film and I liked the fact this film gives unknown actors a chance at the big screen.<br/><br/>You might also complain that this film is dumbed down for a wider audience. Well, that's you. I know most kills are off screen but I think they got away with a lot for this PG-13 rating. I liked the costumes of the Predators as well with the high tech modern technology they use. I like the look of the Aliens with slime. I liked the cinematography and the production design.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the originals, you might hate this film for being a popcorn dumbed-down movie. I don't blame you.

I thought the plot was just fine having today's humans mess things up for the Predators so that it took a combined effort against the Aliens.

"rcavellero","8","2","3","12 August 2004"," AVP IS A BATTLE WORTH THE WAIT!
","People have been waiting a very long time to see these two foes in the same frame of a big budget Hollywood blockbuster and the day has finally arrived. Paul Anderson of the totally underrated Event Horizon and Resident Evil fame directs the latest installment of both franchises with a separate pizazz. It's quite obvious that Anderson is a fan of the source material and holds both franchises in high regard. Not only does the film stand well on it's own it feels like an entirely different type of film. The movie promises with trying success to mash storyline, emotional development and kick ass fight scenes together and it partially succeeds. No matter who you are or what your expecting if your paying to see a film entitled alien vs. predator you will get your money's worth. However, the film doesn't prevail without any faults. Audiences have been waiting a very longtime for this and for the film to be utterly perfect would be a miracle and it's not. There for, ultimately a slight disappointment the people involved do the best job to keep the originality afloat. The story centers around a group of people whom stumble upon the ets during the battle while investigating an ancient pyramid. Seemingly built with the predators help. It seems that every hundred years there is an all out avp war so that the surving predators may graduate and become true warriors. Sanaa Lathan of Love and Basketball, Lance Henriksen (bishop of the Alien films) and gorgeous Raoul Bova head up the human fodder. The acting in some scenes is very good however in others it's never bad but somewhat unbelievable. Lathan makes a formidable female but a Ripley she isn't. And sorry Lathan but the comparison is going to be inevitable. It's no doubt that people will be happy and people will be ignorant and people will be appreciative of this film. But no matter what complaints are presented the film succeeds as a workable picture even though the second half seems a little rushed it delivers more entertainment and scares than it has any right too. AVP stands as the beginning of hopefully many promising sequels. And as a late summer scarefest worth the price of admission. 8/10"

This movie still has its own charm and there is lots of fun to be had. Predalien looks great but I think a sequel to a fanfic wasn't needed."

","This film has an interesting premise for a crossover - some of the biggest, baddest alien foes we've seen on cinema duking it out. The storyline is nothing special and in fact it throws off the continuity in many places, but it is all in service of the action. This is a true Paul W. S.

","So far, the Alien/Predator Franchises has produced four films that I have rated great or good, and this is one of them. Personally, though I loved the concept of Predator, I hated the film. The acting was low-grade, the dialogue was trite and cheesy, and the script was formulaic at best. But if Predator was a popular dud, then Predator 2 was one of the worst films ever made. That said, I did like Predators, though it was far from perfect. OK, onto the Alien franchise! I found Alien to be the best of the lot, and then Alien 3. Whereas Aliens was destroyed by the bad dialogue and dismal acting by Bill Paxton, et al. And Alien Resurrection was just an insult that should not have been made at all. But you would have to read my brief review on that. So this should give you some idea of what I was looking for when I watched this film. Personally, when I'm watching a grim, dark movie I want it to remain grim and dark - like the Underworld series and not like Blade! Keeping this in mind, AVP never strays into Comedy, and its dialogue is reasonably logical for the situation, and the acting is fairly good. And the story is above average and somewhat plausible. This does not mean that I could not find bits and pieces of AVP to pick apart, but it certainly is not as bad as Predator, Predator 2, Aliens, Alien Resurrection, and its sequel AVP Requiem. I haven't even bothered to watch the latest Predator release, and I never will. Unfortunately, the makers of this film left us with a lone heroine stranded in a very cold and hostile environment (Like the Predators could not have offered her a lift to somewhere warmer instead of giving her a useless trophy!), and a pointless, meaningless summation. Other than that, AVP is still one of the better films of any of these two series - and that says a lot about how bad the other ones are!"

Unwittingly the humans are caught in the middle of an Alien vs Predator conflict.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the film is great. The action is great. The combination of Aliens and Predators works well and follows the source material pretty good. All in all so far, tick. The main issue I had with it was the stupidity of the humans and the average script the actors were working from. It seemed too cliché in places and almost cheesy. Saying that though, I didn't dislike the film for that, I actually enjoyed it. It could have had more blood, guts and horror in it - but audiences have changed and the rating system this film tried to achieve meant it had to be less gory that previous Alien or Predator films. I actually played the titular console game of this and it was hell of a lot more scary than this film. I think there were some opportunities in the film to make it better but they were missed and this also affects the pacing slightly - it takes a while to get to the action and then when we follow the humans it can be a little stop/start.<br/><br/>One of the issues with this film I have found is the divided fan base. Fans of Alien films want this to be another Alien film. Likewise fans of the Predator films, want this to be another Predator film. Truth be told, it's neither and both at the same time. Watch this as a new film and it's a good action romp. Watch this with expectations of it being an out-and-out Alien or Predator film and you won't enjoy it.<br/><br/>I give this 6 out of 10.

","To me this is a real true follow up to ""Aliens"" mythology and story arc. It is improvement over disgusting horrendous Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. I have enjoyed this movie more then the last 2 movies, it is fast pacing goes quickly around. I like this film not love but I like it. It is not the best one or the greatst one but it is decent and a good movie. AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) is field with horror and science fiction suspense that work in the movie.<br/><br/>Directed and written was from Paul W.S. Anderson who previously directed Mortal Kombat and series of Resident Evil. I think the man did a good job making this movie. This movie deserves more than 5.6 it is at least better than Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection. It is decent, fascinating, filed with horror, sci-fi and little action.<br/><br/>The design and CGI effect for xenomorph queen was correctly the mythology was right. Aliens did laying eggs and make a nest. The design for Alien creatures was right. I think they did it right with this movie. Tom Woodruff Jr. playing ""The Alien"" trough whole movie did a right excellent job. This are the Aliens that were portrayed in James Cameron's Masterpiece Aliens (1986). That is why I enjoyed seeing Alien creatures portraying correctly in this movie. They did right with this movie because Alien creatures did act the like they did in Alien and Aliens.<br/><br/>Predator design and CGI effect was closely enough but nothing can top the original Predator (1987) Kevin Peter Hall the original actor who played Predator creature. Ian Whyte did a good job as The Predator but he is no Kevin Peter Hall. Ian Whyte in my opinion is much better Predator than Derek Mears, Carey Jones, and Brian Steele in Predators (2010). Ian Whyte is also much better Predator than Brian A. Prince as the New movie The Predator (2018) from Shane Black.<br/><br/>Alien and Predator fight each other that is the best thing in the movie and does not drag it goes quickly around.<br/><br/>The story is set in Antarctica just like (John Carpenter's ""The Thing"") a team of archaeologists and other scientists find an ancient pyramid buried in Antarctica. But soon the make a terrifying discovery: two alien races engaged in an-all out war. Whoever wins we lose. From the actors Lance Henriksen is in this movie he is a legend to me from James Cameron The Terminator too Aliens too Hard Target too AVP: Alien vs. Predator. He did a fine job playing his character. Sanaa Lathan is excellent as Alexa Woods I am really wondering to what happened to her character.<br/><br/>On Blu-ray disc there are two version one is theatrical the other version is extended unrated cut. I only watch theatrical cut because it goes fast paced around. You have also a slasher death scenes a little gory not much but I like it.

","Director Paul W.S. Anderson's spin-off of both the ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" franchises is a blast from beginning to end. It has a surprisingly coherent internal story that builds from the two established movie universes, a diverse cast of well-defined characters, and first-rate special effects. In addition, the title isn't just a marketing gimmick: The two disparate species really do go for the jugular on several occasions, and it's a blast to sit back and watch two science-fiction titans wind each other up. It's more ""to the point"" than the slow-build tension of the ""Alien"" series but its jocular tone fits right in with the ""Predator"" movies, and it's kind of fun to see the internal ""Alien"" universe turn into a haunted house."

","For me, it was an okay film, it was well directed and has pretty good action sequences. The scenes with the human characters are a little dull, but you can care about them sometimes. The dialogue isn't too good, but the action sequences are amazing and the practical effects are awesome. I liked the way the facehugger eggs opened up, how the actual aliens and predators look, even the queen looks impressive. Usually with such a small budget but with enough of a budget, you can do so much with practicality. The CGI does look bad, but that just means there's more room for practicality. Paul W. S. Anderson did such a good job at trying to make a good film, its hard not to respect him for that. Again, the writing isn't that great. Not great writing, but not the worst either. The climax of the film is the best part. Seeing the queen battle the predator and our main star makes for good visual storytelling. The set design? Just great! The sets look so real. It looks like they're in a pyramid built by predators. But what really gets me is the different styles of writing in the pyramid. In this universe, humans clearly did learn writing from the predators, with the Aztec and Cambodian writing (supposedly) things get kinda confusing, because these are two different styles of writing. So how do you blend the two together?<br/><br/>Well that's my review of AVP. If you're a typical film-goer just looking for two aliens fighting, you're gonna get it. It's just really late in the film so you can't do a whole lot with it. But if you're an Alien/Predator fan, you might not like this film. Although, I would prefer to spend more time with our main human characters rather than watch mindless fighting between our two title."

I've recently been collecting movies and I wanted to watch the alien quadrilogy so I did. alien and aliens are great, 3 sucks, and 4 was almost as good as the first 2. What was next ? Alien vs Predator of coarse, I had no intention to watch this movie when I heard first about it because I heard it sucked. But then one day during school my friend said he watched Alien vs Predator and it was awesome. I thought about watching it after that and I ended up buying AVP and AVPR. I watched AVP with no expectations of it being decent, but I was wrong.<br/><br/>I found the suspense buildup G-R-E-A-T I was clenching my pillow watching this movie because of the fear and what would happen next.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is Amazing, although it's not any original idea for action sequences COUGH*Matrix*COUGH its still pretty sweet. My favorite part is a face huger jumping in slow motion.<br/><br/>The story works.

They never experienced the hype. but, my opinion might change on this movie when I get older like how the kid that likes Phantom Menace realizes it sucks and that the original star wars trilogy is better.

"firstruleofmethclub","6","1","1","15 April 2015"," Not great, but cops much more flak than it deserves
","I can honestly say, that this is one of the most under-rated films of 2004.<br/><br/>Not because it was good, just because it was panned so damn hard by critics! I think this is mostly due to the fact that it was being compared to both the Alien and Predator series, which is fair enough, but it was never going to be what either of those films was. <br/><br/>Ultimately it's downfall came from some poor dialogue, and trying to reach a larger audience. Where Predators was a film that you didn't need to have watched all the others in order to follow, it was still fundamentally a Predator film, aimed at the Predator-loving market. AVP on the other hand used references to the older films, but then completely threw the canon out the window and went for a larger fanbase. And whilst it worked to some degree (my grandma liked it) it wasn't enough of a step in either direction. AVP was complicated as a stand alone, and disastrous when compared to anything else in the franchise except perhaps its sequel Requiem (and maybe Predator 2 or Alien3).<br/><br/>Honestly I think the film works as an archetypal film in the realm of both Alien and Predator, just not a sequel or prequel to either. The lead protagonist is a woman by the name of Alexa Woods, portrayed by Sanaa Lathan was clearly meant to be a modern day Ripley, and catastrophically failed at doing so. The Predators were as cool as ever, and people complained that in the latter half of the film they weren't as ghostly as in Predator/Predator 2, but we've already had two whole films of that, and these were juvenile Predators, so it sort of made sense that they were a tad more restless.<br/><br/>Bringing Lance Henriksen back was an awesome decision, one that was probably lost on the audience who had not seen the Alien series.<br/><br/>Tommy Flanagan is another an actor I love, it was a shame his character (Mark Verheiden) was so underused. Ultimately, the film is a good one to pick up and put down, don't think about it too much, don't compare it to the others, go in with your only expectation being that it's a monster-movie, then you won't come out too disappointed.<br/><br/>59%<br/><br/>-Gimly"

","After reviewing both Alien & Predator franchises last month, I thought it wouldn't be fair to leave out the very picture that simply killed the validity of those two reputed series in one shot. More a spin-off than a sequel or prequel in my book, AVP: Alien vs. Predator was destined to surface ever since the alien skull was discovered in that Predator's ship in Predator 2 but I can't help but wish it hadn't.<br/><br/>Bringing together the two eponymous creatures of Alien & Predator series, the story of AVP: Alien vs. Predator is set in 2004 & follows a group of archaeologists assembled by Weyland for an expedition near the antarctic to investigate a mysterious heat signal where they discover an ancient pyramid buried beneath the ice. While exploring the pyramid, they find themselves caught in the middle of a battle between the two species.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, this is the first film I've seen of his & well, I'm so not impressed. Why do humans even exist in this film? We could've simply had these two creatures battling their differences out on another planet without human intervention at all which sounds way cooler than having this dull set of undeveloped characters who bring the story down every time any of them appears on the screen at any given moment.<br/><br/>The technical aspects is overall nicely carried out but its job is to compliment the narrative in a more engaging & polished manner but since the groundwork in the storytelling department is already weak here, none of those elements play any relevant role. Camera-work is fluid, editing is choppy, visual effects are impressive actually, music is forgettable & the very same goes for the performances by every single one of its cast.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, AVP: Alien vs. Predator is an unnecessarily crafted movie that tries to keep the viewers interested in its premise by referencing the films that inspired it yet fails miserably. What's even more disappointing is that it doesn't even live up to its own name as the sequences depicting the two iconic species going against each other are too low in number & expectedly, those scenes are the only ones worth talking about to some extent, at least."

","The 'Aliens versus Predator' storyline has been with us ever since the 'Predator 2' when Danny Glover huffed and puffed his way across what looked like an alien's skull in the Predator's trophy cabinet. This brief image sparked a storm among fans, whose dreams and wishes were subsequently realised by volumes of comics and graphic novels regarding the subject matter. And they were actually pretty good! Having read a fair few of them, it seemed no end to the possibilities of pitting two of the big screen's most famous monsters against each other. With so many ideas as to what could be done, how could they possibly lose?<br/><br/>The answer: they gave it to Paul W S Anderson. Now, Paul W S Anderson is a very competent director who can stylishly bring action scenes to life. However, his films' major flaws all are that they're 'almost great.' They're not bad. They're watchable. And that is their major crime. They leave you thinking that if you were given $60 million to make a film (in this case one starring the aliens and the Predator) then you could do better than him. And there's a reason for this - you could. And so could I.<br/><br/>Aliens vs Predator sports the tagline 'Whoever wins - we lose.' Isn't that the truth? The film gets its rating taken down from an 18 to a watery 12A, removing all gore and much of the suspense with it. Instead of brutal tough Predators we have a trio of young, inexperienced ones who are - quite frankly - a bit rubbish at killing aliens. Instead of the gun-totting Colonial Marines from Aliens, we have a team of bland, disposable scientists who are there simply to increase the body count. At least the aliens perform on camera, but the battles you may expect between the two races are few and far between. Also, if you saw the trailer and witnessed a million aliens tearing towards some Predators on top of an weird and wonderful pyramid, that's only a flashback. That's about the best bit of the film.<br/><br/>It sort of tries to tie into both the 'Aliens' and 'Predator' mythology, but fans really don't want it to. Like I say, it's not bad. I know I'm making it sound terrible, but it really isn't. It has action, special effects and, um, that's about it. It's perfect for your average sci-fi monster-munching movie. However, when you have either an Aliens film or a Predator film, people expect a little more than something that's 'just okay.'<br/><br/>At least it was more understandable than Prometheus I suppose.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

When the base is reactivated, the heat signature is picked up by a satellite, and an expedition team is sent out not knowing what awaits them.<br/><br/>Special effects are good in this movie, but the battle between the Predator and Aliens weren't all that successful because both lacks character and it just turn into a mindless fight. In this movie humans are relegated to a total supporting role. <br/><br/>It's the first attempt of combining the Alien, Predator, and humans in one film and interaction between all of them remained somewhat raw. While this movie is pretty good, I liked the Predators (2010) better than this one, as blending of the plot and the monsters were much more smoothly done, and recommend that movie over this."

No, but when do American directors stop using actors with funny accents (italian and Scottish in this case) and when do they stop ending the movie with the usual 'return of the villain'.

Much like Freddy vs. Jason the one that backed the most bucks and bigger film career gets the ""win"" and at the end twists around leaving room for a sequel. The whole movie was pretty decent, the story was interesting, but the way the whole movie went through was some what gamey. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 7/10 because believe me, we ALL wanted to see these guys battle, and let's face it, there wasn't one visual piece of this movie that was un-attractive.

"amcurtis77","Null","1","1","22 August 2004"," Terrible, just TERRIBLE!
","Spoiler warning Ugh. This movie was sooo bad, I don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>The initial idea was great - we have been anticipating this movie since we saw the first poster over a year ago - bring back these to Sci-Fi Heavyweights for an all-out battle. Sounds good to me having grown up watching both of these movies, but the whole movie just fell short. <br/><br/>In order to have made this movie really good they should have just offed all the humans in the first 20 minutes and just let the Aliens and Predators have it out the rest of the time. That being said, it was completely silly that the last remaining Predator and the human chick 'teamed up' to fight side-by-side. The whole audience was laughing at the cheesy scenes of the two of them running together as a team. He makes her a shield and spear? Give me a friggin' break! ""Sorry about killing all your colleagues and stringing up their dead bodies up on the surface - but I REALLY AM a nice guy so here's a spear and shield made from an Alien head......"" I was actually waiting for them to hold hands as they narrowly escaped the explosion by sliding back up the 2,000 foot ice hole!<br/><br/>Then the Predator gives her 'props' by burning her pretty little warrior chick face? Ugh.<br/><br/>Remember the original Alien movie? When Kane gets the first ever Alien attached to his face it takes HOURS if not DAYS for that Alien to lay the egg in his throat and then fall off and die. They even try to perform surgery and thus find out about the acid blood. Then, once it fall off, again HOURS PASS before that sucker gestates and jumps out of his chest. In this movie apparently we don't have time for that so all is forgotten (who cares about continuity?) and it takes less than 5 minutes from face-attachment to chest expulsion. <br/><br/>The fight scenes were lacking, the plot was silly, the acting was terrible and the one-liners were just sad. If you want a good, PATHETIC laugh - then go see this movie. Otherwise, save your money and go rent the original Alien and Predator movies at Blockbuster."
"hikaru_ao","7","1","1","16 August 2004"," Having read all the reviews on AvP I decided to watch it... (some spoilers)
","I love the Aliens and Predator series, I am a big fan in all things Aliens and Predator and the sci-fi backdrop it takes place in. I went to watch AvP with full knowledge of what was going to happen and some bias having read the reviews.<br/><br/>I felt robbed in what has to be most castrated appearance of both Alien and Predator species. The PG-13 style death scenes were very disappointing. I believe with all the advances in cgi and special effects we should be treated to more visceral content in regards to how the Alien and Predator dispatch each other as well as the pesky human species. I was hoping to see a Predator cut a person in half with its Combistick or at least cut an arm off. And the Alien's secondary jaw attack in all its glory is only evident through some splotches of green Predator blood, a waste indeed.<br/><br/>The plot was cohesive, enough to provide a reason for the urgency of expediency required in such an operation. The characters were all very much forgettable stock characters. Hudson from Aliens had more character than all the characters in AvP combined. I didn't really care about any of the characters myself and were wishing that they had all died a horrible painful death by the Aliens.<br/><br/>Things that bugged me, in the sacrificial chamber scene, the blond woman asks the nerdy guy again what the room is called in a vain attempt to add suspense. Lex is hanging onto a ledge and the Italian helps her up and is taken by an Alien, what bothers me is that the Alien could have easily taken Lex with it as well but didn't, why? When Lex was running with the Predator as the ice was crumbling under their feet the Alien head shield kept changing arms and she wasn't even carrying the Alien spear... then the spear magically appears in her hand while fighting the queen, nice. The Predator fighting the Alien with its claw was swinging and dodging in such a non-agile manner, looking as it if was stiff or had problems being limber. The alien lifecycle being accelerated pissed me off too, whats with that? The 20ft retractable Alien tail also bothered me and struck me as uber lame.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was so difficult for the team to get out, yet beyond all odds and the 10 minute timer, Lex and the Predator make it out of the pyramid effortlessly, nice way to rush the film. We don't all have ADD and would like to see a quality R rated flick with less childish dialogue, ""WHat is this room called again?"" ""Sacrificial charmer.""<br/><br/>What they should do is make direct transitions from comic books, the entire Alien story is available in comic book form and would provide MANY quality movies... the Predator comics aren't bad either. Ah well one can only dream. btw, Herk Mondo is one bad mofo."
"camden2k3","7","1","1","16 August 2004"," As entertaining as a PG13 of the age can get.
","I am quite a large fan of the Aliens vs. Predator universe. This movie was below my expectations, but not a disappointment. The director, Paul Anderson did a good job on the movie. On IMDb, a 4 (in my eyes) is a good movie unless its boring, and Anderson has a lot of 5's and 6's. He has made some good ones despite what people say. An example is Mortal Kombat. I liked it anyway. One thing about this movie that could have been improved is the lighting. At times it was hard to figure the aliens from the preds. Also, maybe the first two preds shouldn't have died so fast. The aliens shredded them quickly. A little bit more human gore would have been good too. Good directing, for most of it Good acting, Some of the best fight scenes I've seen. 7/10"

","Admittedly, the PG-13 rating made me and my friends a bit nervous just days before the movie came out. In the end we ultimately got what we wanted. I thought the quality of the special effects was excellent when it came to the aliens, and although the Predators were a bit bulkier and slower than I would have liked, the fight scenes were fun. Since I really didn't expect an Oscar winning script I wasn't disappointed with the dialog. A few of the scenes were a little cheesy and some of the lines seemed a bit canned. Anyone who is a fan of either franchise will see some funny little things that hearken to the parent movies. These little ""inside jokes"" make it fun for us fan girls and boys."
"darkshadowkein","7","1","1","16 August 2004"," not as bad as people are saying...
","I read these boards before seeing the movie, hearing mostly all negative comments, so I was a bit worried, but after having seen it yesterday, It isn't all that bad...<br/><br/>Of course it's not to everyone's expectations, but what is? It was fun, entertaining, and the staple movie which has brought the Aliens and Predators together, if nothing else. It may not have seen great, but just seeing some of the scenes of the Aliens fighting Preds were surreal images I had thought about occurring throughout my childhood. I remember having action figure aliens and preds fight in a WWF ring when i was a kid, and seeing them actually battle on the big screen was cool, at least for me. Now, for my criticism on the negative reviews...<br/><br/>**SPOLIERS** <br/><br/>1: I heard rumors of a 'potential kissing scene' between the Predator and Lex. Seeing the movie, I don't know where people get that idea. AT the end, the Predator merely takes off his mask. then brands lex w/ the alien blood... wtf are people talking about of how they thought they were gonna kiss? i in no way got that feeling. <br/><br/>2: and people say people in the theatre were laughing at some of the corny parts, all the way through to the ending and it was like a comedy. No one in my theatre, including myself, took anything foolishly. we enjoyed the film for what it was, and were not 'chuckling' at its insipidness. everyone seemed to enjoy it. i don't know what people were laughing at...<br/><br/>3: people were like 'it's not scary at all, etc'. the first alien movies were intended to be scary, since you really didn't know what the hell it looked like and where it was lurking, but after 25 years of the same creature in the same corridors, you kinda know what to expect. same thing with freddy vs. jason. they're not intended to be 'scary' 'horror' movies anymore. they're intended to be 'monster' movies, like the classic 'wolfman vs frankenstein', 'king kong vs. godzilla' etc. these are our generation's VS. movies, so just enjoy them for that. They're made to entertain, not to scare.<br/><br/>4: People always trying to compare it to previous Predator or Alien installments, which I suppose in inevitable. of course it's not as good as 'Predator' or 'Aliens', but it's NOT a sequel or even a prequel to either franchise. It is NOT Predator 3 or Alien 5, so don't expect it to be.(both respective movies are still being considered being made). This is the FIRST of a new franchise, 'AVP, part 1' (if there are sequels, that is).<br/><br/>5: of course there are plot holes and stuff, and things everyone would have done differently, but it's not perfect, and you just have to take it as it is. sure it took place in crappy antartica, the camera work was shaky and poor, there was no characterization, and most of the human deaths were off- screen... but for what it was, is was not AWFUL as everyone is making it out to be. if you don't have such high expectations, you shouldn't be all that disappointed.<br/><br/>i just go in to be entertained, and not expect an Oscar-winning, well-acted masterpiece. the first half was boring beyond belief, but the 2nd half was just what you'd expect: aliens fighting predators. that's what the title is, and that's what you pay for. end of story."

There are many possible explanations fore this, like how the cold air would obviously enhance their thermal Vision, or how they say in the movie that ancient maps have shown antartica with no ice, and it may have been a tropical climate and the fact that the predators did not want to jeopardise the general human public in utilising the pyramids in cambodia, Mexico or egypt.<br/><br/>But I would have to say that the movie itself is definitely not all that original, it doest so much follow the previous movies as it mimics them.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is actually pretty entertaining, and i would not call it a B movie, but it is most definitely not an A one either, i would say it is definitely better than predator 2 and alien3 and alien resurrection but it does not come close to the first2 aliens or predator.<br/><br/>i give it ***1/2 stars and my recommendations on seeing it even if you are not a fan of the genre,if only to fund a sequel to this or the predator series i am disinterested in another alien movie cuz the last 2 sucked, so i give predator one more chance."

","This movie should have been 3 hours long (because if it was, the film-makers would have had enough time to make it excellent). I swear, this movie was over when it was just getting started! All the production is awesome: the aliens, the predators, the humans, the temple, the audio visual effects ~ except the plot moves too slow in the beginning, and too fast at the end! They should have seriously cut the first 20 b-movie minutes, and get straight into the actual A+ AVP story and battle. More real scenes of aliens and predators actually hunting and fighting each other would have been cool, and forgetting to exploit the warrior bonds forged between the main human and predator characters, with real suspenseful action-packed fight scenes within the temple, is a mistake. Nevertheless, the mistakes are seriously forgiven by the alien and predator effects themselves; they're truly amazing. Overall, I like what I see, but I wish the screenplay was better. Good movie, but keep your comics."
"Grudgerun","7","1","1","15 August 2004"," Fun!
","I enjoyed this movie a lot, but let me begin by saying that it should not be compared to the very first Alien movie. I think that may be the reason so many people dislike this movie so much. People should not expect an intensely frightening, suspenseful movie. It isn't and could never have been as good as the original. However it is exciting, entertaining, and just a generally fun movie. It's a real treat to see these two monster icons square off, and the mythos from both movies are perfectly integrated together. The fights are nicely brutal and the movie will definitely please both Alien and Predator fans, as both creatures get some good blows in. The special effects are great, as they rely far more on advanced animatronics than CGI.<br/><br/>Alien vs. Predator is by no means a great movie. It's got corny dialogue, weak characterization, and a few lame plot elements. It's hokum. But it does give a nice punch in the arm to both movie series, and even has good potential for future Alien and Predator battles. Your expectations for this movie shouldn't be set too high, but I'll guarantee you'll have a good time."

","Ta-da-bump.  <br/><br/>Though the film is full of journeyman script writer dialog, it also has some great scenes and nicely done effects.  There are many classic bad movie moments that had the audience I was in howling, especially when the actors point out that `my enemy's enemy is my friend'. (oh yeah!)<br/><br/>The Alien & Predator costumes were not cheap knock-offs though there are SO many technical things wrong with the film it's not really worth listing. If you see this with friends it gives you TONS to talk about afterwards. <br/><br/>
/SPOILER ON<br/><br/>It was obvious from the start that the Predator would see how sick Bishop was and pass on killing him  the writer should have stuck with that giving Bishop an edge and a valid reason (for the genre) to survive but NO, the sickly Bishop decides it IS his time to die so he provokes the Predator to bring on a corn ball cliché, anti-climatic shredding.   That was one of the weakest moments in the film.  If they had left Bishop alive at the end, it would have played into a story thread reinforcing why the Weyland Yutani Corporation was obsessed with capturing its own Aliens. Oh well.<br/><br/>/SPOILER OVER <br/><br/>Is this film worth seeing in the Theater?  Maybe, but if you have a decent DVD home theater you can wait to rent it.

There hunting ground for this is an ancient pyramid under the Antarctic ice, but a ground of scientists have discovered the temple and are now caught in the middle of the fight.<br/><br/>Simple story, not particularly great acting (but not terrible, either).

Hopefully when the DVD is released they will have the special edition including all the violent content that had to be obscured along with all the other footage that had to have been stripped for it to fit in its run time.<br/><br/>Just like Aliens 3 the theatre release was totally messed up by editing, so is AVP.

While the action and gore was a little dumbed down from some of the past movies in this branching series, it still got the point across. There were some spectacular scenes that caused the fanbase on the theatre to applaud for a bit and keep the newcomers entertained.<br/><br/>While I probably won't pay full price for it in theaters again, the movie was definitely fun. It was worth the opening night trip and kept me entertained. The ending events of the movie begin to shallow out a bit as the plot heads somewhere you don't want it to, yet I found it was kept 'realistic' (as it can be in this story) and believable.

If you appreciate the old school method of don't show too much too early, you will enjoy AVP. These two movie giants played a large role in developing my Sci-Fi/Horror appreciation. The suspense of Alien and the combining of Horror and Action with Predator helped shape many followers. The AVP film took me back to the 70's version of King Kong, one of my first theater experiences. The original Jurassic Park also followed these rules. Tease a little while developing a story even though we all just want to see the result. AVP did not just create a dream for fans, but made a movie that anyone could enjoy, whether you had seen the previous movies or not. The movie also put to screen a Video Gamer's dream. Sometimes, going from the VG system to the big screen makes for many disappointments. AVP was able to pull it off and satisfy fans of all ages."

Really makes you want to see an AvP2.  They really tried to re-write a lot of mythos.  There were major plot holes.  Making you wonder how much of what happened in this movies affects the first 4 Alien movies.  One mistake is a how easy it is for the Predators to die.  These are inexperienced Predators.  It makes you wish for more plot and less scenary.  A lot of time is spent just analyzing the Pyramid.  Its called Alien vs Predator, not The Pyramid.  The writer thought the movie is more about a pyramid then the mythos of Aliens and Predator.  I wish there was more plot. I wish they explained more about why the Predator's do this. I wish it wasn't so easy to figure out what was going to happen.  I wish the final cliff hanger happened in the first 20 minutes.  Oh well. I still enjoyed myself.  Thanks for reading!"
"DragoonKain","7","1","1","13 August 2004"," One of the better movies based on a game
","But that's not saying much.  While Alien vs Predator was a fine video game, it seemed unlikely that it would ever be made into a film.  First of all, franchise crossovers, while common in comic books, are extremely uncommon in movies, save for Japanese monster movies.  Also, the total lack of humans in the AvP game made it even more unlikely to be turned into a film.  I don't think film studios are brave enough to make a movie without any human beings in it.<br/><br/>So, predictably but probably wisely, they took the Zerg vs Protoss route. For those that haven't played Starcraft it means it focused on a battle between Aliens (Zerg) and Predators (Protoss) with the humans caught in the middle serving as mainly hosts for the Aliens.  Predictable or not, it made for a fun movie with good fight scenes, decent acting, and an okay back story.<br/><br/>But, on the downside, it pretty much played it completely safe.  Nothing really that major happened, and nothing really came as a surprise.  However, save for Alien 1, none of the previous movies had many serious surprises, so I guess it's no real loss.<br/><br/>This movie was good enough to warrant a sequel, and I think this may be one of the few franchises where the sequel outdoes the original.

And why would it be? It's like complaining about a Batman vs Superman movie, it's just so out there to begin with so why compare it to anything else?

For the Predator aficionados all the toys are back with a vengeance.<br/><br/>In short, this film takes all the hits from both franchisees and combines them, well. The FX in this film are amazing the camouflage and wiping tales are almost perfect. The human touch in AVP is done nicely especially Lance Henricksen who pulls this adventure together in a matter of 20 minutes.

I've never seen a movie of his that was Oscar worthy, but I haven't seen one that was horrible either. As with his others, Alien vs Predator falls right in the middle.<br/><br/>The directing is well done, with the exception of doing too much ""shaky cam"" during the action sequences. Although, this seems to be something that's in every action movie now-a-days, so I guess I can't be too hard on it.<br/><br/>The acting is well done, considering the movie. There are some laughable scenes, but most of it comes across pretty well. Likewise, the characters are well portrayed (including the predator/alien). <br/><br/>If there is one downside, it's the story. Although, this is where you just need to not expect too much. For what it is, the story does well. There are some things that are just plain silly, but in some odd way, it works.<br/><br/>I'm sure there will be a lot of people complaining about how this movie isn't aliens or isn't predator...but that's just the thing, it ISN'T an aliens movie or a predator movie, and therefore shouldn't try to be one. It has parts of both as well as something of its own. <br/><br/>Overall: Good action flick with some minor nuances.

"mikeyproduct","1","5","12","3 May 2005"," Atrocious beyond belief......
","AvP is the single worst film I've ever seen. And I've seen the Rugrats Movie. Starts off OK. I forgave the rampant Jurassic Park theft, giggled at Bishop doing the knife trick.<br/><br/>Then they did it. They bullet timed the Face Huggers. All downhill from there.<br/><br/>From the theory of the Pyramid changing configuration every 10 minutes (because some ancient civilisation had a ""metric"" calendar. Not decimal, like you thought), it works out that a face hugger can implant a chest burster, which can then gestate and burst within 20 minutes. And then grows into a full size dog alien within another 10. Jeez, with a growth rate like that they should have been dying of old age by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>They managed to do the impossible and somehow make the aliens not scary. The puppet queen from Aliens looked more believable than AvP's CGI effort, and the Predators look remarkably like Rastafarian Robocop with the masks on and Doctor Freaking Zoidberg with the masks off.<br/><br/>Then there's the whole bit with Nu-Ripley befriending a Predator (um, no...) and for no adequately explained reason walking around for the rest of the movie with what can only be described as an alien glove puppet on her arm. I almost expected an Eric Morcambe style ""What do you think of it so far?"" moment.<br/><br/>The only thing that could have redeemed this movie would have been if in the bit where the Predator takes his mask off at the end, the music had swelled and he and Nu-Ripley had fallen into some kind of weird Captain Kirk kiss (I could have sworn that was where they were going with that scene.<br/><br/>Sorry to go on about it, but never has a film made me genuinely angry. There will be no more Alien movies. Even if there are more AvP movies, Avp has made enough money no doubt to keep them as shoddy as this one. Now I understand how people felt about The Phantom Menace.<br/><br/>I think the time has come for Fan Film-makers to hijack the franchise. I have no doubt that that ""Batman vs Alien vs Predator"" mini movie was single handedly responsible for getting Batman Begins made. Someone needs to show Fox that CGI and MTV camera work do not a good movie make and that the Alien franchise deserves a decent director (and an R rating). Any takers?"

From then on things just went from bad to worse.<br/><br/>I watched this movie last night(27 November 2004)knowing i was going to hate it, As putting two fantastic creature features together just does not work.

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I've made a study of what differentiates the Alien films. Their differences are a concise film school. <br/><br/>Now this here is a different beast. It is a simple essay, not an ordinary long form film. You might like it because of the very idea, or the plot device of switching the ordinarily hunted into a trusted partner of the hunter. The previous films form the foundation for this one which must become smaller.<br/><br/>That `pyramidal' notion is behind the one thing that did interest me here. Once you become familiar with the monsters (as we all are), and you know that the human situation must stay in the expected rut, then the only way to innovate is in the novel setting.<br/><br/>What we have here is an alien pyramid that is part `Cube' part `Thirteen Ghosts,' something that mechanically resembles an orrery. We're even told about it being a synthesis of three ""races"" of pyramids.  A good idea, down to the allusion to the shaft as one of the mysterious `air shafts' of the Cheops pyramid. Alas, this was too slighted because by the time we get it, we are too high in the food pyramid.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

The editing, pacing, acting, and special effects are simply some of the worst I have ever seen. The director, Anderson, should be ashamed of himself for putting his name on this piece of garbage.

"h0ly_knight","1","4","9","18 September 2004"," A joke...
","Being a fan of both Alien and Predator series and even of the AVP comics and VGs (like me), when you hear a movie like this is being made, you will certainly have some doubts about its quality. I've read the original AVP comic and enjoyed it immensely and at the time thought it would be a great story for a movie. So when I first heard of the upcoming AVP movie, I had hopes it would be based in the comics. (Oh! such innocence!) My fears came true when I saw the trailer: It would have nothing to do with the comics except for the concept of having Aliens fighting Predators with powerless humans in the middle. But still I had hopes the story could be somewhat acceptable and the directing good. So I went to see it... and then reached the one logical conclusion: Mr. Paul W. S. Anderson hates us (fans of Alien and Predator) and decided to insult us with this... movie.<br/><br/>The events occur somewhere in Antarctica, below an old mining site where an ancient pyramid is buried. A small team of experts and (of course) brutes with guns, leaded by Bishop Weyland(head of Weyland industries) and Alexa Woods go there to investigate the pyramid, finding themselves trapped in a maze with Aliens and Predators. After knowing that, the movie is an absolute joke: clichéd scenes of action, the Italian archaeologist being able to reach conclusions that a normal human being could not (for example, just by seeing the maze change its form the first time, he discovered it would be done every 10 minutes), Alien gestation time being only 5 minutes, Predators' armors and weapons melting with the Alien acid blood, and so on. It has loads of FX and matrix style camera rotations. And the revelation of how Predators used humans in the past made me remember Stargate (the difference being that Stargate was a good movie).<br/><br/>With all this, the it isn't more than an action movie trying to put together two of the most famous Sci-Fi characters unsuccessfully.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Alien Versus Predator is a disappointing sci-fi movie but to be honest I wasn't expecting much from this either so I wasn't too surprised that I didn't end up liking it. The movie was okay but it wasn't the greatest and I found it to be rather predictable. Director Paul W. Anderson has done an all right job of making this movie but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this one. The cast for the most part good in their roles including Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Lance Henriksen, Ewen Bremner, and Colin Salmon but most of them (except for Lathan) lack development and screen time because their written out of the movie rather quickly for you to care about their struggle to survive when they find themselves in the middle of a war between the nightmarish alien beasts and the deadly predators. Luckily Anderson keeps Alien Versus Predator at 100 minutes so it's not one of those films that seems to drag on forever (A.I., There Will Be Blood, or Spider-man 3). The action/fight sequences are okay but nothing memorable. The showdowns between Alien and Predator are letdowns because none of them ever last very long. All of them are missing that WOW factor you get when watching movies like The Dark Knight, Iron Man, or Spider-man 2. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times either. Overall Alien Versus Predator isn't the best sci-fi adventure with so-so action sequences, good special effects, a little suspense, and decent performances by the cast but this movie could've been a lot better."
"moontiger5","10","3","6","14 September 2007"," Give it a second chance after reading Lovecraft
","I admit that I felt frustrated after watching this film for the first time, mainly because, like a host of other fans of both franchises, I expected to see a high action duel with a satisfying conclusion. (In my opinion, the perfect closing sequence should have featured an unceremonious decapitation of the Alien Queen).<br/><br/>However, something clicked in the back of my head. I was pretty sure I had seen the elements of this story before... the Antarctic setting, the grand expedition, the discovery of a subterranean structure of alien manufacture, a previously unknown alien culture with a history of having visited and even dwelt on Earth in previous eras, and of course, the ill-fated intrusion into a conflict between a feral alien life form and the more cultured one. I then swiftly browsed my science fiction collection, and sure enough. While perusing an H.P. Lovecraft anthology I reread the story ""At the Mountains of Madness"" (which by the way, is an homage to Poe's ""The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym of Nantucket"", which I also reread). There it all was! Even the detail about penguins accidentally frightening a human character was included. What a joy! Imagining Predators as the Ancient Ones and Aliens as unruly shoggoths... breathtaking. And quite hilarious, too, of course. Excellent! So, this movie fans contend should not have been made is actually a little gem which makes Lovecraft, and to a lesser extent Poe, accessible to audiences who may find reading these grand masters poorly suited to their tastes. Director Paul W.S. Anderson deserves a standing ovation for his courage to attempt not just the merger of two sci-fi action franchises, but an increase in their collective quality. Not to mention that he deserves vindication for all the opprobrium he has endured. Bravo, Mr. Anderson, bravissimo!"

","Although it deserves only one star, I give it four because at least it was made. Fans have been thrown a bone here. Granted, a bone with no meat, but a bone none the less.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is time. This movie barely cracks the 90 minute mark, giving the entire story a rushed feeling. No time to establish characters. It's pretty obvious in the first 10 minutes who the survivor is going to be.<br/><br/>Remember how great Aliens was? We didn't see one Alien till well after an hour into the film. Why? To develop characters. Hicks, Hudson, Apone, Dietrich, Vasquez, Gorman, Bishop and the like all became such memorable characters, and it sucked when your favorite marine got killed.<br/><br/>That sense of development is clearly lost here. Plotwise it ain't so bad. They discover a temple in the Antarctic, so they send a team to investigate. Apparently, in ages past, the Predators used this temple to harvest Aliens, presuming the purpose is to then hunt the aliens as a sort of right of passage. So when the humans show up, they trigger the egg hatching process. A nearby Predator ship picks up on the signal and arrive to exterminate.<br/><br/>Again, not bad, but with the time constraints, the lack of any real effort in the acting department, and fight scenes that could have been better kept this from being a true sci-fi match-up.<br/><br/>The end of course, hints at a sequel. Lets just hope if that's so they get it right the 2nd time around."

This was absolutely incredible! Not a broken bone or chipped elbow after being thrown 10 feet across a room to land against a wall. I'm sorry, but this really brought down the movie for me.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like the movie enough to give it a 7 out of 10. Of course, I had low expectations going in.

","""Alien vs. Predator"" brings together the two most popular sci-fi monsters from the 1980's to duke it out in a winner-take-all battle. The question is: does anyone care? The tale begins when scientists discover an ancient pyramid mysteriously buried deep beneath the frozen surface of Antarctica. In no time, a team of explorers and archaeologists is dispatched to the site to investigate the puzzling phenomenon. While there, they discover that this is no ordinary ruin, but a temple established long ago by outer space aliens who have made their presence known in order to lure fresh human sacrifices into their trap.<br/><br/>With a premise that feels an awful lot like a warmed over version of ""The Thing,"" ""Alien vs. Predator"" spends virtually no time on character development and, instead, heads straight to the action - not an unusual course of events in a film of this kind, until one realizes that what distinguished both the original ""Alien"" and the original ""Predator"" from the typical action flick was having charismatic performers in the lead roles (Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, respectively). In contrast, Alexa Woods makes for a pretty wan heroine and the supporting players are not much better. And although this film predictably registers high on the goop meter, there isn't much inspiration to be derived - even for die-hard action fans - from what is, essentially, two CGI effects going at one another for nigh unto two hours. The sad truth is that the fight scenes quickly become monotonous and boring seeing as there is nobody on screen whose fate we really care about.<br/><br/>About the only real surprise in this film is that the obligatory ""fake scare"" scene, usually given to a cat to deliver, is here performed by a penguin."

","I saw Alien Vs. Predator and had ambivalent feelings about it. It definitely could have been a lot better, had better actors, better script, better reason and logic, and better atmosphere. It also could have been much worse than it was as well. What is does have going for it to some small degree is that the film was directed by Paul W. S. Anderson,a competent suspense, science fiction director accustomed to working with this kind of material. Anderson gives the audience what he thinks they want to see, and going by the money his movies make he doesn't fall far off the mark most of the time. For me(being someone I gratefully acknowledge as being outside the majority of the movie-going population) he disappoints with his cliché-ridden dialog, tissue-thin, stereotypical characters and plot threads, his over-used CGI effects, and his general arrogance to presume how little the movie-going population knows. Notwithstanding all of that, Alien Vs. Predator has some special moments. What did I like: some of the sets were impressive, a couple of the fights were well-executed, Lance Henriksen(being the only ""real"" actor in the film, and the Artic setting surrounding this hidden pyramid. I haven't gone into any detail of the plot for two reasons: (1)many other reviewers have already done so and (2)the plot is so ridiculous that any real scrutiny would be more enlightening than anything that happened in the film. Is ALien Vs. Predator entertaining? Yes, it is - like many accidents are. It has just enough going for it to keep the viewer engaged but never really satisfied."

Although, we can hardly speak about ""events"" in this ridiculous cinematic disaster...<br/><br/>Let's think about this: the Predators ruled the ancient Aztecs and some other ancient civilizations, they were returning periodically and organized great huntfests each time. BUT, in the first Alien, the Nostromo's crew doesn't know, what the hell is this acid-blooded, double-jawed killing machine they must deal with. So, if they are placing the AvP movie to the Earth and still no one has a clue about Aliens, what then? One can expect, that there will be no human survivors. But there IS one - but presumably she will not make it or no one will ever believe her.<br/><br/>That's the point. Such pointless situations in other movies have meanings or artistic values. But pronouncing a sentence, which contains the term ""artistic value"" regarding this movie is an insane act, which should be punished by the law...<br/><br/>So much for the ""plot"" or ""script"" of this movie, let's see the action. At first sight I went: ""Oh my, it's PG-13, what will Aliens and Predators do in the movie? Will they play chess? Will they bring flowers to each other or what? It's PG-13, for chrissakes!"" And this can be seen in every action scene in the movie <br/><br/>The Aliens are represented nowhere near as dangerous and threatening as in the previous 4 movies. Their movements are so corny, and the atmosphere during the scenes just doesn't fit. They are just like the other movie monsters - not that outstanding, well thought-out creatures, like they were in the Alien movies. The Predators... although, I always liked the Aliens better, but I must admit, that I realized too, that the Preds were so damn pitiful. They were like ""We are the Predators with capital P, so get out of our way, even if you are an acid-blooded killing machine. Oh, you won't? Well, then we must fight with them, guys. Oh, it's a pity, I would rather watch TV..."" I mean, how on Earth could they make the Preds so out of character? They are HUNTERS, they have a codex of honor, for crying out loud, they shouldn't have been represented like pompous, self-loving morons...<br/><br/>As for the back-story and the ""ideas"" in the ""script"": ""Let's chain down the Queen! Oooops, some of the other Aliens can spit acid on the handcuffs, and it's melting, because we couldn't make them acid-proof, while our spears are made of acid-proof material! That's how clever we are!"" - or maybe they wanted the Queen to escape, but the escape-scene supposed to be a significant event in the movie, and it failed miserably.<br/><br/>All in all: this movie is an insult for all Alien and Predator fans.<br/><br/>(Second part: viewed as stand-alone movie)<br/><br/>It's a decent movie, it has some action and a rather stupid story which is a lame excuse to bring the Preds and Aliens together. But it's watchable, so I give it a 6/10.<br/><br/>(Third part: a little explanation)<br/><br/>Finally I gave a 6/10 to the movie. You may watching this comment through the ""Loved It"" filter, because I gave a 6, and 6 is bigger than 5.4 (which is the movie's current rating). But I have to say, that I didn't ""love it"", because I'm a fan of the first two Alien and both of the Predator movies, and I had to watch it as an Alien or Predator movie. Then, after the movie ended, I thought, that ""Well, maybe it ruined the reputation of Aliens and Preds, but viewed as a stand-alone movie, it's waaaay better than for example Queen of the Damned, which was so boring and tedious, and it's nowhere near as stupid as League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.""<br/><br/>That's why I gave the movie 6/10, and not because I loved it - do not think that for a single moment!"
"mykepeters13","10","3","6","6 February 2005"," Alien versus Predator
","The people of this website said that this movie is a 5.5.That is wrong. If you put your expectations aside the movie is solid,it is actually pretty good.The one reason I voted a ten is because alien and predator are my two favorite movie creatures.The movie was pretty good all the way to the end when the queen kills the predator that sucked.Also the predator should have killed that one girl.The movie should have actually had a clear cut winner.We should have seen it coming.It happened in Freddy vs Jason.I think the predator would actually kick an alien's butt in a fight!I don't care what anyone else thinks!The movie was probably the best Predator movie."
"what_the_130","10","3","6","5 January 2005"," masterpiece!
","i have seen all of the alien movies and all of the predator movies, and i think that AVP is the 2nd best. aliens comes 1st. but for this movie to have come 2nd best in my books, (and take my word) AVP is one hell of a movie. the movie's suspense is just incredible and the violence is awesome. the plot is also pretty good although it does not work out right when the previous movies are plotted completely different 2 how the aliens got destructed. as my final word, i suggest u go and c this if u r a sci-fi buff!!!!!!! since i need 2 take up 10 lines, i will blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!blah blah!"
"Danny_G13","5","3","6","9 December 2004"," Great idea, badly done, but tolerable
","AVP was hyped as much as the second coming. 2 of the biggest sci-fi horror franchises coming together in an amalgamated effort designed to cash in on both's fanbases while hopefully not alienating (No pun intended) either market. Freddie V Jason had already been, and frankly was quite a pleasing effort which managed to be both entertaining and gory while being acceptably contrived. So in the same vein comes AVP which sees a fairly mediocre cast brought together as a group of scientific experts on a mission headed by Weyland, boss of Weyland industries, played by Lance Henrikson (In pretty much the only single homage to either franchise) whose imaging equipment has uncovered something big in Antarctica. On the mission to explore it things start to go predictably awry, and before long it's a battle between aliens and predators for something or other.<br/><br/>There's no doubt this film was great on paper - a cataclysmic battle between 2 of the biggest movie warrior-types around would make for a great movie if done properly. Problem is, not enough good work went into this.<br/><br/>Firstly the dialogue is quite toe-curlingly embarrassing. Lines like 'I'd rather have a gun and not need it than not have a gun and need it' serve to make you cringe, and conversations between characters are absolutely appalling at times with some of them laughing where there's nothing even funny. <br/><br/>Secondly the level of star here is truly b-movie rate. Even Lance Henrikson's appearance doesn't improve it much. Sure, there are plenty of folk you'll recognise, but their names will more often than not escape you. Only Ewan Bremner as Miller sprung to mind, and that was because I'd seen him in Snatch, and am myself Scottish so I know him.<br/><br/>Lastly is the truly boring direction and camera work. For such allegedly exciting content AVP doesn't half do a good job of boring you rigid. It never grips you, it never amazes you, it barely even entertains you. Appallingly drab and 'by-the-numbers' direction and camera work makes dead sure of that.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes have to be seen to be believed, and while we can all take a little cheese in sci-fi, pizza-sized fromage frais does not go down well. Quite nauseating and ridiculously stupid is the last reel.<br/><br/>The movie clearly takes itself way too seriously, and ends up being laughed at. It's not the worst film I'll ever see, but at times it wants to believe its the best.<br/><br/>Shame."
"shaworth9496","10","3","6","2 November 2004"," excellent
","i thought this film was a brilliant addition to the alien and predator films<br/><br/>i think it is much better than alien 3 and 4 and predator 2<br/><br/>there is tones of action and a very good story and the preds and humans teaming up to win was a great twist!<br/><br/>overall i think the aliens won the film because of the pred-alien at the end i think the aliens look and move very realistic they don't look like a man in a suit but there not obviously cgi like in alien 3<br/><br/>overall i think it is an excellent film and i give it 10 out o 10!"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","5","3","6","23 October 2004"," Weak, weak, incredibly weak.
","In fact AVP is weaker than a 10x recycled tea bag. You get my point...it's a very weak film. What else could be expected from Paul 'It's not my fault' Anderson? A man who is forever blaming studio interference for the poor quality of his films. What on earth Fox, Walter Hill and John Davis were thinking in hiring this hack I'm not sure I want to know. Trust me, no matter how naive and simple your film-going pleasures are, you will walk away from AVP forever jaded and cynical. <br/><br/>Both franchises are best examples of their genre.<br/><br/>Alien-Utterly faultless Aliens-Breathtaking hardcore sci-fi action Predator-Just so brilliant words fail to describe it Predator 2-Underrated sequel that plays like a story taken directly from a 1950 Tales from the Crypt comic-book. Alien 3-Notorious failure but far superior to AVP. Alien Resurrection-Very strange but intriguing weirdo sequel with some wonderfully unique touches.<br/><br/>And now...<br/><br/>AVP: Alien vs Predator-Watered down, childish, repetitive, boring, completely flat, soulless and castrated.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson simply has no idea where the heart of either franchises is. He directs the film with arrogance and over-confidence. Undeniable proof of this is obvious in the scene where Sebastian says 'It's all beginning to make sense now.' <br/><br/>I'm sorry, the sense must have been lost and me and the rest of the audience.<br/><br/>Having seen AVP in the cinema twice now I must stress to you that the film does NOT hold up in repeat viewings. After being surprised at how 'not too bad' it was the first time, the rotten dialogue, endless exposition, slow set-up and lack of actual Alien vs Predator fighting damn this film to hell. Much like the main faults of last years Freddy vs Jason, though at least that film was a hard R-rated movie and not a kids movie.<br/><br/>For a crossover franchise that has existed for over 14 years throughout many different forms of media, the AVP movie should have been an epic directed by someone with talent. Instead Anderson craps all over the source material and directs the worst film of his toilet dwelling career. AVP plays like a bunch of cut-scenes from the video games and totally devoid of any originality. In one particular scene he blatantly and obviously rips off a narrative from HP Lovecrafts At The Mountains Of Madness. The nerve!<br/><br/>There are plot holes all over the place and massive gaps in logic. Like why does the acid blood conveniently only corrode weapons the Predator doesn't really need? And why oh why do they hunt in Antartica? The are drawn to earth areas of heat and conflict.<br/><br/>Just as horror movies are desperate to come up with new, better reasons to make the use of cell phones not available to the dying one-by-one characters, AVP uses the most asinine reason to isolate the cast so no one can help.<br/><br/>Get your head around this monstrosity...the Predators hunt Aliens in a pyramid 2000 feet below the ice on a remote island in Antartica.<br/><br/>WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>Of course they do. And the next Robocop movie is set in a volcano below Vietnam. Honestly, it is the most ridiculous story ever concocted. How dare they release this gibberish upon an audience who, for a long time, deserve better.<br/><br/>Despite the utterly moronic plot and pathetic characters, the film does do a decent job of tying both creatures together. Such as the Predator's fondness for triangles and multiples of ten. The Weyland-Yutani corporation's initial interest in the species. And the presence of Lance Henrikson, as Bishop's creator and the only cast member with credibility.<br/><br/>The Predators get very little screen time (much of the film's meagre 101 minute running time-14 minutes of credits-is devoted to wandering around dark corridors...how astonishingly new) and when they do show up they are total wimps. Though the main one is a bit harder, he's a bit too humanized at the end. His facial expressions are very, very cool however.<br/><br/>One cannot help how much better this film could have been. Even with the awful Anderson at the helm, if Alan Silvestri's scores and themes from the Predator movies had been kept then the tame action scenes would have soared. As it is, Harald Kloser's score to the movie is generic and unengaging. Yet another missed opportunity.<br/><br/>The ending hints at a sequel. If it's anything like this count me out."
"carlos_pimentel","10","3","6","3 October 2004"," AVP ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!
","I Liked this movie a lot, this movie for me is a blockbuster!! The sfx where Xtremely good and the Predator's cloaking efx where better than in the predator movies. Some things that I liked in the predators where their weapons( Blade disks, Spears, The overgrown blades, the cutting nets, plasma cannons), Vision Modes And the pyramid hologram that they used to visualize the interior of the pyramid. The Alien efx where the best! The Aliens even looked more realistic. The battle scenes where very good, and gory to. Some of the scenes that I really appreciated where the scene where the predator is almost killing Lex and the Aliens tail trespasses the cloaked predator body. The other one is the fight between the Alien and the Predator. The other one was the Queen's fight. The face hugger attack and The history off the pyramid. The acting was excellent, and the story very original.<br/><br/>But one thing that I noticed in the Predator was it's mandibles, that where wrong. But the rest off it as OK. The Queen was right and the Aliens to. And one aspect that is definitely the rightest of all is the form off the chest burster (Serpent like shape: no arms or legs). After saying all this, I only have to say is that if you are an Alien and Predator movie fans you must see the two creatures in one movie, FIGHTING each other. My Rating 10/10***"
"Spawnie051","10","3","6","26 August 2004"," The best that could be done
","There is a lot of ppl that r upset about the outcome of this movie. Why? Did Anderson do something wrong? Nope he didn't. This movie was very entertaining, and I agree that the plot has some holes, but nothing that drastic. The predators didn't look smart enough for u? Or competent? YES THEY DID! The first 2 get dispatched because of the circumstances. The Predators had no trouble in killing all those humans, they did it in a spectacular predator matter. This story combines all the Predator movies and the Alien movies together. This story is supposed to happen in between the 2. This movie had no proper fonding to become great! Anderson really did some great work on the action scenes. If u're only interested into picking the movie into tiny little pieces, then obviously u're not gonna have fun watching it. This movie wouldn't even happen if it wasn't for the fans, and now because all of your small picking it might never get a sequel.<br/><br/>F A Q: to save u the trouble of killing yourself with stupid questions<br/><br/>In this movie aliens hatch out of chest much faster then in other alien movies! U're gonna ask yourself about their acid blood many times in the movie, well don't it's irrelevant! There r more aliens in the movie being killed then they actually hatched, yes also a minor detail. It would be like saying: hey he fired 10 shots from that 357 (happends all the time in movies) I've been talking to fans in other forums and they said that in the comics the pair up between a girl and a Predator actually happened. So does in this movie, and although u all think it was stupid and too touchy, I say it was pretty much appropriate. Yes the woman's character is made a bit too tough, but also a minor detail. She kills an Alien, so in a way helps the Predator. The Predators always recognize honor and the kill. U keep what u kill. I don't know why everyone wants to underrastemate the aliens so much, yes they r hive minded, but they r also great killing machines. Their strength and agility r not to be undermined. I believe that the Director's cut will give u what u're missing in the movie. <br/><br/>I for one gave this movie a 10 just because it made to the theater and gave me 2 hours of entertainment."
"Mrs_Peel2","10","3","6","30 August 2004"," Bravo!
","Two years ago I was sitting in the movie theater when suddenly I thought how nice it would be for another Alien film to come out. When I heard they were making AVP, I was delighted. I waited patiently, and because I love these movies so much, it was really hard to do! Although I felt that the last two Alien films could have been better, I still couldn't wait to see what they were going to do with AVP. I'd like to say that that was one hell of a movie, everything about it I enjoyed! And I can be really critical, but there was NOTHING wrong with this film,in fact I went to see it three times, and plan on seeing it again, I enjoyed it so much. I can't wait for the DVD to be released!"
"homerbetty","10","3","6","28 August 2004"," Entertained and content
","I have been a fan of the movie Predator since it first came out and I've been a fan of the Alien movies for the last ten years or so...I have been anticipating this film for quite some time. Having read the novels and comic books like most other fans of the two genres, I admit that my expectations were a bit higher than your average viewer, but that does not mean that I expected the film to meet my expectations. This film took small portions of both movie franchises and combined them very well into a new and entertaining film franchise. The key here is ""film"" franchise. While the story was a bit weak from the human perspective it added a history to the running story-line from the other films and provided a key element to bring them all together for the average viewer. Not everyone has read AvP comic books or played the video games...most people think of them separately and look at this film from a more conventional point of view. All in all, the visual effects were awesome and the creatures lived up to their preset movie standards. The PG-13 rating ensured that there was not too much gratuitous violence...at least as far as the humans were concerned. I know who I think won but I do not want to spoil the movie for anyone. The film did not match the AvP comic book story-lines but it did nothing to detract from those story-lines as far as I can tell. Even if it did, I became a fan of the Aliens and Predators based on the movies and not on the comic books and novels. In that respect I am content with the movie, extremely entertained and waiting anxiously for the film's DVD release."
"djspeeddog","10","3","6","27 August 2004"," Well worth seeing in the theatre. At least on a matinee.
","As I am a longtime fan of both the Alien and Predator series (even the Alien3!), I admit I'm a little biased. This was one the best deliveries since Aliens. Not as good, mind you....but still pretty d*mn good. Good storyline, good cgi, good casting, reasonabe writing. I always looked upon the Predator series with almost a B-movie fondness, but AVP is definitely ""Top Shelf Sci-Fi""! Though, I have no idea why they gave it a ""PG"" rating. Kids under 13 should not see this film. It might be a bit much. Don't want to scar their fragile minds. (Let's Leave that job to the 6 o'clock news!)<br/><br/>Anyway...a winner...10 out of 10."
"Xavier_Creed","10","3","6","21 August 2004"," This is the one to not miss!
","Okay this was a great movie, it had tons of action and didn't leave me wanting. It had great camera work, action sequences, character development, and it didn't drag on making you feel like you wasted your time and money like some movies! *cough* Bourne Supremacy *cough*! I would even say it was better then Kill Bill and it's sequel! I highly suggest this movie it's very good, I brought someone that didn't see any of the Bug or Pred flicks and she loved it and then we watched the other movies and she still says that the AvP flick was the best of them all. I know she's crazy the 2nd alien flick was the best. lol People come on here and whine and complain about the movie saying ""they knew it was going to suck"" or some crap like that. I say, ""Then why did you go see it?"" Look people it's not the number one movie is Canada for nothing. And if I hear one crack about Canada from any Americans so help me God! People liked it and a lot loved it. I've talked to a lot of people that are BIG fan freaks of the Aliens and Predator movies, and they loved the movie also. So for anyone that watched it and hated it, you're part of a VERY small minority....and you're wrong deal with it or keep it to yourself. To everyone else, go se the movie and make up your own mind as it should be. Don't listen to others ranting and raving, think for yourself! In my opinion this movie was GREAT, I can't wait for AvP2, I'm going to buy them both! Oh yeah.....GO BUGS GO, BUGS RULE!!!!!!<br/><br/>***A BIG 10 OUT OF 10, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED***"
"jiromba","10","3","6","19 August 2004"," Quite good, but could be better
","The AVP movie, is a quite good action movie, for fans of both creatures... the extensevily explored Alien character, and the AWESOME, not-so-explored-I-don't-know-why, Predator.<br/><br/>C'mon... Predator 1 was EXCELLENT... but Predator 2... was quite boring.<br/><br/>I believe, if you go to watch this movie, wearing the proper ""outfit"" (the will to see a science fiction movie, with a lot of ""fantastic"" things), you should be as pleased as I am.<br/><br/>I was expecting... NOTHING.<br/><br/>Maybe that's why I became very happy for the movie, and I really recommend it.<br/><br/>However... as I saw it, the movie could be better... with more battle scenes, more 1 on 1 confrontation and more Alien trap's and Predator's gadget's... not to mention the ending.<br/><br/>Anyway... is a very good science-fiction, action movie... in it's category, I give it a grade 4 out 5.<br/><br/>And recommend for those who can remember how to feel like a young kid again."
"Master_Alucard","7","3","6","16 August 2004"," My opinion
","It was an awesome movie overall, but there are a few things I didn't like, such as the following: You see the Predators and Aliens almost right away(there should've been more mystery about their presence), the Predators cloaking appearance was kinda sucky(it was better in the previous movies), the Predator's vision was no longer inferred like in the previous movies, the Pred's faces were different than the original. Despite all that, I did like it a lot because the Predators kicked some tail in the movie, it was accurate to the books, I liked that a lot. I wouldn't mind seeing the movie everyday for the next 2 weeks, I can't wait until it comes on DVD."

","I am picky about movies, i hated only Alien Resurrection but loved the rest of em, also the two predators which are great. THis movie i loved completely...it was fast and furious, no fat to trim. But yes this movie could have been longer, they could've shown more and more but hopefully all of the opinions the fans have will make it to PWSA ears and we'll get something better next time around. But this was as good as it gets...<br/><br/>tell the haters to bugger off!<br/><br/>(hey, did the pyramid forget to change every ten minutes or whatever close to the end of the flick?)"
"Lysa_and_Rick","10","3","6","16 August 2004"," We didn't lose
","This was a great film, exciting, scary, entertaining and fun. As one of my kids said afterword, ""that didn't seem like it was over 2 hours!"". The movie was over, and we wanted more. My other kid said ""that was the best movie I've seen yet"". They're both ready to see it again, or see a possible sequel. Anderson did a good job with this, and should be proud of himself. The little touches that tied this movie into the Alien series were well done, including the use of ""the knife trick"". The only gripe I have is the tagline used in the commercials...""Whoever wins, we lose""...not at all accurate once you've seen the movie. Better would have been ""If the serpent gets free, we all lose""."
"bowang227","10","3","6","16 August 2004"," awesome
","I wasn't expecting much with the pg-13 label since both of the original series were rated R. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of violence they were able to get away with though. the acting on the part of the humans are pretty pathetic but its OK because this way you don't get too attached to them when they get killed. the special effects were great because they were mostly physical and not cgi. this was the first action movie that i saw where people actually clapped at the screen.<br/><br/>great action, but not so great story, but who cares, i go to the movies usually to escape reality. buy a big tub of popcorn because this is the perfect pop corn movie ever.<br/><br/>ps. why did the drilling team carry guns as standard equipment?"
"Vivian_Tong","10","3","6","15 August 2004"," Awesome movie!
","I am not going to deny it. I've been waiting for this movie. I've been keeping track of it through the official website and was soo psyched to see it. It is everything I had hoped for and everything that I didn't hope for. I think Paul Anderson did a great job. He made a great film because he himself is a fan of the two franchises and he brought in Lance Henriksen. C'mon, we all knew Lance made the movie complete. Without him it might has well have been a flop. Thank you Lance Henriksen and Thank you Paul Anderson for getting Lance to sign on to the movie. I really loved the storyline, which made sense...at least to me it did. I really loved how they eased back on the CGI and went with actual models and animatronics. It was done quite lovely. Some people complained about some funny lines like, ""...finding Moses' DVD collection."", but I thought it was intentional. You have to have a few funny lines in a movie otherwise it would be too droll. The only thing that bothered me was the time continuity of the facehugger to the chest burster. I'm sure most Alien fans will pick that up."
"Max_VI","10","3","6","15 August 2004"," The Greatest Sci-Fi film you'll see this year
","Does Alien V Predator have tons of blood and gore? Nope, but as a great film maker once said, Violence is far better when it is implicit, not explicit. For those of you who are not particularly up on your vocabulary, that means that violence is much better when implied in some other fashion other than by visual means. Was there action? Yes, some damn good action. Great thing is from the beginning we aren't immediately thrown in between the war with the two species, we're given some character, some background. The movie's atmosphere makes it one hell of a solid action sci-fi picture. And contrary to popular belief this movies atmosphere is very dark and creepy despite the fact that the blood and gore is very minimal. The movie I honestly think retains a good amount of scariness, balanced with an interesting back story on the Predators and Aliens. It's not the perfect film by any means. I will say this however, there is no possible way to make a better Alien Vs Predator movie than this one. I was never once bored watching it and was very entertained by this movie as well as the interesting ending."
"sid2000","1","3","6","13 August 2004"," What happened?????
","I am a bit confused here, when did Predators become team players? And when did the gestation period of an alien take 5 minutes? It must have been the cold, as we all know cold is the most effective catylist. In short, the people who made AVP are truly what sci-fi nerds call geeks. They like the same stuff but when it comes down to it its like watching a handicap kid get in a fight with a ziploc bag, its ...just really said. I would say the whole team played five minutes of AVP2 and jumped up and said hey lets make a movie. I have never seen such a cut up clusterfuck of unmatched parts. The day a Predator makes a shield and staff out of alien parts for his human counterpart is the day Ripley gets a sex change and becomes the cover girl for Vogue. But then again she was able to out run both Predators and aliens who on average can run up to 55 mph. And magically while cutting up an alien the same metal another Predator used seemed to be uneffected by the hydrochloric acid. Personally i think i'd want my breast plate and wristblades to be as strong as my swiss army knife. I really think Fox turned their back and let this idiot make this film. I mean the slogan ""whoever wins we lose"" didn't make sense because if the alien won the last Predator would self destruct out of honor and if the Predator won they would be back next year, but no instead they both die and the human is the only one left, wow give the dumbshit in charge of advertising a raise. My point being don't waste 6+ dollars on this film wait till its on DVD to rent for 3. And personally after this and the first Resident Evil movie i have no plans to see another movie made by Anderson including Apocalypse."
"MinorityReporter","1","4","10","16 September 2005"," Ridiculously bad!
","My one line summary pretty much sums up my feelings and thoughts on this movie. I never usually comment on films unless I've seen them more than two times so as to get the details of the film and attempt to look at the film more objectively. That is, however, not the case with AVP as having to sit through this film again might have resulted in my suicide. Grossly exaggerated of course but I really couldn't understand how the once mighty alien has become reduced to this piece garbage. Why did the studio give the OK for this film that clearly should have died in the early stages of pre-production. Paul W.S. Anderson should have had his license to make films removed so as not to create this kind of garbage ever again.<br/><br/>The original Alien film had some of the best acting I have ever seen in a Sci-fi film and the uniqueness was in the fact that the characters seemed really down to earth and their reactions were believable. I think they have been described as truckers in space. That is not the case with AVP. In this film its more like supermodels in space (except of course its not in space but on earth). The film copies the original Alien in the sense that quite a long time is taken to build up the characters and make them believable. They should have picked some better actors then. Sanaa Lathan has to be one of the worst leading ladies since Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls. She sucks on every front. Her performance seems forced and unbelievable. Her ability to seem scared is pretty much non-existent making the ""horror"" scenes seem fake. Raoul Bova was obviously cast because of his accent as the director might have thought it would bring a little spice to the film. That is, however, not the case and when you think about it the accent is all there is to the character which is otherwise flat and unbelievable. Lance Henriksen does his best and his character is without a doubt the most credible in the entire film. However, the dialog is very poor which doesn't exactly leave him with a lot to work with. The rest of the cast is pretty bad as well and I won't go into details about them as it would be the same all the way through.<br/><br/>The effects aren't that good. I thought they were better in Alien Resurrection (also a bad film) which was made in 1997. The fact that 7 years has passed should have meant that something would have happened in the effects department but it really hasn't in this case. At one point an alien trips up a predator using its tail and you can literally see the predator falling backwards on purpose the effects and action is that bad. The predators have quite a few stunts but the bulky suits make the predators look clumsy rather than gracious. The fact that there is little to no gore in this film ruins it almost completely. The gore was obviously removed for financial reasons. If the film had a PG-13 rating kids would be able to see the film as well and it would make more money but there is just something terribly wrong with seeing a chest-burster scene without the gore. It just isn't done.<br/><br/>The overall story is ridiculous so I won't go into it other than that. The story was obviously secondary. It was just a loose draft which would then justify some heavy action between the aliens and the predators but since the action is horrible there are no saving graces for the film. AVP is a horrible mainstream action movie that disgraces all the previous films with the alien in it. It almost makes me wish there was a 0 rating. Avoid it at all costs.<br/><br/>1/10"
"bob the moo","Null","4","10","2 November 2004"," An OK film if you want monsters punching each other, but if you want anything else then you'll be out of luck (SPOILERS - as if it matters)
","When a satellite belonging to the Weyland Corporation picks up a heat trace on a remote island in the Antarctic, investigation reveals it to be some form of pyramid, hundreds of feet under the ice. Putting together a team to go under the ice, Weyland leads a group that includes an ice climber environmentalist, pyramid experts, people who date stuff, drillers and a couple of really big guys with guns. When they come to drill they discover a perfectly formed shaft at 30 degrees going down to the pyramid and take it down as the easy way. However reaching the bottom they quickly get separated by the shifting structure of the pyramid and it is all too late before they realize that they are not alone and may only be a side issue in a bigger story.<br/><br/>It is ironic that, in the year that marks the 50th anniversary of Godzilla, I found myself sitting in a multiplex watching two men in monster suits punching each other. The acting may be (marginally) better and the effects cost more but that it basically what this film comes down to, and to enjoy this film it is important you get your head around that as quickly as possible. If you come here expecting plot, acting, scares or quality then you are maybe best to just go somewhere else. But if all you want is two men going 'BOSH' and 'BANG' while wearing monster suits then you've pretty much hit the motherload with AvP. This is not to say that it is any good whatsoever because it really isn't, but if all you want is very basic action then you'll find it passing the time (albeit only a very short 80 minutes). I didn't hate it  and that's about as good as I can say about it.<br/><br/>The actual action has no real scares or jumps to it and fails to have anything approaching a palatable tension. The effects are pretty good and some of the fights are alright despite the editor cutting them so quickly that it is hard to really see what is going on. Outside of the spectacle of the film there is really not a great deal else worth turning up for. The plot is delivered by characters who seem to be able to work out what is going on very easily so that they can tell us  if it was me I'd be running shouting 'WTF' but these guys take the time to explain to one another the story. This is clunky and about as annoying as it sounds and it creates a second problem  characterisation. The problem is that there is none. The characters are mainly killed off very quickly and we never really care about them because to us, like to the aliens and predators, they are only incidentals to the main event. Certainly the character of Woods seems to have been intended as a Ripley stand in but having her in a sort of 'mismatched buddy' movie with the Predator failed to get me interested and instead had me trying not to laugh at the whole idea! I must give credit to the writers for at least coming up with a vaguely good concept to make this film happen but beyond this premise the plot is no good at all and the script feels like it was written by someone who had never written a script before  it was a serviceable script but not a convincing one.<br/><br/>The cast pretty much know that they are meat and many of them can barely make an impact. The casting is quite interesting because there are only one or two instantly recognisable stars but the majority of them are 'where have I seen him before' faces  eg the guy from James Bond, the guy from Braveheart etc. Lathan tries to be Ripley but fails; the only praise I can give her is she managed to keep a straight face no matter how stupid her scenes were. Bova is OK and is good looking but again has nothing to do. The last time I saw Bremner was a few weeks ago in a short about ME  in fairness maybe stuff like this pays his rent and allows him to do more interesting work but he can certainly do better than this. The rest of the cast are pretty much fodder that last 20 minutes if that, but special bile is reserved for Henriksen who really should have known better. The film didn't need him to tie into the Alien series and, for all he does, he really shouldn't have bothered  he did have some good stuff in other alien films but this was too much. The Predator is OK but has lost the vicious edge that made him compelling in the first film, but the Alien at least is a menacing character (well, apart from the silly lumbering featured in the final scenes).<br/><br/>Overall this was not terrible, it was just not any good. Men dressed in suits throw each other around and CGI effects gallop up walls in the dark while things go bang. If that is all you want then this film just about manages to deliver that in a very basic fashion. But if you are looking for plot, dialogue, characters, genuine excitement or tension then you might as well just p1ss off home now because there ain't none of that here for you! How cheering it is though, to see that 50 years after Japan started the ball rolling, Hollywood is keeping up tradition of poor movies based solely on the idea of two men in rubber suits throwing each other around a set. And they say there are no original ideas left..."
"tobias_lane","Null","5","14","14 August 2004"," first hour descent, potential ending spoiler
","I just got out of one of the most disappointing films that I paid $7.00 to see. Alien vs. Predator was a film that crossover fans have been waiting to see. Who would win? Predator hunts by infrared, aliens do not give out heat (Aliens reference). Aliens hunt by sight, Predator cloaks themselves.<br/><br/>I will admit, I had enjoyed the first hour of the film, the character development, the set up for the rest of the film. Then the whole movie takes a nosedive into crap. I enjoyed the little nuances of the Alien series (Bishop Weyland, no matter what the debate on his character is, and the knife/hand scene), the team that is split up and has to walk down corridors to escape and is ultimately hunted down by the Aliens (Alien reference), and how the team on the surface is killed off by the predator.<br/><br/>When one of the characters decides to team up with the Predator is where they lost me. For one, the menacing presence of the Predator and given an almost human quality was a horrible move. To see the human siding with the Predator gives the movie's tagline ""No matter what side wins, we lose"" has no credibility.<br/><br/>A friend had a suggestion to what would have made this film work. Give it a The Thing feel and have them doing a dig on Antarctica and uncovering both species and have all hell break loose. Both species destroy each other while the humans have to find their way out. You can still have all the chestbursters you want. A twist that I thought that might have worked is that the woman who survives happens to be an ancestor of Ripley and maybe have the man be a relative of Arnold's character. It is only an idea."
"strangelexicon","1","3","7","4 August 2006"," I'm afraid its very difficult to see any positives in this
","Quite frankly, I believe that this movie should be in the IMDb bottom 100. It is really that bad. But with so many (suspect) votes, perhaps I should contemplate further to check out any possible positives that this movie has? Some of us like the Alien franchise so much that we would just force ourselves to suffer through this. What could the positives be? The SFX - Paul Anderson promised to not use CGI. He lied. Very bad CGI has been used in important scenes. The rest of scenes ie the Aliens with people in suites are quite convincing looking because they were done by the original SFX team. Despite that, the Aliens behave more like stray dogs and zoo animals than the monsters they are supposed to be. The results are quite embarrassing. The Predators also act like buffoons rather than stealthy killers. In one scene, the Predator runs like a ramp model.<br/><br/>Creativity....should not be confused with dreaming. A Pyramid buried under the Antarctic containing Aliens and all makes this a sort of fantasy film. The realistic horror is what made other Alien and Predator films stand out. With shoddy camera work, poor props and implementation, even the minimal allowance goes away.<br/><br/>Fight scenes...show the Alien tail held by strings and the Predator blades to bend like rubber. Admitedly, this is a very difficult scene to perfect but if you don't have a Cameron like talent, you should not even try. Ultimately, while it starts out good, it ends up like a wrestling match.<br/><br/>That about sums up any possible positives that this movie had and they were really, not positive at all. Everything else in this movie is really bad as other reviews have indicated. Be sure to check out the goofs section too. There are really too many."

Basically its the same two films which we both love which have been added together, unfortunately 1 + 1 do not make 2 on this film.

Anyone reading this will probably feel i have been harsh but i was deeply offended by this film by the fact it was such a let down.

","As an Italian, let me apologize for having exported such a weird wax-statue of an actor as Raul Bova: fortunately the movie is so bad, that Bova is not its worst part.<br/><br/>Others have written about how bad it is and why it is so bad, so let me just spend some words solidarity with Predators, for the sad evolution of their race.<br/><br/>On the first movie - let aside the strange flawness of the Predator technology, preventing them from seeing anything covered by a layer of sh.. - it took a full-size Schwarzy, and a good amount of luck, to kill a Predator (and, anyway, after it had slaughtered a bunch of guerrillas, mercenaries and Apollo Creed, all armed to the teeth).<br/><br/>Sadly on the second movie a Danny Glover, appareantly fully recovered from the finding of a bomb in his W.C., was more than enough for them. We also discover that even Predators have a should, and don't kill pregnant polices (of course, unless their fetus is covered with sh..).<br/><br/>Eventually this movie, after promising us the fight between the best hunter and the fiercest prey, after showing how evolute and powerful Predators were some thousand years ago, reducing Aliens to chains and building an entire civilization to guard their zoo-cage, tells us that the best they can do nowadays is to send these pale imitations of the Three Stooges (their race champions, I guess, as they can take this hunt only once in a century) to get their ass kicked in less than a minute.<br/><br/>Poor Schwarzy taking that much effort in besting such dumb asses... maybe he should reconsider quitting action and give himself to politics."

","Which was done years ago of people who probably would want no association with this movie whatsoever. Its remarkably how they have managed to take these so perfectly designed horror creatures that has made so many great scares before and turn it into nothing. The action scenes have no impact, the camera-work is laughable and the editing takes away the suspense. About the humans? Well the woman is good looking at least. Mr Lance Henriksen should be ashamed. And I cant understand the point of making the predator so superior to the alien. Actually I thought that the alien would be far stronger and the predator would have to outsmart it. Then again, its a long time since I saw the original movies. Best bet to get some chills and see some proper film-making would be, I guess, to make an alien vs predator night in which you see Scotts 'Alien' original from 1979 and then see the original 'Predator' from 1987 and then discuss who you think would win. Any discussions made after that would prove more interesting than this movie, but what did you expect?"

","The creators/writers of this film had obviously no respect for either franchise. I don't understand how some people on these boards say that people who didn't like the movie are being overly critical. The truth is that even if you are not a alien/predator geekboy, the film does not stand up at all. I felt nothing for the characters, i thought the action sequences were really badly done and the story was awful. To anyone who disagrees, i say do this....go back and watch alien, aliens and alien 3, then predator and predator 2...ok? now all those films had an interesting story and they all had reasonable character development (you actually cared what happened) and they all were fun to watch ( hell i even liked alien 4). The main point is that even if a film is science fiction, it should still make sense in its own way....with this film there were so many gaps in logic that i realised that the creators of this film really didn't care about the end result....they were just looking to make bucks. Its funny, films like alien and predator were risky projects at the times they came out cos nobody new they would do well...and it amazes me that movie companies are willing to risk on the first film, but after that if it does well, they all try to rehash the same story over and over. I was really disappointed with this film, i remember playing the alien versus predator game a few years ago (my first introduction to this crossing of the two franchises), and thinking what a great film it would make. I just don't understand why the creators of the film felt the need to bring the story to present dayand make gradoise claims about the origin of civilisation....if they wanted to cut the special effects costs, they should have based it in a remote futuristic laboratory where scientists discover something in the aliens the predators want and shot it all in doors, reducing alien and predator on screen time to a minimum as in previous films, and building up the tension. There was simply no tension here....i would have preferred it if they had just spliced up the first couple of films from either franchise and directly combined em...it would have made a much more entertaining story."

","I'm going to start out on the good ideas.<br/><br/>Good Idea: Putting together the two scariest aliens together in a battle and humans getting in the middle. How perfect is that? Examples: King Kong vs. Godzilla, Freddy vs. Jason, and Dracula vs. Frankenstein. It's a plot well used, and very loved by horror fans. The ending was also very cool, which I will not spoil. You'll just have to trust me on that. The characters are pretty well developed and bringing back Lance was a interesting and exciting concept. You have the same feel from the original movies. The best part is that I think the director, he wasn't trying to upstand the original Alien and Predator movies. He knew that they could never be touched and didn't feel the ultimate need for CGI effects.<br/><br/>Bad Idea: First off, Antarctica. This is the coldest place on Earth, 50 below zero is summer time in that country. All the explorers wore was one winter coat, and the girl takes her jacket off at the end. She would've froze to death. As along with the others, because one coat would never keep them warm enough. I know that ""Alien vs. Predator"" was a comic book, but the stories could never realistically be put together. ""Alien"" was set in the future and in space. ""Predator"" was set in the jungle and the creature was a man hunter. It being on the side of the humans didn't make much sense. Some very typical and predictable points in the movie were used and very stupid people.<br/><br/>Over all, it's not a bad movie to watch, but I wouldn't really watch it again.<br/><br/>6/10"

I know you're thinking, ""A run on sentence and that's all its about? 'Whoever wins, we lose'?"" Yes, you do lose. You lose for watching it.<br/><br/>However.<br/><br/>Once you get through all the atrocious dialog, bad timing, and shoddy (at best) paintings of pyramids 2000 feet below the surface of Antarctica, you get to the meat of AVP. Detach yourself from linear time and step into movie time. This movie is essentially a prequel to the Alien series and establishes their conception as a species. Long story short, Predator creates Alien in a lab (they should have cut to a montage of Predators in lab coats looking down into a beaker with a HR Giger designed clipboard nodding, and maybe sharing a laugh with a strategically placed copy of Richard Connell's short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" in the background all to Herman's Hermit's ""I'm into Something Good""), Alien evolves and flies off into space where thousands of years later it runs into Ripley's crew and ignites Sigourney Weaver's career.

"Movie Nuttball","10","3","7","3 February 2005"," AVP: Alien Vs. Predator is one outstanding film!
","One of the most anticipated films in history is AVP: Alien Vs. Predator! After many years of waiting for this ultimate feature film it finally arrives in the year 2004! Was it as good as the original Alien saga & Predator saga (Alien - 1979, Aliens - 1986, Alien 3 - 1992, Alien Resurrection - 1997, Predator - 1987, Predator 2 - 1990)? I think so in My opinion. Did it live up to the hype? Yes! Was the film what I expected? It was actually much more than what I had expected. Was the musical score great? Heck yes! Does newcomer composer Harald Kloser have a winning score like the other films do? OH YES! Does Paul W.S. Anderson deliver great direction? He delivers it all! I am I happy with the film overall? A big yes! Why? I will explain further as I go on. The film has one of the most different castings including Lance Henriksen, Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Ewen Bremner, Colin Salmon, Tommy Flanagan, Ian Whyte and Tom Woodruff Jr. Henricksen has now been in three Alien films and now a Predator film! An interesting thing is now that he has been in Alien, Predator, and Terminator films which is really unusual. Readers of Dark Horse comics will now what I'm talking about. Anyway Lance acts very good in this film. Lathan and Bova also are pretty good in it. In the film Bova reminded a lot of actor Olivier Martinez. Tommy Flanagan was also good and he looked quite different in this picture. Everyone else is good. Since Kevin Peter Hall is sadly no longer with us his presence is missed very much as the Predator but the new Predator played by the huge Ian Whyte plays this classic role very well and he has a very convincing performance as a Predator. The Predators looks as great as ever! They all have different personalities especially the played by Whyte. As for the Aliens they too look as great as ever! The Alien Queen looks as awesome as ever and she really gets respect in this one. I was so disappointed how the Alien Queen was in Alien Resurrection. Fans of this Alien character will admire her in this film! The story of the film is really good. I am really surprised about the theories in this. Honestly I believe these theories and in My opinion there may be some truth in this film. The special effects are just tremendous! I was amazed by how realistic everything is! The action is also tremendous and I love the camera work. It was outstanding to see the Aliens and Predators together! The musical score by Harald Kloser is just wonderful. He doesn't use any of the music in the previous films by Jerry Goldsmith, James Horner, Alan Silvestri etc. but he has his own themes and such. I just love the theme he composed and the other music such as the alien fights. Another thing I just really love about it is the magical sounding in some places. I recommend that you do what I did buy the score from Amazon.com. Its truly a wonderful score. The creature effects by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr. is just as great as the previous works in the previous films. The direction by Paul W.S. Anderson is just great. I love the way he made this film. He is one of My favorite directors and if there is a sequel to this film or one of the titled characters I would love for him to direct it. Well, this is My opinion of the film. I am pleased with it even though the film goes by very fast but I think that's because the film is action packed and just that great! If you are a hardcore Alien and Predator film fan, Alien and Predator comic fan, and/or fan of the two in general and like Lance Henriksen, Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Tommy Flanagan, the rest of the cast, Paul W.S. Anderson, and want to hear some of the greatest music then I strongly recommend that you head over to you local video or department store or stop by Amazon.com and buy the DVD or VHS today! <br/><br/>Movie Nuttball's NOTE:<br/><br/>If you like alien movies and/or the subject of aliens I also recommend the following films: The Thing from another World, The War of the Worlds, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Horror Express, The UFO Incident, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, John Carpenter's The Thing, Krull, Time Walker, Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn, My Science Project, Howard the Duck, John Carpenter's Starman, John Carpenter's They Live, Mac and Me, Explorers, Invaders from Mars, Alien Seed, Total Recall, The Abyss, Communion, Suburban Commando, Fire in the Sky, The Arrival, Mars Attacks!

","It's been many years of waiting for an Alien vs. Predator film and when I first heard about it, the rating was still pending. I read a few interviews from the actors starring in the film speaking of their violent deaths and such, and then I finally get to the see the trailer. What's this? PG-13! I quickly came to terms with the rating and still wanted to see it. I then waited patiently.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie is released and I'm in the theaters first night with a friend with an equally love for both franchises. As Freddy vs. Jason (Which is another vs. movie I will not compare this film with) was a full theater as well, this one was different. You see, I never heard so many people laughing at a movie at once. The scene when the predator fashioned a spear and shield for the only surviving female character in the film was the best, as the entire theater was filled with genuine laughter and knee slaps. Brilliant! Me Tarzan, you Jane! What was wrong with this film? Plot holes, dialogue which I've seen better written in porno flicks, worthless back stories to characters that die within a half hour, and did I mention plot holes? Take for instance, why was the predator in the beginning the only one with who had problems with the acidic blood from the alien? After that, it seemed everyone could stab and slash at the aliens regardless of such consequences or it just seems they were forgotten.<br/><br/>I think the worst part of this movie was the idea. People say this film is the prequel to Alien films and sequel to predator films when that is ridiculous! To think the Predators can see if you have a baby inside the womb or some cancer inside your lungs, but to think that the predators have dealt with these aliens for countless years that they would not glance at the predator before carrying him inside the ship to see if he has been infected is absolutely ludicrous! And even if the little baby alien escapes, do you think a ship full of predators would have any trouble keeping the situation under control? What about that tag-line? Whoever wins... we lose. If the aliens ""won"", surely they would wipe us out of existence if they could actually escape Antarctica. What about the predators? They sacrifice a few people every 100 years for this ritual, which is a horrible idea and I wish they didn't rip off The Cube to fill in time! So, predators tend to hunt human beings every so often on Earth, big deal. Notice how everyone it killed was armed or had a rather nice skull? It's not like they were going to enslave the human race (Now that idea was just bad, not going into those plot holes) or kill us all. This film should get some Razzies, as when you think of it, it's another spin-off of a comic book just like Catwoman, but I guess Catwoman deserves it more since it has bigger names people starring unlike AVP.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver was right about the crossover idea. I just hope there is no sequel and hope this film gets the punishment it rightful deserves in due time. The only positive thing I can say about this film, which isn't a lot since the writing, directing, and just about everything else was awful, is that we got to see the queen 100% running around. That idea alone wasn't worth this film, but I guess Hollywood knows what we want since this film grossed so much in theaters. Michael Moore should make a documentary about how we are just attracted to such trash, but then again, I guess he made that point clear for we did re-elect Bush."

","This is what the title of the movie should of been. Yes the Predator teams up with a girl to go and kill the aliens. How does this happen? Well the Predators Kill any human the see, but when it comes to the last human the ""hero"" she begs ""please don't kill me"" and the Predator who now understands English is like OK, come with me and will fight the Aliens together. 2 Classic movies turned into a Cartoon. THe Predator is Soft in this movie, he is the 'Good Guy' he has ""feelings'. Yes this is how the Predator is portrayed. THe are some many flaws in this movie and it is so poorly written. And lets not forget after the girl kills an Alien the Predator gives her a Tattoo, how funny. Why would the Predator who kills Humans so easily all of the sudden want one to go hunt with him. The Predator went to go kill the alien because is like a test to see how good a Predator he is. The Alien is the Ultimate prey so isn't having a Human help you cheating, this is not the Predator I remember this is a Loving warm hearted Predator I never knew existed."

","Let's face it Sanaa Lathan is no Sigourney Weaver. For most of this film it feels as if she is being bumped from one poorly acted, badly scripted scene to the next, completely unable to take control of her destiny.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of the film are filled with the usual Hollywood formula plot, clichÃ©d dialogue and predictabilty. You feel that the only way this film is going to be saved, is for a hardcore Sigourney Weaver or some ultra cool Predators to start kicking Alien ass. <br/><br/>But in the end it's all a little underwhelming, Predators arrive, couple of dark fight scenes, lots of running about, the human saves the day, the predator dies and the sequel is set up. <br/><br/>And I won't even bother to mention all the holes and other obvious plot flaws which will make this movie a black sheep in the Aliens and Predator franchises.

"rawashjr","1","3","7","24 August 2004"," A horrible effort at an easy movie.
","I did not expect this movie to be good, but I did not expect it to be that bad. I have to be harsh on it because this may have been the easiest movie of all time to make good. All Paul Anderson had to do was adapt the first comic series. That's all. He could have also realized that after 2 Predator movies most people know what they look like and show us the Predator's face early on and try...TRY... to get us to care whether he lives or dies. We could have seen some interaction,conflict, respect, whatever between younger and older Predators. This was done in the comic book series, and it was good.<br/><br/>By using the comic book setting, on another planet where humans have set up a mining and ranch town, Anderson could have spared us another pyramids built by aliens movie. That premise should be officially banned from any future use. The time spent setting that up could have been spent on Predator culture. Here was a chance to showcase their warrior culture much like what was done with the Klingons in Star Trek. <br/><br/>But in the end I'm not surprised. This is the same guy who ruined Resident Evil. And did anyone notice that AVP was essentially the same movie? He even used similar 3D map pull outs to show where the team was. He even had the same actor who was laser diced in RE get caught in the razor net. There was also the same terrible fight choreography. At least the boom mikes didn't creep into the scenes.<br/><br/>This was too bad to even be a B movie. 1 out of 10, and that's because I saw it using a free ticket (that I want back).<br/><br/>Paul, if you are out there, MST3K was canceled; stop making movies for them.<br/><br/>Stop making movies period."

","What a bunch of crap these bad reviews are. I have been an alien fan and predator fan since the day i laid my eyes on them! I'd been waiting for this monster-collision movie since the concept came up a while back, to me this movie was NOT a disappointment at all! If you go in thinking with ties to the predecessors then you WILL think there are plot holes, you start to think ""where did that come from--why did that happen, how did they get there--where did they get that from?"" but honestly, go in and just think---totally different movie--totally different uptake on the characters. Its basically a movie that takes well known characters and splashes them with a whole new plot and a storyline destined for stardom. Come on people, true fans would know that predators are not ruthless killers, they are hunters, they hunt the worst prey to what planet they may and if successful they keep trophies. This, their prey was aliens--sure they knocked off a human or two (or more) but a predator RESPECTS someone who can defeat the worst prey--a human defeated an alien, which was the most dangerous victim for the predator, and to that predator it was admirable and the help of someone who could do that was highly needed. 10 stars! Open your minds and you will definitely love it! i took my sister kicking and screaming and she left holding onto the doors wanting more---so don't judge by the movies, there's a lot more to this concept than what you say on the big screen! Remember this line ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend.""? Yeah---you get my drift i hope"

"KEELING1985","10","3","7","17 August 2004"," The opening of a New Chapter!
","Well...<br/><br/>I have read what people have being saying on here since the day it came out and i have to say ""whats with all the disappointment?"".<br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson as done an amazing job all round! He shows off how good both species are! I sat there watching the Predators and I found myself thinking all the way back to when I first saw the Predator film. The way that single Predator took out a Army Squad! The way it Stalked and attacked with such stealth and accuracy, it was the ULTIMATE Hunter! In AVP...it is them who become the hunted! <br/><br/>I have also read that people were disappointed with the one Alien that took two Predators out! ""Why you disappointed with that?"". Aliens hit when the Predators were occupied with the Humans! Classic counter which sees one Predator taken out within 20 seconds. The second Predator then comes into the fight! They go at it for a while and I have to say ""This fight scene is incredible"". I don't want to give to much away lol..but the Alien wins! I think its fair because I think a lot of people under-estimate the Aliens when they come face to face with a Predator! Another thing people forgot was "" The predators were basically there to learn the hunt""! They are badass killers but this was there training to become the Ultimate Hunter! Thats why I think the single Alien was able to take down 2 of'em! Also, they didn't have there cannons that would have kept the Aliens at a distance!<br/><br/>So here we are with one Predator left from the Three! And he wants is shoulder cannon, that is currently in the backpack of Alexa Woods( no where near as good as Ripley but she puts in an amazing performance!). She's the only one left from the group and the Predator tracks her down. Aliens start coming and she manages to grab the spear, which the Predator drops while fighting and stabs the Alien which is just about to rip her face off...Anyways, the coast is clear and he wants is gun! She pushes the backpack across the floor and he fits it on! Bring on some more Aliens...Shoulder cannon ready...Fires...Dead Aliens! The Predator clears the way so he can carry on but Alexa wants to follow him, to help her chances of survival! This is a good bit! The Predator gets out is knife and starts cutting up an Alien! I sat there thinking ""This is no time to eat!""...but he was actually making he a spear and a shield! I thought it was stunning if not a little OTT at the same time...but it was different and good. It also showed the warrior side of the Predators survival instincts! They carry on through the Cave to mince up some more Aliens!<br/><br/>The partnership of the Human and Predator lasts up until the end of the film where he dies, but what I liked is the fact that a Predator isn't exactly as bad as an Alien! Its no friendship in away of living together but it was good to see that it wasn't nasty! Unlike the Aliens that just kills or takes you to be host, where you would die anyways lol! The Partnership was there and it opens up and all new chapter in how things could be in the Next AVP! Looking forward to it already :)<br/><br/>And Lastly, I have always enjoyed the Aliens and Predator movies and seeing them both in a film was even more enjoyable! The Battles are great and the actors do an amazing job! There is a lot more to come from the AVP name and hopefully it will go a long way! For all who are going or thinking of seeing it...go without thinking about Previous Alien or Predator films! This film as them in it but its an entirely new thing! Go with fresh thoughts and let the film do the talking! <br/><br/>10/10 for this one and a big well done to Paul Anderson!<br/><br/>PS...Special effects were great and I am having trouble stopping cause it was so good!<br/><br/>Thanks<br/><br/>Lee ------"
"viciousjeremy","10","3","7","17 August 2004"," Whoever wins, we lose
","Personally, I thought AVP was a very well done sci-fi action movie. Most definitely the best sci-fi action movie happening today. Between the Predator and Aliens, the Predator outranks them all. Why? simply because the Predator has more advanced weaponry to destroy anything in its path including Aliens. My favorite moment in the movie is the final battle between the Queen Alien and Predator with the mark on his mask. I don't know how the hell the director manage to capture all that on film but my god that was an amazing battle.<br/><br/>Just because my favorite is Predator, doesn't mean that hate Aliens. The Chest bursters played timeless moments which brought me back to the very first Alien movie, where John Hurt was eating with his fellow crew members until, a Chestburster popped in and freaked everybody out. It's too bad that there was no gory scenes between the Aliens and the humans. What happened there, Paul?! <br/><br/>Despite the lack of goryness, I still enjoyed every second of the movie and whoever voted 5.6 or lower than that is obviously a demanding person. A movie like AVP can't have it all. I totally rate this movie a 7/10."
"flonge","6","3","7","17 August 2004"," Not Oscar worthy, but a worthy addition to Alien and Predator movies.
","First of all I want to make clear that it's a PG-13 movie. Nevertheless the violence is clearly visible in most parts of the movie, even though it feels a bit cut sometimes.<br/><br/>Second of all I have to say; this is the most violent PG-13 movie I can remember to ever have seen.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with references to earlier movies, games, books and comics. On the other hand; the only casting follow up is the ""Bishop"" character which we have to assume was also an android in ""Alien 3"" .<br/><br/>In Alien VS: Predator, Bishop is the creator of the coming droids. He is a billionaire (owner of ""Weyland Corp"".) and gathers a team of (armed)roughnecks and intellectuals to follow Lex the guide, which leads the team to 2000f. below the ice of Antarctica where a heat bloom is detected via satellite.<br/><br/>The suspense,triller,horror, and the character development rushes through the movie. I recommend reading the novelization if you are interested in knowing more about the characters. When the first 45 minutes are done, the director Paul Anderson starts giving the audience some good old action sequences, mixed with fancy ""matrix""style action. It works for the last 45 minutes, and suddenly the movie is done. 1hour 28minutes and it's over.<br/><br/>It leaves you hungry for more. I hope a directors cut, or an unrated version hits the store before Christmas!<br/><br/>Finally after watching this movie three times I believe it's the best Action/Horror/Sci-fi/Triller/Adventure movie I have seen in the latest years; It plays like a rushed version of Aliens, and ""predator 1"" which I think are the best ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" movies.<br/><br/>10/10 ,but it's not perfect; an unrated or directors cut can make it perfect. I recommend this movie for people who are Fans and open minded for new ideas in this franchise.<br/><br/>And remember that just because a lot of people thinks that this movie is really bad, doesn't mean that you'll not like it. On the contrary I think this is a movie that you'll probably as a fan; will love or hate."
"bbosco","10","3","7","18 August 2004"," Very satisfying
","When I realized the budget given to this film and read about all of the low expectations I was frustrated. I really thought we might get another Alien Resurrection. Although it was obvious to me that the studio chopped this movie up quite a bit, I enjoyed every minute. The effects were great and the action was good. I would have liked to have seen more of the creatures fighting each other, but I am willing to take what is given and hope for an extended cut on DVD. This was a great starting point for a new franchise. It was not over-the-top and the end leaves you wanting more. The acting and directing is far better than expected and the overall quality of the film is good. By far this is Paul W. Andersons best work."
"carnivora","10","3","7","15 August 2004"," Wow!
","Almost didn't go see this because of the punks whining about the length and the rating. I'm a huge fan of the other movies and like them all for different reasons. Most of the time, the more I anticipate a movie the more it lets me down, unrealistic, stupid, bad physics, bad effects etc... So it was with trepidation that I finally did see it.<br/><br/>Length ... plenty long, would love to have seen more, maybe a directors cut but sometimes extra footage doesn't improve a movie rather it slows the pace. Loved the pace of this movie.<br/><br/>PG-13... I would prefer a R-rating if it benefits a movie but I don't think this would be improved by an R. I'm not a big fan of F*#k this, and F*#k that so I can do without the F word. It's not that it bothers me it's just that most of the time its unnecessary. Most of the violence was creature to creature otherwise the violence would likely have made it R. The violence towards humans was well done at the PG-13 rating and IMO wouldn't benefit from being more gratuitous. There was plenty of that for the A's and P's<br/><br/>Some people were complaining about the P's not being tough enough which I think is bung. I thought that dynamic was perfect. A's are tough to kill and deadly which is why they use them as the ""rite of passage"". Only the toughest P's survive. Love it. Also, I loved the fact that the three P's were different (other than just looks) in their fighting styles. One big and brutish, another smarter and stealthier, and one just plain alien fodder.<br/><br/>Only negative would be the small amount of cheese involved between our two main characters towards the end. (Don't want to give spoiler) Loved the ending. Sequel sequel sequel."

It's really nice that AVP came out after 14 years and I did enjoy the movie somehow, but there were definitely some flaws that needed explaining to people who never read the comics before. And I do hope that Cameron, Scott, or McTiernan do another Alien/Predator movie. Paul Anderson did a fairly OK job on this movie, but he did ruin the Resident Evil movie by making it have rock music, a kung-fu leading character, slick camera angles, stupid, stupid, dialogue, and that annoying rough/tough or I-can't-show-fear attitude that the characters had."

","There's not too many crossover type movies out there, but out of the few, i would say alien vs predator is the best, director Paul Anderson did a great job with the whole story line in making it fit the original universe's of the previous alien movies. although it was a great movie i was expecting a bit more from the predator side, more killing and deaths, with a lot more gore, overall the story was a good one. I especially liked the realistic movements of the alien warriors they looked exactly like how i would imagine a serpent like creature like them would look. If anything, i would probably change the build of the predators and not make them look so big and bulky, they should of stayed true to the original predator movies and made them long and fit, tone, like how you would expect hunters to look like."

","Being a fan of the AvP series, I must say this has got to be the worst movie ever. Firstly the Predators were a disgrace. If anyone has read the story you would know that there is no way 2 Predators would be killed off so easily by the Aliens. Secondly the story sucked bad. There was no point to the story. it all made no sense. Since when did Predators come to Earth and taught humans how to build pyramids? Bullcrap is all I can say. To make matters worse they used some reference from the books and did a terrible job implementing them. I will never watch another movie from this horrible director. His Resident Evil movie sucked and now he has given the AvP series a bad name."
"robertmaybeth","9","2","4","27 April 2018"," Not sure why this one was rated so low - a logical addition to the Alien/Predator storyline
","From the review scores it would seem a lot of people were disappointed with this first installment in the AVP franchise. I counter that the setting and story are almost perfect for the scenario of the film - Aliens fighting Predators, in a sort of earth game reserve, with unwitting humans caught in the middle. <br/><br/>The film moves fast and there's not a lot of fluff or wasted scenes. Every story element advances the viewer faster and faster to the bloody battles that are the whole reason for ""alien vs predator"" and for the most part, they don't disappoint. Predator and Alien species seem more then evenly matched and it's hard not to simply want to see the two creatures destroy each other - which they very nearly do with the crew of an antarctic research team caught in the middle. <br/><br/>Is it the best Alien or Predator film, certainly not. However for die-hard AVP fans there's plenty here to like. I was a fan of the dark horse comics series, (at one point Dark Horse most popular comic book)and there are elements from several of the comics present, in this competently made and reasonably suspenseful story."

","Most of the bad reviews I read were people complaining that they were mad because in all of the previous AVP movies, the Aliens were supposed to be on another planet and TRYING to get to Earth, whereas in this movie, they already ARE on Earth.<br/><br/>Oh come on, why does every plot have to be the same? And none of those ""previous Alien movies"" had Predators in them, did they? <br/><br/>I thought the plot was an excellent way to combine both franchises, it made sense for someone who was just trying to enjoy the ""idea"" and it wasn't outrageous or pushing it, as far as believably goes. <br/><br/>OF COURSE some things are not going to line up... we ARE TALKING ABOUT A MOVIE INVOLVING ALIEN PARASITES AND WARRIORS BY THE WAY. So when people say comments like ""oh, well PYRAMIDS DON'T BELONG IN Antarctica"" I just shake my head and sigh. Seems the world is overcome with pretentious pricks these days!<br/><br/>Great movie, better than most Hollywood blockbusters (I actually heard that one of the reasons why this movie was poorly reviewed was because the production cast chose to do much of the filming in Europe, and Hollywood's critics basically just screwed it over with ruining its reputation, even though the movie is great). It is probably my favorite in the Alien or the Predator series combined, or at least in the top 3.<br/><br/>Don't be discouraged by the bad reviews. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>By the way, IMDb you need to fix the way you prohibit posting from prohibited words, I kept getting rejected like 10 times before I figured out where the word was.

"Pred88","8","2","4","10 February 2012"," A very well executed movie with the most interesting plot and setting since Alien.
","Note: This is a review of the extended Bluray version:<br/><br/>As you grow older you learn to appreciate every aspect of a movie and not just the amount of action and gore. I first saw it in a theater in 2004 and didn't like it that much. I'm 23 now and watched the extended version on Bluray on a 46' Samsung LED with a good sound system. I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Up until the action starts, the director imitates the pacing and camera movement of the two first Alien movies and does it really well. The mood which is set by great lighting, shadows and music, stays top notch throughout the experience. All the set pieces on and beneath the surface of Antarctica are very well done and suck you into the story. <br/><br/>It should be said that the story that is told and the explanation of the origins of the pyramid is very interesting and really ads to the experience. However, in a movie it is important to have characters you care about and root for. The supporting actors give a passable performance but it's Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen and Ewen Bremner that bring the quality of the picture. <br/><br/>In the extended version, there are more scenes to give a sense of who all the characters are and to create an emotional bond to them. This really helped the movie and it's sad that they weren't in the theatrical release. Additionally there are some scenes in the extended version that help setting the mood and hints on what is about to come. I didn't see any changes or additions to the action scenes though except for a prolonged chest burster scene.<br/><br/>When the action starts the pace picks up significantly. The actual battles between the species are are well executed, chaotic and entertaining to watch but this is also where the movie was criticized. The general opinion is that people were going to the cinemas expecting huge and many battles between Predators and Aliens. What they got was 3 Predators a few Aliens that only face off a couple of times in the movie. This is what I like, the movie tells a more personal story about 3 young Predators there to prove themselves. The movie wants you to root for both the humans and Predators as it is portraying the Aliens as the ultimate enemy of the two other species. The Predators are not there to fight the humans.<br/><br/>The special effects of the movie are really well executed. They are excellent when it comes to the environmental effects. When it comes to the creatures the movie mixes cgi and real actors in suits almost seamlessly. The Predators seemed at a few times a little bit too hindered in their movement, creating the feeling of actors in suits. The Aliens were executed almost perfectly. They are probably the most well done of all the movies the Aliens have starred in thanks to the wonder of CGI and more sophisticated suits compared to the last decades. The dark and shadowy setting of the movie probably also helps hiding any flaws in the effects.<br/><br/>Spoiler! The movie is almost ruined when a Predator teams up with the lead character towards the end. It felt very ridiculous and not believable as I see the Predator as an unsympathetic lone hunter."

"Patedwalters","1","2","4","9 April 2008"," What could have been one of the most awesome movies to grace the screen in years turns out to be one of the worst movies to grace the screen in years.
","Well, if you haven't already figured it out, this movie sucks. Too bad, it had so much potential too. There are numerous problems with this movie, well here we go: <br/><br/>Acting: It is poor. Other than Lance Henriksen, who doesn't really have much to work with, the actors clearly can't perform well. They are no-names and they quite frankly deserve it.<br/><br/>Direction: Mediocre at best. There is no talent in the direction here.<br/><br/>Script and Dialogue: I am not one the Paul W.S. Anderson haters, I have no problem with several of his films, but this one is just shameless. The dialogue is terrible. The actors aren't good, but even if they were, the script doesn't give them much to work with, case in point being Lance Henriksen who is slumming in this role. Yes I understand that Predator has bad dialogue too, but it is enjoyably bad dialogue at least. Numerous quotable line, my favorite being I ain't got time to bleed. There is no memorable dialogue here, it is just stupid dialogue. <br/><br/>Editing and Rating: They edited this movie to a point beyond bear-ability. You can barely tell what is going on during the hectic moments such as the fight scenes. Combined with the dark lighting and it is very confusing. This is mostly due to the shameless rating of the film. A PG-13, come on. I guess I can't blame the producers for this one though, had it been R the movie would have done no business because no adult in their right mind would like what is on display here. <br/><br/>This is shameless, disposable entertainment of the worst kind designed to make teenagers think they are watching a movie. It is a chore to sit through. Other than a couple of very brief genuinely cool moments, that encompass less than one minute of the film, there is nothing worth watching here. The target selling point of the film, other than the name recognition of course for fan boys, is the fight scenes. Well there are indeed two actual alien vs. predator fight scenes. But they are disappointing, as they are on a small scale and are over quickly. Plus they are edited ridiculously and dark to the point beyond recognition. You also have to wait a good while into the film( at least 45 minutes for the first one) to get to this point. And by then, the audience will be bored or asleep due to the poor acting, dull dialogue, and mediocre direction. <br/><br/>There is nothing here, no dread, no terror, no excitement, no fun, no awesomeness, no enjoyment, no wit, no charm, no humor, nothing genuine at all. Except genuine suck. The aliens on display here provoke no fear, and the predators are pushovers. The creatures of the previous films should teach them a lesson for masquerading as them. This is nothing more than a cheap retread imitation of the other films, without the atmosphere, thanks to the overwhelming darkness of the film, and without the proper pacing, thanks to the first 45 minutes of watching the humans walk around and act like idiots. This would all be good and everything if they actually had anything interesting to say, but they don't. They don't hold a candle to Ripley or Dutch or anyone else from the other films. This film is ultra serious, plodding, dull, and downright lame."

","A group of archaeologists and scientists head off to the Antaritic Ocean and discover an old whaling station under neither layers of ice and snow and they find a mysterious shape that looks like a pyramid directly under the whaling station. The archaeologists also find a tunnel that goes straight down to the pyramid location. Alexa Woods, (Sanaa Lathan) plays the role as a expert in expeditions in the Antaritic area and is also a safety guide. Everyone on the expedition feel like they are the first humans who discover a huge pyramid until they encounter strange creatures and start getting trapped in sliding walls of stone pillars and some of their crew start to disappear. There is plenty of action and good entertainment. However, this film was a big disappointment and simply burned itself out at the end."
"buiger","5","2","4","3 March 2007"," Very decent, unpretentious Entertainment...
","Once again, I beg to disagree with the critics. Yes, this film is surely not a quintessential milestone in the history of cinematography, but it is simple, well made, ordinary popcorn-and-beer type entertainment. What's so wrong with that? Films are supposed to entertain, distract from the problems of everyday life or aren't they?<br/><br/>I found the idea behind the story to be original and even though things are kept essentially simple and neither the story or the characters are very much developed, I didn't find it boring at all, there is more than enough tension involved. Yes, I know most of the story doesn't make sense, that it isn't realistic. I am usually the first person to complain about that in other movies, but when you go to watch a movie like AVP, you must expect this. Such movies are not even supposed to make sense... And then, then there is the most important and best thing about this film - the special effects. They where really excellent. I have seen many a big budget film with much less realistic scenes than the ones in this movie (the 'dinosaur stampede' in the recent 'King Kong' just to name one). What else do you need in a movie like this? I have seen much much worse in the past than AVP, which to say the truth, actually delivered much more than I expected.<br/><br/>On a final note, I do agree with most critics that the last scene is lame and predictable, but come on, one has to prep the ground for a sequel..., doesn't one?"
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","2","4","7 November 2006"," Amazingly good for a fifth sequel, even surprisingly fresh
","What a challenge ! To take two characters like Aliens and Predators to invent a new story that could make them meet is more than a challenge. It is unimaginable. Each one has to be better than what they were before and yet both together have to be even more dramatic and formidable than each one may have ever been. Then you have to keep the human beings as the real center of the film, those who are really going to transfer their fear onto us, the audience. The situation has to be believable and has to allow no single minute of respite or lack of tension. The film-makers behind this adventure have revisited their good old mythology books and ransacked the back shop of the store known as « The Old Curiosity Shop ». So we revisit pyramid civilizations (three : Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian) and the great myth of all times : the Antarctica from which all these pyramid civilizations are supposed to have come from. Then they revisited all the stories that are ranting and raving about some space visitors who would have taught the animals of the homo erectus species how to become homo sapiens. The general idea is that the space-visitors are the Predators, that the aliens are prisoners in a pyramid two thousand feet under the ice of the Antarctica and that every one hundred years some young predators are sent on earth to hunt these aliens in the pyramid. Of course some human beings have to accept to be the sacrificial victims from whom the aliens are going to be born, for the hunt. Easy since these human beings of old are not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus. That's what we are told happened on October 10, 1904 and is going to happen again on October 10, 2004. Unluckily some crazy human beings get in the way of the hunt. In a way that was lucky since these human beings set the whole machinery of the pyramid to work and they become the sacrificial victims who will carry the aliens to life. Of course things are not going to go exactly the way it was planned by the predators. The result is absolutely perfect. The human beings are going to be reluctant and resisting victims and one will manage to go beyond simple hostility and disgust and help the predators, hence saving the world and the human race. The details are to be discovered in the film itself which is spectacular. It reveals the vanity of human beings who get into an adventure without even knowing what it is all about and without any proper preparation. All those vain people who believe in money, guns, science or whatever will get to the end of their vanity and the only survivor will be the one who was best prepared and also least vain, so little vain that for her the enemy of my enemy is my friend. This is a dangerous principle that led many people into unbearably absurd situations with incalculably lethal and uncontrollable consequences. But at times it is safe to believe it and it is safe to practice it. Though when the first round is finished my enemy who is the enemy of my enemy and has been my friend in an alliance to defeat this common enemy goes back to his basic definition and becomes my enemy again and the war goes on for one more round. The film-makers decided not to go in that direction but to genetically cross the alien and the predator for a sequel some day in a few years that will be tried and tested first as a comic book, I guess. The DVD has numerous and very interesting extra resources which are quite welcome.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","I mean, come on. This movie was supposed to suck. And in that very vein, it didn't disappoint. It was, uh, shot pretty well. And the sets they built were relatively detailed. They spent a lot of money, didn't they? Why would you go to a movie called Alien Vs. Predator and expect great acting? What, if you really wanted expensive loss leading Hollywood schlock you got it, right? The investors sure did. And 2 years later? Meh, not bad. Not great. I suppose I could have surfed Digg for another 2 hours, but this movie provided an entertainment that looked expensive, and probably was. Movies like this are a dying breed in Hollywood methinks. Someday it will get the appreciation it deserves. Really expensive gadget laden hooey. God bless America. Ha!"
"jon2005","6","2","4","22 May 2006"," Alien vs. Predator
","Ever since it's conception, the very thought of having two of the best franchises in sci-fi cinema come together to kick the crap out of each other was one of the best ideas to come out of Hollywood. A decade later, when the film was finally made, the results are slightly less than were expected. <br/><br/>The Alien Vs Predator franchise has been going for some time. The comic books were very well received (and still are) since their creation in 1989, and since then they have spawned two video-games. It was inevitable then that a film would one day be made. After being tossed around studios for a bit, responsibility for the film fell to Paul W.S Anderson, who had a background in video-game-to-film projects. And here was the first mistake: Anderson was responsible for both Mortal Kombat and the more recent Resident Evil's, both of which were a bit, well rubbish. It seems odd that studio bosses would put their faith in someone who made two bad video-game-to-film films. Still, they did, and the result is a fairly passable, yet wholly unsatisfying film.<br/><br/>The reason is this: Aliens and Predator are great films, the pinnacle of the sci-fi genre. That means, as this film combines the two, that it has to be rated against them both. If there had been no Aliens or Predator then the score for this film would possibly be a bit higher but as the first two films were so good, this seems very second rate in comparison. <br/><br/>Not that it's all bad. The moment we first see an Alien and Predator face off is great, the moment which has been a long time coming and that we've all been waiting for. It's a bit too hastily edited, and it's hard to see sometimes exactly what's going on  it's all too zoomed in  but the audience is too immersed in the scene that these are minor niggles. Also, the final fight between the last Predator and the Queen is an adrenaline filled, action packed showdown, which does end the film on a bit of a high. It is just that the rest of the film is let down by a lack of any real tension in the build up, a script that is too full of clichés, and (this may sound a bit odd) too full of humans. With the title Alien Vs Predator, you would have thought that it would be mostly about them with humans just kind of in the way a bit, but it is actually the Aliens and Predators which take the back seat. This is a real shame, especially as most of the under-developed characters are only there so that they can get killed off in gruesome ways. Sanaa Lathan is good enough as the lead, though unsurprisingly comparisons with Ellen Ripley from the Alien films will surface and quite simply, she's not as good. <br/><br/>The film is shot well and really looks the part, and the special effects are fine  the Aliens in particular have never looked so good  but the now obligatory action film slo-mo goes a little too far. Still, it's not a totally bad film; it's just that it can in no way compete with the original films. It has to be said though, and raises the score up a bit because of it, that the Predators are, and always have been, awesome!<br/><br/>Rated: 6/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"
"illusionation","5","2","4","8 May 2006"," Aww man, how'd they screw THIS up?
","After sitting through this flick, I couldn't help but think that with all of the drafts that Fox supposedly went through before green-lighting this, they could've put a bit more of a story into it.<br/><br/>It has a nice concept, Predators use the Aliens as hunting game for training in an underground pyramid which shifts its structure very ten minutes... but after the set-up is done, so is the plot development.<br/><br/>Casting Lance Henrikson as Weyland (Bishop) was a nice touch, but there isn't really much to the character other than being a disease-stricken tycoon who wants to leave his mark by discovering the Aztec/Egyptian tomb underneath Antarctica.<br/><br/>Sanna Lathan (Blade's Ma) is okay as the lead, but ultimately not very engaging. The only other characters that stand out are Spud from Trainspotting and some hunky Italian anthropologist. Mostly because their accents are so thick, it's sometimes hard to understand what they're saying.<br/><br/>The creature FX are nicely done, although the unmasked Predator looks kinda rubbery compared to the original.<br/><br/>The set design was the star of the show, however.<br/><br/>That's never a good sign when the stuff in the background is what's best about a production. <br/><br/>All in all, the main problem I had with the movie was instead of it being a tense thriller like it's two originators, it wound up being a dull action flick geared toward teenagers who were probably in their cribs when both the Alien and Predator films were in their prime.<br/><br/>What's even more frustrating is reading a recent interview with James Cameron who stated that after this last film was made, neither he, nor Ridley Scott have any desire to return for an Alien sequel, (which was in the planning stages.)<br/><br/>Cameron stated that he felt that the team-up of the Alien and the Predator films cheapened the franchises, likening it to that of a crappy Abbott and Costello meets Whoever the F@*k.<br/><br/>To cap it off, the final shot, (which should be an amazing revelation) had me actually laughing out loud. <br/><br/>Like the rest of the movie, nice idea, but real bad execution.<br/><br/>Mark another one down for Paul W.S. Anderson."

The DVD also has an alternative version of AVP with an alternate beginning. <br/><br/>The latest DVD is the 2 disc set, which it features the original theatrical cut and extended cut. DVD has the same picture quality and sound from the previous transfer. But the extended cut is disappointing, The director added eight minutes of additional footage but DVD cover promises more battles and more violence. That's simply not true, The filmmaker added character development instead and there's more CGI blood than the PG-13 version. But second disc has plenty of featurettes from Pre-Preduction to Post-Production and more. <br/><br/>Anderson's film is simple but it has some exciting visual moments, which their are sensational. The film is fun enough to overcome the illogically plotting of Anderson's screenplay. Screen Story by Anderson, Dan O'Bannon (Alien) and Ronald Shusett (Dead & Buried). Although O'Bannon and Shusett had nothing to do with Anderson's original screen story. But Anderson used elements from O'Bannon and Shusett's story from Alien, that they were never filmed from the original 1979 film.

However, if you find yourself watching it, without wanting to, you'll find yourself saying 'just what I expected' The prologue was way too long, and the exciting scenes aren't very long. They are, however, exciting and freaky. What I also didn't like was how fast the humans die and the characters picked to explore the place where everything takes place in the first place.

","Not a bad work. The special effects are thrilling, and the action borderlines intense, but the acting is crap. And the fact that two of the(will not list what species) are killed in the same scene was dumb. It's not very Alien versus Predator, if two of the (will not list what species) die back-to-back.<br/><br/>I did like the idea of a pyramid in Antartica, but to have it under the ice blows chunks, and the movie takes to long to pick up. Sure there's a snippet or two here and there of a Predator ship, but other wise, no extraterrestrial action until later on. The plot is mediocre and full of holes, and, as aforementioned, the acting is poor, and when coupled with your aunt's constant jawing about what this person or that person should be doing, you've got yourself a heaping platter of man-speak that will drive you insane. If you know of someone who won't shut up during a movie about the characters and their actions, do not watch this movie with that person.<br/><br/>On a positive note, as I have already said, the fight scenes are really cool, and the Predators and Aliens look much better than they used to. The movie also features really nifty camera angles that make for cool shots. And of course, the last battle between Predator and Alien features potentially the coolest action shot ever (but I'll let you see for yourself). So, in short, decent with good special effects but poor acting. 6 outta 10."

Too many bad things to mention, but this sums the film up well; even its catch phrase was wrong... whoever wins we lose, yet the human wins. Morons. Not only did they ruin aliens and predators just when they needed a new lease of life to recover from alien 4 and predator 2, they killed the entire storyline by setting it on earth present day.

Lets get to what I like about this movie, fast paced, good special effects, better than average writing, and Paul Anderson directing,but this film should have been R rated with some better ""murder,death,kill footage....yes carnage"".

"ggp-3","3","2","4","22 April 2005"," Is that an Alien in my chest or heartburn?
","Alright, now the setup takes forever. Fair warning. Diagrams, helicopters, mountain climbing, debriefings. This filming strategy cut the cost of the film down but real-fake shots of the ice cutting boat were well worth it. Trust me. Ice cutting boats are action worthy. So like I said, the setup takes forever which is longer than an Alien takes to hatch out of your sternum. Most of the story takes place in Antarctica even though Predator's hate the cold.<br/><br/>Now the Predators have come to Earth again and they are bored with Arnold so they bring along an alien that was frozen just for fun. Then some scientists just happen to be around because they are on an expedition that knows about a big Pyramid below the Antartic ice where they have to explore and where the Predator's just happen to be going. (Ya with me so far?) Well at least 'Alien' Bishop (Lance Henriksen) is along for the ride though he really doesn't do anything in this movie except use an inhaler. I swear! Now the scientists all go exploring in the snow and later in the Pyramid below the ice. One of the characters in the movie, some hours later, carries around a weapon found in the Pyramid and carries it forever without realizing it's a weapon! Why are horror/scary movie/thriller people so stupid? Is this always a requirement? Would you go down a thousand foot hole in the ice that couldn't have been drilled by anything on the planet except for maybe Aliens? Yep. They all go down. Ya gotta love the stupid scientists.<br/><br/>Now there's a lot of gush and gook and Alien acid. It's becomes as cliché as a Film Noir detective looking at blood at the scene of the crime. Ever notice how detectives always have to stick their fingers in the blood and smear it around just to make sure it's blood? Well now it's Alien slime apparently. A scene or two with the sticky stuff being examined. You always have to pick up the sticky gun/stick/whatever very slowly to let everyone know it's sticky. You have to have that stupid look on your face when you pick it up as well. Just turn your head to the side and look at the sticky stuff and say to yourself. This doesn't look right  it looks like Alien sticky stuff. By the way, the Alien is right behind you.<br/><br/>Then there's the Alien Acid. We all know this stuff can melt its way down several stories of futuristic metal. It burns like a bad pepperoni Pizza at Sbarro's. But Alien acid just doesn't follow the laws of gravity. Einstein rolls over in his grave during this movie when Alien acid is flowing like water but it just can't seem to fall on the heroine no matter how much she sticks the Aliens and bleeds them. OK, she gets it once but quickly takes off her outer jacket. Quite frankly I could have spit across the room and gotten more on her. Aliens, please take note. Spit, don't bother bleeding like a pig.<br/><br/>Now the heroine goes around in a long sleeve, acid free light shirt from there on. OK, so the rest of the movie doesn't matter but finally the end of the movie does happen. Here we go. There's the imminent explosion. Predator's got to blow up all traces of everything as usual. But wait. First you must watch the Predator bomb-clock tick to its own beat and with only a few seconds left, it still takes 5 minutes. I know the clock is on Predator time, but I've seen this before Tick Tick Tick. Couple running away from the bomb. Tick Tick Tick. Shot of clock ticking. Now they are climbing or something like that. Tick Tick Tick. Now they are running. Shot of clock ticking. Tick Tick Tick. Someone slips on Antartic ice and slowly gets up. Shot of clock ticking. Tick Tick Tick. Now they are running again. WAIT. The bomb is about to go off. EVERYONE MUST JUMP (the big bomb flame in back of them goes off.) Now, hit the deck. Slide, Blast, Boom and they're SAFE! Just a Predator and heroine on an Abyss of ice. They insist on staying on the edge of the ice by the way just to prove that scientists and Predator's are equally stupid. The heroine's shirt is clean pressed after all the battle, spit, acid and goo. No time for a sloppy chick in this movie. Aliens and Predators hate sloppy.<br/><br/>Now later on still, the heroine is outside the Predator space ship in the middle of Antarctica before the grateful Predator aliens must take off for home. You understand? Predators never stick around long enough to explain Area 51. The heroine; wellshe's in her nice pressed shirt in Antarctica and what's so unusual about that?. The heroine doesn't even have the cold fog breath. I mean really, there was more mist coming out the mouths of the ""I see dead people"" cast. The Predators then take off and the heroine is not feeling chilly at all WAIT! It's not over yet. Deep inside the Predator ship as it leaves Earth's atmosphere, a slow pull back of the camera shows the dead body of one of the hero-Predator guys. He's lying on a slab as his friends walk away - all of them sad in a Predator way. What's that? Something moving in the dead guy's chest? Can it be a little Alien pup? Is something going to jump out of his chest? Nahhh! The dead guy is sicker than me about this movie. He's just going to barf I think? Now that's scary! 3 Stars for CG. Nothing else to make this worthwhile except for the cleanest costumes after an alien invasion that I have ever seen."

","Simply awful. I felt both hurt and offended by this lightweight, soulless attempt to re-invigorate a once great franchise. For the first time in many years I felt compelled to turn the film off before getting to the end. Not one character had anything other than two dimensions, shallow cartoony motives and a bare grasp on the leaden, unoriginal script.<br/><br/>Only its familiar and favourite movie aliens save it from being an all out failure, an early clash between the monsters does provide a burst of excitement. Yet these also suffer badly with repetitive shots that have simply been re-cycled from the earlier originals, and with much less effect; the Predator removing his faceplate, a close up of an Alien, all goo and teeth. And the clumsy-looking, over-sized rubber Predator suit, that nostalgia will forgive in the original, here simply looks dated and lazy.<br/><br/>Nothing here innovates in the way that the earlier films did, it is simply safe, by the numbers film making that could, and should, have delivered on the great potential it promised."

Alien vs. Predator is a pure action movie with a lot of special effects, and it worked for the general public, not for me. I like action movies but they should have a rather interesting storyline, this film doesn't. It only mixes the humans in the avp fight. It should be innovative but I think it would have been better if it had more acceptable parts than improbable. The humans work together with the predators to stop the alien threat but the title says ""Whoever wins we lose"", so is that wise??? Anyway the action movie lovers, like me, will probably enjoy it and look away from all the negative parts."

It moved a little fast but what the heck. I think movies should just be enjoyed and not analyzed to death and this movie was very enjoyable. Personally I think it was better than all of the other Alien and Predator movies except ""Aliens"" and Arnold's ""Predator"" movie. Man if you want to watch an Oscar type movie rent ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Dances With Wolves"". If you want to watch a cool movie with some fight scenes that will make anything you will watch on ""WWE Smackdown"" pale by comparison, then rent this movie!"
"glsanborne","10","2","4","27 January 2005"," FAR out
","This is a perfect movie! I was waiting for this for years, and finally they made it. The Predator was a great film, and the whole Alien series is great. The only other possible improvement I can imagine is to add RoboCop to the mix. Now that would make an awesome film.<br/><br/>Hopefully we'll see more of this in the future; movie makers should just use characters from other films and mix it all together. Those are interesting films. Since AVP did so well, maybe we WILL see some more of this.<br/><br/>I will definitely be getting this on DVD. Hopefully there will be lots of special features, maybe even another hour or so of footage. Or at least a hint of a sequel."
"blasteel979","10","2","4","20 November 2004"," They could have READ the script before making the movie!
","(contains spoilers)<br/><br/>Although I must admit that this movie did start off great. Especially when you see the predators' getting ready for their hunt. It seems that once the battles began, the people all died one by one. We didn't even have a chance to get to know them. It seems that the only two people we get to know are Sebastian and Alexa Woods. <br/><br/>There was supposed to be a war with thousands of Aliens, and thousands of Predators. Well first of all, there were only three Predators, and it seemed that the Predators were in control before the ""war"" began. That didn't seem fair to the Alien fans (such as myself). Although the company that sent the explorers to Antarctica was Weyland-Yutani. <br/><br/>It seems that unless you have seen the Alien and Predator movies, you would be kinda lost at some points in this movie. Especially in the scenes with the Alien Queen. I think that they should have taken more time in explaining the Alien Queen since they have that whole scene with the history of the world (which is what I think made the movie horrible).<br/><br/>If you have seen both the Alien and Predator movies enough to understand them would have noticed something wrong. The first Alien movie was meant to take place in the future. Then the second was 57 years later. SO we can assume that this is sometime around 2080 right? Well in the third Alien movie, we didn't exactly find out how much time had passed since the second Alien movie, but we can assume that it was around 2080 or later. But we meet the man who created the Bishop machine, and it was the same man who played Charles Bishop Weyland. He obviously was younger in Alien 3. And that was sometime after 2080 (or so we can assume). But in AVP, it is the same person and not only is he older, but it is the year 10/10/2004. So that throws the audience off. Director Paul Anderson may have said that AVP is it's own franchise, but that doesn't explain the whole Bishop story."
"aniels1","8","2","4","24 November 2004"," Nice way to tie in both worlds.
","I honestly do not understand all the bad reviews I have been reading about this movie.<br/><br/>It is true that when I heard they where making Alien Vs. Predator, I did not expect very much, because of the economic connotations the whole idea implies: taking two money-making franchises and getting more money out of it. Basically I think that is what the comics did when they first appeared, though, for all fairness, I haven't read them, so I can't say if they succeed on the same level that this movie does.<br/><br/>The surprising part is then, that this movies is not just a battle between the two races set in a place somewhere in space, ""just 'cause"", but it is nicely tied in to human history and mythology, where the result is a plausible story, at least in sci-fi terms.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked is that the story is seen from the humans' perspective who unknowingly walk straight towards the gates of hell. We (the viewer) know what these people (who do not even carry guns except for one guard who does have a pistol) are up against, and this creates a sense of doom around all of the characters. The movie is realistic in this sense, as in fact, they do not stand a chance. We wonder how any of them will survive once the the massacre starts.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well shot, and quite refreshing for the darkness and grittiness, and the under-use of CGI in favor of well-done animatronics and models.<br/><br/>Whereas the movie is not as scary as the Aliens movies, it is faithful to both Aliens and Predator movies in the mood it creates, without catering too much to either one.<br/><br/>So, all in all, a worthy successor to both movies, which I will get on DVD and recommend to all fans of sci-fi movies."
"paulm8975","10","2","4","5 November 2004"," Bloody Good!
","To all the AVP haters out there, you obviously can't appreciate a good bloody movie. This was a bloody good movie and i loved it. One of the best movies i've seen in a long time. I've seen it 3 times i love it so much! I know it wasn't hugely great, but for me it was bloody good. It could have been better though, just pray that the sequel will be better. I'm looking forward to Alien 5 and a possible Predator 3 & 4. Anyone played the games? Yes? No? I do think the AVP2 should be based on the Aliens vs. Predator 2 game on the PC though. That was a great game and should be turned into a movie. Overall, i thought AVP was a great movie and i love it."
"steven.gough","Null","2","4","21 October 2004"," A truly mediocre experience
","I had really low expectations for this film, but as it started I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised. The initial effects, the mildly funny ""spaceship overhead"" shot which turns out to be of a tiny crevice in a standard earth satellite, and the hackneyed but serviceable sequence assembling the team raised my spirits. Something at least workmanlike seemed to be on the way.<br/><br/>Sadly the film quickly nose-dives into the imagination-free franchise sausage factory exercise I was expecting all along. When the characters arrive at the big pyramid set, any sense that there was a plot or guiding intelligence just evaporates. The machinery grinds out statutory Alien and Predator moments. Chest-burster follows Face-hugger with no tedious hanging around to build up silly suspense. A number of full size aliens not even remotely based on the number of dead people appear out of shadows or haul screaming bodies into light-wells. ""Shimmer effect"" Predator (soon to be available as an 8 inch action figure) uses its genuine retractable claws to gut over half the admittedly built-in-obsolescent human cast. After an interminable delay one of the predators finally removes its hockey goalie mask and does the team hiss, as if this was a really special moment worth waiting the full hour and a half. There are a number of what were presumably intended as ""iconic"" face-to-face moments between masked and unmasked predator and alien, that in fact seem as managed as a movie poster photo-shoot.<br/><br/>Most of the action takes place in a huge stone building that changes its internal structure on a timer every ten minutes. Walls open or close, the floor turns into pits or lifts, exactly in the way incongruous traps and elevators enable the gameplay in every first-person shooter since Doom. We're supposed to accept the premise that ultimately the building is supposed to be an Predator paintball alley, but the entire backstory is so juvenile it's an insult to the creators of the original Alien, which alongside Blade Runner always seemed to be one of the few really intelligent science fiction films. This isn't even a comic book. It's not a fresh observation, so I'm sorry, but it has all the charm and intelligence of a video-game without the replay value.<br/><br/>Like most of the people who'll read this I have a crap job grinding thanklessly through routine tasks for a pitiful wage. A privileged minority of people have access to vast sums of money to make the bread and circuses to entertain us coal-face workers, and I have no complaint when that results in whiz-bang popcorn movies like Bad Boys 2. It's a crime and an insult, though, when someone just grinds out mediocre corporate franchise pap like this. If he can only raise his game to the level of this sort of production line pap maybe the writer/director should have his bread and circus privileges revoked, and taste life away from the swimming pool and beach-house community for a while."
"DORK1","10","2","4","14 September 2004"," Not too bad, but pg-13 rating let this film down a bit
","I just finished watching the movie and i have been left with mixed opinion. It reminded me very much of a resident evil scenario, typical as Paul Anderson is back on board to direct and Colin salmon has a role in the movie. I liked the idea of merging the two alien races together since the trophy room scene in predator 2. This movie is satisfying good and starts off really well. at 87 minutes long until the credits, this felt a bit rushed and could have been 10 minutes more to help explain a few things. OK though. The money has been well spent and the film looks like delicious candy. Great idea to put lance Hendrickson on board, i so admire the actor, and even give the scar faced tommy Flanagan the role of verheiden, that actor gives a very menacing feel to the screen, i hope he gets bigger roles soon. The film played OK throughout, effects top notch guys, but due to the pg-13 rating, i bet tons of footage was cut and it is pretty obvious a lot of the time. In some battle and attack sequences, they are too instantaneous and before you can work out wtf is happening, were on to the next bit. The script was OK but the character development was not here at all. Most of the soldiers don't have names, you don't see them all die, and they all disappear to quickly. I think about five people die within a minute here. The cast goes from around 16 down to 2 in 25 minutes. Anyway, if you read this, see the film, it is a good film on the whole and leaves room for a sequel, though one i feel is not needed. I don't think Oscars are on the horizon nor great reviews, but this was a good 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Overall rating, 6 out of 10, mainly that damn pg-13 rating took it down!"
"Elswet","9","2","4","31 August 2004"," I had issues...but most of them were resolved with the UNRATED EDITION's release.
","I went into the theater with little in the way of expectations. I love both franchises and I frankly did not believe they could do this one properly.<br/><br/>The performances were quite good, the effects were great (although they did something weird to the mandibles on the Predators that I found to be a poor incarnative device), and the sets and story were quite well done.<br/><br/>The story. That's what blows you away in AvP.<br/><br/>SPOILERS.<br/><br/>This movie was rich in story without going back and explaining all the redundant boring trivial little details from both franchises. It depends on your subscribing to the theories of each franchise and is more a ""carrying on"" endeavor than a ""win new viewers"" one. I found that to be endearing in these days of repetition. Considering that this was an extension of two successful franchise components, why compound the repetition factor. <br/><br/>The premise of ice after having said the Predators only come when it is unseasonably hot left me feeling a bit disturbed as to why they chose Antarctica. However. Given the theories concerning the shifting of the poles, the Ice Age theorems, and so on, I have accepted that the pyramid was built when what is now the North Pole/Antarctica, was in the deserts of what was the Old World's ""middle east.""<br/><br/>I was disturbed that the Predators were less...predatory, and more ""touchy-feely"" this time around. I seriously missed the action! Action! ACTION! of these franchises. So if it is action you are after, this movie is -not- the first choice. There were practically no hand-to-hand episodes, and what you did get was a bit weak probably due to the PG-13 component. Bah! Hopefully there will be an American ""R"" release in the next year or so. I think I'll hold off on buying the ""theatrical release"" when it comes out and wait a bit to see. I can't imagine there weren't more fight scenes shot and then extracted as a marketing ploy for later use. <br/><br/>By ""touchy-feely,"" I mean the love/team interest forged between Sanaa Lathan's character Alexa Woods and the surviving underground Predator. That was completely out of character for the Predators, in my opinion. Okay, I realize it is a carry-over from Predator 2 where the Predators acquire a respect for Danny Glover's character in the end. However, to quote ""Howard the Duck"" ... ""This relationship defies all the laws of Nature!"" Though it's hardly a romance, there are far too many cutesy moments in this endeavor to suit my Predator/Alien tastes. In fact, this feature alone lent a feeling of ""this is stupid"" to this whole movie; a thought I had to keep pushing back during my theatrical viewing and detracted immensely from the final product.<br/><br/>The premise, however, was quite well done, in spite of the obvious flaws. In Bishop's endeavor to live what is left of his extended ""life"" to the fullest, he embarks upon this journey in the hopes of surviving one last grand adventure. Not a new element to the cinematic world, but still effective. I -wanted- him to go, and I -wanted- him to succeed. <br/><br/>Perhaps, that is only because he was the only character from the original franchise to make this attempt. This attempt bore no other original members from either franchise, by the way.<br/><br/>The idea of the pyramid bearing the three types of ancient civilizational writings, thoughts and designs was outstanding.<br/><br/>Quite clever interpretation of the placement of the great pyramids on the Earth, and the origins of the Gods of mankind. Perhaps it was a Predator bomb that caused the Tunguska blast of 1908. <br/><br/>The effects were well done, and the makeup artists surrendered their best, as expected. As I said before, the mandible adjustments on the Predator were a bit off-putting, but then again, they were never beautiful creatures to begin with. The pyramid was well done, the glyphs were realistic, the adornments were creatively and historically presented, and the aliens were expertly done.<br/><br/>Just another small question...In all the years the Predators have been fighting the Aliens, -why- is their armor not acid-proofed?<br/><br/>Just a thought.<br/><br/>In an attempt to make this more attractive to ""arthouse"" fans rather than fans of the original franchises, the story line was given more screen time than the action one would expect from a movie which carries these two franchises. Even with this distraction AVP was very watchable. <br/><br/>The Unrated Director's Cut (which Anderson promised fans from the beginning, IF you will remember), is as the movie should have been. You are given eight more minutes. <br/><br/>Now, I can already hear the cries of malcontent. ""Eight MINUTES?!"" But I can tell you that 8 seconds added here, and 5 seconds added there, really do serve well to flesh out the story, give you the details previously missed, and extend the Alien/Predator fight adequately enough so that fans are, at last, appeased. <br/><br/>The story is in the UNRATED EDITION. The action is in the UNRATED EDITION. The version which makes sense is the UNRATED EDITION. The PG-13 edition is the chopped up, convoluted crap-fest we saw at the theaters. <br/><br/>Thanks to the studio for letting Anderson have this UNRATED EDITION. It goes a long way towards salvaging what we KNEW was NOT an inferior film. The PG-13 version just made it seem inferior. <br/><br/>The Theatrical Version rates a 7.0/10.<br/><br/>The UNRATED EDITION rates a 9.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"moonotter1951","6","2","4","24 August 2004"," Decent effort - watered down. Spoiler warning!
","I enjoyed it about as much as I expected I would. After all, it is the 7th in a series, so to speak, and that doesn't usually mean Oscar-time. It seemed to be a very diluted version of a potentially rich story. So many myths, so little explanation or time. Also, I must admit, I get tired very quickly by movies that take place in that level of darkness. Couldn't we just suspend ""reality"" in order to see what's going on? Really enjoyed Sanaa Lathan's performance as our newest ""Alien heroine."" Feel a little dumb that it took me so long to see the queen vs. heroine fight coming a la Aliens I & II. Doubt I'll see this again until it hits late nite premium channels, as I don't think I'll care to add it to by DVD library."

","I don't despise Paul Anderson. In fact I rather favor him.<br/><br/>I don't know why he was given AVP, but I did not complain...<br/><br/>I did not like the PG-13 rating, but it didn't ruin the movie...and I've long since gotten over it.<br/><br/>I am going to say one thing though, the fight scenes ruled. Some say they were too fast, I thought they were just great.<br/><br/>****!!!!SPOILERS!!!!****<br/><br/>I think it was cheap how they killed off Sebastian and Weyland. Weyland did not come off to me as the corporate ass that his company ends up becoming in the Aliens series when it merges with Yutani corp.<br/><br/>I did not think of Sanaa Lathan proper to play the part that she did...she just didn't seem to fill it properly...she seemed to be there...but she did it alright I suppose.<br/><br/>As for Bishop, Henrikson brought on an astounding display of immense talent in his acting.<br/><br/>The predators seemed a bit bulky to me...and the facial structures just didn't seem right, and also the mandibles didn't seem to have the 'life' that they did in the first one...for instance when Arnold is looking at the Predator in the original Predator when it takes off his mask...you see his mandibles clicking, anticipating the fight to come...and then one twitches...it is so lifelike! I guess that is what happens when we lose the talented Mr Kevin Peter Hall who played a predator like no one else can, not to forget Stan (something or other) who came up with the predator design in the first place...and god bless him for creating one of the most kick ass creatures in the world.<br/><br/>All I can say is WHEN WILL A DAMN PREDATOR ACTUALLY WIN?!<br/><br/>Every time the predator gets his S!!t messed up and the human walks away without a scratch...it's getting old and tired...I say make Predator 3 and every humans dies, and the Predator walks away, having made a successful hunt.<br/><br/>The elder predator kicked ass, though he had the same messed up mouth like the rest of them did.<br/><br/>Aliens...could not have been done better...Congratulations to Anderson for relying more on animatronics than CGI...cause CGI sucks...it can be done very poorly...It wasn't all that great supporting the queen either when she busted out of the pit created by the predator's bomb. It almost looked like a T-Rex from Jurassic Park...but then again all we have to compare it to is the Queen in 2 which was so docile due to what cameron had to work with...not to mention the one that was killed so cheaply and never moved in Alien Resurrection, the money dump that it was.<br/><br/>Ah, well, I will say that I am not disappointed that I paid to see this flick. Boycotting it won't do crap unless you can get the younger crowd to do so as well, and you never will...Perhaps it is good that we have had the franchise opened to younger people now...I mean there seriously were no little screaming brats...as I think even 13 year olds are capable of shutting the hell up during a movie on screen...it's obnoxious jocks and their boyfriends that drive me up a wall with their stupid comments and ill placed obnoxious laughing...oh and their constant insistence to make out all the time...Last midnight showing of a movie I'll ever see."

This movie holds true to the title AvsP with no question if you want more than Aliens fighting Predators your in the wrong show it was the showdown of 2004.

Many people are trying to compare this movie to either the Alien series or the Predator series, but seem to be missing the point that it's all combined; it's a movie entirely its own and I love it! No cheesy one-liners, lots of tasteful , and awesome effects make this movie what it is. The best part is that it doesn't run along the lines of other action movies in terms of having the humans rebounding to victory in a critical moment when all hope seems lost. The slogan of the movie fits perfectly: ""Whoever wins... We lose."" It's nice to have a movie where the humans get annihilated. This movie is a great action flick with no real complaints except the previews hint at a total war over the planet instead of being isolated in one spot. SEE THIS MOVIE.

Go into this with an open mind for action/sci-fi and you will come out having seen a good movie. Not great (unfortunatly), but good.<br/><br/>In these days where making longer movies is more acceptable to movie goers - this movie needed to be longer. Only because more explanation of the Weyland character and his company would have helped tie this movie into the Alien series a lot better. It might have explained why in Alien and Aliens, the 'Company' was so intent on sending people to bring back an alien - no matter what the cost. I had hoped this would have shed light on those future events, but it didn't happen.<br/><br/>Do I remember any of the other characters names besides Lex? No. Did I go into this movie expecting to care for all the supporting cast? No, but neither was I when I went and saw Aliens - and ended up getting sucked into all the different characters and their personalities - and caring whether they got killed or not, or if they backstabbed someone (damn Burke!). It just wasn't done with this movie.<br/><br/>I thought the Aliens, and the Predators were to die for. I caught myself leaning forward towards the screen and wringing my hands together whenever there was an alien on screen fighting a predator - I was amazed.<br/><br/>What I missed was the creepy atmosphere from the Alien seies. In this movie, if there was an alien around, you would see slime, then immediately hear it and then see it. There wasn't enough tension built up.<br/><br/>If the 3 predators were 'young' predators, then damn... They seemed to be twice the size of the predators from the predator movies... I guess they had good genes...<br/><br/>People in the theater did laugh. And not a good, funny laugh - but kinda like 'this is silly' towards the end.

"LesserRaven","10","2","4","13 August 2004"," A Rather Well-Done Movie
","Alien vs. Predator exceeded my expectations. My expectations, as probably most people's, were for a slightly above-average action movie. It certainly wasn't as good as most of the Alien movies (with the exception of Alien 3) and I have not seen Predator 2, but the Predator aspect worked well in comparison with Predator 1. And (SPOILER)I liked the aspect of Bishop being actually modeled after Bishop Weyland, and this taking place before the Weyland corporation merged with Yutani. It was able to actually develop the story of Alien farther in this movie instead of just finding some plot to pull the two species together. (END SPOILER)<br/><br/>The main problems I had with this film were:<br/><br/>-Because it's a fairly short movie, there really wasn't as much time for character development as there should have been. I still liked the characters, but they're just not as rich as the characters from Alien. Maybe Predator.<br/><br/>-I'm not one of those people who goes ""OMG THIS IS PG-13 THIS SUXXORZ"" but because of its PG-13 rating, you weren't shown many of the things that made Alien and Predator so intense. It just seemed too contrived, cutting away from the shot every time something violent happens to a human. I guess the PG-13 rating was to draw in a younger audience, but let me tell you: BAD IDEA. The theater in which I saw this movie was practically empty (though apparently other theaters were crowded) except for mainly a group of teenagers who talked through the whole thing.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a *bad* movie, but it's hard to live up to such high standards that the movies on which this is based set up, and for that reason people are prone to be more upset at it being less perfect.

","First of all, I am a huge fan of both series' and this movie I would rate a 7.5/10. The movie had a interesting plot, and it was many years behind the Alien series. The director explained a lot of the story very well, The Aliens looked great and the Predators were pretty good. The ending was pretty cool except for the running away from the explosion, I cant wait for the sequel and to see the Pred-Alien. I also liked how the predator didn't have too much of an advantage. The reason they didn't use their cloak too much against the aliens is because the Aliens can see through it. The only real disappointment was the lack of gore, I don't care if it would have been rated R, I wanted gore! Well thats just one guys opinion, I would say spend the money and go see it."
"chrisbeaver","10","2","4","13 August 2004"," Whoever whines, Anderson still redeems himself.
","Well... ""Redeems"" may be the wrong word, because while his work has ranged between Decent and Alright he's never produced anything that was complete unremittable garbage.<br/><br/>This movie is what I hope he'll be remembered for -- It has excellent visuals, a powerful score, a good cast, as good a script as one could hope for, and some truly brilliant shots. (The opening sequence, for example, in which the satellite's silhouette is evocative of the queen). Paul's working on it all the way to the days before its release really paid off.<br/><br/>The damning point it, it won't be accepted critically. This movie was not made for critics; it was made for fans, and the constant homages to the other films and John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" really shows this. Also, the fact the Fox forced it into a PG-13 rating hurt him also as it turned off many of the fans he was making it for. Future DVD releases will surely rectify this, though.<br/><br/>Give this movie a chance before you go making assumptions; it is not another Freddy Vs. Jason."
"katkiller5","10","2","4","13 August 2004"," A perfect mix
","After waiting nearly 15 years for this match up, Paul W.S. Anderson gives us AvP fans everything we could have hoped for, and then some. The master of movie adaptations has seamlessly blended the suspenseful, ""look out behind you"" moments that we've come to expect from these movies, with the action packed fight sequences we've always wanted to see. He includes references to everything that has come before regarding AvP. The video games, novels, comic books, and previous movies, a little of everything can be found here.<br/><br/>Originally I thought that because two franchises that have never before seen less than an R rating were coming together and only garnering a PG-13, that would somehow take away from the series; but once again Paul Anderson shows that it doesn't take gratuitous blood and swearing to make a good movie. The movie faithfully adheres to tradition and canon. Even the ""inconsistencies"" can be explained if you look for the right clues.<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a fan of either series, and if you haven't yet, I urge you to read the AvP novels by S.D. Perry as well. They are an invaluable tool for putting the movie into perspective."

The movie is excellent and the much maligned director Paul Anderson really shines in this.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the detection of a heat bloom (which is later determined to be a structure, pyramidal in shape) under the ice in the Antarctic by a Weyland industries satellite. this leads to the Weyland corporation putting together a team to excavate the site as fast as possible due to their rationale that they cant be the only ones to discover the heat bloom,and thus must be the first to arrive in order to claim the site. the team arrives on site to find an abandoned whaling camp and mysterious shaft down through the ice to the pyramid (provided by a predator space ship in orbit). the team then descends through the ice, to the pyramid, closely followed by a trio of recently arrived preds. the team unwittingly activates a mechanism to release the aliens. there's a twist however: the pyramid realigns itself ever ten minutes. the humans become trapped between the sides and are used as hosts by the aliens (what would you expect them to do?). thus enemies must work together against a common foe.<br/><br/>the acting in this film is first rate, with good performances by sanaa lathan, lance henricksen and raoul bova. other good things include excellent battle scenes between the aliens and predators and some very well directed tension. the bad things about this movie, to me, were that the predators seemed to die really easy to the aliens,(spoiler!) one alien killed two preds! bad things aside Anderson uses the pyramid rearranging itself to keep the audience guessing and create an air of trapped hopelessness throughout. this is a killer movie and an excellent thrilling action summer movie. any and all sci-fan fans should see this."

","This movie is just pure fun. What it may lack in actual filmatic excellence, it makes up with adrenaline pumping action. You can't go to this movie and not be entertained. Paul Anderson was a great choice, making this already novel idea even more exciting, adding his own story to an already great series of films. He has brought a Sci-Fi/Action flick sense to an already existing horror element, using his B-Movie sensibility to create a fun flick for any fan of the series or summer movie experiences. It's great to see these characters back on the screen, together at last.<br/><br/>By the way, just to prove this movie was incredible, after viewing the first showing at midnight, we stepped into the parking lot only to be mugged at gun point. This seemingly horrible experience probably would have been a lot worse, if the movie wasn't as sweet as it was. It made the whole ordeal into a rather funny joke, as the adrenaline from watching the movie had left us wondering, ""Who would have better disposed of those cracked up thieves; the Alien or the Predator?"".<br/><br/>We said the Alien. Come on! How cool would that be?!?!<br/><br/>For this kind of movie, on a 1-7 scale, I'd give it an 11."

","I would have given this a 9 or 10 but that would be TOO nice. The movie deserves a hard solid 8 for how great it was. The CGI wasent amazing but it didnt cease to amaze at any point and besides this was in 2004. The action sequences are so cool but a problem i have is that ITS RATED PG-13. So yeah because of that theres basically no gore but thats ok, im used to that in some of these predator and alien movies already, but there is a TON of alien and predator acid blood and slimeyness. The beginning was kind of boring but basically the whole movie was a thrill of a ride and so fun to watch. Now most versus films arent something to rave about i mean freddy vs jason wasnt bad but could have been a little bit better because they only fight during the end but in this movie the aliens and predators fight throughout but it dosent feel like theres enough hand to hand combat between them. There is one scene where there is a hand to hand combat between an alien and a predator but its really hard to make out with all the camera movements and up close shots of them fighting but in the end it was all great. Another problem i have is that the movie itself is clearly routing for the predator and makes the aliens seem like the bad guy and in the end the predator is the good guy when he was killing people too, kind of dumb but you really get to have feeling for the predator during the end. In a versus movie like freddy vs jason they both get equal amounts of screen time and you cant go wrong between any of them and you have to vote for whose gonna win and thats the meaning of a vs movie, so this one dosent succeed at the definition of vs. It should have been called predators meet aliens instead but hey the movies good and thats all that matters."

","Don't go into this movie with high expectations or you will be disappointed. The premise that Predators hunt the Aliens as part of their trophy in attaining the status of super warrior is awesome! I love it. The Predators are so cool and the Aliens are gnarly. Here's a short version of the plot: scientific team goes to Antartica to explore a strange pyramid found by satellite. They discover they are the bait in the Alien vs. Predator game. The rest is a slasher/alien horror (though not really scary) movie. You are not cheering for the humans but for either the Aliens or the Predator. It's Team Predator vs Team Alien. This isn't a horror movie but a game night movie. The question is will the Predators win or will the Aliens win and take over the world? Who cares about the humans..<br/><br/>In fact, two of AVP's biggest problems seem to be the result of breakneck-speed sloppiness: 1. The Alien life-cycle is inexplicably abbreviated, with chest-bursts making their nasty debuts in tens of minutes rather than tens of hours; 2. The Predators' long-range weapons (e.g. spears and throwing stars) are acid-resistant, yet their close-quarters materiel (e.g. wrist blades and body armor) are not. All in all, AVP did its job. With the exception of a handful of (de rigueur) overly-jittery/super-slow shutter-speed shots in otherwise well-made action sequences, AVP is a polished piece of work. Thanks to Anderson's direction, the ADI FX Workshop was forced to abandon the Mr. Hanky-looking design of the creature from ""Alien 3,"" as well as the beastly, overly slimy appearance of the extraterrestrials from ""Alien Resurrection,"" and provide the silver screen with its best looking xenomorphs since 1986.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 7 out of 10."
"skybrick736","4","0","0","6 August 2016"," AVP: Alien vs. Predator (4/10)
","Although it is nice to see the two most ruthless alien species on film going at it, there lies the first issue of the film. Both film franchises chronological timelines are now ruined with the xenomorphs being exposed in the Predators timeline (modern day). It's clear to see the Paul W.S. Anderson and the writers did have somewhat of an interest in maintaining some faith to the original alien franchise by casting Lance Henriksen as Sir Weyland, since the robot Bishop is supposedly made to look like his maker. Aside from that aspect, the storyline is completely silly with the only entertaining facet that the Predators and Aliens are facing off for the first time. Action sequences are prevalent and done rather well but there are no characters of redeeming value and the ending was a big miss. SPOILER: The notion that our main character was able to survive by ""picking sides"" was very, very stupid. A 4/10 rating is being pretty considerate but there is a part of myself, remembering back as a young viewer at the time AVP was in theatres, that I did enjoy seeing both alien species being on the big screen together."
"Leofwine_draca","4","0","0","16 October 2015"," There's some cool stuff here, but the film is still a failure
","Good idea, bad execution. I was looking forward to this cross-genre collaboration ever since I read a few of those alien vs. predator pulp novels about fifteen years ago, which provided high entertainment value all the way through. Sadly, the film is much less enthralling, offering a minimum of actual alien-on-predator action, instead focusing on a large bunch of uninteresting characters (mostly unknown actors) who wander around for about forty-five minutes before things start warming up. Now, the general plot sounds great; I love the way the mythology of Predators visiting ancient civilisations and instructing them to build pyramids ties up with real theories (try reading Chariots of the Gods) and the idea of a vast, ancient walled city beneath Antarctica is straight out of the Lovecraft story, At the Mountains of Madness. Sadly, this elaborate and expensive set-up eventually results in a load of uninteresting characters running around corridors in the dark, getting bumped off one by one.<br/><br/>Sigh. So far, so boring. The worst offender is unknown lead Sanaa Lathan, who goes for the tough heroine approach a la Sigourney Weaver, but she's bland and uninteresting in comparison. Then there's Italian heart-throb Raoul Bava as a charismatic archaeologist, and I did enjoy the twist involving his character towards the end. Heavyweight acting comes from Lance Henriksen, returning to the series after ALIENS and ALIEN 3. This time, though, he isn't the android Bishop, instead the old man who inspired creation of the androids in the future (this film is set in the present day). While it is cool to see Henriksen back in action – and I loved the pen trick, a reference to ALIENS – it's sad to see him as an ill, tired old man, and something of a wasted opportunity – I would loved to have seen him return as Bishop. Still, he has one good scene, involving him using a makeshift flamethrower on a retreating Predator – great spectacle!<br/><br/>Other actors include Snatch's Ewen Bremner, wasted as a kind-of comic relief Scotsman; then we're down to people like Patrick Troughton's grandson and that scarred guy out of GLADIATOR, but the characterisation attempts fall flat. As for the main contenders – the Predator is big, here, I mean real big, in different ""cold"" armour, but when he gets his helmet off, his make-up is crap and a big step down from that seen in the 1987 PREDATOR. What gives? Kudos, though, to the guys who did the Aliens, which are magnificent creations, looking scarier and more fluid than ever, whether it be chest-bursters, warriors or the Queen; great work all round. It's just a shame that ALL of the scenes involving either alien take place in the dark, so it's really hard to see what's going on.<br/><br/>Great special effects are just about what keeps you watching this movie. Certainly, with the rating cut down to PG-13, there's no gore or violence here like you'd see in the rest of the films from both series. Predictability rules outright, especially in the routine climax, which is only saved by some outrageously convincing CGI/model work, although it is a little reminiscent of JURASSIC PARK. There are only about 4 or 5 actual alien vs. predator fight scenes, and they are wicked; especially the scene where Predator swings the alien around his head before tossing it through the air. Lots of fun is had with the corrosive acid blood of the alien, and the high-tech weaponry of the Predator. Sadly, though, this is a wasted opportunity, best seen as a nostalgia piece that'll have you reaching for the original movies in the series to see how good they were in comparison."

The cinematography has that gory atmosphere and creepy feel in the second and third act, but it has that snowy Christmas-like atmosphere in the first act of the film. The problem that had film critics hammer this film was the PG-13 rating, to be honest, I don't mind this film having that rating because I understand what Paul W.S.

","First of all, I am rating the Unrated Edition of the film, which in my opinion is exactly the same as the theatrical one, albeit with some deleted scenes and few scenes containing more ""blood"".<br/><br/>This film suffers not only from poor direction but also from editing point of view and acting aside, the script simply sucks. From disregarding the continuation of the previous movies, like in some instances the honor code of the Predators and the skills of the predators but more importantly the lame excuse to put these two creatures is a far more baffling choice: SPOILER!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Every 100 years the predators return to the temple, which btw was built by the ancient people of the Aztec's and two other cultures for the predators as they worshipped them as gods, to hunt for the aliens which they achieve by hooking the queen to a machine so she lives again and lays eggs and some willing people sacrifice themselves to the facehuggers so a breed of xenomorphs is born.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief helps you if you are not an avid fan of both of the series, otherwise you simply can't enjoy this. Biased people also won't enjoy this as their favourite creatures don't display their real abilities, instead a dumbed down version of the aforementioned creatures.<br/><br/>Nevertheless it gets some bonus points, for me personally, for it's fighting scenes between the two title characters, but it is also cut short and edited so fast you can't almost see anything, but the joy of seeing these two fight it out is kinda like a fan boy dream of mine.<br/><br/>So for those who are avid followers, I wouldn't recommend it as it is just a rubbish excuse for some quick cash on both properties, and you won't be pleased with the acting either except maybe for the leading girl, who earns the respect and a spear from the king predator as she singlehandedly defeated an alien and was marked by the predator, with the acidic blood of the alien, that fought alongside her.(This is quite reminiscent of the final scene in Predator 2, where Danny Glover's character earns the respect of the Predators.) Otherwise this film is filled with a few nods to the previous entries of the two film series.

I'll stop therethere is really no comparing this to the origin series of either Alien or Predator. They sincerely made their own movie, even when using all mythos from the original franchises. That said, they really made a clichéd-filled and predictable movie that REALLY dropped the ball because they had the opportunity to put the character Alien into our time, the present and on EARTH finally and they chose to set this in the distant regions of Antarctica?

","AVP (Alien V Predator) has some brilliant monster design, great use of CGI and models which are all put to good use. AVP isn't that scary compared to the original films. It might scare a nine or ten year old but it does have a 12 rating. It does show all the monsters key traits, such as the Aliens ability to climb along walls and the Predators unique hunting weaponry. Whenever an Alien appears and something bad is about to happen the shot cuts away, this is frustrating. There is a lack of gore but loads of alien goo. The characters in this film aren't all that interesting, there are only 3 that really stand out. I found some of the characters annoying and the rest were just there to die. The story is good, set in 2004 on Earth a satellite passing over Antartica discovers heat signatures resembling a pyramid. Wayland Yutani, owner of the satellite, sets up a team to investigate.

That's okay, though, because the real attraction here is the amazing, seamless CGI efforts, anyway.<br/><br/>Story has one of Weyland's satellites detecting what appears to be an ancient pyramid 2,000 feet below the Antarctic ice. This structure seems to incorporate the styles of the Aztecs, Egyptians and Cambodians.<br/><br/>With his teams of drillers, scientists and guides assembled, the group lands at a small whaling village abandoned over 100 years ago. The drillers are not necessary here, though, because someone (or SOMETHING) has already made a nice big conduit that runs all the way to the bottom of the structure.<br/><br/>Character development is no longer needed at this point, because we all know what's going to happen with most of these people. The adage goes that the bigger the cast, the more people will die (in various ways, incidentally). This picture is no exception to that fact.<br/><br/>Sure enough, once the gang is in place, they discover to their horror that they are in the middle of a longtime, ongoing battle between extraterrestrials - the stainless steel, warlike creatures first introduced in the classic 1979 sci-fi film, Alien"" and the ugly, dread-locked, more humanoid monsters that Arnold Schwartzenegger went up against in 1987.<br/><br/>One by one, the cast is slaughtered until only a few are left to fend for themselves. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (""Mortal Kombat,"" ""Resident Evil"") keeps the chatter to a minimum while getting the battle started quickly. Special effects whiz, Gerd Fuecher (""Around the World In 80 Days"") also holds our interest with some amazing and very scary monstrous creations.<br/><br/>This film is sure to bring in huge box office revenues and its conclusion leaves no doubt that a sequel is soon on the way."

","A pyramid(full of traps, adding to the already excessive amount of threat in this, further diminishing the effect of any of it) is discovered in the Arctic, beneath the ice. Of course, a team is sent to investigate. With them are a bunch of armed mercenaries, because who doesn't bring that to an archaeological dig site? We don't actually care about any of these flat, undeveloped and stereotypical characters, we're here for the titular creatures. So this is bogged down by poor dialog and an attempt at build-up(because Anderson, in spite of confusing surprising the audience with entertaining them, isn't a *complete* tard) until we see them, halfway through. And then there is a bit of hit-and-miss action(the genre this fits into, and the wrong one for both species this has plenty of ""exciting"" things and doesn't go for proper atmosphere as it should and things either come out of nowhere or are ""cancelled out"", so tension is wasted(when it's there) and pay-off is nonexistent) as this continues to be erratic in pace, and then it ends. At 85 minutes, the credits roll. We leave unsatisfied. This is filmed and edited fine enough, if there is an abundance of stylization(who thought these beings needed slow-mo?). As far as effects go, this does favor practical over CGI, and they do look nice. The concept is overly detailed for a single picture(and the exposition reveals far too much about the extraterrestrials(taking away the mystery that gives them a firm grip on our psyche) and we see them weak and overpowered to the extent that we are no longer scared of them), it doesn't hold up to even a little questioning(there haven't been sacrifices to the pyramid for hundreds of years, where did the ""hosts"" come from?), and at the end of the day, if you want fighting between Aliens and Predators the video games(actually, this plot could have worked in that medium) are what you want. Yeah, the comics aren't that great, either. There is disturbing content, mild bloody violence and brief strong language in this. The 2-Disc Extreme Edition DVD has a nifty raised cover and comes with two commentaries(#1: director, Henriksen and Sanaa Lathan it's interesting and fun, if you can ignore the dumb things she says. And #2: the FX guys, who have a very dry sense of humor and are funny if you like that), various documentaries(most I will review on their own pages here on the site), 9 minutes of Deleted Scenes with the option of hearing their thoughts over them, a 7 minute featurette about the ADI Workshop(not bad), galleries of storyboards and concept art, an Inside Look of several movies, a trailer and a teaser.

If you want gore than just go to the sequel (which in my opinion is a bad idea because it starts where the first ends)People say the acting is horrible, well, actually, that's not much of what it sucks of. The acting was pretty good, actually, the actors really seemed to care for each other. But that brings me to the bad part, NO CHARACTERIZATION! So when somebody dies, the audience doesn't know enough about the person to really care that they're dead. Now onto the aliens and predators. The aliens in this movie are great. People say, ""they just go around killing"" actually, the need to harvest people, and the creators of the alien said ""they kill any threat"". Now onto the predators. One word: wow (sarcastic). The predators kill to live, in which a sense they did do in the beginning of the film, but then onwards it just got unrealistic. This film is good for a PG-13 movie, so if your'e a fan of cut off horrific death scenes and alright acting and unrealism to the kings of science-fiction, this is your movie. Hope you like it!"
"xamtaro","5","0","0","15 December 2009"," They have forgotten what made the Aliens and Predator films great
","It was only a matter of time after that Alien skull cameo in Predator 2 that someone made a movie pitting the ferocious Alien xenomorphs against the vicious Predators. Already that one scene spawned a number of video games, novels and a slew of comics, some good some terrible. It is quite disappointing that this movie would have to veer dangerously into the ""terrible"" range.<br/><br/>Alien Vs Predator starts off with the discovery of a pyramid deep under the antarctic ice. A team of explorers are sent in to investigate. Lo and Behold, they discover that the pyramid belongs to a space-faring species of hunters (the Predators) who use it to breed another type of Alien (the Aliens) as opponents/prey for their own hunting rituals. As usual, the humans screwed up what was to be a standard hunting trial for 3 young Predators by stealing their plasma weapons and unwittingly setting the Aliens free ahead of schedule. What follows is a frantic free for all as Humans, Aliens and Predators duke it out in one surprisingly bloodless fight after another. <br/><br/>Now of course coming to a movie with ""versus"" in the title would imply lots of fighting right? wrong. Alien Vs Predator is absolutely BORING for the first 45 minutes or so as we are introduced to one bland B movie stock character after another. Lots of talking, which no doubt the writers thought could pass off as ""character development"", happens but nothing else substantial aside from a little nod to Aliens fans in the form of Lance Henriksen playing the role of a character named ""Bishop"" again. <br/><br/>When the action finally does come, it is more bark than bite and ultimately not worth the 45 minute wait. There was only ONE actual bona-fide ""Alien vs Predator"" fight which is dressed to impress. An epic crescendo in the otherwise mediocre movie background music accompanies the very first big-screen face to face meeting of the two movie monsters. Fantastic fight choreography coupled with some clever use of slow motion makes that one fight very satisfying to watch and it is actually quite a nail-biter as you would never know who would turn out the victor until too late. However, any of the subsequent action sequences lack that level of intensity and actually seem a little ""cartoon-y"". Also some scenes involving the Aliens look to have been ""sped up"" in post production, possibly to make those scenes feel more frantic. <br/><br/>Sorry, but that one good fight just does not make up for the other disappointing ones. In fact, the creative team tended to be more partial toward the Aliens. The Predators are a far cry from the unstoppable killers in the previous movies. Here they are presented as big bulky bullies who pick on helpless humans with ease but are constantly being overpowered by their half-sized Alien opponents. It has been confirmed in behind-the-scenes interviews that director Paul WS Anderson is a bigger Alien fan than Predator fan, basically making the entire movie like a ""fixed"" fighting match with a biased referee.<br/><br/>Lots of action is a good thing, but action was NOT the only thing that made the Aliens and Predator movies the classics they are. Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" film managed to keep up its eerie atmosphere and genuinely scary feel while giving viewers some well written character drama, James Cameron's Aliens upped the action ante and threw in some very memorable and likable characters with an impressive production design. Alien Vs Predator had none of these. It was not scary, the characters were under-developed, the pacing was erratic. . . Even the 1987 Predator had better action, characters and some memorable movie dialog. The dialog in AVP is just too wooden to be memorable.<br/><br/>Failing to live up to the hype, Alien vs Predator is a big let-down for fans of the franchise. The entire premise, complete with hokey back-story about the Predators teaching ancient humans how to build pyramids, feels like a rejected video game. No doubt the set designs for the underground pyramid interior and the snowy antarctic scenes look awesome but that is where the praise usually ends.<br/><br/>There is an ""unrated and extended"" DVD edition that adds in some CGI blood and some longer scenes of fighting but a disappointing movie is still a disappointing movie no matter how you try to coat it and market it. The fact that the versus match was fixed from the start does NOT help matters. AVP is essentially a whole lot of ""style"" trying to mask the lack of substance."

","I must admit I'd avoided watching this film for a while expecting it to be terrible, however when it was on television I decided to give it a go. While I don't think it was as good as the original films it was better than I expected.<br/><br/>Set on present day Earth a heat signature is spotted deep under the Antarctic ice, satellite images show that it appears to be a pyramid. An expedition is set up by Charles Bishop Weyland to investigate this strange find. When they get there they are surprised to discover a shaft leading from the surface to the pyramid, assuming it must have been made by another team of explorers they head down, little knowing that it was in fact made by a Predator hunting party that lands soon after and wipes out the surface party. About the same time an Alien queen within the pyramid is awakened and starts laying eggs. Shortly after the team divide into two groups they trigger a mechanism which causes parts of the pyramid to move, trapping one group in a room into which Alien eggs are inserted with the inevitable results. The remaining explorers must then battle to survive against the Aliens which the small group of Predators intend to hunt as a rite of passage.<br/><br/>Fans of the original films may be disappointed at this much tamer combination of the two, the lower rating means that there is almost no real gore and it is never really frightening. It isn't a terrible story though, the acting isn't bad and the special effects are pretty good so if you haven't seen it and it is on television it is worth watching, I won't be buying the DVD though."

","Sadly, I went into this film expecting some mind-blowing action scenes... then I learned that the director was Paul W.S. Anderson, the monstrous idiot who directed Resident Evil... and I was disappointed with the end result of AVP.<br/><br/>The writing, while a good concept, is executed poorly. The character development is cliché, and could've been ripped-off of the most wretched of Sci-Fi's original movies. The first 45-minutes is an introduction to the cast, and each of them are clichéd messes: from the geek, to the foreigner, it's the simple necessities of the average horror flick. Not one bit of dialogue flows well, and whenever there's foreshadowing -- like Sebastian and his reference to the moon being called ""hunter's moon""... predictable, and terribly performed.<br/><br/>The directing is awful, and Anderson proclaimed his love for the original Alien, yet that inspiration is not seen. For a film titled Alien vs. Predator, the film seems to focus primarily on the former of the latter. In fact, the Predators are so clumsy and terribly portrayed, I nearly walked out of the theater right then and there. Anderson has no idea about pace, as the film drags on and on, trying to setup each species and the events that are about to unfold, all ending in a big explosion of disappointment.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good. Probably the only good thing in this garbage. The Celtic Predator and Queen Alien are remarkably cool looking, even if their screen-time is limited to about 5-10 minutes apiece.<br/><br/>The music is passable. I wouldn't mind tossing it out of a window to see it clatter and shatter for it's non-complexity and its lack of continuity in using any of the prior material from the Predator or Alien franchise.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is just too bad. The ending is horrible, allowing no use of character development. There's no one to root for but the antagonists, who become the protagonists... ugh, just bad bad bad. I highly recommend you not to see this, as it does not belong in the same room as the Alien and Predator franchises."

The 'stock actors' are just cardboard cutouts designed to be sitting ducks for the Aliens and Predators. The weak addition of Bishop (a staple in the ""Alien"" series) is totally uncalled for, and raises more questions than ever.

Much the same to Aliens in terms of the plot but not the best support acting. Winona Ryder was not a good choice, hated every bit of her acting. Not suited to this style at all. Weaver once again great but clearly a change from the first film, a lot less heart, tougher and stronger but I put the blame down to having to bring her back from the dead.

Well, even if its called Alien vs Predator, you don't see much of it. Most of the time you can watch the guys and girls of the expedition team running through a big pyramid, which oddly enough works like the 'Cube' in 'The Cube'. This wouldn't be so bad if they were complex and well played characters - but they aren't. The only really good scenes are the fights between the Aliens and the Predators, and they are much too short. Another really big flaw are all the logic mistakes. I won't name them, but it was like one mistake every 5 minutes. (For example: in The Predator Schwarzenegger can hide from the Predator by covering himself in mud to trick the heat-sensitive camera of the Predator. In AVP a guy lies 5 minutes in the cold and his face is covered with ICE, and the Predators have no problem to find him). <br/><br/>The only positive thing beside the fighting scenes are the special effects - especially the models of the aliens and predators.

There were video games in the arcade, computers and game systems with marines fighting the two creatures along with action figures that I used to see from Toys R' Us and Kaybee's.

","To start Alien vs predator is a waste of a movie. Alien vs Predator doesn't show that much violence. It almost never shows any people getting killed on screen. The movie wasn't smartly made, it was poorly made. There is more violence and blood in some PG movies! It shows you one time when a baby alien bursts through a women's chest and it wasn't bloody at all (little blood shown). the gore in the movie is mostly, actually all alien and predator! Why am I bagging on how much violence is shown in the movie? I am doing this because the movies where this movie originated from was packed with violence and gore and are all rated R, this one is rated PG-13. I heard 20th Century Fox deleted most of the gore and violence in the movie because it would be rated R. Let me say if it was rated R it probably would have been better. They stayed true to the movies where it originated from and I give them credit for that, but they just didn't stay true to the violence. The whole story and plot is simple and they don't entertain you enough to back it up. They lure you in with good trailers and get you excited with adrenaline and all, you go buy that movie and it leaves you wishing for more (I hate that!). That's usually how they set up a sequel and they did make a sequel (I didn't get to see it yet which I'm happy I didn't because I heard this one is a waste to). Now this one is rated R. Alien vs Predator is mostly boring and dumb. The movie left me wishing for way more. To round it all up Alien vs Predator is a waste and a bad movie."

Pretty much, this movie focuses on humans instead of the famous movie creatures.

Amalgamated Dynamics Inc. (ADI) did pretty well in this movie. Companies Double Negative, Cinesite, Framestore CFC and Ghost (Bionicle fans who saw this movie will recognize the commercials they did) were also good.

"AdderCowley","4","0","0","25 April 2008"," Potential wasted
","This idea had so much potential, anybody who's read the comics would attest to that, and yet it is unbelievable that the film was so mediocre. A question one might ask is whether or not Anderson (and no I can't be bothered to look for his full name), did actually see the films prior to this disaster. Anybody knows that both franchises are built around suspense. The first alien film for example has barely a dozen scenes which contain the alien and yet it delivers so well. Indeed Anderson does seem to attempt to employ this technique as the first 40 minutes or so are completely devoid of action trying to build to the confrontation between the Alien and Predator. Thus around half the film is spent leading up to a moment which itself is poorly conceived, not convincingly suspenseful overall. This was mainly because of the weak editing as well as the lack of decent dialogue, just one liner clichés.<br/><br/>Secondly there is a chronic lack of fighting within the film, indeed there is more confrontation between the humans and the aliens when compared to the two alien groups fighting each other. There is one fairly action packed scene around half way through but the camera angles are so obscured and the scene cuts from one angle to another so much that in the end little is actually visible. The film does seem to focus around the humans which allows the director to focus on the emotions of the situation, however this is not done well, as none of the characters (with exception of the Scot) do not appeal. This is most especially evident with the main character Lex who appears to spend one half of the film telling people that something bad will happen, and the other half snivelling and crying, somehow surviving death or worse while her colleagues are brutally stabbed, maimed, skinned, impregnated by face huggers or skewered.<br/><br/>However the main problem of the film is that it builds no suspense, creates no drama and is a measly 90 minutes long, not to mention the lack of gore (which was usually a convention in the other films). No skinning is actually shown (as the humans are merely hung up) and the chest bursting scenes are usually implied or cut away at the goriest moment. Secondly the pacing of the film is very bad. This attributes to not only the short length of the film but also the lack of suspense. Aliens are born and mature in a matter of minutes when in the previous films they take hours if not days to become adult. This completely loses the suspense and terror of the previous films.<br/><br/>Like all mediocre action movies these days (because this was an action film not a thriller that the Alien films were or the action/suspense genre of the Predator films) is that the graphics are decent. Unsurprisingly it seems that the animation have taken priority and that the actual work on set (which is rumoured to have only been in production for 2 1/2 months) shows. Interestingly the computer graphics are in stark contrast to the mechanic puppets and predator suits used. Usually I'm a huge advocate for the use of puppetry in such films but in this case it was poorly done and thus juxtaposed badly with the animation becoming tacky and dated. So even on the graphic front the film fails to impress.<br/><br/>Thus an idea which has had so much speculation and is seen to have so much potential was poorly directed, edited and executed. Very disappointing."

I mean, ""A girl helps a monster, becoming a hero""(I kinda like that though...) has been done more than once right? Then, this is not the first or worst R-to-PG-13 movie, Did you watch Robocop 3? The 1st one is total violence with x rating, the second is grotesque and violent, the third, just destroy it up..., Robocop 3 receives worse ratings than WARNING: Contain several strong language and spoilers.<br/><br/>AVP:Alien versus Predator. Then, there's Live free or die hard. after AVP. And, people liked LFODH, why not this? Well, perhaps cause AVP:Alien versus Predator was a battle between 2 of the world's scariest monsters!To me, R-To-PG-13 is just mediocre. If you type in AVP:R here at IMDb, you'll see the R-rated sequel with a worse rating(Ha ha ha....)The second one is pointless and has many plot holes. The first one, features awesome CGI and the predator looks like Hercules, and the Aliens were more intelligent, able to free their queen with her own acidic blood. What else could you ask? R-Rating? watch the unrated edition for that man! Not the theatrical version!!!Pointless carnage? Watch the second one, but this first film has its own uniqueness, so stop criticizing it. Its not Uwe boll's movie, and I'm not that fat guy Roger Edbert, who criticizes, a lot! Well, I don't wanna complain about Edbert. Goodbye, give AVO:Alien versus Predator a chance."

I suppose we new that would happen but the whole idea of the film is to see the Alien and Predators kill each other.I thought it was stupid when Alexa befriends one of the predators. <br/><br/>The only positive things i can really give about this film is that the CGI is really good, the fighting sequences are good and the story is OK.

","First off, i don't see what everyones problem is with this movie. It's one of those movies that is not as good as either of the films main characters movies, and in this case those are alien, and predator. The acting is, well, OK, the best actor without a doubt is Lance Henrikson. The rest are, OK. And definitely the ending left us wondering if there was going to be a sequel with a predator alien hybrid.<br/><br/>I think the reason this movie is trashed so much is because both alien and predator are rated R, and this is rated PG-13, that was a bad move. AVP R, is rated R and i think this will bring in a much broader audience.<br/><br/>So basically, the movie is pretty good and worth watching. I don't think the director Paul W.S. Anderson will be directing another AVP movie in his lifetime because of the disappointment of this film."

","Combining Fox's two great sci-fi movie monsters, Aliens and Predators, with a Stargate-esquire back story about alien gods and ancient pyramids in the Antarctic must have seemed like a great idea at the time. But somehow it falls flat. I'm usually a big fan of writer / director Paul WS Anderson (I loved Event Horizon, and the first Resident Evil is one of the few video game movie adaptations that stands on its own merits), but I'm afraid he really stumbles here.<br/><br/>The script could have used another pass to tighten it up before shooting began. The opening is rather clumsy and shows too much too early, missing out on the slow build up of tension which worked so well in Alien, Aliens and Predator. Most of the ""characters"" are faceless cannon fodder, even the central characters are woefully under-developed, and everyone dies too quickly for the viewer to really care about any of them.<br/><br/>There are also a host of glaring continuity errors, plot holes and contradictions of things we've already seen in previous Alien and Predator movies, like the way the Aliens in AvP apparently go from an egg being laid to hatching to implanting to chest bursting to being full grown adults in the space of a few hours.<br/><br/>All of which would be forgivable if the action lived up to expectations. But it doesn't. There aren't any memorable set pieces, the Predators look like chubby WWE wrestlers, the occasional slow motion shots don't really add anything, and there just isn't enough Alien on Predator action to keep you interested, while the humans are predictably pretty much wiped out within a few minutes of encountering the two alien species. Unlike the original Predator and all four Alien movies, there just aren't any fights, chases or reveals that really stick in the mind, and the whole film flashes by in a blur in just over an hour and a half.<br/><br/>All in all its a bit disappointing, and the prospect of Aliens vs Predator (see what they did there?) coming soon is enough to fill fans of either franchise with fear."

Its been awhile since seeing the Predators, so it was more pleasing seeing them again. As far as the other characters in this movie , I think there were to many of them. Then again, its always nice seeing humans get slaughtered by the extraterrestrials. There's a cameo with the human explores that was also in a previous films.As far as adding to the story of both the Aliens and the Predator this film does real well, it's like the comic coming to life.

","Overall, this movie is fair. We (my friends and I) discovered many holes in the story line, the first one in the very beginning with the whole concept: Alien is set in the future, and Predator landed on earth 18 years ago. And that is just the beginning. The plot becomes weaker when a Predator befriends a human. I do not remember compassion for humans as one of the Predator characteristics, even if it would benefit their own survival.<br/><br/>The action is great; in fact, I even remember one scene -spoiler?- where we actually see the baby alien jump thru the air to attach to a person to implant the embryo. What an awesome work of cinematography! The way the camera deliberately slowed down and then resumed normal speed was impressive, and a few other scenes had some note-worthy special effects. The notable Lance Henrickson, who we all should remember as an android in ""Alien,"" as the HUMAN owner of the satellite that first discovers a mysterious pyramid in Antarctica, and puts together a team of individuals to investigate.

","So, I didn't expect much from this movie. I haven't seen any of the Predator movies, but I have seen all Alien movies (and think that James Cameron's Aliens is probably the best film ever made). It turns out that AvP was better than expected. Which doesn't say a lot, but still.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed the first hour or so of AvP. It was seldom suspenseful, but quite entertaining anyway. I liked how every single character was killed, one by one. However, once Alexa Woods started interacting with the predator it all got a bit too silly for my taste. In fact, I couldn't shake the image of Alexa and the predator getting hitched in Las Vegas. A rather amusing image, to say the least, but hardly, and hopefully not, what the director/writer had intended.<br/><br/>So, up until the last half hour or so, AvP was quite a good film, but it got too silly in the end.

The plot which seemed pathetic at first, to test the future predators against aliens, works out well after you watch it twice. Indian made young braves do the same, as did Aztec warriors, so why not an advanced civilization. the hike leader , whoever she is, is definitely the best actor in this movie. the cgi graphics are amazing, watching the predators come in and go out is fabulous. the ending watching the creature come out the injured or dead predator inside the predator ship lets you know there maybe a chance for a part 2.

","My lasting impression of AVP will be that of the lead woman being tossed onto the surface of the Antarctic island wearing just slacks and a light sweater and then being out there for 20 minutes like it's L.A. in May.<br/><br/>My hope was to see a movie focused on the Predator in some situation more challenging than sniping Arnold's oblivious commando team from the trees. Not in this film. These Predators are easily distracted and careless. It's worth noting that the Predators consider the Aliens so dangerous that they will nuke the area to ensure no Alien's get loose. Yet, in a place infested with them the Predator stops to remove his helmet to perform a hunting ritual. Aren't the rituals usually held until *after* the hunt?!? I give it a 5/10 because of the special effects. It had potential but the creatures were underutilized and there just wasn't that creepy feeling that the originals had. In both originals the humans walked around always fearful that the creature could strike at any time. You could feel them being stalked. In this film you don't get that feeling.<br/><br/>Worth a DVD rental. Glad I did pay $7.50 at the movies."

Other than those annoyances, the gist of the story is intact. Predators ""breeding"" Aliens for the hunt, humans getting in the way, one of them surviving, joining in the kill and being ""marked"" for it like a Predator.<br/><br/>What I did not get, I mean simply did not get, was the whole facehugger-to-alien in 30 minutes or less thing...if you want to voice an apologetic, I guess you could excuse it by saying the Queen is in duress, so the facehuggers are driven to rapid reproduction. It doesn't necessarily jibe with the timelines in the other movies for the belly-bursters, but hey...who's counting right? To be truthful, I can't say I was expecting anything, but I do know if all I had been treated to was an Alien/Predator bloodbath (or acid-bath, as the case may be) I'd have bolted inside of 10 minutes...I can see that kind of pointless noise three times a week or more on SciFi.<br/><br/>On the whole I liked it well enough.

","Excellent film and deserves an 8 out of 10. Loved it for the action sequences, special effects, characters, atmosphere, storyline and oh yeah the predator. Borrowed a lot from the book Alien versus Predator: Prey by Steve Perry and arguably i found the book better than the film. Same female lead character who teams up with the predator and battles the aliens, although its obviously different circumstances the spine of the story is still the same, disappointing a little. Would of liked more fights between the alien/ predators and for the predators to be a little less whimpish, and to of lasted longer. Excellent SFX with the CGI used for distance shots and the models for the close ups and some of the fight work. Very pleasing on the eye as this lends to a more realistic feel for the film as opposed to the Hulk for instance. Could also of done with the whole film being longer and a more detailed look at weans character as he does pioneer the synthetic life-forms in alien. Although i expect more money would have to of changed hands for the alien franchise to of agreed to that. But the film is still quality and watchable repeatedly..<br/><br/>Borrowing from the above comment to place the films in order of movie quality, in my opinion it would be Predator (jus because it has arnie in it, and he shouts ""go, run, get to the chopper!"")

Well I think that being a hero, it doesn't matter the way you look. What matters is your character, your will and the ability to use everything around you to survive. That's what Alexa did in the movie. She used her brain the same way Sebastian De Rosa did. She came to a conclusion and acted the way she thought best to survive and make sure that the aliens won't come in the surface.

I agree it's not as classy as the original Alien or Predator, but no 4th/2nd sequel is ever going to do that. The original Alien is now a huge part of popular culture, how are they going to surprise you? The whole point is - we've got another Alien and Predator bunfight to look at and it doesn't disappoint AFAIC! To the people who picked holes in the narrative: 1. The explorers didn't awaken the queen, the predators did. that's why they're coming! 2.The predators activated the pyramid, empty since the mishap 2000yrs ago (they've been on one-man trips to earth's jungles since, and who knows where else) 3.They knew there would be hosts for the eggs due to the activation, they know how advanced humans have become in the last while, but remember we're still cattle to them. 4. the queen was unfrozen with the activation of the pyramid, that's what she's there for, she is a farm animal to the predators! 5. The speed of the maturation of the aliens IS a bit doubtful, but remember, these creatures have been genetically engineered by the predators to be a worthy adversary. Nothing seen in other films is valid as these are previous generations from an original queen not released into the wild, this is an artificial organism, that's why it is so weird. 6.The characterisation is a bit lacking but to flesh it out would have slowed the film right down, the idea is to get on with the action, I suspect there are no plans to reprise any of these characters as the end sets the scene for finding the alien ship centuries later in Alien1. 7. The characters know what is going on because they deciphered the hieroglyphics which tells the history of the pyramid. Obviously some slaves survived the original cataclysm and finished the story while working for the predator cleanup crew, there must have been one or the pyramid would have been in shit state. 8.no-one told ripley about these things!! of course not that was the whole point of the first film, a secret directive to capture an alien (and in the 2nd)passed down no doubt from charles weyland, the model for the bishop android and no doubt cloned due to ill health over the centuries. what was the company? weyland-yutani?<br/><br/>I could go on but my punctuation is failing and it is late.

I did however love a few scenes with the Predators and Aliens in battle. I've read some of the comic and if they had followed the story in the comic, this film could have become a sci-fi classic. But no, it only borrows some ideas and makes what every Hollywood film is doing more today than ever it seems a film with a few good ideas which they hope will float the boat. The film was actually not THAT bad until the ""escape"" scene, where I think the director must have thought ""hey, now we've shown everything from the old movies, now we HAVE TO show them something new, no matter how stupid or silly it may seem!""

","I suppose it's hard to make a serious movie about aliens and predators. But what you sure can do is a movie that looks groovy and feels good to the eye. It's not even that hard, given that since the last Alien/Predator films, which looked and felt good, technology has advanced at an absorbing rhythm. In a way, that's also the problem: you have to know how and when to use special effects. If you don't, you risk a big flop. <br/><br/>Is AvP a flop? Sadly, yes. Its rather eye-brow raising story and character ""development"", as well as the terribly distant cinematic experience just add up to an unsatisfying product. It's not bad for a Friday night, but if that's your standard, then there's nothing anyone can do about it. Anderson is incurable. I wouldn't say he's a big idiot, because it'd be a bit harsh. He did kind of ruin/diminish some interesting franchises (Resident Evil and this here), but I'm sure he was all well intentioned. Maybe things would've worked out different if he hadn't written the script, but it's a mystery to me why people keep on laying this terribly heavy burden upon his shoulders.<br/><br/>AvP is another recycled flick, as are all of Anderson's ""creations"". A bit of this, a bit of that, even a reasonably big bit of Resident Evil techniques and: voila! Here's your blockbuster. I don't know how to describe this feeling inside. Maybe the actual lack of it is enough of a fact. Also, I don't understand why people keep saying ""it feels like a video game"" to all the recent adaptations of games for the big screen. None of the films actually feel as a video game, because while playing a VG you immerse into an extravagant universe and become obsessively accustomed with it. This just doesn't happen with the films. Oh, so you mean games are nearly stupid and rather simplistic, not material enough for the brain-chewing audience? Well, if a film could achieve half of the atmosphere, tension and involvement a good game does, then it'd be a terrific experience.<br/><br/>I wonder whether AvP is based on the games...or whether it is a face off between the two films. It's difficult to make a connection based on the film and that does say something. Anderson has to stop writing screenplays the way I have to stop singing during breaks at school.

But finally, it is simply ALIEN vs. PREDATOR - the title says it all. So get a bag of popcorn, put some Slipknot in your mp3 player and enjoy the images!"

","Now, ... I'm from Germany and a great Alien and Predator admirer. So I couldn't wait to see this movie.

And I can tell you - I wasn't disappointed at ALL!<br/><br/>Anderson did a great job. Didn't expect that! ... I loved to see my favourite creatures up so close and in detail. The story created great suspense, and the design of the pyramid and the CG were great!

","Whoever Wins, We Loose  Spoilers Within<br/><br/>Well, I can't say I was disappointed - I'm in the UK and heard all the 'hype' prior to the release. I had decided to avoid this at the cinema due to all the bad things I'd heard but after watching Film 2004 with 'Jonathan Ross' I was swayed. He confirmed what I already suspected, that AVP was a commercial attempt at resurrecting two classic pillars of sci-fi history but surprised me by saying that it was equally watchable and visually pleasing. I decided to take his advice and give the film a chance.<br/><br/>I feel I must apologise to the other people in the cinema, for my outbursts of laughter and sniggering. I remember some years ago, coming out of a cinema in Cambridge and praying that there would never be another Aliens sequel following the Resurrections desperate attempts to re-kindle the dying embers of a once great story. Compared to AVP, Resurrection is a classic...<br/><br/>Before I start I'd like to say I don't have a problem with Anderson - a lot of people don't like his work. I think Resident Evil was a great adaptation of a Computer Game, and Solider was just plain entertaining, commercial but entertaining.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, as a commercial film AVP will no doubt succeed at the box office, I'm sure the twelve to fifteen yr-olds will love it. It looks very expensive, has a couple of big explosions and some great looking aliens. But that's where it ends. The potential greatness of this movie has had me excited for ages and I thought there was nothing they could do to spoil it. Anderson shouldn't have accepted the script if he had no love for the project.<br/><br/>Story Line - Great Idea for a plot  loads of potential, the timescale ties the two alien races in together nicely, the idea of the pyramid was understandable and reinforced the predators desire for honour in combat. I still can't comprehend why a huge killing machine like the predator would team up with a lowly human? The relationship between predators and humans has always been as hunter and pray, any 'friendship' was always based on the respect for the prey, not a deep seeded need to work as a team and be nice to each other, as someone commented, It was like watching an episode of the care bears.<br/><br/>Continuity  This is where the film really missed the target. Both the Predator and Aliens series are bathed in cult status and should have been respected far more. Applying a few rules to a sequel/prequel is essential in making the continuing story both believable and consistent. I'm unsure what Anderson was thinking when someone decided to lay this films timeline out over a few hours? but it ruined the atmosphere. It really was the first mistake that cascaded into the disaster that we see today. The restrictive timeline meant that the Full Alien Development Cycle was drastically shortened to an amazing (get this) 15 mins ! That's from the queen laying the first egg to face hugger hatching to human host being inseminated to chest-burster erupting and growing into a full battle hardened alien?<br/><br/>Characters - While this whirlwind of chaos was unravelling we were subjected to a tedious flash back explaining every detail of why these alien species were on earth. (not required and insulting to anyone with an ounce of grey matter) and then it was over. Before I knew what was happening our heroes (now best of friends) emerge on the ice for one last slog with the Alien queen, the fact that I can't remember the lead characters name is bad but the fact that I couldn't care less, even more worrying I was praying for the female character to be killed off in some kind of justification but no, now we get the one to one respect scene, that should have been the culmination of the human/predator relationship.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling violated, not a whimper of sympathy for any of the characters (Plenty for the actors) No respect for Anderson or the creative Team, and not even a glimmer of interest in the oh, so obviously nauseating 'suggestion' of the impending sequel. I refuse to believe that there is anyone stupid enough (even in Hollywood) to forget or overlook all of these and many other glaringly obvious plot holes. My only conclusion is that they weren't stupid. they just didn't care. And that is an unforgivable crime in my eyes as making movies should be about telling a story and creating a vision. Not creating piles of cash<br/><br/>My summation AVP is a top rate commercial achievement. No creativity  Minimal writing Talent  Just a huge pile of cash made off the back of a successful series, if you loved the previous movies please don't bother this will make you cringe  if your fairly laid back and want something to put on at your kids sleep over, this'll be right up your street."

","<This review contains some spoilers><br/><br/>It might have seemed at one point, an interesting idea, brought to effect in a computer game, but no further. Fox obviously saw an opportunity to meld together two iconic alien creatures in one film and have them face-off. That'll get the fanboys wet with excitement. You can bet someone thought that at one point. However, greenlight it they did. Like they were ever going to say no. In order for them to have an excuse to battle, a credible storyline had to have been produced for it to happen. It didn't, and what we get is some nonsense about the predators teaching humans to build and us worshiping them as gods. So a type of initiation rite meant them proving themselves by fighting aliens in a pyramid in the Antarctic. Humans are lured there to act as hosts. That's about it really. It dosen't really get any more complicated than that. It's basically an excuse for them to battle.<br/><br/>Up until the point where they eventually see the pyramid beneath the ice, the film is, I suppose, quite interesting, but then the predators arrive, and you can see the rest of the film mapped out. Humans trying to survive with the predators and aliens about. Then it reaches a point where there is only one predator and one human left, and guess what? Yes, they team up. I felt that at this point, it was trying to impose some sort of empathy with the predator. Are we meant to feel sorry for it against these nasty aliens? It doesn't work, and the predators themselves simply come across as men in costumes. Its hard to think of them as aliens.<br/><br/>Towards the end, where the alien queen is up on the surface, she reminded me of the T-Rex in Jurassic park. The effects were great. However, that's the best thing I can say about it. With today's standards in cgi and puppetry, you wouldn't expect a cheap, straight to video or made for TV film. It's a pity the film itself couldn't match the effects for quality, but come across as simply an excuse for these aliens to face-off. This is film I cannot recommend."

","Unbelievable how two of the best sci-fi franchises in history could be brought together on the same screen, and result in a great film. Both Aliens and Predator films are considered top of the sci-fi league, and in this case AVP does not disappoint if you give it half a chance.<br/><br/>Most of the characters in this movie you will care about, I especially enjoyed Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner from Trainspotting). He brought a satirical feel to the first half of the film but becomes a sad victim before long. There's not much I can tell you about AvP without spoiling the entire movie, only that the liasoning of the films ""hero"" with the Predator seemed quite tacky and the ending unbelievable and Hollywood-ish, something a classic Alien film should never be. However, it was great to see proper special effects being used and very little use of CGI effects. The (few) fights between the aliens are very entertaining and the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the film if you can shut off the overwhelming hype.<br/><br/>8/10"

There are moments of tension, suspense, comic relief, nods to the original movies, and some great action - enough to keep you entertained for the whole trip. As I said before, I didn't think it was perfect, there was some dire dialogue and the characters were almost non-existent, and I didn't find Colin Salmon that appealing (although I thought he was better than he was in Resident Evil).

","It is an impossible task to please the fans of both these movies, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't have been attempted. No attempt seems to have been made and this is certainly not an Alien movie. The story and structure of the film is a combination of 13 ghosts, Cube, and Stargate. It just so happens that the monsters involved happen to be Aliens and predators. Cliché after cliché is thrust down our throats with out any attempt to disguise that this was written in 5 minutes with no thought or depth. The whole pyramid idea has been done to death so many times before it beggars belief it could be attempted again. The acting is the worst I have seen in any of the films, but then the dialouge was awful so thats hardly surprising. It plays out like a kids movie feeling it needs to explain everything that is happening. The Alien movies were great, you had a real sense of a Universe you wanted to know more about through your own imagination.<br/><br/>If you watch this having never seen any of the previous films you would think that this was an enjoyable action film, and that it is. Watching the aliens and Predators fight it out is cool. Sadly if you've seen the previous films (in particular the Alien Trilogy) than this is a severe waste of a license."

AVP was never going to be a work of art, never going to be an Oscar winner. Any story involving bringing these two together was, from the outset, going to fall down. I for one enjoyed this movie and refuse to nitpick what was a valiant effort to entertain. It is sad that people can be so self centred and not see that movies are there to entertain. Movies are a form of enjoyment. Most of the 'critic's' here enjoy the power they have to debase and run down other peoples efforts.

","Two of the greatest science fiction sagas finally meet on the big screen. It's something many of us have been waiting for a long long time. Hardcore fans of both series are at least familiar with the video game and the comics and watching the film may find a few similarities, especially with the comics. We are not talking about a masterpiece here, but I don't think that anyone would expect some Oscar performances in a film full of sci-fi monstrous creatures. Whoever is a great fan of both Aliens and the Predator will almost definitely enjoy this film. Some questions may be occur; questions that director Paul W.S. Anderson sustains they shall be cleared out in the integral version, on schedule to appear on the DVD release. Whoever just seeks to see an action film will remain satisfied but still the lack of knowledge on the two species may cause some frustration. It seems at times that this movie has been made for the ones that have already watched the Alien and Predator films as many of the details just don't get explained.<br/><br/>Alien VS Predator is a nice shot of making the dream of many of the sagas' fans come true."

","Firstly what's PG-13 to America is 15 here in the UK- and considering almost every other Alien/Predator related flick has been an 18, the rot set in right there. Considering there's plenty of yellow and green blood flying around all over the place, it's a mystery why the fights have been ""MTV'd"" to death since there's no human blood going on - hardly a spoiler when you look at the certificate.<br/><br/>If Anderson had been honest and told us the great historical setup he hyped on the official site was going to be 30 seconds in the finished product, I wouldn't have been so disappointed. Setting this in Antartica brings back fleeting shades of John Carpenter's The Thing and reminds you that there's no attempt to bother scaring anyone, once the characters have been moved to where the action will start. The script is just travelog and smacks of Jurassic Park as Colin Salmon and Lance Henriksen do the Jurassic Park fairy Godfather routine, bribing the cast to go on the voyage. Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen make more of the dire script through their acting ability, but Ewen Bremner's the comic relief and everyone else, forgettable. I would say rent it and wait for director's cut(s) on DVD, then at least you can see a complete mess for adults in the comfort of your own home, rather than this edited one for kids and teens. Disappointment. Anderson is no David Fincher but the same thing has happened with him v the studios, and he lost. When we see what was intended on the small screen, that's when we can blame Anderson rather than the producers who were giving orders to the editors.<br/><br/>If there's a sequel, just closely adapt the comics, that's why they're classics. It's getting to desperate times in Hollywood when the PC game from five years ago gave better entertainment, was a bigger hit and cost a hell of a lot less to make than the film you just went out to watch."

","Visually this is a very good movie. A film where care has been taken in the production. Experienced and skillful people made this movie. The Predators and Aliens look and move well. The individual scenes all work well when taken in isolation.<br/><br/>But what happened to the rest of the movie? The one I saw was less than 90 minutes long. IMDb attributed 101 minutes to AVP at the time of this review. Something is missing. Several things are missing. The most obvious are character development and the blood and guts of humans. Who cares about the humans dying when we don't know their names, don't know anything about their lives (except that some of them are parents) and they speak American with funny accents (for example Scottish, English and a Scottish-European hybrid). The version I saw had a UK 15 certificate: the predators and Aliens were killed with acid/green blood and body-arts flying everywhere but the humans all died off stage. There is no red blood. There is also no explanation why the previously extra-hot weather loving Predators are now suddenly playing in the ice.<br/><br/>Perhaps all these missing things are on the cutting room floor and another special edition DVD will reinstate them and their synergy. Aliens and Predator are diverse multi-media franchises and they are big enough to absorb the damage caused by this failure.<br/><br/>The movie also features a pretty but historically inaccurate whaling station.<br/><br/>For a good frozen wastes movie you should watch John Carpenter's The Thing instead. In this form AVP is for the completionist only.<br/><br/>Final Score: 3/10"

I usually don't like movies where different monsters and characters, popular as individuals, are suddenly united in movies like ""Van Helsing"" and ""Freddy vs. Jason"". These two are perfect examples on how NOT to make such a movie. But ""Alien vs. Predator"" don't seem to have this ""versus-problem"" at all.

","Okay as I always say in any review 'it's a movie, it isn't Shakespeare'. But sometimes I wonder if the scriptwriters understand the word Sequel. You would think that they would think, 'Goody, the back story is written now I can really get down to it'. That is, they build on the story, writing a script, which is continuation of the popular myth the previous successful movie created. In AvP they had the perfect opportunity, but instead of fitting the script to the myth, they, and they are not alone in this, (I sometimes think the screen writers guild must run a course called 'Sequel Writing  How to ignore the blatantly obvious'). They tinker with the details of the previous successful movies to fit their substandard script, (IE the gestation period of an Alien is changed to 30 seconds) rather than be constrained within the back story.<br/><br/>What this does is create an environment that produces plot holes. Because when you start tinkering with the basic story this leads down to making other changes that eventually creates more and more compromises. This movie had plot holes a plenty, but I just ignored them and enjoyed the shallow movie it was.<br/><br/>One comment though, the Predators better speed up the testing their Warriors. If the 3 Predators are an example of their best then these boys must be in decline. In previous visits they took on Aliens in there 100's. These guys had trouble with 9. I would ask their Coach, have they become too reliant on their shoulder cannons?? And whomever makes their Armour should be speared, please at least give these novices acid resistant Armour."

If you own firearms and aren't afraid of using it, please hear me out.<br/><br/>Let's first talk about the story, which for all the loopholes that break out faster than an alien facehugger does, is still bearable by any means. We've got the usual anomality signal somewhere in a far unpopulated location and some power hungry tyrant, in this case, some foggy billionaire who is most probably going to die before he can even spend a tenth of his wealth wants whatever this anomaly can offer him. <br/><br/>Well needless to say, we've got the usual 'recruiting' scenes that are all too predominant in movies these days and a group of misinformed sheeps who are gathered together for the glory of dying in front of millions of audience worldwide on the widescreen. Then we'll have the protagonist, who is invincible and will never luck out, and somehow always managing to find either true love or great wealth at the end of the show. (Oh, in this movie's case, there's actually a twist there! I smile with glee)<br/><br/>That apart does not make things go wrong. What happens next is something you will never expect, but not in the good sense. No, far from this, it makes your mouth turn sour and go 'How could low can a show go?'.

First, why oh why do screenplay writers and directors continue to bore the crowd with do and done cinematics. It may have been original when Trinity did her infamous yoga floating technique but we didn't watch the Matrix to see cheap camera tricks. Unfortunately, this is what this movie, and not surprisingly Resident Evil 2 (check out who wrote the show... bling bling!) assumes a good movie is all about. I can almost imagine the process of creating the script. Note names are purely fictitious and any resemblance is entirely coincidental:<br/><br/>Paul: Hmm, let's see. I will have the girl charge into the hall with a motorcycle, ram it into the alien and blow them both up with a lead shotgun.<br/><br/>*pauses*<br/><br/>Paul: Oh that will be so cool!!!!!!!1112<br/><br/>*shudders in excitement*<br/><br/>Paul: but wait..how do I add a bike into the story<br/><br/>*pauses* <br/><br/>Paul: Nevermind, I'll just save that for this instead<br/><br/>*scribbles onto page of Resident Evil 2 script beside*<br/><br/>Paul: Oh so cool!<br/><br/>*shudders*<br/><br/>And then when we think about what conspired within the scriptwriter's mind as he thought about the movie's content:<br/><br/>Paul: I'll get everyone to this recluse outpost and..and wow!

The movie did give a sense of claustrophobia to me but only for 5 minutes and the rest of it was to cover up any good decent action. i can't blame Paul W.S. Anderson for trying but i do blame the people who accepted his script. The predator vision in this movie is a enhancement but you only saw what the predator wanted to see apart from that it looks pretty good. The cast was alright even though the main characters are new to Hollywood but i did like the killing of Charles Bishop Weyland even though it could of been more inventive. The plot was alright to my taste but it did lack a certain finesse but it was still alright and the little creature that bursts out of the predator means that ANOTHER movie is coming which might be boring. Apart from the flaws in this movie, it's alright to watch but just for hard core fans will enjoy it and I'm not a hard core fan but i still enjoyed it to a degree.

It came from a dog, had the dog's coloration, acted like a rabid as hell dog, crawled around like a dog, do you get my point, yet? If not, go play the AVP game on the PC (The first AVP) they had Pred-Aliens. Lots of fanfic books had Pred-Aliens, these people picked up that the Alien takes on properties of it's host.

","While I enjoyed the movie for what it was I think they could have done a much better job on it. I've read the Alien vs Predator books and it was very clear that they pulled some of the story out of the first (and in my opinion the best) of the books. I think that they should have just stuck with remaking the book into a movie because the characters were awesome and the storyline rocked. The movie had some weak moments and the characters were quite shallow. The predators should have been kicking more butt as they do in the book seeing as they're experienced hunters. If they'd stuck with the book the ending would have been so much better and more meaningful when the surviving predator blooded the woman. Otherwise the special effects were neat, as always I love the alien designs. It was okay but could have been so much better."

","~Spoiler~<br/><br/>Where's the rest of the line? Oh, I forgot the movie was rated PG-13. You weren't aiming to please, were you guys? Well, let's have a little backstory on the film's director: Paul WS Anderson. He upset a lot fans with his film version of Mortal Kombat but I didn't care because I didn't like Mortal Kombat. He upset a lot of fans with his film version of Resident Evil but I didn't care because I will take a theatrical zombie film any way I can get it. But, it would seem my time has come. It was time for Paul WS Anderson to upset me by screwing up classic science-fiction icons that I have grown up with. Let's start with the characters, what characters? This movie had NO character development whatsoever. What's so great about the Alien and Predator series' were that we always had characters that we cared about; Dutch and his commandos, Ripley and her crew, Hicks and his space marines. I had little to no interest in any character in ""AVP."" The only plus was the appearance by Lance Henriksen, and he was barely in the movie. The pen trick he did was a nice touch, but hardly makes me forgive anything else. Next we have the setting: the Arctic. Apparently it's not as cold as I was led to believe in the arctic. People are just walking around nonchalantly for long periods at a time (some without coats) and I don't even think you could see their breath. Way to go. Now, and this is the biggest no-no, the mythology. They messed with the mythology. The aliens gestate in mere minutes it would now seem whereas it used to take hours. Also, the aliens grow to full size in a matter of minutes now. Yay. And they made the Predators seem very weak to me. I was waiting for Busta Rhymes to jump out and start whipping them just like he did Michael Myers in Halloween Resurrection. Now let's examine that atrocious final shot, you know, the one with the ""predalien."" How could it be half predator and half alien? We've seen the alien gestate in humans, we've even seen it gestate in dogs, and it never burst out with a nose or whiskers or any other attribute that didn't belong to it. So why now? On that note I will stop (although I could go on). This is the worst theatrical horror or sci-fi film I've seen since Dreamcatcher. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Oh, the wasted potential!"

","The Alien series had a nice symbolic resonance of Joseph Conrad's work, hence the Nostromo and Sulaco references, in which you understand that the Alien is not evil, the Company is the evil and driving force while Ripley is an apostle against the Dragon, as it was referred in the underrated third film. I disliked Resurrection, but it had it's moments, courtesy of resurrected Ripley.<br/><br/>Predator movies don't have that symbolical charge, but they where good in narrating a entertaining suspense/action flick, specially the first one.

There's no denying he'd make a heck of a producer - none of the old farts in Hollywood would have never in a million years come up with the idea to make movies like ""Resident evil"" or ""Alien versus Predator"", even when they've been hanging in front of everyone's faces from day one! Paul also seems to have an idea or two when it comes to writing scripts, but unfortunately, that's it. Dear God keep this man 50, no make that a hundred, yards from a movie camera! I so much wanted to like AvP, but what can you do? Except admit the sad fact that Anderson fumbled the ball again. There's no excuse for the crap that's tarnishing the celluloid. A few amusing minutes on a movie don't make up for the rest 86 minutes of sheer pain. The fact that the original version was mutilated to a PG-13-edit is the least of the problems here. Who the hell wants to see big-budget ""horror"" - movies with actors that can't act, stupid dialogue, plot holes/illogical turns and Z-grade directing anyway? I thought they stopped making movies this poorly something like 20 years ago. Or at least they should have stopped! Jason vs Freddy was actually scarier (not to mention WAY much better), and it was a parody for crying out loud! All that's missing from AvP is 'the annoying 12-year-old who's also the comic relief'.

","As an action movie, this film isn't bad. Sure, it may not have that much character development, but that is hardly an unforgivable problem when the main point is to see a bunch of humans, Predators, and Aliens battling it out. This movie delivers no shortage of good fight scenes, explosions, and all the good stuff an action movie needs. They did a good job of explaining just why the Aliens and Predators were slugging it out, too. And it had several amusing references to the originals.<br/><br/>The movie does suffer from two things, though. The first is that I believe Hollywood needs to be banned from writing any more scripts where the major plot points are pyramids and space aliens. Sorry, but that one's overused and often doesn't even work. Just for once I'd like to see space aliens building the Great Wall of China instead.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about the movie is that it is an average action movie following after several great ones. The originals often displayed a mastery of suspense, where directors realized that you could generate more terror with a dozen blue dots closing in on a scanning screen than with a dozen monsters you can see. This one is just your basic fight after fight slugfest, with less ability to build tensions. It doesn't offer any really memorable visual effects such as Ripley driving the loader.<br/><br/>AVP is not a bad movie for an evening of mindless entertainment, but it isn't in the same league as the movies that inspired it."

We watch the grotesque creatures collide in an all-out war wherein one species will be terminated... It's mindless, savage action laden with disgusting gore and grotesque violence, nothing more and nothing less. I really didn't care which species prevailed in this ""war of supremity"", yet I enjoyed the action, and yes, the silliness of it all.

","Spoilers<br/><br/>This is a nicely done movie, in a number of ways. The length of about 100 minutes is just right, allowing enough time to build towards the climax and stopping before the whole thing becomes a bore. I also like the 'clean' element in that unlike most of the adventure flicks, there's no villain, no treachery in the exploration party. Blood and gore is reduced to a minimum as the whole thing looks like an exciting video game, from which the movie is actually derived. There are a couple of good and well-timed laughs which are, wisely, not overdone as to become tedious. Best of all is the art direction and action sequences.<br/><br/>Unavoidably, there are things that are borrowed from other movies. The workings of the moving parts of the pyramid looks suspiciously familiar, if you have seen the Canadian indie 'Cube'. The Predators' gigantic spacecraft look unabashedly like the one in 'Close Encounter of the Third Kind.' We (humans, that is) are finally taking sides, and it is not surprising that the humanoid-form Predators become our allies. <br/><br/>All in all, good no-brainer entertainment.

Only the third predator manages to not get impaled on an alien tail immediately, but he then proceeds to team up with one of the humans, which any true predator fan would find sacrilegious even. <br/><br/>Fans of ""Aliens"" will be disappointed too with the lack of weaponry exhibited by the human exploration team.

The good bits... well its Aliens V Predators isn't it, how cool is that! Seeing them battle on screen is fantastic and the action sequences are superb with terrific set design and special effects. The bad bits.... I feel they rushed into the battle a little quickly and apart from the main female actress I cared very little for the humans. Also was Ewen Bremner who was great in Trainspotting deliberately acting that bad?, the Italian actor and the lead female actress were thankfully very good though. Lance Henrikson was great and with him being in the movie it tied up all the movies very nicely, lots of little in jokes for fans of the Alien movies to enjoy spotting. The biggest problem with this movie is the fact that its not an 18 certificate so the director couldn't up the gore level and make the film more frightening and nasty, which an Alien and Predator movie should be, this is just the movie company wanted to get the kids in the cinema so the film can make more money. If they release an uncut version on DVD I would certainly buy it, though why I should have to wait for it is slightly annoying. Also the movie is very dark so sometimes its a little hard to see whats going on, which certainly wasn't a problem in Predator for instance which was set in the Jungle. The movie is well directed by British director Paul WS Anderson who made the great Event Horizon and the absolutely terrible Resident Evil. AVP is a much better movie than Resident Evil thankfully and if you go into the cinema wanting a fun movie you won't be disappointed, but you will be if you expect it to be as good as Alien, Aliens or Predator.

And admittedly, I found some parts in here that I liked....<br/><br/>But you can already sense the ""but"" I'm about to interject, can't you?<br/><br/>There were some gaping issues with this film, starting with the characters: You knew almost nothing about them, and what's worse, cared even less. Take ""Aliens"" for example. Every Space Marine, no matter how early in the film they died, you knew something about them. You knew about their motivations or relationships with the others, or even how they handled crisis situations. With the introduction of the ""best of the best"" hand-picked ""Jurassic Park""-esquire team of scientists, you don't even get that luxury, even with the drawn-out meeting and trip to the dig site. A few nice ""Bishop"" references, but that's about all the viewer gets for things to come in the series. There was one female character who talks about ""always being prepared"" as she brings her gun along, but with that hint of foreshadowing, you think she'd play a pivotal role in the film. Think again.<br/><br/>And then the frustration with actual meeting of the Aliens. What did they do to the incubation period? I've seen bags of Jiffy Pop that don't complete as fast as the chestbursters in this film. What was an hours/day long process in the previous films was instigated and completed even before the researchers had time to leave the first room. After the long character set-up that established absolutely nothing, I can understand wanting to get the plot rolling, but you can't cheat the established ""rules"" of the characters to get there. But Anderson did anyway.<br/><br/>I had issues with the Predators, save for one hardier survivor. So much for the ""great warriors"" that they've always been known as. The fight scenes (which should have been the whole meat of this film), were reduced to little more than spastic jump cuts that obscured the majority of the action.<br/><br/>People have been waiting YEARS to see this, from all the video game and comic book stories, and it's reduced to a PG-13 slugfest that doesn't show the intensity and no-holds barred attitude that should have been there. Both ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" are R-rated franchises. They should have stayed that way for a reason. The main heroine was certainly no Ripley, which makes one wonder how she was able to survive through the continued challenges in the film. And lets not forget another ""Jurassic Park"" fight moment between the survivors and the Alien Queen. Anderson must love the JP films, because so many references were lifted from the first film.<br/><br/>It's not that I hated this movie, it's just that after waiting for so many years, it wasn't what it should have been. They cheated established character rules. They gave characters you couldn't care less about. It took too long to get to the title grudge match, and even when it did, poor editing destroyed any intensity it could have had. And the ""surprise ending"" is what should have been done a few minutes before the ending, so that there would have been more to play with in the film. I wanted to see THAT as the ending conflict. Not a Jurassic Park tribute with the Alien Queen. They had so much to work with, and they didn't.<br/><br/>The only positive aspect of the film were a few ""Bishop"" references, and a few cool moves during some of the conflicts.<br/><br/>I wanted more. I got a little. Hopefully they'll do it better next time, or release a ""Director's Cut"" on DVD to actually make the fights worthwhile."

","I'm not as familiar with the franchises as some other reviewers, so the complaints about consistency didn't bother me too much. Thanks maybe to my ignorance, I enjoyed the film. The action was fun. The CGI was pretty good. The story was familiar, but let's face it, all the story has to do is provide an excuse for the action, and this premise, though dull and derivative, fits the bill.<br/><br/>My problem with the film is that every time a human opened his/her mouth, complete and utter dreck poured forth. <br/><br/>For instance? The team's archaeologist(!) speculates that a prehistoric (never mind pre-Christian) civilization used the Gregorian calendar. Fortunately for the team, apparently it did.<br/><br/>For instance? The team discovers an inscription that gives a thumbnail history of this ancient civilization. The inscription also describes the civilization's downfall, which almost certainly happened sometime after the inscription was created.<br/><br/>But the nadir of the dialogue, the execrable line I can't get out of my head, was the archaeologist's hypothesis: ""The Aztec calendar was metric, based on multiples of ten. So I'm guessing that the pyramid changes every ten minutes."" <br/><br/>Now let's pretend for a moment that ""metric"" means ""based on multiples of ten"" (it doesn't); and let's pretend for a moment that the Aztec calendar was ""decimal,"" which is the word Anderson was looking for (it wasn't); and let's pretend for a moment that Aztec calendrics and Aztec horology were somehow entwined (I can't think of a reason to suppose that they were); why would the Aztecs use sexagesimal units like ""minutes""? <br/><br/>Nonsensical as the hypothesis is, it is also correct, which tells you everything you need to know about the amount of thought that went into this script.

","So many plot holes. Where to start?<br/><br/>I knew that the predator that escaped with Alex had an alien embryo inside of him because he was attacked in the pyramid without his helmet on. But why would a warrior take off his helmet in a place crawling with ""facehuggers"" and full grown aliens? Removing his helmet made him vulnerable to physical attack and deprived him of his advanced visual sensor devices. If he wanted to take off his helmet so that he could mark himself with the alien's blood, he could have done so after his trials were over. I thought that the alien inside the predator was going to burst out after they got to safety, scamper off to grow up by using the dead survey team members for food, and then come back and stalk Alex. This would have made more sense than the alien queen surviving the explosion and then digging through hundreds of feet of solid rock and ice. A final one-on-one showdown between Alex and the alien would have been a nice parallel between the original alien/Ripley conflict.<br/><br/>By the way, how did the alien queen dig through all that ice? In this movie we saw that the queen was kept in deep freeze. In Alien Resurrection we learned that aliens don't like extreme cold. I'm sure the predators put the pyramid under ice to prevent any aliens from escaping. You could argue that the intense heat from the bomb heated up the area long enough for the queen to escape. However, that intense heat should have also fried the queen to a crunchy crisp.<br/><br/>Why were the predators always being surprised by the aliens? Their visual sensors seemingly gave them the ability to see through (solid rock) walls.<br/><br/>The last scene on the predator ship with the predalien bursting through the dead alien didn't make sense. A highly advanced, space-traveling species like the predators would certainly have quarantined and scanned their fallen warrior for any alien embryo implantation. I know they wanted to set things up for a sequel. They could have done better by giving us a suspenseful battle on the surface and then leaving us guessing as to whether Alex had an embryo inside her.<br/><br/>Of course, I realize this film is intended for a younger audience than the original films, but I think they could have entertained the teenagers without insulting the intelligence of the adults."

","Right. i just want to make this clear. I am a huge Aliens and Predator fan. Ever since I saw the Alien skull in the trophy room in predator 2 back in 1990 I have waited eagerly for the Aliens vs Predator film. now it is here. And, although i enjoyed it, I couldn't help feel disappointed.<br/><br/>When i first heard it was going to be made i was like ""YES!"" I was like a child being told he was about to spend a year at Disneyland. Then that dream was shattered when I heard who was writing AND directing. Now, Paul Anderson, in all honesty is not my fave person. He ruined Resident Evil in my view. Sorry, but he did. So i was very skeptical that he could pull this off. <br/><br/>I saw the trailer and thought, well yeah maybe this could work. then I saw the film. Now, there were some brilliant parts in it. Some real great parts where i was jumping out of my seat going ""YES!"" But, when the end came round i was left feeling hugely disappointed. It was over too soon. There could have been so much more to this film.<br/><br/>Before it came out I was told there was going to be a scene where the predators lock a teenage predator in a room with a dozen or so Aliens and it must kill them all to be 'accepted'. That really got my juices flowing, but the scene was no where to be found. Whether or not it was going to be in there in the first place I don't know. <br/><br/>I won't go into too much detail, but the final scene in the film didn't disappoint. I was waiting for it the whole way through and it has left it open for a (Hopefully) better sequel.<br/><br/>Overall i would give it 3/5. which is a good solid score, but for me this film deserved to be so much more."

","WARNING! DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS! Oh dear! for a movie that lived in limbo hell and went through so many scripts and directors this really didn't manage to hit the spot. The director clearly didn't understand the Predator mindset, did he? Had he seen predator 1 & 2 or played Aliens Versus Predator 1 or 2? I think not in all cases. Predators are about hunting for honour. When the chap @ the bottom of the shaft whose freezing to death is casually killed, where's the glory or honour in that kill? There is none!<br/><br/>Does the director understand Predator technology, again that's a no. The Predators view humans on heat vision yet they see the shoulder cannons? WHY? These are technology and would be seen on electric view or normal view only, idiot! The director might have known that if he'd played the game. Also, how destruction proof is that Pyramid? If it was blown up by 100 years before by a predator nuke, how is it so intact? Are the film characters totally insane? Millar must be. He kills a facehugger with 1 bullet then wastes 5 more making sure. Why does the main girl pull herself onto a ledge where an alien just was, even if she is hanging over a chasm? From certain death into certain death? Why when the 1st alien is speared by the girl does it not attack with it's arms at all? Why when the predator cuts the aliens head off his knife doesn't melt? Likewise with blades of spinner on facehugger? How come Millar seems to lose his Scottish accent just before he dies? The Queen is bitten multiple times but is fit to go on a rampage? HOW THE HELL does the Queen escape the bomb at all? Why are there so many Aliens? Only 8 people are facehugged! When the bomb is detonated how come there seem to be about 20 aliens in the main chamber as they board the sled? Clearly this film was not researched at all. Aliens and Predator fans will be picking holes in it for years to come. As for the pred-alien at the end? We'll be lucky to see a sequel I think, seeing as how long it took to get this movie on the screen. In the end, the jury is out, everyone must judge the film for themselves. I'm not happy, but it wasn't bloody awful. Just slightly crap."

Andersen was spending too much time doing this movie and the new Resident Evil, which is coming out soon. Advise: if you are doing an AvP movie, don't work on something else while your making it! To sum this movie up quickly through Andersen's talentless head ""let's try and get as much cool stuff in one movie as we can and who cares if it makes any sense because a bunch of teenagers are going to go see it"" I find myself the kind of person that would never get up and leave a movie theater even if the movie is really stupid...the scene where the predator teams up w/the lead actress to kill the aliens and escape...almost made me leave for the first time. I honestly yelled ""this is gay"" and half the audience clapped and agreed as if everyone ""really really"" wanted to say if first. That made me feel better for a little while, at least I knew I wasn't the only one suffering, watching two of the best sci-fi franchises get massacred.<br/><br/>Even the people that were there enjoying the movie just because it had Aliens and Predators must have realized at that point we were watching a kiddie movie. Wait and the scene at the end when the girl takes off the Predator's helmet...LOL wow, I thought they were going to kiss. Wait, then the Predator screams at her, LOL what a joke, what this to show off the special effects of the face? Okay...maybe the special effects could save this movie? hmmmm, not really. For a movie made almost 20 years after the first predator and Aliens, there wasn't much improved. The predators in the first and second movie actually look better than in this one. What about the music? Both franchises had great music distinct for both movies...I didn't hear anything similar or as good AT ALL! Watch the ending of Predator 2, then remember the end of this one...What's up w/the peaceful music? What's so peaceful about anything about either of these franchises? As others have already stated there, there are so many things wrong and awful in this movie, it would take longer to explain than the length of the movie itself. <br/><br/> From the chest bursters time frame, to the queen sh**ing out thousands of eggs in what 10 minutes?

If this thing grows up and acquires an invisibility cloak it will be the end of the Predator mothership.<br/><br/>The face huggers also acted a lot quicker than in the original Alien movies, I think John Hurt took a few days to explode, in this show it happened in 10 minutes and they reached adulthood 10 minutes later.<br/><br/>Other postings have mentioned the obvious freezing of the queen, after all we know that is how aliens are subdued.<br/><br/>The poor alien is the ultimate killing machine but is always the hunted it never seems to go looking for trouble. I find it hard to see how a creature so dedicated to killing could have developed any society/intelligence.<br/><br/>As for the Predators, well without their gadgets they would be weak as p*ss.<br/><br/>I reckon I could have come up with a much better premise than this one.<br/><br/>The sequel which will be the Alienator cutting sick on the Predator mothership will be void of much dialogue....<br/><br/>rating 5/10"

","All I have to say about this is WTF?! This movie was horrible, almost unwatchable. I went into this expecting a good Sci-Fi/action movie based on two of my favorite series from the genre, and what do I get? A completely illogical turd.<br/><br/>First of all, the predator species are supposed to be the greatest hunters in the galaxy, yet two out of three buy the farm in the first twenty minutes, and from the same WOUNDED alien. The aliens are nothing but dumb animals, and the predators are a technologically advanced race of warriors, so it should have been no problem for them to dispatch the bugs.<br/><br/>Look at the previous movies, in the aliens series, (especially ""aliens 2"") A squad of space marines, low on ammo and cut down to half their starting numbers, blow away at least four dozen bugs, and in predator, one, and only one, hunter took out a whole squad of soldiers, armed to the teeth. <br/><br/>So doesn't it stand to reason, that if we can kick the aliens ass, and the predators can kick our ass, that the predators can kick the aliens ass?<br/><br/>And what's with the last predator at the end of the movie getting all buddy-buddy with the chick? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. I could understand if he just let her live, seeing as how she gave him back the gun (that the humans took, I might add) and killed the one alien, but he definitely should have offed her for getting lippy with him. But does he do what is expected of him? NO! Instead, he not only lets her live, he actually makes weapons and armor for her, out of the alien she killed, and then treating her like a member of his race.<br/><br/>That's another thing I don't understand, the blood of the aliens is acidic, so shouldn't her hand have burned off as soon as she put it inside the creatures head?<br/><br/>then, after the kill the queen, TOGETHER, (lame ass idea), and the mother ship comes down, one of the predator ""elders""(I guess) sees the ""Mark of the hunter"" on the chicks face, and gives her a souvenir. This scene I actually liked, the first time I saw it in ""Predator 2"".<br/><br/>And the ""awesome twist ending"" that was lame. That sort of cheap gimmick should be reserved for slasher movies. ""Wow, it's finally over, WOOPS! A big shocking twist ending, that conveniently leaves an opening for a sequel.""<br/><br/>Real original.<br/><br/>All in all, a total piece of crap, in fact, it's not even worthy of being called crap, it's the stuff crap calls crap, it's AvP."

","The idea here is simple and sexy enough to please the fans, I think. Take monsters from two different movie franchises and set them in the frame of another movie franchise (Stargate), use the Stargate to flesh out and give background context to the origins of Alien and Predator. The action and setting seem like the pitch for a video game, which works better than the story (Stargate was pretty lousy too) - if they were going to give background to these things, though, I wish they would have used something truly 'alien' like the egg-ship from the first Alien movie, rather than 'alienating' domestic (Earthy) stuff like pyramids and Aztec mythology.

"Antagonisten","Null","0","0","3 September 2004"," Not as bad as i feared, but not good
","I´m sure that director Paul W.S. Anderson does whatever he can with his films. He seems like a nice enough guy, and very enthusiastic about each project. But he has yet to make a single movie i found enjoyable and this is yet another good idea wasted.<br/><br/>While it can be argued that part of the problems with this film is not Paul W.S. Anderson (a PG-13 rating, substandard acting) he has still made yet another bland and unexciting actionfilm. I love the first two Alien-films, as well as the first Predator-film. And to mix these two is one of the first truly exciting ideas i´ve heard when it comes to mixing franchises. It´s sad to see though that all the good vibrations from both series of films are wasted here.<br/><br/>So, what´s wrong with this film? Well it´s not cheap-looking and boring (like Resident Evil) nor is it a total catastrophe in every way (like Mortal Kombat). It´s just... bland. The action scenes are few. And the pacing is slow, especially in the beginning of the film. When the action scenes DO happen they don´t look too bad although the lack of gore effects is obvious. But i feel that the gore is not the main thing missing, the film would have benefited much more from better editing and more frequent, and longer lasting, action scenes. What made ""Aliens"" so great? Was it the gore? No, it was the way the action-scenes just throbbed with energy. An energy severely lacking here.<br/><br/>Probably this will spell the end for both the Alien and Predator franchises (or at least for any future films mixing them) which is sad because they deserve better. With a proper director, and a rating adjusted to the kind of film this SHOULD be, this could have been the action-film of the year. Now, it´s just sad.<br/><br/>I give this 4/10."

Don't expect to go and see a dramatic tear jerker or Oscar level character development, but on the other hand it does tell you everything you need to know for the movie and still leaves time for some tension building and great fight scenes. It even tells you exactly why they can figure out the writings so quickly! After all, who wants a great action movie with a lot of wasted time on finding out which one of the characters cry in bed, or eats wheaties, etc., etc. Action movies have a plot line to cover the necessary, lots of shooting, explosions, and some bad boys to duke it out period. If you don't like sci-fi, action, crossovers and thrills, or if you want a tear jerker, Driving miss daisy waste of time then this movie isn't for you.

If i consider purely of these Alien and Predator movies, the all other movies than AVP has more believable science fiction elements that are all other than action related,and this one has too much pointless action, and that is just like i mentioned because of director. <br/><br/>I have seen it already in earlier Anderson's movies, directors make of course their own look a like movies . But in case of these 2 scifi movie monsters and Anderson they come along like red stain in white car. That makes this movie to be allround worse than all its predecessors . I cannot understand why they didn't find better director for it.<br/><br/>The second serious problem is that this should have been much longer. Many things don't make sense if you stuck much action , almost nothing more and thats it. This shows that joining of two movie groups is not so good result it can be, not even near. Storyline of predecessor movies is already so huge. There is wery much background that have not noticed. The whole story would been better against action. Now its like pancake.<br/><br/>In good side is effects. Though, these develop all the time. It was not surprise as there were skilled persons, making the effects , witch have been much in all movies making these monsters to work.<br/><br/>Like i stated in start , this movie is moderate.

Are you really trying to tell us that there were already aliens on Earth, and that predators were a major driving force for human civilization? And yet we had to travel into deep space to finally meet aliens? Mmm... unintentional irony.<br/><br/>2. Should a hieroglyphics expert, no matter how mysterious his accent, be able to decipher a convoluted alien ritual (written on a ceiling the size of the Sistene) faster that a Reader's Digest crossword? And without any reference of any kind? Even Indiana Jones needed his notebook.<br/><br/>3.Did you know that an Alien (warrior or Queen) would not attack a host carrying a live offspring, even to its own peril? That's because the offspring would die (hint: that's what the cocoons are for). So the Predator would not have been killed by the queen, nor had a live chestburster pop out at the end, once he was already dead.<br/><br/>4. Did you think we might not need to see this hapless bunch of goofs figure out step by step how the aliens work (when we in the audience have known for nearly 30 years), none of whom had any interesting talents that would plausibly lend to good action scenes. They didn't even appear to need the woman's mountaineering skills since it turned out, the Ps had conveniently shot a nice tunnel for them to slide down. What were all those characters there for, aside from being guinea pigs to show the audience (again) how the aliens infest, and the predators hunt?<br/><br/>5. Shouldn't the alien and the human lady have run away from the explosion holding hands?<br/><br/>6. Wouldn't holding a scooped-out alien head as a shield sort of... burn? And how could a small human lady (fit tho she may be) kill an alien in hand-to-hand? It ain't right.<br/><br/>7. Would Predators leave their only guns buried away for thousands of years?<br/><br/>That's a long time to be without your piece.<br/><br/>8. Weren't all those stone carvings of the As and Ps a little too obvious? I would have freaked out a bit when I saw them, nobody in the film did.<br/><br/>9. Why would Aztecs, Egyptians, and Cambodians have all decided to hang out and build pyramids in Antarctica? Wouldn't any of them have wanted to do this a little closer to home?<br/><br/>10.

","Everyone who is into this type of film knows what it's about, so I won't bother setting up the plot.

If you're into the individual 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises, then you'll enjoy watching these two species duke it out to the end. I was pleased and surprised (especially the ending, it still works).<br/><br/>20th Century Fox better watch their next step (sequel), since, to anyone who's seen this 2004 movie, there will probably a rematch (and I'm not really giving anything away by writing this). <br/><br/>One thing kind of bothers me though: There is a scene in AVP where a 'Predator' monster comes across an ailing, intended human victim who has just fallen down the 2,000-foot-long shaft and is entirely covered in ice/snow. If 'Predators' only have 'thermal vision,wouldn't it have bypassed that man and continued searching for its quarry elsewhere?(like the 'Predator' that bypassed Arnold Schwarzenegger when he smeared cold mud on himself to elude visual-detection)<br/><br/>Still, AVP rocks!"

I understand why it was necessary in old movies, the effect quality was so weak, that there was no other way how to hide the glitches. But today is 21st century. Even low budged movies have better graphics. Predators looked like jamaicans with masks. Looks like the graphic effects team was very much ""inspired"" by Chewbacca from the Star Wars. Aliens looked the same way they looked in the first Alien movie. Only the plot was quite OK, though none of the ""specialists"" acted as a professional would. No archaeologist would run around pushing and opening everything he finds. And so on. CONCLUSION Better watch the first three parts of Alien and both Predators, but don't waste your time on this one.

","Where do I begin? I think that Alien vs Predator may have been the worst movie I've seen in a really long time. Oh my goodness. We were cracking up the entire movie because we just couldn't take it seriously. First of all, its like they took a bunch of good movies and took scenes from them and just spliced them into a movie. I saw Armageddon during the first 30 minutes. Hmmm... they need to create a secretive team to dig a big hole. They even have the goofy Steve Buscemi type character that you know is going to only cause havock. Then the rest of the movie was scene after scene of our dramatized moments. Bad acting. And just plain old DUMB plot. Don't get me wrong, the special effects were nifty. Thats about it though.<br/><br/>The most ridiculous part of the movie was the humans siding with either the Alien or the Predators. I know I'm probably going to ruin an ending for you folks that still plan to see this piece of crapola, but the woman convinces a predator to join forces with her and there are some really sappy moments where the predator takes off his mask, reveals his bizarre face and looks longingly into the woman eyes. All I can say is thank goodness they didn't start making out!<br/><br/>If you are an Aliens fan or a Predator fan, do not, I repeat do NOT expect this movie to have ANYTHING to do with the original movies. They are loosely based of the originals and pull from the basic parts of them. Think of it as a ""What If they Got Together"" movie. Actually, don't think, it will only make the movie more confusing and stupid. I'm not even going to talk about who all was in the movie because I don't want them to be remembered for such an awful collaboration. Lets not embarrass them shall we? I hate to bash a movie so. I know people put a lot of time an effort into the movie, but if I can convince even one person to not waste their money, its enough for me.

","***Spoilers Ahead, Watch Where You Step***<br/><br/>I did not particularly want to see this movie, but I went with my friend, who was born with a tragic genetic defect that makes him like stuff like this. However, our opinions on this movie were pretty much the same: it's actually quite entertaining at first (you gotta love those awesome steel weapons the Predators use), but the last third of the movie gets unbelievably goofy. I mean, the last thing you expect in a monster movie is for the lead human character to befriend the monster. But she does, and at that point it almost turns into a buddy movie. In fact, the human is almost tougher than the actual Predator! She was outrunning him there at the end! What's that about!?<br/><br/>Another nitpick I have with this movie is that it's taking place in Antarctica--aka THE ARCTIC--and everyone is dressed like it's late August in Duluth. The ending of the movie finds the heroine standing there alone in the middle of the tundra without a coat or hat. Did anyone consider that after her adrenaline rush goes away, she'll probably freeze to death? Oh well. Movies like this don't tend to make a lot of sense, so why bother complaining about logic.

"K21Nova","8","0","0","25 August 2004"," Some Non-overanalyzed Opinions
","There are some spoilers ahead, but not as much as the whole plot.<br/><br/>First of all, the comments here seem to have come from people who have really gone far in overanalyzing the film. It would seem that the content as far as the Alien/Predator lores go is more important to people than the movie itself. I thought I'd give commenting on this movie a shot as well.<br/><br/>The basic idea of the film, that it takes place on Earth has always been a good one, as far as aliens are concerned, so no wonder Fox went for it. Now that we got that, I would've liked to see more of Earth than what the film showed us.<br/><br/>I'm sure people expected to experience the same horror and excitement that Alien gave us, or even Aliens, like we did with Alien Resurrection and Alien 3. Both of which seemed to be a bit of a disappointment to the public. This isn't a true alien movie though, since it basically is a crossover.<br/><br/>Visually I found the movie very pleasing, with more than adequate CGI and special effects, and a nice mood. The dialog could truly have been better, and the movie could have done without the one-liners. There's especially one that irritated me a lot, but I guess you'll see it when you see the movie. The dialog seemed to be a bit forced and dull at times.<br/><br/>The action scenes were just a bit of a blur every now and then, but all in all kept me at the edge of my seat. The acting sadly won't bring the film any Oscars.<br/><br/>The film may have had a bit too much of the alien/predator lore here and there, but I guess this was a movie for the fans of those franchises, and with the rating being so low, I'm betting the movie was meant in parts for the kids who liked the games (AvP, AvP2). Sure, there were things that didn't seem quite right, things wrong with the lore, with what we know, but being that this is an imaginary tale of imaginary beings, I'm sure someone can imagine a reason for everything that happened.<br/><br/>The film didn't really get boring at any point, so the plot progressed very smoothly, which I liked a lot. It had a couple of scares and for a good part of it I really was on the edge of my seat, waiting to see more.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think this was the fifth alien movie, but I do consider it to be the third predator movie. If you think about it, that's actually what it was. It more or less delved into the world of the predator, instead of looking at things from the perspective of the human, scared s-less of the alien.<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of negative about this movie, but I think most of it was expectations. People really should get it through their skulls that nobody is going to make an alien movie that'll ever satisfy the audience. Don't expect it to be great, because it most likely won't be.<br/><br/>And is there going to be another Alien vs Predator movie? Well, just look at the ending.<br/><br/>Personally, I just wish Renny Harlin WOULD make the movie about the alien planet, as he was about to when he was asked to make Alien 3. He is after all Finnish. Go Finns! :)"

"miketoth1001","Null","0","0","25 August 2004"," So much to do... So little time!
","OK. I've read the reviews after seeing the film. And, here's my take. Beware... There may be spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>1) Why didn't the Predator kill the girl? OK. That's an easy one, if you've read any of the history of the race, in the comics, books and games. They have a code of honor. Part of that is in NOT hunting sentient beings. That's not an honorable thing. Nevertheless, there are ones called ""Bad Bloods"" that do hunt humans. They might have been in the first two Predator movies. The first one was definitely a ""Bad Blood"". These hunters were being ""Blooded"", so they were to fight honorably. But, that doesn't mean that if you picked up a gun or weapon you're not going to become a target. Look at Weyland. The Predator saw he was diseased, and was going to leave him to die on his own. But, here's the ""Don't turn your back to me"" bit of bravado, and then he looks surprised when he got the wrist blades where his innards should have been. Get a weapon, become a target.<br/><br/>2) Why were there so many Aliens? If you counted all the people that went down the shaft, you know there couldn't be more than 15, but at one point there seems to be many more than that. I think it was mostly a trick of the eye. At the end, when the Predator took out all those Aliens with his gun, the remaining ones went to the queen. There were only 4 or 5. The Predator had already taken out a large majority with his Plasma gun. (9, I think) However, we're shown that there are still a lot of them when the Predator and girl are trying to make it back to the surface. There must be more than 15 in that scene, alone. The numbers really don't add up right. It seemed to me that the Director said to the CG guys, ""Make me a LOT of aliens"".<br/><br/>3) Why were the two Predators killed so quickly? Well, we have to understand something. This was a hunt for three Predators who weren't ""Blooded"". That means that they had undergone the training, maybe hunted some lower life forms, but nothing big. This was their real test. Think of this like people going through military boot camp. They have the training. They've shot up hundreds of paper targets. However, for all purposes, no real tests. Therefore, they're dropped into a battle and whoever gets out alive, with trophies is now tested in battle. There's, normally, one of the Predators that's the leader of this three Predator group. He has more training, and you might think of him as a squad leader. (Some on here have nicknamed him ""Scar"".) His job is to get the others to the battle and back ""safely"". I put that in quotes as if they really don't have the ""right stuff"", then they can become so much alien food. It's the ""rite of passage"". He shouldn't have left his mask off for so long, though.<br/><br/>4) What about the Plasma guns? They were supposed to be found by the Predators BEFORE the humans became hosts of the Alien spawn. The Predators were supposed to ALREADY have the upper hand. But, those pesky humans had to pick them up and start the whole cycle before they had them. Dang, annoying humans. Stepping on the floor plate was no big deal. It just meant that the eggs would be ready, sooner. They already had an idea on how the pyramid would re-configure itself. They really were the prison guards.<br/><br/>5) What's with the masks being different? Well, there's only one Predator race, but thousands of ""clans"". Think of them like humans, without the infighting and wars. They adorn themselves differently, and even have different ""codes of honor"". So, different masks aren't really a surprise. Hair braided differently, etc. Look at it like Japanese schoolgirls in their uniforms. They might look the same, but there's differences that if you're attuned to it you can tell what school someone attends just from seeing the uniform. Same with the different militaries of the world. And, why were the mouths different? Well, humans all, unless there's some birth defect or accident, have 2 arms, 2 legs, 2 eyes, etc. But we have white, brown, yellow, red or black skin. Our teeth might not be picture perfect. We might be bald, balding or have 90% of our bodies covered with hair. We might have a Jay Leno like chin, or no chin. Therefore, what happens if you're in a clan of 5 thousand Predators. No reproducing outside of the clan and it's been that way for thousands of years? The gene pool becomes stagnant. Things happen. It might even be made that way so you can tell one Predator clan from another. It's not that far from the truth.<br/><br/>6) What about the Predator bomb? Well, that, without examining a real Predator bomb, could be a bit harder to figure out. Nevertheless, let's look at it like this. If a Predator knows he's going to be iced, then he just sets it to blow. However, if he wants to get out of there, he could set it to remote detonator or timer detonator. So, why was the one in Predator 2 stopped by cutting his arm off? I think I remember that it was actually damaged when the arm was cut off. The real question is why didn't it still explode, as a safety measure so the technology didn't fall into the wrong hands. That's the question. It should have. A real question is what is that bomb made of. Something that can't weigh more than a few pounds, but can still do that much damage. Sure, it's supposed to be inside a huge ice cavern so the blast is contained. Nevertheless, you saw the entire top 3/4 of the pyramid just vaporize when it went off. In addition, the explosion started with this weird blue light and then turned into flame. If it worked on the hydrogen molecules in the air, then it should keep going for as long as we had air, until the entire world was destroyed. And, it didn't seem atomic, or nuclear, in nature. If so, then all the ice in the area would have been vaporized in a couple of seconds. This would also include the 2,000 feet of ice above it. (Heat travels upward, remember?)<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, I'll just say that I thought it was an interesting movie. It could have been loads better. The factual errors, Plot holes, Continuity errors and just stupid mistakes do drop this from a Class 'A' movie to a ""C"". Not really borrowing from the original movies and all the other material out there was a bad mistake. It was nice to watch, and I may even buy the DVD for my collection, but it's not on my ""often"" replay list like some other movies."

","I'm tired of all the bashing here. Yes there were some flaws in the film.. I would agree that the aliens were gestating too quickly and that the films overall running time needed to be longer, but hey it was entertaining and obviously opens up the gates to a whole new set of movies starring our fave E.T.'s. And to say the Predators seemed dumb and inexperienced(as 2 of the 3 were killed early) is redundant... HELLO! they are supposed to be teenage Predators on the hunt for their adulthood rites.. they aren't supposed to be lethal, ultra skilled hunting machines like the previous hunters in Predators 1 and 2. They are trying to prove themselves as worthy hunters, I don't see too many new human hunters being ultra skilled or confident in their training when hunting for the first few times in real life, Why would this be different for Predators? This adds the element of frailty & drama and proves that the predators aren't invincible and have a human quality to them as we saw when the one predator spared the life of Charles Weyland until he so ignorantly tried to flambe' him. I appreciated the comedic moments of this film as it broke the monotony of most horror/action/sci-fi flicks that have a whole film of tension,gore and screaming. I liked the look and feel of this film as well. I also enjoyed the flashback scene that explains the history of Predators on earth. This movie was entertaining, period. It was worth the money to see it. I would have to say I am eagerly awaiting the inevitable sequel.. hopefully they will make it to the predator home world??? Will we see the tremendous battle that everyone for some reason expected to be in this film? I mean c'mon what's larger? AVP on earth?(Antarctica nonetheless) or AVP on Predator's home turf? This was merely the introduction film to the series.. a springboard if you will. Remember this line... ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend."" so expect humans in the sequel. here's a response to a quote of an earlier post. ""I've seen all the Predator and Alien movies and have also read some of the comics that were titled Alien versus Predator. I feel short changed by the total lack of character development. In the previous movies and in the comics you were able to get attached to the characters a little, who they were, what type of personality they had (everyone remembers Newt from Aliens), so when they got yoked it sort of meant something. You never get a chance to care, like or dislike about these people getting killed"".This was a direct quote from johntd5551 Hillsborough, New Jersey. Well let me tell you that you're not supposed to care about them! They are disposable.. the only [human] you should care about is Lex! considering she is the main human character. Overall I would give this film *** stars out of 5. In closing I would like to say to all the whiners and complainers who didn't think this movie lived up to ""THEIR"" expectations to go make a better movie themselves if they think they can."

Where are the marines??? why was this movie set nowadays when it could have been fifty times better with the space marines???<br/><br/>Now we'll get a little more specific-<br/><br/>3.Why did they choose all the actors except for Lance Henrickson to suck? Was there method to this madness?<br/><br/>4. Why is Mullet from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells a geologist? Why is he even in the movie?<br/><br/>5.How come the Archaeologist seems to know everything? I'm an archaeology student and the facts he's provided are believable for science fiction... but then he comes to these insane epiphanies from those facts, that no person could do. Especially the whole ten minute shifting pyramid thing (speaking of which didn't some of those ten minute periods seem really short while others were tremendously long?)<br/><br/>6.How come Sanaa Latham never seems phased once by any of the terrible things that are occurring, I'd be soiling myself in this situation, she stays cool???<br/><br/>7.Ms Latham also impales two aliens (something I doubt she could do considering their exoskeletons) yet she's never burned by the acid... wouldn't it just be spewing out of them?<br/><br/>8.Ms Latham is kicked against a wall by a predator yet she doesn't seem hurt or even really startled (see #6)<br/><br/>9.How do the aliens gestate so quickly compared to the other movies? the face huggers are birthed, plant their eggs, the aliens hatch and then grow full sized in like an hour.<br/><br/>10.Why do there seem to be more aliens running around than there were people to birth them?<br/><br/>11.Why did that new predator have a crappy like dollar-store Hallowe'en mask instead of a real predator mask? And okay, I can except that maybe they make new masks now, but at the end the predator takes his mask off and his mouth looks way different than the predator from the first movies... have they evolved since we last saw them?<br/><br/>12. Why do the predators have new ships that look nothing like the originals? as well as a new graduated hunter sign that they put on their helmets.. I don't remember the predators from the first movies having those on their helmets.<br/><br/>13. In predator 1 & 2 the preds see through their masks in a blue heat-vision, yet in this movie they use a red and green vision the whole way through... until the end where suddenly we're back to blue... And why when the explorers are carrying the predator plasmaguns, can the predators see the guns in their backpacks with a perfect outline, as though the guns have their own heat signature?<br/><br/>14.We all know that the aliens strength comes in their numbers... yet two predators are killed instantly by a handful of aliens..especially considering that later we see a flash-back to a stupid past back story/history (don't even get me started on that blasphemy) where three preds are wooping like a thousand aliens. And one of the predators is destroyed by an aliens inner mouth going right through his helmet (don't remember them being that strong).<br/><br/>15. Also the predators are supposed to be the perfect hunters, calm and collected... yet here they run around in this mad killing frenzy, just wiping out everything.<br/><br/>16. The predator dissattaches his little wrist computer and it detonates... yet in predator 2 the predator sets his detonator and then his arm gets cut off and the explosion never occurs, suggesting that the explosives for that device are on the suit and not on the computer device. can you say continuity? Also the new throwing discs-lame<br/><br/>17. How come she gets a way cooler gift from the predators than Danny Glover did??? lame.<br/><br/>18. Such an exciting ending... ooooooh a Predalien on an predator ship... what's gonna happen? can't wait for part two.... here's part 2, the predators find the predalien and kick it's woosy @$$ because there are a lot of them and only one predalien... the end<br/><br/>The real question is who allowed this garbage to ruin two amazing series(es?), why did anyone allows this yo-yo to direct and why did I waste my money on this garbage? <br/><br/>The actors in the predator suits weren't even trying to act, the CG was terrible like all CG is (directors and SFX wizards used to know how to make believable stuff without computers watch any Stan Winston movie for examples) The queen alien danced around like an idiot dinosaur from jurassic park and then died. Predators did not teach us how to build pyramids and then get worshiped as gods, they are interstellar hunters, they hunt the indigenous life on planets, take their trophies and leave. They go to other planets for other life... they don't bring it here. This is a huge atrocity in these movie genres and now any subsequent movies will have to make-up for the mistakes made in this film! Where's Sigourney? Where's Arnold? Where's James Cameron? Where's the taste? Where's the gore? where the hell is my money???"

"cmivie","Null","0","0","23 August 2004"," What did you expect?
","Even after I had read the negative reviews about this film, I still went with a buddy of mine to check it out. He and I are big Predator fans (yes, even Predator 2 is a movie I like), and I also enjoy the Alien series (Aliens being my favorite). So, as a fan, I really wasn't bothered by the PG-13 rating, but I found it odd that FOX was willing to sacrifice product over profitability. But, with AVP, FOX has managed to put out three box office successes (the other two being I, Robot and The Day After Tomorrow). So, I guess the gamble has paid off.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD)!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Okay, so now to the movie. Well, you all know the plot, so i will skip that much a hit some other things. First is the cast. Besides our lead heroine, we get to know them very little. In a way this is good because we all paid to see the Aliens battle the Predators. I'll hit the latter part in a second. As for the cast, you really do not care about them. Heck even when the two guys are talking about getting home to there kids, you know they are gonna die. So, the dialogue between the two seems rather pointless. Then, there is our lead heroine (Sanaa Lathan) and the pyramid expert Sebastian. Sebastian is a know-it-all and he is the one who figures out the backstory of the Predators and Aliens. The backstory is neat, but it really could have used more thought to it to make it seem more logical. In any case, the Predators come back to Earth every hundred years and hunt the Aliens, and the Humans are used as hosts to breed the Aliens. Which is why the satellites found the temple in the arctic. Yep, the Predators set it up because they needed our team of expert scientists and such as hosts for there hunt. Sound silly? Well, it is, but I was willing to look past all that. In any case, the cast is expendable and as a result.........they die.<br/><br/>Now, on to the fight scenes. There is very little action between the Predators and Aliens, but what little we get looks very good. This alone saved the movie for me. My only beef here is that two of the Predators die very quickly once they get into the temple, leaving the one main Predator to do battle with all the Aliens. Lucky for him, our lead star is willing to team up with him to fight the beasts. Look, we wanted the Aliens fighting the Predators, and I feel that killing two Predators off like they did was just too damn silly. In any case, the effects and such are very good and should salvage some of the movie for you.<br/><br/>As for the Aliens? I felt they looked good (what little we do see because they mostly come out in the dark), and they have no alterations to them (at least they didn't try to put that stupid Alien from Resurrection in the film). The Aliens we get are what we saw in Aliens. Now, the tail is used quite often, and it looks good too when it is used. As for the queen? Okay, she has been locked down by the Predators and is awakened by one of our cast members stepping on a floor piece. Yes, it does look like Frankenstein's monster when she awakens as the electric current flows through her body. Here is my problem with this. She finally figures out how to get loose, as she sacrifices her young and there acid breaks the chains! Okay, me thinks if she is this smart that she would have figured this out many, many years ago. But, for the sake of the film, she just now figures it out and she gets loose. Obviously, she has her big scene in the final battle with the Predator and our wonder woman. Was it just me, or did anyone else think of Jurassic Park when the Queen Alien is chasing the woman? I laughed my ass off at that. <br/><br/>The Predators look good. I like how Anderson used there camouflage, especially when one Predator jumps from one side to the other during a battle with the humans in the temple. I liked the new throwing star (I guess that is what you would call it) the Predators had. There really wasn't anything cheesy about them.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is what it is. I have read that Anderson was unhappy with it because he didn't get to make the film he wanted to. If that is the case, then I hope once the DVD is out that FOX will release his cut of the film (which was R-rated). I don't think the film is as horrible as some have called it. It is a ""popcorn flick"" and to take it seriously is the wrong approach. If you like Sci-Fi and action, then this film will give you that."

","After reading the reviews of Aliens vs Predator, I was expecting a bunch of fight scenes and little or no plot. The movie surprised me however. Far from being<br/><br/>the usual loosely written action movie (a la Chronicles of Riddick), it actually had a smooth plot, contained no major logical discrepancies, and stayed true to the comics as well. The only thing I didn't like was the ending, and I doubt most people will know enough about the Predator universe to figure out why.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie to watch if you're a fan of action films or the Aliens / Predator universe.

","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Like most of my fellow geeks out there, I have been waiting for this<br/><br/>movie for a long time.  Ever since that scene in Predator 2 when<br/><br/>you got a glimpse of the alien skull on the Predator ship.  We've<br/><br/>waited, indulging our need to see these two species clash through<br/><br/>comic books and video games.  But that illusive feature film still<br/><br/>haunted us.  We waited and waited... Until now.<br/><br/>So here we are, 14 years later, and the film has arrived.  And I have<br/><br/>to say, it wasn't worth the wait.  The film itself was disappointing on<br/><br/>many levels.  The script was weak.  The characters over-explain<br/><br/>everything, treating the audience as if we were complete idiots.  It<br/><br/>was insulting.  ""It's a pyramid!""  Gee, you think?  <br/><br/>And here's a tip.  If you are going to over-explain everything, don't<br/><br/>use the same character to use explain it.  This movie had a whole<br/><br/>room full of so-called experts, but it was the mountain climber that<br/><br/>seemed to know everything.  The only thing she didn't know was<br/><br/>how to translate ancient hieroglyphs from three civilizations across<br/><br/>three continents.  Fortunately, they happened to find an<br/><br/>archaeologist who happened to specialize in not just one, but<br/><br/>three dead languages.  Lucky break!<br/><br/>Also, I have to say that I am tired of the same old story of alien<br/><br/>species (in this case, the Predators) coming to ancient Earth and<br/><br/>having the primitives worship them as gods.  It's been done a<br/><br/>thousand times before, let's think of something new. <br/><br/>I am also a bit tired of having some alien temple or spaceship or<br/><br/>something buried under the ice in Antarctica.  It's the Thing all over<br/><br/>again.  Again, let's think of something new. <br/><br/>And since when did the aliens only take five minutes to gestate in<br/><br/>a human host?  It seems to me that in past movies it took a heck<br/><br/>of a lot longer.  In fact, it took the whole movie in Alien 3. <br/><br/>
I questioned a lot of the choices used in this movie.  The pyramid<br/><br/>under the ice, the Predators and ancient Earth, the casting of<br/><br/>Lance Henriksen as roughly the same character he was at the end<br/><br/>of Alien 3.  (Again, let's think of something new) But the thing that<br/><br/>really annoyed me was the lack of Versus.  This is Alien VS.<br/><br/>Predator, but they really don't fight that much.  The first two<br/><br/>Predators get their butts kicked right off the bat.  They spend half<br/><br/>the movie running after their little ray guns.  Seems to me that a<br/><br/>Predator would do just fine without it, and would probably find<br/><br/>more honor in killing an Alien with a spear or just his bare hands. <br/><br/>
Also, how many times do you have to put a Predator face to face<br/><br/>with an Alien?  It's a face-off, we get it!<br/><br/>Anyway, all in all, the film was a disappointment.  I don't expect a<br/><br/>whole lot from a Predator movie, but I do from an Alien movie.  I<br/><br/>like a much more creative storyline, with interesting characters and<br/><br/>a lot of scares.  There were none in this film.  I am tired of people<br/><br/>making movies that, just because it's got a winning formula, they<br/><br/>don't make an effort to make a good flick, because it's gonna sell<br/><br/>tickets anyway.  Take some pride!"

","So why bother watching it? I don't know, I did so too... only to have my expectations proven right.<br/><br/>Some personal ratings of relevant pictures: Alien : 5 stars, Aliens : 3.5 stars, Alien3 : 3 stars, Alien: Resurrection : 2 stars, Predator : 4 stars, Predator 2 : 3 stars, Aliens vs. Predator : 1.5 stars (it's still a movie about the two greatest e.t. beings of motion picture history, you know). --- And I do believe sequels can rock, I really do, but with these series they just get worse and worse --> so stop releasing Alien and/or Predator movies, for art's sake! You've ruined their once great reputation! But for me the Alien series ended with Alien3 anyhow, Resurrection was a total shame. When Ripley died, the trilogy ended appropriately and unconditionally, so all Alien movies thereafter are fake... er... at least that's some way to save the Alien legacy ;). But indeed, AvP sucked. Why? Please read any random review around here. The annoying thing is, however, I initially thought it had been directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (great... alternative movie making!), but it was that other Anderson from the videogame movies... Anyway: 1.5 stars. It may have gotten two of them if they hadn't made the Predator team up with that anti-Ripley chick (you noticed the audience chuckling, too, didn't you?)... mwoahaha... how marvellously ridiculous that was! Brilliant stuff, people."

","The ultimate question here is whether this film was a good idea or not.  It all began in 1990 with the Dark Horse Comics publication of a five issue series called Aliens Vs. Predator.  Additional series followed over the years including novels, video games, trading cards, and even a toy line.  In a sense, the AVP concept had already crossed every medium years before the film was made.  Various pitches and scripts were discussed since 1990, but nothing really resulted for the project.  The closest the movie came was a script called THE HUNT (based on the original AVP comic book) written by Peter Briggs in 1991 which never came to fruition.<br/><br/>Some argue the project was never pursued because producers felt both franchises were already dead.  PREDATOR 2 (1990) and ALIEN 3 (1992) both met with mixed results from the public, despite the fact the latter grossed more than ALIENS (1987) worldwide.  Nevertheless, a fourth ALIEN film was released in 1997 around the same time that writer/director Robert Rodriguez was writing a script for a third PREDATOR installment.<br/><br/>The success of New Line Cinema's FREDDY VS JASON (2003) no doubt gave 20th Century Fox the idea to finally push AVP into production.  Is it just coincidence that Fox announced AVP a mere month after the widely successful opening weekend of FREDDY VS. JASON?  Fox's new found enthusiasm for the project raises some concern.  Shooting started in October of 2003, a mere ten months before its scheduled release date.  Isn't that rushing it a bit? This must be a cash-in.<br/><br/>After watching the film myself, I don't dismiss it as such.  I feel it's a somewhat genuine effort and pretty fan-pleasing.  I don't know where or how Paul W.S. Anderson (and his own script) came into the project, but he didn't destroy the picture too badly.  His involvement was heavily debated in fan circles from the get-go.  My only hope with Anderson directing was a return to his style in the largely neglected EVENT HORIZON (1997).  Furthermore, Anderson spoke quite enthusiastically (to say the least) about the project.  Read any Fangoria Magazine interview to see how much of a fan he is and how well-suited his intentions were while writing the script. Unfortunately, that doesn't translate exactly into the finished product.<br/><br/>In terms of the fan's desire and a sequel's purpose, AVP does moderately well.  Anderson brings the xenomorphs to modern day earth and the deadly hunters to Antarctica.  The two twists deliver quiet well for fans.  It was such an incredible thrill to see the heat-driven predators in the arctic snow.<br/><br/>Anderson was also sure to add a few details to prove he had done his homework.  The dark and claustrophobic tunnels from the ALIEN movies are here (triangular this time - which is amusingly fresh) and so is the predators' hunting code (one throws a human back for being too weak).<br/><br/>What AVP lacks is a solid narrative.  There's a good story here, but Anderson seems to rush into things way to easily.  His need for speed tragically diminishes the film's potential.  He also seems to play to the twelve year old boys in the audience, or at least their mental equivalent. What he fails to notice is that you don't have to dumb things down for kids.<br/><br/>The overall pace of the film was horrible.  The film's final running time is around the 84 minute mark.  As I said, Anderson made it very fast.  There's literally less than five minutes of screen time that passes between a face-hugger impregnation and the alien's birth.  I understand that you have to have aliens in the picture for the predators to hunt, but that's ridiculous.  And where did all the aliens come from?  We only see six to ten humans get impregnated yet there seems to be an endless number of aliens running around.  And why do we only get to see one predator fight one alien at a time?  It would be so much more exciting to see a predator take on a swarm of aliens or at least two predators fighting together as a team.  We finally got both creatures in the same movie, so let's make the best of it!<br/><br/>Another oddity of AVP is its PG-13 rating.  This was a major shock to the fanbase considering that the aliens are born through violent chest-bursts and the predators skin their prey.  Fortunately, AVP doesn't feel too PG-13 but there are a few moments where the film obviously cuts away from the violence.<br/><br/>I'd be able to deal with the ultra-fast pacing, bad dialogue, and lack of proper character development only if AVP hadn't made the predators so hokey looking.  This was the biggest disappoint for me.  Special effects technology has advanced since the original PREDATOR films, but apparently not for this one.  I don't really understand what went wrong considering the effects were handled by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr.  Fans know their reputation, so what happened?<br/><br/>Another disappoint is the general neglect of the aliens.  They are hardly in this movie.  Furthermore, the humans in this film do little but flee from both deadly species.  We the audience may already know everything about the two creatures, but these characters don't yet.  That should have been explored more.<br/><br/>Of course, I am a life-long fan of both franchises so I doubt any AVP film could live up to my expectations.  Naturally, I felt let down by Paul W.S. Anderson's picture but it could have been a lot worse.  Loyalists can damn me all to hell but I'll honestly admit that I enjoyed watching AVP.  There weren't enough problems to make me truly hate it. <br/><br/>It might have been a mere `cash-in' for the producers, but I feel Paul W.S. Anderson gave an honest effort here.  My criticisms of the film are just from a creative standpoint, really.  I recommend AVP to fans, but the average movie-goer won't be able to appreciate it or even understand it."

By showing your support for AVP you are just convincing Hollywood to make more and more mindless, boring and mediocre films. The acting in AVP is Horrible and they way the screwed with the Alien life cycle is unforgivable! This and the fact that Fox cut the movie to pieces AND gave it a PG-13 rating reminds me that if you can't do something right the first time, DON'T DO IT AT ALL! Now we all have to wait for the DVD to see the ""R-Rated Director's Cut"" which may or may not be better than the theatrical version. What a joke!

Most of the movie was well done, and, I thought the references to both the Alien and Predator movies was a good feature. The storyline involving the humans, aliens, and predators and the pyramid was great, I thought. It really pulled everything together. And, I was really happy with the film up until Lex (Sanaa Lathan) handed over her gun to the predator and they went off to battle aliens together. The scenes with them running side by side in slow motion were a little ridiculous. Personally, I would have had two predators get up to the point where Lex hands over the gun. Then, I would have had an alien kill Lex with it's tail suddenly and then the two predators fight it and everything else that happens ensues, with the second remaining predator taking the place of Lex.

","After seeing movies like X-men, Batman, and especially the Spiderman's I thought the movie industry had it all figured out. Use the elements of the comics, television shows, and movies that the people loved. Most importantly, give the audience a chance to care about whats going to happen to the characters. Add in the latest special effects, decent dialogue, and story line that gives the characters ample room to do what we paid to see them do...not so with AvP.<br/><br/>I've seen all the Predator and Alien movies and have also read some of the comics that were titled Alien versus Predator. I feel short changed by the total lack of character development. In the previous movies and in the comics you were able to get attached to the characters a little, who they were, what type of personality they had (everyone remembers Newt from Aliens), so when they got yoked it sort of meant something. You never get a chance to care, like or dislike about these people getting killed. Some of the action was great but for the most part it seemed like everyone was just doing the obvious with no suspense or decent build up. The PG-13 rating really hurt this movies gore factor."

","I've always been a big fan  of both the Alien and the Predator franchises, and when these have been extended to comics I have always enjoyed them. This movie, however, fails to deliver on any of the possibilities of these visitors' encounter.  It is obvious that the screenplay was written quickly, since the plot that explains why these characters from different universes should meet is pretty thin.  Unfortunately, the carelessness taken with the plot doesn't even make for interesting action set-pieces, and the end result is a movie that even seen on the big screen has few thrills. A team of scientists and adventurers travel to Antarctica to investigate a mysterious heat source located by a satellite and stumble onto a hidden temple.  This ancient building is being used by the Predators to breed Aliens, which are then used to test the newest members of the Predator clan.  The researchers must find a way out of the place before they get caught in the middle of a war they can't hope to win. The plot needn't have been so complex, and it definitely should not have been dwelt on so much in the beginning.  As a result there is no development of any of the characters, so their mostly uninteresting deaths never weigh on the audience.  There isn't even an interesting dynamic that could have dealt with the psychology of an ever-dwindling group.  Instead, the movie focuses on the action between the titular characters, but the Aliens are never menacing when they are fully lit and not very numerous and the Predators are robbed of their stalking cool."

The best way to enjoy this movie is to pick a side, ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" and see if you're happy with your choice at the end!  No matter who you choose, you will enjoy the battle! A must see movie for fans of the two creatures!  You will not be disappointed, trust me!!!"

","AVP was well sorley dissapointing. I found that all through this movie it was very vulgar. I don't know who could enjoy it with all the violence and rage in  it. I think that the director should look over his work before he decided to release it. I think that it was very brutal to sit and watch some Alien and a predator rip each others lungs out. They should of had some scene with out violence and rage.<br/><br/>I think that this was very obsurd and crusial and the director must have been in denial to release this. I would give it 0/10 for it's misconduct and the direction theis film was in. I think that the movie would have made it bigger than what it is without all the violence. Many Teens like those movies and when they can't see it you lose more money."

","saw this the other night with a friend. we agreed that a better movie would have been if, instead of agreeing to lead the group, the main character had stayed by her decision to leave. then the movie could have followed her home, where she could have sat, long-faced and sad-eyed, thinking about what might be happening to the people she abandoned, probably to die. at any rate...instead, they decided to make a movie called alien vs predator, where the human actually does most of the alien killing, the predators are pansies, and the action sequences consist of the camera-man shaking the camera a lot. the least they could have done would have been to throw in an inter-special kiss or love-scene between the human woman and her predator friend. but, alas...disappointed again. freddy vs jason was far better than this movie. at least it was funny from time to time, and the people responsible understood that, if they were going to call it ""freddy vs jason"", freddy should actually fight jason at some point. anyway, have fun and happy meatballs."
"dan-881","Null","0","0","19 August 2004"," Thoughts about what would have made it better....
","I was thinking about what I think would have made the movie better, and thought of this:<br/><br/>1) The beginning should have been a narrated story type thing, as seen in other movies like Terminator, Judge Dredd, and others; a detailed, but concise telling of the backstory to let the audience know the how and why. The scene where the Italian guy was reading the hyroglyphs, and recounting the tale, with the flashback, THAT should have been the beginning.<br/><br/>Tied into this narration would have been some info about a deep exploration team going to check out a mysterious occurrence, and have the movie actually start once they were at the site and ready to go down. As it stands, I personally felt the humans got too much screen time. This movie is supposed to be about aliens and predators; I really don't care about the background history of each human character in this particular film. By abbreviating the beginning, more time could have been given to what we were all waiting for: AvP carnage.<br/><br/>2) Have 5 Predators (or at least 4) to give more on screen battle time. It seemed as if the first 2 predators got killed much too quickly (although the fight was really cool) However, these are Predators; cunning skilled warriors that stealthy, strong and resourceful. Despite being inexperienced ""teen"" Predators, it would have been better to see more one on one battles. When ""scar"" finally gets his shoulder cannon back and starts blasting aliens off the ceiling, I thought ""wow! I hope we see more of that!"" but alas, that's all we got. Some scenes with a Predator med kit would have been cool, just as a throw back to earlier films. Having 4-5 Predators in the film may have added to screen time, but with movies as of late (like the annoyingly tedious Bad Boys II) pushing 2hrs+, this movie could have had more ""money shots"" and action, because that's what we paid for.<br/><br/>I'll draw a parallel between AvP and Godzilla: People/critics slammed Godzilla as a piece of crap for various reasons, however I enjoyed it for one reason: All I wanted to see was big lizard stepping on stuff, and that's exactly what I felt I got. There were so many shots of Godzilla itself, as well as the thing that made Jurassic Park fun: Raptor like offspring. Not just a taste, but a full on barrage of footage with the little offspring. I walked away from that movie feeling I got what I paid for, and not ""teased"" by quick glimpses or snippits of action. As for the acting, who really cares about the acting in a film like this? I mean really....The movie wasn't called ""the adventures of Matthew Broderick and Maria Pitullo"" so who gives a crap if they weren't up to par?<br/><br/>I found it hard to stomach the human/predator alliance. If you remember the previous predator movies, there's no way such an allegiance would ever form between man and this ruthless creature, even if the human did kill an alien. I kept waiting for the Predator to kill Lexxa after she bagged his target, but I knew already that she was the ""heroine"" so that wasn't going to happen. The tag line stated: ""whoever wins, we lose..."" However, since Lexxa is basically the only one who survives, it seems as if ""we"" won..<br/><br/>As an additional thought, Near the end, when the Predator indicated that he was going to blow up the eggs with his arm bomb, Lexxa vehemently declares ""let's blow these F***ers away......"" or something to that effect.........the predator should have rolled his eyes (or done the equivalent head gesticulation, since his eyes are masked) and then lopped her head off with a blade, and then used a voice sampled recording in typical Predator fashion:<br/><br/>""Sh'up B*tch!""<br/><br/>now THAT would have been cool.<br/><br/>Just my $.04 :)"
"TMNTFreak2006","Null","0","0","20 August 2004"," Like All Movies, Has Its Ups and Downs
","Although AVP has been one of the best films I've seen this year, like all films it had its ups and downs. For starters, the sheer fact of seeing the two legendary aliens face off head to head was one of the most exciting things to happen since Freddy Vs. Jason. Most fans of the Predator series have been waiting a long time for this since seeing the Alien skull in the trophy room in Predator 2. But on a downside, the plot, as it may have been good, had many holes in it.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in a Predator pyramid that was there for the sole purpose of breeding and hunting Aliens. The movie goes into the history of the Predators' species, which seems to be what the film circles around, and tells how humans once worshiped them as gods, but a tragic end lost all knowledge of it. A team of archeologists, assembled by Weyland Industries which was the ""company"" referred to in the Alien series, searches the pyramid only to find out it was a supposed trap, so they would host the Aliens to breed them. The humans are taken out quickly, first by Aliens, then the Predators, leaving only one. After Lex, the remaining human, kills an Alien with the Predator's spear, there comes a partnership between the two as the hunt the Aliens together, ending in a showdown with a very angry queen Alien.<br/><br/>As the plot was very well thought out, the movie was very slow in the beginning along with jumpy. The Aliens were much better CGIed that in Resurrection, but the Predators were too bulky. Their predecessors were muscular, but sleek, meanwhile, the new Predators looked as if Schwartzenegger trained them.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I enjoyed the film thoroughly, and with the ending, do expect a sequel, hopefully filling in the plot holes without presenting more. I gave this movie an 8/10."
"Soul_Device","Null","0","0","20 August 2004"," Not as good as the best, not as bad as the worst.
","ALIEN vs. PREDATOR<br/><br/>Like most sci-fi/action fans, Predator and Alien are some of my favorite movies. I was very excited to hear that Paul Anderson, a self-professed fan, was writing and directing the merger of these two ""monster"" franchises after the hint of such a creation toward the end of Predator 2.<br/><br/>Style - 8/10<br/><br/>Stylistically the film does well. The FX are well done - we get to see the Aliens do things we never have before and with much more detail. Further, the battles are much more harrowing now that they take place between more equal creatures. While it is violent once the fighting starts, the gore/goo factor was toned down a bit from previous films - more implied than graphically displayed. For those interested, foul language was not over the top, and nudity / sexual situations are non-existent (even the requisite heroine-changing-into-her-underwear scenes are missing!). The acting was acceptable from the non-throw-away characters - nothing special, but not distracting from the story which was my principal interest.<br/><br/>Story - 6.5/10<br/><br/>AvP's back-story is an amalgamation of Erich von Daniken's ""Chariots of the Gods"" theory, and Stargate-style mythology. It gives us another glimpse of Predator ethics and values (see below). But from there it follows its basic genre blueprint with little if any character arc and few creative twists (save the interesting sequel possibility thrown in at the end). But hey - we got what we expected right?<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a worthy successor to both lines of its predecessors. I say 'worthy' because while it was not as good as either of the originals or the best of the two franchises' sequels, it was not as bad as their worst. This owed mostly to the story's originality and the inclusion of believable heroes (the absence of which contributed to Predator 2's downfall - I mean, c'mon, Danny Glover beats an alien that Arnold and two special forces teams had trouble with???). Considering how easy it would have been to mess up a potentially great merging of two story lines, Anderson's efforts should be appreciated. <br/><br/>World View / Moral - 8/10<br/><br/>I think the film's biggest strength is in its contrast between the moral status of the Alien and the Predator. Aliens basically represent the nihilistic outcome of a coherent evolutionary world view (i.e. 'survival of the fittest,' or, 'kill or be killed'). They show no remorse, no rationale, and live only to overpower the weak and reproduce themselves regardless of the consequences or suffering they might cause along the way. In other words - they are animals. <br/><br/>The Predators, on the other hand, are persons (creatures possessing emotion, intellect, and will). They are even, in a sense, an honorable race. In contrast to the random Alien killing machines, the Predators seek out warlike societies for their hunting grounds - what they seem to consider morally equal ground. They kill for sport, but rarely unarmed victims. That they value honor, courage, and strength is also made clear in several scenes. Oddly, given their assumptions of species-superiority, they are actually more honorable than many humans who consider it a heroic triumph to shoot a deer from a tree 1,000 feet away with a high powered rifle!<br/><br/>Anderson does not lose sight of this ethical distinction although it is not made as thematically evident which is unfortunate. The more obvious theme (i.e. ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"") is really brought forth more as a ""lesser-of-two-evils"" philosophy than a considered moral decision. More attention to this fascinating aspect would have strengthened the film considerably.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7 / 10"
"Lyzer","8","0","0","22 August 2004"," In answer to the haters
","First I would like to address some of the illegitimate faults people have with this film. It had some really neat fight scenes, but they shoulda gotten rid of more Aliens.  One of the Preds seemed to be far more prepared.  I think people would have enjoyed this movie more if not from the 'holes' that weren't really there.  The official site that the chestbusters grew fast because they are given a drug that makes them grow faster.  As one guy put it, the preds didn't wanna have to sit around playing cards waiting for the prey to grow up.  The faces didn't look like plastic-they were good.  They weren't the best fighters-they were kids trying to prove themselves-how smart do normal teens act??? <br/><br/>The critics definitely went a little nuts. I emailed one and corrected him-and he wrote back and agreed.  The men had weapons because most groups out to investigate might have sent mercenaries after treasure, they were prepared!   Given what happens to most of the humans, it's know wonder that we didn't learn a lot about them. Alexa didn't want to take a team down to no-where without training.  She refused to help them hoping that they would change their minds and go through the training.  But then when she realized the person they choose had little training-she wanted them to benefit from her experience-to give them a chance. <br/><br/>Oh yeah the predalien--Alien 3--there was a pred-dog, so why not??<br/><br/>I forgot--this was good because it was mostly actors in suits doing the stunts.  The lead predator was a 7'1 ex-football player. (!!!)  A couple of scenes were robots, even fewer were computer generated.  It's kinda refreshing to see a depart from that. <br/><br/>The acting was good, both the humans and aliens. You have to be good to make your character shine without saying anything. Well done. 8/10"

","The plot line was a little slow in the beginning, I have to admit, but come on people, how great was it to see these two Goliaths on the same screen. I throughly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>The only fault I would give this film would be where the story line goes at the end. Instead of Sanna Lathan (Alexa Woods) killing the alien using the means she did, it would have been far more intense if the aliens aboard the mother ship monitored the battle between the young warrior and the matriarch alien. Watching his demise the battle-scarred predator chieftan would rise from his console chair and intervene, holding back his older warriors on the ship. With all the authority and mastery due his vast experience, the predator would, in a much longer fight scene, jump in with a no-holds-barred attitude and weaponry. This would extend the battle-scene between the two titans, and would have made for a much more entertaining and exciting ending. After all, it is Alien vs Predator, not Alien vs Predator vs earthling.<br/><br/>Hollywood, if you are watching and reading, I am for hire writing horror scripts.

","I never care what the critics say about any movie... if i did, i would watch maybe 5 movies a year. I absolutely loved this movie. Just for the pure action and entertainment value alone, i'd go see it again. I don't know what people are expecting to see when they go to a movie named alien vs. predator. Good acting? A love story? Plot? I went to see action, killing, special effects and entertainment. This had all that. Sure, it wont win any awards... But its worth buying on DVD. As far as the story lines from the other alien movies and predator movies.. i don't think they intended this one to follow their styles. And like MOST movies out there... this one had some flaws, but so what... over all i left the darkened theatre happy and hoping for a sequel. People, don't waste your money on boring, too drug out, sappy story lines. Relax and live a little and give your imagination some fictional food for thought for once. See this movie and then go see Resident Evil Apocalypse... And bring the kids so they can have a nightmare or two to brighten up their lives.

","Completely entertaining in that Big Hollywood Summer Movie Shlockfest kind of way, Alien vs. Predator (or AVP as they packaged it for short-attention span Gen-Xers), has a sexy-but-tough black chick protagonist who gets blooded and bonds with the toughest of the crab-faced Predators as she fights for survival in the shifting labyrinth multi-cultural pyramid of doom under a half mile of ice where the Aliens have taken over and threaten mankind with .... blah blah, you get the picture. <br/><br/>What is truly entertaining is the unintended camp of this film.<br/><br/>At one point, after a lucky defensive spear thrust, AVP's version of Vernita Green earns the last Predator's respect and together they seek to destroy the aliens and escape from the Pyra-maze-complex ... you almost expect a scene of them relaxing and smoking cigarettes after sex it gets so preposterous. <br/><br/>The Matrix-Charlie's Angel slow-mo of a face-hugger flying across a room is moronic - some studio suit no doubt wrote the note for that one.<br/><br/>Our heroes outrun explosions and collapsing ice - after vanquishing an angry queen Alien, of course. One must simply laugh at the movie at this point.<br/><br/>If the makers of these films could just ground them a wee bit more in reality - like following the rules of physics for one - they would be so much more suspenseful - and better.<br/><br/>I sure hope the spoofs of this film pick up on the Vernita Green angle and blend in a Christie Love aspect too. I'd love to see a bell-bottomed, big-afroed sistah kicking ass with her man the Predator and then smoking after some serious inter-species lovemaking.

"jimmiewing","6","0","0","21 August 2004"," Biggest monster of all? The director.
","All four Alien films, and even the first Predator film, were helmed by very talented filmmakers. Together, the Alien and Predator series have launched the careers of major talents, such as Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and John McTiernan. So who was the genius over at Twentieth Century Fox that decided to hand BOTH franchises over to writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson? Anderson's awful reputation as a music-video-style hack is not unwarranted. Anybody who actually saw Event Horizon, Soldier, Resident Evil, or any other previous efforts knows that this guy can make an unwatchable movie out of any decent script. To be fair, AVP begins promisingly- I actually really enjoyed the set-up in the underground Antarctic pyramid. And I was fairly pleased to see the filmmakers hold back on the CGI. However, the film really starts to lose its hold over a thinking audience when the titular monsters finally do face off- the first match-up is about halfway through the film. The editing becomes frantic, the story becomes silly, and the characters- well, they were unmemorable to begin with but these characters soon become absolutely unbelievable as well. I have a major problem with some pretty face of a heroine (Sanaa Lathan is NO Sigourney Weaver) making FRIENDS with a Predator. Blame Paul W. S. Anderson, who somehow got story, screenplay, and director roles on this long-awaited event film, for botching what could have been a great fight."

","A pretty good story with lots of action.<br/><br/>To be nit picky:<br/><br/>The aliens DID incubate too fast.<br/><br/>There were more aliens than hosts. I don't remember the exact number, but when the predator first got his gun back, there were like 10 aliens coming up the hall. He had already killed one prior to that. And there were only like 8 or so humans in there... not all of which were dead yet... and some of those humans were killed by the predators. Where did all the extra aliens come from???<br/><br/>Other than that, it was better than expected for another ""vs."" movie. My son loved it."

","Weeks before Alien Vs. Predator was released into theaters, I was already laughing. If it wasn't bad enough to squeeze every last dollar out of little kids by toning down a should be R rated film to a wimpy PG-13, it was further blessed by Fox giving the project to writer/director Paul Anderson, who's ugly resume includes Event Horizon and one of the worst movies of 2002, Resident Evil.<br/><br/>Happily, AVP prevents strike 3 for Anderson. It's a rockn' good time and one of the best monster movies since the all time great, Aliens.<br/><br/>To keep up with the special effects and moderate budget, AVP has no familiar names such as Tom Cruise or Julia Roberts. Our main character is played by Sanaa Lathan (Alexa Woods), an expert mountain climber who has been called to the line of duty by billionaire Charles Bishop (Lance Henriksen). Bishop. Now why does that name sound familiar? (watch Aliens for the answer).<br/><br/>It turns out one of Bishop's satellites have discovered a pyramid 2,000 feet below the earth core in Antarctica. Since Bishop knows others will soon discover it as well, he's willing to pay top price to anyone who will help him explore it. Alexa senses danger from every corner, but curiosity gets the best of her so she agrees to lead the expedition.<br/><br/>Now we've got problems. The Predator's aboard their own ship have been watching from space and it turns out they are responsible for the re-appearance of the pyramid and when opened up, it's show time.<br/><br/>Once inside, the crew finds out the the pyramid is a maze that adjusts itself every 10 minutes and when the first surprise unexpectedly hits, everybody gets separated and a few end up being hosts for the aliens who began to spread faster than a social disease.<br/><br/>The best thing about AVP is the attention given to the aliens and predators. One disappointment about the original Alien was we never got a good look at it. Here we have an all out experience in virtual 3-D with in your face close ups of the monsters and the battle sequences with with alien and the predator are done to the cue. And we also find out that a dead alien can make one hell of a fighting weapon.<br/><br/>A nice way to end summer at the movies.<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>I rate the entire Alien/Predator series as follows:<br/><br/>Alien ***1/2<br/><br/>Aliens ****<br/><br/>Alien 3 1/2*<br/><br/>Alien Resurrection ***<br/><br/>Predator ***<br/><br/>Predator 2 **1/2"

","***SPOILERS BELOW***<br/><br/>I approached this film the same way I approached Freddy vs. Jason:   don't expect any Oscar caliber, genre-defining stuff, just sit down and enjoy yourself.  Fortunately, I was able to do that.  I'm a BIG fan of the original Predator; I consider it one of the best action films of all time. I'm not really familiar with the Alien series, only seeing the first one about a month ago.  Therefore I was fortunate to go into this film without too much of a bias....my only bias being that I'm a HUGE fan of the Predators and was rooting for them.<br/><br/>This film isn't as bad as I heard it was, and as IMDb would lead one to believe.  It's not a terrible film by any means, but it could've been better.  I thought the PG-13 rating would've really hurt AVP but it really doesn't, and I was relieved by that fact.  It sounds very childish to hear so many people here bashing the movie because the Predators don't 'rip out any spines' from their prey....it's REALLY sad when people allow such gratuitous violence to dictate whether they 'enjoy' a movie.  Believe me, I could appreciate blood and guts like the next man, but don't bash a movie because they chose not to have such violence....it's not essential to film, its just icing on the cake.  The effect is still pretty much there.  The Predators are so damn cool, but I must say I underestimated the Aliens.  I didn't expect them to be as much competition for the Predators as they were. I could honestly say that I'm even more inclined to go and rent the two Alien sequels based on their showing in AVP.  <br/><br/>My only real beef with the film is the ending.  Seeing Sanaa Lathan running side by side with the Predator.....well it seemed very cheesy, and pretty unlikely for that matter.  It just didn't seem right, granted that I vividly recall the Predator in the original picking off humans one by one...although the Aliens are the main prey here.  Maybe because she had their plasma gun the Predator was less threatened by her.  Besides, from what was told about their history, the Predators and humans did have a relationship all those years ago, albeit not an equal one since the Predators were looked at as gods.  So maybe the makers of the film were playing on the 'human helping/serving their god angle.  I guess I'll justify the cheesy aspect that way.  <br/><br/>It was cool how they left the film open for a sequel.  Although it may seem that they have a lot to work with, they really don't because I can't see any way that that 'hybrid' alien is gonna survive on that ship full of Predators.  Anyhow, AVP overall is an enjoyable action/sci-fi film.  Of course it could've been better, but it's not terrible at all. <br/><br/>

Sanaa Lathan did an alright job as the heroine of this movie but she's far from Ripley, like she was anything great either. I hate to say this because I know I'm gonna start to compare other crossover movies that started out with separate franchises i.e. Frankenstein and the Wolf-Man but this movie was not better than last summer blockbuster Freddy Vs. Jason. Even though the fight scenes were a tad better than FvJ's, it lacked the charisma that both films brought over it 20 plus years span(there were 7 Freddy films and 10 Jason films not including FvJ.)I felt like the producers should have made more predator and alien movies before they brought these two together.

"j_meinhardt","Null","0","0","18 August 2004"," The good and the bad about this movie < AVP > (Spoiler)
","I am going to start off with the good. This movie is good for those people who just enjoy going to movies. It is not for the big fans of either franchise. The fight scenes were awesome. I give an A for them because they were not 100% CGI or 100% animatronics it was a good mix and you could not really tell when they switched from one to another. Weapons were nice I wish they had more new ones. Very good use of the Alien's tail in this movie. You never really see them use their tail in the other ones as well as they used it in this movie.<br/><br/>Okay now for the bad. As I said before if you are a fan you will not like it. One reason is there are so many things you can nic pic about this movie they all add up to a big pile of crap. As a fan of both films I will start with Predator one of my favorite all time films. Both movies Predator hunted in hot weather. Why would they even go to the coldest part of our world to hunt for their man hood? Another is the human did not wear proper close down there in the Artic every part of their body ""like their face"" should have been covered up. you could not see hardly anyone's breath. Coldest part of the world and no cold breath coming out. 2 out of 3 Predators die within 2 mins of fighting...they had advance weapons, they hunt aliens all over the galaxy for fun but they die within 2 mins and their manhood training or test however you want to look at it. It just seems like they made him out to be a wimp. They only had one new weapon they needed a lot more to bring out what made predator so cool like in the other 2.<br/><br/>Now the Alien, I think he did pretty well on them. I just wish there were more tunnels and stuff to make you jump out of your seat like the first 2 Alien films. As an Alien fan I did have one problem and that was with the chest busters or baby Alien however you know them as. They grew up faster then in any other movie. And to nic pic it even more they came out of the humans real fast but when the Predator had one it took a lot longer. Not only that in Alien 3 they did not attack a human if they had a alien in them. But this can be debate able. The Queen attacked him and put her tail threw him near his chest too. So really the Alien inside should have died. But that is more of an opion I guess.<br/><br/>One of my biggest problem with this film is that it is PG-13. All the other films in both franchise were R. No gore, no blood, no scary scenes to make you piss your pants. And fans of either will be really pissed off about that at least I was. And also 1 hour 27 min running time!! What the hell come on The Lion King is longer then that with a run time 1 hour 29 min. and it is a cartoon.<br/><br/>I just wish they would have listen to the fans more on this film and got more input from people who love both films. I think he ""Paul Anderson"" brought these 2 universes together in a bad way but did well with the fight scenes. The problem is there was not enough fighting between Aliens and Predators. Maybe 10 min of fighting out of 1 hour and 27 min at the most.<br/><br/>I am not going to bash Paul Anderson but I will not say he did a great job either. I think he did what he could do with the budget Fox gave him. Also he should have had more time editing the film I think that is why the film was so short someone from fox made a lot of changes to the film and not enough time to get it out.<br/><br/>Please add what you found wrong with the film but also please type what you liked about it too.

","If you're 13 or thereabouts I'm sure you loved this movie. The young kids in the movie theater I was in thought it was good. If your older (like me) and loved the first movies first time round just deal with the fact that this movie wasn't made with you in mind. It's like the 'new' Star Wars movies. They already have your dollars guaranteed before the movie comes out. They're looking for younger dollars and rightly or wrongly they clearly believe that younger dollars don't want a two hour epic like ALIENS when ALIENS already exists. Get over that and you'll be fine.<br/><br/>I went expecting what I ended up getting; a fun hour and a half. The movie cuts to the chase as quickly as possible, reducing most of the cast to walking cannon fodder but there you go. I personally found it refreshing to have the creatures center stage instead of Ripley or Dutch. The creatures are excellent, as are the fights.<br/><br/>The 'twists' in the plot aren't all that twisty but at an hour and a half they keep you zooming along until the end and like I said before, I'm sure it's twisty enough for the average 13 year old.<br/><br/>Go in knowing that and allow yourself to just enjoy how good it all looks."

","I have to admit, I'm not the biggest Aliens or Predator fan. The Alien movies were good actioners at best, and the first Predator was the only one of the two worth any merit, even if I was laughing the whole time because it featured governors of California and Minnesota. So I didn't come in expecting a great movie. And I didn't get a great movie. But I got a good movie, a movie that is what it is supposed to be: a good action flick.<br/><br/>The plot is about this group of adventurers who find a pyramid buried under Antarctica, or Alaska, or Alabama... I don't know. Doesn't matter. They go there to find a giant hole in the ground leading to the pyramid, a hole that wasn't there the day before. Down at the pyramid they find that it's an ever-changing--okay, so basically, it's a movie about aliens fighting predators. Some cool fight scenes, but it needed more oomph, and there was too much pointless backstory. I kept waiting for the Pepsi-Cola thing to come into play or SOMETHING to happen with that, but apparently the makers just felt like throwing a whole bunch of money around to make a rather expensive set for a backstory that isn't needed. Grr. Right, because we're supposed to feel for the characters... yeeeeeeah....<br/><br/>Anyway, it needed to get to the aliens fighting the predators part quicker, and it needed more action, but sans those it was still a pretty good movie. If you're in the mood, I recommend it."

They send a drilling team to reach the pyramid, and find that it is under an abandoned whaling station. My question is, how the heck is the whaling station so high above sea level or the pyramid so far below it? It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Second, one of the first ""scares"" of the movie has to do with a penguin.

"einTeufel","8","0","0","19 August 2004"," Exactly what I expected
","This movie was super fun, and I totally enjoyed it. I was not expecting the dark mastery of Alien 3, but rather the exciting pace of Aliens/Predator 2. More action than horror. In that regard I was not disappointed. Yes, it was a fluff movie. Yea, it would have been nice to have more character development, but hell the movie is called ""Alien Vs. Predator"", not ""Humanity vs Multiple Bad ass Alien Species."" For human drama, watch the Assembly Cut of Alien 3. Otherwise, this movie was great fun. The fight scenes between the Aliens and the Predator were exciting and ass kicking!<br/><br/>
To be overly critical of the film (complaining about the rating, and just hating it even before it was released) is exactly that, overly critical. This isn't supposed to be some grand thought provoking film. The term ""Popcorn Movie"" springs to mind. And all in all, it was better than Alien Resurrection (seriously, not to beat a dead horse, but who approved the Newborn?)... so...<br/><br/>Clearly, Anderson put some thought into the film in regards to keeping it honerable to the others. The quiet tinging hanging chains that seem to make their way into EVERY Alien film for example to Weyland playing with the pen ala Bishop with the knife. Subtle, but there. <br/><br/>My only complaint was that the incubation period of the Alien was too fast. Less then 10 minutes and the Chestbusrters were coming out! There was a post in the discussion board with a comment from Anderson stating that this was explained in footage that was cut from the theatrical release. Surely this will appear on a ""Unrated"" DVD edition when it becomes available.<br/><br/>See the film for what it is. Not Alien 5, not Predator 3... but a different film all together. One the is true to the science (if indeed the short incubation period is explained) of the other films, but is itself a different film all together!"
"shadwell-1","Null","0","0","18 August 2004"," This film is NOT based on the Aliens or Predator Franchise!
","What really gets me annoyed about the majority of whining that goes on about this film is that most of the reviews have the same two complaints.<br/><br/>1. Its not like the Alien or Predator franchises.<br/><br/>Well there is a reason for that that most of you ""so called"" fans seem to be missing! It isn't based on either of those franchises. It is based on a comic book that was spawned by those two franchises. Anderson does a masterful job of adapting the comic to the screen. I really don't understand why so many people don't like Paul Anderson, with directors like Sam Raimi ruining the Spiderman franchise it is refreshing to see a director who actually cares about the film he is making and tries to make it as faithful to the comics as possible.<br/><br/>2. It's PG-13 so there will be no violence (Insert whining and Crying here)<br/><br/>Using this as an excuse to dislike the film is proof positive that you are not judging the film on it's merits. A good film is lost on the gore crowd that are simply obsessed with watching the Predator rip out countless spinal columns or the Alien punching holes in skulls with its ""Second mouth"". They are never happy unless there is limitless gore and this takes precedence over any amount of quality film making. ""Chronicles of Riddick"" was a PG-13 and it was excellent. Obviously Fox made the decision to make the film PG-13 to make money. That is what Fox and every other studio does. It was not Anderson's fault as Resident Evil was fairly gory and still excellent. I don't find that the lack of gore detracts from the entertainment value of this film at all.<br/><br/>At the end of the day I think a lot of people went into this film looking for something to dislike about it and if you view films using this criteria, inevitably you will find something not to like. If you enjoyed the ""Aliens"" and ""Predator"" franchises then there is definitely something here for you but be warned, this film is not meant to be an ""add-on"" or a sequel to either of those franchises. It does use the creatures from both films but that is where it starts and ends. AvP is an adaptation of a Comic/Video game. In that respect it succeeds and if you watch it with that knowledge I am sure you will thoroughly enjoy it. <br/><br/>8/10"

","After waiting almost ten years for this movie I must say that Paul Anderson must be fed to fire ants. He some how was able to take a movie with such great potential and butcher it into another worthless so called comic book movie. Where in the world did this moron get the good sense to take movies that had all been R rated and drop them to PG-13? Then he decides to take the tired theme of a strong independent female(no offense to all the women out there but this is a tired theme) and reuse it all over again. With so many scripts and comic book stories floating around you would have thought he could of at least used some of the good parts of those. Not only do we not get much action into the film but Anderson had the great idea to kill off two of the three Predators in the first 30 minutes. He then goes and makes the Alien life cycle all of two seconds. What was up with a facehugger appearing, then a drone alien, and then another facehugger to attack one Predator? It seemed as though he ran out of ways to kill the Predator so he went back to his first try. Anderson is an insult to anyone who was a TRUE fan of these series. For the love of Buddha be original. I am begging for John McTiernan to come back and make a GOOD PREDATOR movie PLEASE!!!!!!!"

","I, like many, have been looking forward to a movie that pitted Alien against Predator for quite some time now. And I have to say that I'm fairly disappointed with the result. Having to wait so long and reading the synopsis ahead of time, I didn't go in with high expectations. However, this movie was littered with so many faults that it's difficult to leave the theater satisfied at all. It's as if they took the canon related to both species and threw it out, without consideration. Being a fan of both movies the creatures came from, I did expect the pyramid below the ice to become literally hot inside. Not for the sake of seeing the actors strip, but because that is the environment the Predator hunts in and the Alien lives in (or at least, the climate in which the eggs are kept). I'm not being too ""fan-boy"" here, but I do feel the movie didn't stay true to its sources and fans. Speaking of. Did they forget us, when they chose the script? It seems to me the producers picked the one that would garner the PG-13 rating, because it would attract younger audience members. Most of the people who wanted to see this movie are the fans and the fans are around fourteen years older than they were the first time they creamed themselves at the sight of an Alien's skull on a Predator's ship. The script is written as though the writer had no respect for his audience's intelligence. We're told too much of what we can figure out for ourselves. 'Told' being the operative word. A good writer doesn't tell anything. A good writer shows the audience what's happening. They even failed to do that well. For at least the first half of the first fight between Alien and Predator it's impossible for the audience to see what's going on, due to poor cinematography. The camera's either in way too close, at a terrible angle or jumping around as if the camera-person had both tourettes syndrome and ADD. The following fight scenes aren't much better. While you can see more clearly what's happening, they are too short. Very much like the whole movie. The movie's pacing is too fast, which leads into other problems with logic. Can we say no gestation period? And while I started to like the characters, I just didn't care when they died. There is practically no character development in this movie. Aside from that, the acting was well done and it was fun to see both creatures on the big screen at the same time. As others have put it, it's a very ""popcorn"" movie. And I don't think anyone likes facehuggers in slow-motion."

It wasn't.<br/><br/>A friend remarked that he hoped the DVD release would restore some of the cut violence and make this a better movie. While some blood and guts could really help to restore the horror element, nothing can make up for the horrible dialog and flat acting.<br/><br/>Was it just the cutting of the R-rated material that made the edit so bad? The movie was 87 minutes long but seemed more like 60. Characters who I feel like I'm supposed to care about are dismissed too soon and without any humor, irony, or anything to show that the writers and director have any real creative ability.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were a mixed bag. I admit it was a fanboy's dream to see the two species go at it, and the use of animatronics (as opposed to too much CG) gave the creatures a gritty, slimy edge that computers have yet to capture. I'm not a fan of quick-cut fight scenes and was happy that the camera would occasionally pull back a bit to let me see the monsters pounding the crap out of each other.<br/><br/>I tried to think of how I would have thought of this film if I had never seen an Alien or Predator movie. It was OK. A cut above straight-to-video or a Dolph Lundgren film, but that's about it. But if I were a neophite, I'd be asking so many questions about the creatures that the 87 minutes would be done before I got half of them answered.<br/><br/>A disappointment to a fan, who hopes for some small redemption in the DVD release."

What were these people watching? Name one on-screen kill where a human died. All the on-screen kills were deaths of Aliens or Predators where the MPAA lets go because they think it is unrealistic. In movies where things burst out of chests leaving blood flowing everywhere and where other aliens rip the spine + skull out with their bare hands and skin people alive, this movie should of gotten a R rating. But Paul Anderson and Co. wanted to be money whores and collect from the middle schoolers wallets, so we got BS. Most of the human deaths were unseen and when you did there would just be a claw or two though a body with droplets of blood on them, you call that on-screen kills? See ""Predator"" or ""Aliens"" and then you will see death beyond PG-13. But the worst part of this movie was the starting. For one whole hour we are introduced to a bunch of whiny idiots who we couldn't give a damn about. Come on! We don't care about your kids, just die already! I doubt there is anybody here that is watching this movie that needs or wants a reason for people to visit the pyramid. Just get to the fight scenes already! But when we were finally introduced to the battles they were a doozy. The one-on-one battle between the drone and pred was pretty darn cool (me being a predator fan myself would of liked to see a better outcome but you get what you pay for) *SPOILERS* The two predators who came with the main bad-ass pred were killed off WAY too early. I know that they are teenagers but I doubt that the predator clan would send them down so unexperienced, I mean they only go there every 100 years, they are going to send somebody who knows what they are doing.*END SPOILERS* But all in all I really enjoyed this movie, the ending was great...I was glad something from the game was included in the movie. 7/10"

I just wanted to see if Sanaa Lathan made it out alive. I didn't like the changes made to the Predator's facial features, but what can ya do? What would have made it more interesting? Bring in Sil from the Species franchise. Two macho aliens versus an insatiably horny alien female. As it is, AVP is entertaining only if you are not a hardcore fan. It was better than Van Helsing and all the other crap that's out there. It's time to visit the predator home planet in the next flick, which will happen because Hollywood is stupid. Besides, all this press in the states is just expensive advertisement for overseas audiences and the DVD crowd who will rent this in the next five months.

It was not meant to further the plot of each franchise. He did not set out to do this at all which he made plainly obvious.<br/><br/>Take this movie for what it is worth. The acting is of an acceptable level considering the genre. This movie wasn't meant to win any acting awards. The acting is secondary, it's the predators and aliens themselves that this movie is based on. I can see that he is trying to turn this into a franchise. Not an aliens franchise and not a predator franchise, but a franchise all on it's own. As far as I am concerned, it has succeeded.

"laserdude","Null","0","0","17 August 2004"," But I like Sanaa Lathan
","This is a really tough film for me to review. In terms of the director following any history of these two sci-fi greats, he really butchered the series. Unfortunately this seems to be quite common lately (note how television's Star Trek has gotten so badly bastardized you don't even know what you're looking at). So if he wanted to make a monster versus monster movie, why not get creative and make up his own beasts and leave perfection alone. I guess asking for some real creativity in Hollywood now-a-days is asking for a little too much. I didn't know what creatures these were except they looked like the Alien beings and the Predator beings.<br/><br/>The opening scene with Sanna Lathan answering a cell phone while climbing the side of an ice-n-snow mountain - where is everyone's brain at...in the toilet??? Are you dumb-bells on crack??? Wouldn't an avalanche happen with a phone going off???<br/><br/>But I really do like Sanna Lathan. She can be a serious babe and believe it or not, the girl can act. She probably felt the same way about the script which is why no one has appeared on any talk shows pushing this movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit that some scenes really got me to jump and the tight confines of the pyramid got a little too hairy for me (I'm claustrophobic by nature). So as a basic monster movie it was probably better than Godzilla Vs. Atomic Man. But not by much. You couldn't see half of the fight scenes and the ending where forces are joined seemed really weird.<br/><br/>I take it back. This movie was not that hard to review. The basic look was okay, a scene with the northern lights could have been exploited better (I was making up dialog watching this flick), I liked Ms. Lathan, but the rest blew big time. God I feel like I owe Sanna an apology. And I didn't even have anything to do with this retarded film."

","Predator and Alien by far are the two greatest monsters ever created. They are the two best story lines and realistic creature effects ever in film. Because I am a true fan I am glad I saw the movie, although I was disappointed. <br/><br/>There was way too much time spent on gathering human characters throughout the beginning of the film. I don't mind some character development but let's not overdo it because the cast will be killed anyway. We all know this. The amount of Predator/Alien/human contact was minimalized by this.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed by the storyline. The basics were fine, but I wasn't expecting the Alien, who was a creature only encountered in the future, to have been here on Earth all along. That was just a quick way to throw Predator, Alien and humans all into one pot with very little explanation. The archaeologist was able to discover the entire plot by reading some ancient writing on the wall in about one minute. That's how long it took to develop the story line. 1/2 useless character development (the characters are gone quickly), 1/8 story development & history, and 3/8 explosions and action.<br/><br/>Nowhere did they explain how Predator was able to handle the cold, or any history pertaining to the two other Predator movies. Aliens were something that Ripley was fighting from coming back to Earth, while they were here all along.<br/><br/>If you're a true fan go see it. Give them some money and hopefully they'll actually make another Predator movie. Go for the action scenes because they are great. But don't go for story line because I was left unsatisfied."

","Being a fan of SciFi and an even bigger fan of the Alien movies I have been waiting for years for this movie. I had heard there were 3 big ideas, the aliens come to earth, we go to their home planet or it would be an alien vs predator flick. When I heard which one they decided to go with I wasn't sure if it could be pulled off without being lame. What a treat! (for the most part!) The story line was actually interesting, the creatures looked great, even Bishop came back! Of course, the characters weren't developed very much (can't do too much in an hour and half with all that action I guess??) and some things didn't vibe with the previous movies.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT... there were a few minor things I personally had a problem with... the 'face-grabber to alien out of the belly' action seemed to go very quickly! I remember in the previous movies the face- grabbers being attached for days and after it fell off the infected host would be OK for more than 2-6 minutes.<br/><br/>How on earth did the predators NOT scan the predator they took on board? Deff. not enough was done with the predator's cool effects and armor either.<br/><br/>Momma alien going after the human when she basically had killed the last predator, hmmm.. if you were held captive for hundreds/thousands of years, don't you think she would have killed her captor before going after the silly human? Also, what kept the aliens from releasing the mother before? <br/><br/>Just a complaint, enough with the action sequences being filmed in super-close-up and very dark frames switching back and forth between 'who can tell, I think that was the alien' and 'what was that, it was too dark'? The fighting sequences would have been much more enjoyable from a farther distance. And it needed more gore!

","I, like many, have been looking forward to a movie that pitted Alien against Predator for quite some time now. And I have to say that I'm fairly disappointed with the result. Having to wait so long and reading the synopsis ahead of time, I didn't go in with high expectations. However, this movie was littered with so many faults that it's difficult to leave the theater satisfied at all. It's as if they took the canon related to both species and threw it out, without consideration. Being a fan of both movies the creatures came from, I did expect the pyramid below the ice to become literally hot inside. Not for the sake of seeing the actors strip, but because that is the environment the Predator hunts in and the Alien lives in. I'm not being tot ""fan-boy"" here, but I do feel the movie didn't stay true to its sources and fans. Speaking of. Did they forget us, when they chose the script? It seems to me the producers picked the one that would garner the PG-13 rating, because it would attract younger audience members. Most of the people who wanted to see this movies are the fans and the fans are around fourteen years older than they were the first time they creamed themselves at the sight of an Alien's skull on a Predator's ship. The script is written as though the writer had no respect for his audience's intelligence. We're told too much of what we can figure out for ourselves. 'Told' being the operative word. A good writer doesn't tell anything. A good writer shows the audience what's happening. They even failed to do that well. For at least the first half of the first fight between Alien and Predator it's impossible for the audience to see what's going on, due to poor cinematography. The camera's either in way too close, at a terrible angle or jumping around as if the camera person had both tourettes syndrome and ADD. The following fight scenes aren't much better. While you can see more clearly what's happening, they are too short. Very much like the whole movie. The movie's pacing is too fast, which leads into other problems with logic. Can we say no gestation period? And while I started to like the characters, I just didn't care when they died. There is practically no character development in this movie. Aside from that, the acting was well done and it was fun to see both creatures on the big screen. As others have put it, a very ""popcorn"" movie. And I don't think anyone likes facehuggers in slow-motion."

It has neither the same nail-biting suspense nor the believable characters that the original movies had. The whole idea of Aliens has been turned into a Hollywood joke. Not only is this movie not at all scary, it's scarcely exciting. There are no new developments on the original idea of Aliens and the plot is easily predictable. The monsters in this movie are children in clown suits compared to those that first terrified us and glued us to our seats. One could go through a thousand reasons why this movie is so disappointing compared to the original Alien movies but the lack of good directors is a major factor.

","I will say this about the film: Although the story had a few holes and took a little while to develop, this film was one of the most enjoyable I've seen in some time.<br/><br/>Granted, there are a few gripes to be had for this movie, however, none of you who saw it can say you went strictly for the acting and the good, solid writing. You went to see two of the most recognizable movie monsters duke it out in one of the best blockbuster melees that has ever been offered to the public.<br/><br/>There were times when several characters who were introduced were quickly killed off without much (or any) development. And for the first third or so, the film shuffled its feet, but quickly got up to speed shortly thereafter. Also, there are a few parts where even the saltiest of monster movie vets (If you've seen the film, you know which part I'm talking about) think it's a taste far-fetched. But, come on, People! Its titled after two monsters that fight! And fight they do.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty solid, I can't complain much. Sanaa Lathan did a good job as the heroine, and Lance Henriksen was a familiar face (and name) that the veterans of the originals gladly welcomed. Also, the directing was just okay. It was acceptable, but little more than that. As for the writing, I was impressed. I expected two hours of cheesy, tacked-on dialogue, but it all flowed naturally.<br/><br/>In closing, if you are (or were) willing to pay the fee to get in the movie, you won't be disappointed. But, if you weren't willing to go see it, then you probably won't have a very good time. It's a silly movie, but it's a very fun and entertaining way to spend an evening.

The main predator's victory over his first alien was cool but a little too quick for me, and i thought the human-predator alliance was a little too sudden...i think they should've went their separate ways at first and then met up again later...but again, there just wasn't enough time for any of these ideas. The movie desperately needed another 30 minutes at least to do what needed to be done. Hell, i would've had 5 predators, at least one more battle like that first face off, and maybe a battle with two predators against several aliens.

","Every once in a while we tumble to the notion that a hot new movie, usually of the action genre, might be entertaining. And invariably something like 'Alien Vs. Predator' is the subject, making us wish we had washed the car, returned a few calls or read a magazine.<br/><br/>Certainly fans of the original 'Alien' and even more so 'Predator' hold hope there might be even better yet to come. That has not been the case, and the experience of viewing AVP will not impel anyone to check on subsequent releases, the ending notwithstanding.<br/><br/>The movie opens well, hooking us early with a few techno-moves, some potentially interesting characters and even a touch of curiosity about where this might lead. But within ten minutes, maybe fifteen minutes (no watch to check, but more about that later) we are hopelessly mired in the darkest, murkiest series of flashes and noises since 'Hellboy'. <br/><br/>The best effects are actually shown early in the film. After the expedition has begun the adventure we see a flyover by the alien ship, a great bolt of energy discharged from space (with a purpose we discover within a few minutes) and a nice twist in a mountain-climbing scene. The flash and crash of the remaining hour or so is a patent bore.<br/><br/>An interview with director Paul W. S. Anderson about this latest film reveals the following unintelligible exchange:<br/><br/>Question: The first Alien was really horror oriented and the subsequent ones were more in the action/adventure area. What are you trying to do with this one? <br/><br/>Paul: It's really a combination and it's not because of ALIEN, it's because of PREDATOR, which is more action-oriented. This movie has a slow build, which is more akin to ALIEN, but then the last 45 minutes is a pretty relentless action ride which has much more to do with ALIENS or PREDATOR.<br/><br/>Sanaa Lathan as guide Alexa Woods is the most watchable of the cast, although veteran Lance Henriksen as expedition financier is a steady (not over the top at all: how he expresses his appreciation to the exploration team is nicely phrased). Lathan, at 33 and with a number of films behind her (the recent Denzel Washington actioner 'Out Of Time' (2003), in the successful 'Brown Sugar' (2002), a small role in the very popular 'Love and Basketball' in 2000) certainly deserved the lead. <br/><br/>There are a number of questionable moments to amuse us and solidify AVP as a potential MST3000 candidate. We may note Ms. Lathan standing in mall-cruising grade clothing in the Antarctic, the use of flares as light sources (Why not candles or oil-soaked torches? Because they don't pop and frighten anyone.) and the simple fact there is never a good scare in the entire film. A 14% rating on the Tomatometer, by the way, gives us some appreciation for the overall quality of AVP.<br/><br/>More than ever we regretted the recent loss of our big ticket high-tech Timex Indiglo watch. The glow would not have been noticed; cell phones and pagers were checked frequently by the backup Space Shuttle pilots, on-call neurosurgeons and Fortune 500 CEOs that populated the audience.<br/><br/>Rating: 2 Stars."

What made Alien and Predator so interesting was the way in which they were told on film by directors. Scott made us scream even when nothing happened, but we expected something to happen. Cameron created an all out battle ground, but managed to remain close to the characters and allow for development. As for Predator (1), no one knew when it would show up, what it was, until the end. These were fright effects, movies based upon some sort of Alien stalking it's prey. However, they lived off of their suspense, and of course, the characters. All elements Aliens Vs Predator lacks in every aspect. Fox certainly managed to kill off two of their best characters here, too bad actually.

Though Lewis was the laughs and Martin was the straight guy, the two worked in harmony and were never better than when teamed together. <br/><br/>But a funny thing started happening in Hollywood in the new millennium. People started accepting opposites teamed together to fight against a common cause. Blade II had our title character teaming up with the same vampires that so craved his demise and in X-Men 2, our heroes joined forces with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants as they fought an ever-growing threat to their existence. (*Please don't e-mail me to belabor the point that films such as Frankenstein vs. The Wolfman have been around before color film was even created). <br/><br/>With audiences launching these new duos into number one weekend box office stature, it was no surprise to see two baddies in Freddy and Jason do battle in 2003. With a $100 million in box office bonanza and the opening of the door to other potential bad vs. badder films I thought it wouldn't be long before we saw Godzilla vs. King Kong, Critters vs. Gremlins or Bigfoot vs. Jaws (granted, I will agree that the logistics behind getting a land creature and a water dweller to stand battle are remote, but one can dare to dream). <br/><br/>But maybe the easiest to team in the present future were the Predator and Alien from their respective titled films. These two creatures had already fought in their own comic book series, did battle in trading cards, and threatened to wreak havoc on the world in a video game. Their progression to a duel on the big screen was therefore inevitable. <br/><br/>For those of you who may require an Extra-Terrestrial Reminder 101 course, Predator is the same creature that had the two Governors (Schwarzenegger of California and Ventura of Minnesota) do battle with the beast with dental issues in 1987. He has brute strength, the ability to become invisible and an arsenal of weaponry that can slice, dice and skin someone quicker than any of the late night infomercial giveaways. Mr. Predator has appeared on our planet twice, once thwarted by Arnold and another by Danny Glover in the 1990 sequel. <br/><br/>Alien has had a better string of sequential life. Well known directors such as Ridley Scott, James Cameron and David Fincher have all collaborated in bringing Sigourney Weaver's nightmare to the screen no less than four times.<br/><br/>The Aliens are a fast multiplying populous that use humans as hosts for their breeding. They have a razor sharp teeth and a jaw that jettisons like a cobra towards their intended prey. Their blood is a form of acid and their hunt is usually carried out in packs. The world has been lucky to avert bringing these creatures to our earth. Lucky that is, until now.<br/><br/>Alien vs. Predator is an interesting film concept for many reasons. Maybe most interesting is that the two title colliders don't speak -which can be both a blessing and a curse with these kinds of films. In order to try and explain the plot and to add some kind of pleasurable facials to the screen, director Paul W.S. Anderson constructed a story that included humans intertwined with the blood feud between these two species (to be true, the comic book stories had humans as go-betweens as well). As outlined, an archaeological expedition in the Antarctica reveals a pyramid that might date back eons before that of those in Egypt. As the team of explorers, led by moneybags Charles 'Bishop' Weyland (Lance Henricksen), enter the fortress, they soon find themselves between three young Predators that have come to the temple as a sort of training exercise to earn their right to Predatorhood (?). It's kind of like when Luke Skywalker went to Dagobah to be trained by Yoda, 'cept in this instance, there isn't a cute green puppet who talks like Kermit on helium. Instead, we have creatures that fight to the death, rip each other apart and although they don't have facial expressions, we get the immediate impression that these two species really don't like each other.<br/><br/>The second interesting detail in the film is like the Freddy and Jason clash, audiences will be split in who they root for. This isn't as clean cut as say Spider-Man vs. Doctor Octopus. Legions of fans have followed the career paths of both alien creatures and alliances have been formed. Although my audience tended to vouch more for Predator than Alien, I figured that it is probably a 50-50 split down the middle if Angus Reid ever decided to waste more of our country's time. <br/><br/>So now comes the easy part, the review. Alien vs. Predator, for all it's history, back story and the length of time it has taken to get these two faves in front of a mass audience, fails on so many levels. To critique everything that is wrong with the film would take much more of your (and my) time than should be licensed, so I'll just try and hit on the major pitfalls.<br/><br/>First was the violence factor. Movie aficionados can correct me if I am wrong, but the Alien and Predator franchises always carried the R-rating due to their excessive violence and bloodletting. 20th Century Fox, I suppose, has tried so hard to get a wider audience into the de-clenching of wallets and purses everywhere, that the film has forgone the way of the thrill and the spill and instead left us with a lot of jumping, running, yelling and off screen violence (I guess creatures killing creatures is less of a issue for the MPAA than having humans as the major dietary choice).<br/><br/>Secondly, I have to say that for the dialogue that the humans do get to orate, they do so with humorous results, and this is not intended as a good thing. Where their predecessors had such cool lines as 'I ain't got time to bleed' and 'Stay away from her you BITCH!', AVP offers 'You're one ugly motherf****r'. Yawn. <br/><br/>I was conflicted when thinking of how to evaluate the performance of the human actors in AVP. Although pivotal to the story they were not really developed. They help us understand the situation, (ex. 1,000 miles from help on the most isolated place on earth) but when one of the crew happens to read a few wall scribbles and utters 'This is all starting to make sense', I wondered how could anyone in their right mind be able to put these pieces together so quickly. That said, the humans are primarily a food or carnage source, so maybe I should take it easier on them.<br/><br/>Where I can take pot shots is with director Paul W.S. Anderson. Responsible for also the story and screenplay, Anderson just doesn't seem to be the right person to helm such an anticipated franchise, and maybe his lack of experience is exactly why almost every scene in the movie I thought was a rip off from another. The recruitment scenes reminded me of Sphere, the setting reminded me of John Carpenter's The Thing and the ending reminded me of every horror film ever made that wants to spin off to another sequel. Although I have no doubts that Anderson probably loved both these characters, I think he tried to tread too much water and keep the comic book people happy and the respective fans of both aliens. This, therefore he didn't allow for a lot of wiggle room in terms of story and Anderson doesn't go out on a limb and favor one species over another. Too bad. <br/><br/>But it was maybe the camera work that was the most disappointing (that and the fact they are in the Antarctica and no one seems cold nor has breath that is visible due to the temperature). The shots are all jumpy and the scenes of the two creatures doing battle is so quickly edited that I had a hard time figuring out who was on top of whom. You would think that with all the money they saved by having nary a familiar face in the cast (Lance, notwithstanding), that they could have used their budget to give us a battle scene that we would remember rather than one hard to follow.<br/><br/>So now that it is said and done, I am thankful that I don't have to read on movie message boards everywhere that this movie was in some sort of a development phase. However, now that it is completed, I do question how much development actually went into the film and it's final result."
"slave2","Null","0","0","16 August 2004"," Paul Anderson gives us an exceedingly disappointing film.
","Alien Versus Predator is perhaps the worst science-fiction film I have seen this year. The fact that Anderson (director, writer) had such intriguing franchises from which to draw inspiration, coupled with my lofty expectations of his abilities given his successful turn as director of Resident Evil, make the film all the more disappointing.<br/><br/>First of all, both the Alien and Predator franchises are dependent on their restricted ratings in order to provide the visceral horror intrinsic in the respective villains actions. To release a combination of these franchises as PG-13 compromises their very nature, turning them from horror to pablum. Perhaps even this betrayal may have been ignored had there been at least one interesting moment in the film itself. Instead we are left to squirm uncomfortably in our $13 seats as we attempt to find a link of common interest between ourselves and a thoroughly improbable team of 'experts' who are at once cartoonishly knowledgeable about there specific field, and utterly banal. In addition to this, as mentioned in another commentary on this film, the action direction is pathetic. If you are going to insult audiences with a franchise destroying plot and Steven Segal caliber dialogue at the very least don't mangle the fight sequences, which is presumably the main focus of the film. I mean it is a 'versus' movie, right? There are some points at which I may as well have been watching a puppet show at a rock concert. In short, Mr. Anderson has dropped the ball. They should have got Cameron."

","From the first time I heard about this movie, I was wondering how the director would make it. I thought that he should've consulted both Ridley Scott and John McTiernan on how they put together their first films with respect to each creature, otherwise, it was as good as any other sci-fi horror thriller/adventure. The parts that intrigued me were the story behind why the Predators came back to Earth and hunted and how the characters got caught up in-between the two warring giants. This wasn't exactly an epic battle, though I agree with those that say there should've been more scenes and that the fights between the Aliens and the Predators could've been more in-depth. I was disappointed to see that of the three Predators sent down to the pyramid, that two of them got it right away upon entering into the pyramid, though this could be explained by the unblooded younglings' inexperience with their true prey, the Alien. Other aspects of the movie which were interesting to note was a scene in which the surviving Predator takes off its mask and is notably different from the Predators of previous films in that its eyes and mandibles were not quite what I remembered, otherwise, they were just as gnarly and kick-ass as their enemy the Alien, which was also expertly portrayed by the team that worked on them. The Alien for its part was all the more scarier in part because one never knew exactly when or where there would be a fight between the two warring factions, but it was somewhat predictable in the same light when humans were introduced into the fray. I rooted for the Predators because I like their history and where they come from, but respected the Aliens because of their cunning and ability to be unwittingly intelligent as one scene proved with an invisible unblooded Predator being speared from behind during its hunt of humans. I would recommend only seeing this movie if you are going to see it for what it portrays...a battle between Alien and Predator. It is true that while the humans in the movie are merely sideliners for the two warring factions, they seem to have a bigger role than that allowed or hinted at in the trailers. <br/><br/>I would recommend that for a second film, that all heads come together on how best to clean up a lot of the indescrepancies that seem to have made their appearance in this film, and also that this feature should be a 2 and 1/2 hour rated-R film with more time to develop a few meaningful characters, some with nothing to lose, and a whole bunch of Predators and Aliens duking it out well before the humans become involved. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie an 8 because it doesn't deserve half the bad rap it gets and kudos to someone who actually paid attention and stayed true or attempted to, to the franchises of both films. The first thing that we should see in a sequel is the A's and P's duking it out long before there are unwitting humans who arrive, who then receive the ultimate meaning of losing in a war that's not theirs to begin with. <br/><br/>However, with a disappeared queen under hundreds of feet of ice water, a newly hatched breed of Predalien aboard the Predator ship, and a blooded human female who has ""some"" understanding of what she's received, I wonder what Fox will do with these three loose ends."

I think that it was a very good movie, I can't wait to go see it again. <br/><br/>I mean, what did you think it was going to be about? What did you think it was going to be like? It was based off of two cult classics, a series of movies, comic books and games that have practically paved the way for sci-fi films. Did you think it was going to be comparable to those great movies? Heavens, if you KNEW anything about the movies, you would know that neither directors of The Aliens series or the Predator series had NOTHING to do with this movie. <br/><br/>It certainly wasn't an Oscar-winner. I wasn't expecting that. I went into that movie thinking to see some really good action, something that was gritty and had no plot. Because it has a HUGE PLOT ALREADY.

I know squat about the predators but I could tell you a thing or two about the aliens.

","I'm not going to give anything away, but if you're fan of either series, then I really don't need to. You can pretty much guess whats going to happen. That then is the film's biggest draw and it's biggest downfall, we all go to see Anderson's movie in hopes that it has all the moments we loved in Predator and the Aliens films. Then we walk away disappointed because it had all the same stuff from the predator and Aliens films..rehashed.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson does a pretty good job of combining the two series together, the story, while not entirely original, does hold up pretty well. The action sequences are cool to behold, the aliens look scary, the predators look badass. If anything about the story is wrong, its that it feels a tad too short and a bit rushed at times. The PG-13 rating certainly cuts back some of the gore I think we all wanted to see, hopefully a director's unrated cut will come out on DVD. <br/><br/>If you go into this flick expecting to see something akin to James Cameron or Ridley Scott's masterpieces then you'll be disappointed. If you go in expecting a good summer popcorn flick with lots of mindless scary action then you'll have a good time. If it makes you feel better Anderson does a much better job with this than he did with Resident Evil."

","Perhaps the best word to describe this movie is ""competent"".  It isn't bad. It isn't terribly good, either, but it isn't bad.<br/><br/>The first act is perhaps the weakest, and is filled with scenes that feel as though they are the Coles Notes of longer scenes.  Once the main characters reach the pyramid, however, and the second act begins, the movie stops being choppy and flows very well.<br/><br/>The story is fairly well thought out, and areas where I expected a plot hole (such as where the aliens come from, anyway) didn't have one.  The scenes in the pyramid are suspenseful to a degree, and each moment flows logically toward the next.<br/><br/>Perhaps the thing that keeps the movie from standing up proud with the other Alien movies is the distinct lack of depth compared to every other entry in the series.  Far too many characters aren't fully developed, and only one of the two that are actually spends time dealing with anything.  This makes the movie an interesting diversion, popcorn if you will, but nothing more.<br/><br/>At least it is entertaining popcorn."

I believe that this movie should be given higher regard than I have been reading, it was well written and shot. I think that they could have made the action and deaths a little more intense but it was exactly as I expected they would do. I was even more impressed to find that this was the same director as Resident Evil, which was also a very good game movie.

","I'm not going to give a detailed description of the movie because i know many of these will follow. I just wanted to share my thoughts. For those of your out there like myself that loved the first movies from the Aliens and Predator series you may have trouble with this film. I was a fan when i was like 10-13 and collected all the action figures, etc. When i heard this film was actually being made i couldn't wait. The moment the book came out for it I was at the local Waldenbooks and reading it before i left the store. The story is pretty good, the movie version however lacks a few things that could have made it great. First of all they never really flesh out the human characters. There is no point where I felt like i actually cared about what happened to them. Not like in the old movies where Ripley and Dutch would kick butt for two hours and by the end I was rooting for them. However, this is more than made up for with some sweet battles. Watching these two icons of film go head to head was amazing. The battles between the Aliens and Predators really shows off their skills and brutal tactics. If your simply looking for a good time then this movie will definitely deliver. But if your looking for something that will have some depth them you might want to look elsewhere."

","This is one of those movies that gets worse the more that I think about it, so the trick is not to think about it. I gave it a 5/10 because while it kept me entertained (for the most part) there was some really stupid stuff in it; and I was laughing (along with the audience) at stuff we weren't supposed to be laughing at. I don't think anyone kept a straight face when the lady uses the Aliens head as a shield (!) or the explanation of how the Predators brought civilization to the world. One could go on for days about the inaccuracies and pure ludicrousness of such a premise, but it would be largely a waste of time (in one regard though I think the movie is asking for it since this historical premise is integral to the ""plot"", well what there is of a plot). <br/><br/>I can't believe how many ""10s"" this movie got either. People on this site are so easy to please, if they like it, it most likely gets a 10 and if they don't it gets a ""1"". This movie is nothing special and a far cry from Alien, Aliens, and the first Predator. The original Alien is such an original film and a touchstone for the Sci-Fi genre, in a way its kind of pathetic to see it come to this. On the other hand I liked AVP (as the cool people call it) better then the disappoint Alien3, the totally unnecessary Resurrection, and the largely forgettable Predator 2 (except I remember the Sega game cause it was really really hard). As mindless entertainment its fairly decent and this will be good for drunk college kids to see. With its anemically short run-time and now standard action and CGI it will largely be a forgotten film and to be rented much less frequently then Alien 1 and 2. If you are fans of the series I'd recommend seeing it, but with low expectations. If you think for a second this will be as good as Aliens then you are sorely mistaken. <br/><br/>Zoopansick"

","Kind of disappointing. I'm not sorry I saw it, but it wasn't the movie that 14 years of waiting should have built up to. The commercials made it look like it was going to be pretty large scale, but those scenes are part of a flashback. The actual confrontation was more of a whimper than a bang. This really should have taken place in the future, like the Aliens vs Predator novels written in the mid-90's. Those weren't masterpieces, but at least they understood why we wanted this meeting to happen in the first place: to see lots of fights between the two species (and could someone PLEASE make a movie in which they are given unique, definitive NAMES?! It would be so much easier to talk about them without saying ""the aliens from Alien"", or using the generic term ""Xenomorph"", which is only known to hardcore fans (so one is usually forced to define it as ""the aliens from Alien"")).<br/><br/>Lots of minor nitpicks too. Why would the sled that lowers equipment into an ice tunnel have an emergency return that goes 300 miles an hour? Since when is the Alien life cycle 20 minutes from facehugger to adult? Don't Predators like hot weather? So why would they still visit Antarctica now that it's a frozen wasteland? Were there enough people left alive to spawn as many Aliens as we saw? We watched at least five of the things get killed, and see at least five more of them in a group later. If the Aztec calendar was metric, why does something happen every 10 minutes? MINUTES ARE NOT A METRIC TIMEKEEPING MEASURE! That's like saying something is metric if it uses 10 feet or 10 pounds as a benchmark.<br/><br/>Freddy vs Jason may not have been an earth-shaking confrontation, but as far as long awaited meetings between vaguely similar movie franchises go, it was a lot more satisfying than this."

The storyline holds true to all of the previous movies, and the plot holds water (on it's own) The FX -- as noted don't make me feel like I've just paid money to watch someone else's video game. Some people feel that the more blood makes for a better movie. Well, buckets of blood were used in many other movies (such as ""House of the Dead""); that doesn't make it a good movie. In AVP the director did an assume job, the cinematography was great. After watching a special (on HBO) about the making of AVP, I was expecting the miniatures to be obvious, with bad FX. This was not the case -- I couldn't tell the miniatures from life-size. The actors did a great job. But remember: This movie isn't just about humans: It is about Aliens vs. Predators. And they were all in character. Remember ""City Slickers""? Did you go to watch it just for the Cattle? When you watch this movie, pay attention as in ""Aliens"" (and Alien Resurrection) -- the Aliens had and use intelligence and abilities. From the movie ""Predator 2"", the Predators recognize and honor the true warrior.<br/><br/>In my opinion, there was one minor flaw in the writing of the movie -- in the story line dealing with the time line and the town where this took place. Perhaps the extended edition would answer this.<br/><br/>Final Recommendation:<br/><br/>If you have an IQ, watch this movie. If you enjoy action, or any of the movies: Alien, Aliens, {cough cough} Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, Predator, Predator 2, watch this movie. If you enjoy great Sci-Fi, watch this movie.

I guess what most of us find disappointing now that the movie is out, some of us find (as a famous Vulcan observed): having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting. We knew what we wanted, but we didn't get it. Nor can we agree on what it would have been.<br/><br/>As countless others have documented, this movie has plenty of holes. Some of them may be in the heads of the writer and director, but I digress. The pace is almost too quick, and continuity an afterthought, as though the director's cut had been slimmed down at Fox's behest for the (pre)teen crowd. Not unlike watching the original Predator on TNT in some ways. At any rate, the battle scenes and weaponry are definitely up to date, if a bit CGI-heavy. <br/><br/>I suppose we can put down the lack of grace and skill in the Predators to their adolescence, just as we can assume the presence of high-tech human firepower has something to do with the Weyland Corporation always having something else up its sleeve. The human characterizations are supplemental at best, but short of uncovering an alien Rosetta stone, I guess they had to move things along somehow. The alien incubation period is a fatal flaw, or perhaps the queen's metabolism was tampered with; so much is left unexplained. What little suspense there is, is incidental: regrettably, that's one of the things that made most of the preceding films worth watching. If director Anderson thinks he's being true to the creatures' legacy, then he's been breathing too much Yautja air mixture.<br/><br/>In short, see it for the roller coaster effect, and not for the storytelling, which is largely absent, but don't see it at full price if you can help it. I saw it, and liked it, but the true test is whether I would go right back in and see it again. In short: no. Perhaps the DVD will be worth a look, if only to find out what was deemed too strong for the children, of which there seem to be a number running loose on this board :)"

","I have to give credit to paul s. because he seems to be a big video game freak. his other movies like mortal kombat and Resident evil have very much a video game feel to them, and so does alien vs predator. Just like in the game we have super strong aliens that are born within a matter or minutes, and likewise predators that have certain visions that see aliens. However, unlike the game and comics, the humans seemed to be nothing more than just cattle in this. <br/><br/>CAUSION SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>The predators didn't seem to be much of hunters without the shoulder cannons, i mean slamming that alien around was still cool but did little damage at all if any. Everyone in this movie gets wasted within like 10 min, including 2 of the 3 predators. I really like how the preds and aliens matched up, it's about the way i figured amateur predators to fight aliens with killer instincts. I was a fan of the alien films before i discovered the predator so i kinda knew that the aliens were going to be big trouble i just expected a little more effort and less carelessness on the predators side. all in all this movie was jammed pack full of action and it was still suitable for the nonfan with a bit of ""tasteful gore"". however, i'm left wanting cameron to come and do a great sequel. paul u did well but... i think cameron could do it better. 3 out of 5 stars worthy of ticket price : D some good suspense, lots o death lol"

","Wow I just saw AVP and i have to say it was awesome. It took what we loved about predator and aliens and combined them into one great action-packed movie. First off The aliens and predators have never ever looked better and the face-huggers jumping in slow-mo WOW! I am normally not that enthusiastic about slow mo but in this movie it was used very wisely. AVP also has some really cool references to the other films and it has a lot of stuff You will recognize from the other films (keep in mind this is a prequel). Those of you who have seen this and thought it was just OK (YOU know who you are) you either haven't seen the other movies or enjoy CRAP like XXX and Hidalgo. If you didn't like it at all then well you know what you can do. Anyway o yeah one down point well 2 actually not many of the human characters are cool and some parts in it have some lightly bad acting. But any way it is preety much what I hoped for and a very good summer movie. <br/><br/>My grade:A- yeah"
"suriyawong","Null","0","0","15 August 2004"," Review...
","So I just got back from from seeing AVP. I have to admit up front that I am a fan of the Alien vs. Predator comic books by Darkhorse Comics. Thus I am partially biased in my opinions.<br/><br/>First off, the director did a somewhat good job with the pacing of the movie. I was rather pleased with how evenly dispersed it was. Kind of reminiscent of the original Alien movies. The action sequences were fairly short, and as noted previously rather murky and jumpy. Overall though the director did a good job with what he had.<br/><br/>My main problem arose from the script. FIrst of all I liked the whole premise of where it took place. I like the back story as to why it is there, and what it really is. Those were the things that I liked. On to the things that I disliked. I disliked how the Predators appeared to be weak. I understand that they are new to the hunt and all of that, but Predators have hunted before. Especially as old as those were. They have hunted but never gained the mark of the hunter. Basically you hunt aliens if you are going big game hunting. They hunt humans etc. much the same way that we hunt squirrel. Anyway, I did not like how weak, or how few predators there were.<br/><br/>It was wild how few there were, and they tried to write it into the story as to why there were only three. When I first heard Alien vs. Predator, I naturally assumed it would be an all out major war. I was wrong. So as far as the script goes I was unhappy.<br/><br/>************Spoilers Ahead***************<br/><br/>So I figured I might as well add another thing that I truly enjoyed. I enjoyed how someone on the set knew something about the comics. The predators followed certain rules, the rules of the hunt. This explains why the Predator doesn't kill Weyland. The Predator saw that Weyland had a heart pump. That means he is a weakened prey. Therefore it is not honorable to kill him. So he didn't. Then the predator was attacked by Weyland, and the rules shifted. Weyland was now prey that could be taken. Even though he killed Weyland the predator did not take the trophy because he would be violating the rules of the hunt. He exposed himself to a weakened prey and the prey attacked. Dishonorable to take a trophy. Kinda cool."

","Alien Vs. Predator (8/10) stars Sanaa Lathan, Lance Henriksen, and an assortment of others. The film plays out like this: heat is detected in Antartica by a satellite and a team goes to investigate. They uncover a temple that is 2000 miles or feet or whatever beneath the ice. The temple has characteristics of several different cultures including: Egyptians, Aztecs, and Cambodians. I forget the rest. Anywho, the team first encounters a creature we know as Predator. Then, they later run into Alien. Then Alien and Predator meet and all Hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>First of all, the suspense is really thrown at you when the temple begins to shift around. I was like: ""OH MY GAWDD!!!! HE'S GONNA GET CRUSHED! HE'S GONNA DIEEE!!"" Yes, folks, I'm one of those people. I also liked the historical things featured in this movie. In my World History class at school, we are studying the first civilizations. So far, we've only talked about Egypt, Sumeria, and... you don't care. Then, there's the action. The action is glorious. The fighting is intense.<br/><br/>Then something happens that I don't quite agree with, but it didn't bother me that much. The humans unite with one of the monsters. Judging by the nature of the creatures in their own movies, you can pretty much know which one would side with them. <br/><br/>I liked this movie sooooo much better than Freddy Vs. Jason because it steered away from language, nudity, and cheesy dialogue. (There are some pretty lame lines in this movie, but there's only like... four, whereas, in Freddy Vs. Jason there's about 3924823904 ridiculous lines.)<br/><br/>The only things this movie really has in common with Freddy Vs. Jason is: two infamous horror legends go at it in a battle royale, and the ending. Freddy Vs. Jason 2 is being discussed and I imagine that AVP 2 will be at some time in the next ten years. (If you know how FVJ ends, just replace Freddy and Jason with Alien and Predator and you've got it. Minus the winking of the decapitated head's eye.) <br/><br/>I look forward to the next Versus movie. I wonder what it will be... Robocop Vs. Terminator? Batman Vs. Superman? Pokemon Vs. Digimon? I suppose we'll just have to wait."

What's even worse is that they run down the hall like Batman and Robin?!? And of course the movie pretty much went downhill from there. From the woman not having a visible scratch on her body to the part where the woman and the Predator have a touching moment towards the end.<br/><br/>This sure wasn't the movie I was hoping for and I think that the franchise was killed right then and there."

","***Possible SPOILERS below***<br/><br/>Is it just me, or was the alien blood very selective about what it burned in the film. A little bit of face hugger blood in the first 'Alien' burnt through several decks. This new blood must be very diluted. ;)<br/><br/>The first time a Predator sliced an Alien with his claws, they melted... cool. But then the main Predator sliced through an Alien's head with his disc and nothing happened (in fact, the alien doesn't even bleed). Then Alexa impales one with her makeshift spear (I believe the tip is an alien tail, so no biggie there), and neither the staff nor her were ever burnt. It also looked like a bloodless kill. And wouldn't an alien head be full of blood and stuff (Alexa uses one as a shield). Did they sit there for a long time draining the thing? Oh that's right, Alien heads don't have blood at all (according to the disc scene).<br/><br/>It's almost as if they paid homage to the acid a few times, but essentially ignored it. Thoughts?"
"shawnk","7","0","0","17 August 2004"," Worth seeing but plot has some holes : Spoilers ahead
","I love movies like this. A semi-classic monster movie. Unlike the 1950's, however, we expect a plot with some sense of coherence (if not down right realism). This plot had a few 'weak points'.<br/><br/>1. Alien gestation period. In this movie - 1 to 4 hours gives you a baby monster. Seems a little fast. The original Alien movie gestation period is believable. Not the 'insta-snake' one in this movie.<br/><br/>2. Alien growth cycle. In this movie - 1-2 hours grows a small snake-like creature to a one ton beast. Not even Rosy O' can put on mass like that (although some black holes can come close).<br/><br/>3. Brain capacity of average human character. In this movie - pea-brain, pin-head and vegetable come to mind. Characters find three alien weapons in begining of movie but never try to use them as they quickly die off. Since most characters are PHD level scientists they must be that gun-hating portion of academia which should be stated in the movie. That way we can know that they really are idiots who, when holding an alien gun and being attacked by alien monsters DO NOT try to pull the trigger and just blast the damn thing. I've seen seven year olds in game arcades with more brains than these guys.<br/><br/>There are other holes but the above is the top three.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely worth seeing if you like monster movies. Just expect a script that was written by kids or with someone with a pretty low IQ."

","This is a pure ""popcorn movie"" meaning it's brainless. Don't expect elaborate plots or mind-boggling ideas. This is truly Aliens fighting Predators with some people caught in the middle - just like the preview shows. Nothing more. Maybe something less as the story goes really absurd by the time things are ""explained"" by the end. And the main lead, Alexa (played by Lathan) is no Ripley, although the director tries so hard to make her so. Overall I'd say it's worth a matinee price for a goofy movie. I did enjoy seeing the Aliens and Predators so well done via special effects. I don't think it particularly provided much insight into the world of these characters, and I would say it would even detract from it since it made such little sense."

With the comic books and the video games, there was already a fan base craving this movie, and then the studio hires Anderson, and he turns it into a teenybopper PG movie. Sacrilege. The movie had a horrible plot, bad cinematography, and several plot inconsistencies. Id go into them, but I only have 1000 words so I have to keep this brief. The only good part of this movie was the costumes and creatures. The aliens looked the best I've ever seen them, and I cant stop raving about the predators. They look fantastic. Huge, hulking, and intimidating. Just like a predator should. But thats the ONLY thing this movie has going for it. Definitely a renter. Or better yet, pirate this movie.

","I really wanted this movie to be good. But it wasn't. I am trying to put my finger on what is bothering me. I think the movie looks like young kids developed the plot. Flashy looking, but if given any deeper thought than ""that's pretty"" It falls apart. <br/><br/>I want to relate this to something completely different in hopes that the 30 and over crowd may relate. I went to a teeny bopper concert a couple of years ago, and the people in the audience had a mosh pit. I was horrified. that concept had been bastardized so heavily, that people didn't even know what kind of music it went with. <br/><br/>Okay, now that I have completely digressed, I will get back to AVP. I felt similar disgust to the lack of suspense, or character development in the movie. They have all the gore and the chest bursting of the original Alien, but you just don't care, because the characters are so thin, you don't miss them. The way it looks to me is the writers said okay, in the Alien movie we have people getting attacked by face grabbers... Check. People having aliens burst from their chests... Check. We have Aliens hunting.. Check. But never tried to tie any of it into the story to make it compelling. So it's like the concert with a mosh pit for lame ass top 40 music. It looks the same, but the meaning is completely lost.<br/><br/>I won't even try to get into the inconsistencies in the movie, or the bad choices the characters make, because I will be here all day. So I will just say I really loved the first two Alien movies and the first Predator movie. I feel it has been an ever worsening item since. With this blight being the garbage masterpiece. If you go see it, leave your brain at home, and you may like it.<br/><br/>Hope this helps you decide on whether or not to see it before it comes to free broadcast TV. If you care for the first Alien movie, don't go see this junk."

","The set-up for the movie is unoriginal but decent. In the beginning they even try to do some character development (very little but its there). The real problem is this, it just wasn't scary. They needed another half hour (yes, thirty minutes) of suspense. They just needed more time for the cast to hide out, run, and try to survive. Add in the sound effects of the 'face suckers' scurrying across the floor from time to time and you've got some real suspense.<br/><br/>At the showing I went to the sound was turned down much too low. So, I did not get the full effect of the surround sound. This could have had a hand in ruining the suspense for me. However, the movie as a whole just felt rushed. <br/><br/>Perhaps I've been spoiled by ""Aliens"" which takes it's time to build suspense, or maybe I'm a little bias (""Aliens"" is my favorite movie). Anyway, if you're going for the sake of the special effects, you shouldn't be disappointed. If you're going for the scare factor, you may not be very satisfied.<br/><br/>I'll say this to its credit, it was better than ""Alien 3"". Which isn't really saying much."

","Alien vs. Predator killed the Alien and Predator franchise. The original movies were fantastic. Alien is one of my favorite movies ever, as is Predator. You know it was a matter of time before the combined the two films, which is great, but the writing and directing of the film was just horrible. The plot didn't ever clash well with the original movies. In the original Predator, the Predators were hunting man, not Aliens. And in AVP, they said they were hunting Aliens for thousands of years up to the present time. And in Alien, the Aliens were in space, so if they were like slaves for 1,000's of years how could they be in space all of the sudden. i'm sorry, but this was not a good Sci-Fi horror film.

The interaction between the lone Predator and the female actor was believable. They didn't get sappy or touchy. The Predator knew that he was going to need help and when there was no one else around he turned to a human woman that managed to kill an Alien by herself.<br/><br/>The director caught, perfectly, the nuances and intricacies of these two alien races.

","Okay I'm not going to waste my time telling you how great it was. I'm going to dispel the constant b@#ching that is going on in every alien vs predator forum. <br/><br/>1. Fights: The first fight was a little camera jerky to begin with but the fights were great and the predator was presented right. Yes we have all heard the argument that in the first film he was really stealthy and a great killer. Well he wasn't fighting aliens plain and simple.<br/><br/>2. Predators liking humans: This made more sense than people like to think. They are hunters not cold blooded killers. Yes they have killed countless humans on many occasions, but they were either hunting them or the humans got in their way. (Spoiler) When bishop stands against one the predator sees the fact he is sick and leaves him be. Well until he flames him then he just p***es the predator off. (Spoiler) Their hunters from a tribal community not merciless killing machines.<br/><br/>3. PG 13 and Anderson: Get over Resident Evil people. Yes it didn't live up to everyone's expectations, but it wasn't a god awful film. The guy made mortal kombat that has to be a redeeming quality. Also he didn't make this film PG-13.

","Okay, for whoever read mister ""Seaview1's"" review on this film, and the ""plot holes"" he notated, and is a true ""purist"" as he referred to us, you will know he is full of poo. In ALL the alien movies the aliens have had a rapid maturing time from birth to adulthood. How long did it take before the first alien was ripping out of John Hurt's chest, until it was hunting down Weaver and crew later on? About a a day, if even that. Probably less. Also, he was criticising the human's ability to find out the history of the ""Hunt"" and he obviously missed the point that one of the scientists on the expedition was able to translate the hieroglyphics on the wall. Someone wasn't paying attention to ANY of the films, and is grossly criticizing what in my opinion, pays a lot of homage to all the originals.<br/><br/>**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**<br/><br/>As a true PURIST, I have read every comic book, paperback novel, played every video game, and watched every movie. This HAS NOT been just a creation of people who want to pit horror bad guys together in order to make more movies. Hey Seaview1, if you're such a purist, how come you never realized the Dark Horse AvP comics came out long before Freddy vs. Jason (which was utterly lame)? The story is not old, it has not been done before, and it is quite unique. The Predators have helped in the past what looks to be an Atlantian continent of pre-historic men learn to build, and cultivate their land, in return these humans offer sacrifices to the Alien race in order to breed drones that young Predators can fight as a Rite of Passage. Using a heat pattern, they lure a group of scientists to an under-ice pyramid in the Antartic in order to awaken the frozen mother alien, and begin the cycle of hunt once again. Yet, when the Predators get their, they find that their shoulder mounted particle weapons have been taken by the human explorers, and the Aliens have already begun to breed, so they must get them back.<br/><br/>What results is a battle between the mass quantities and brood mentality of the Alien species, the brute force and massive technology of the Predator, and the ingenuity, and curious nature of the Human. A stand off to keep you on the edge, wondering .. ""who's going to win?"" Of course in the usual manner of both the Alien and Predator films, there is no winner.<br/><br/>In the end, for those who have been faithful to both movies, and to those who thought Alien:Resurrection stunk (this from a die hard fan, and many like me) this will be a great success. I recommend it highly, because it is not your typical kill-em-all horror/suspense. It is intelligent, well lit, and the sets are amazing.

","Well, I must echo what Mr. Ulman wrote in the featured user review. Not much here. The credit for the best stuff in AVP must go to the production design and previous design work. Images and shots seem directly lifted from the original and subsequent sequels. The setup and premise is reasonable...but writer/director Paul Anderson is out of his league. Both franchises seem to be spiraling down to Junior High level action, hence the PG-13. <br/><br/>If only the story could rise to the same level as the sets and production design. A little bit of character development wouldn't hurt, as well as a dose of logic here and there. There's a mishmash of Art Bell level ideas that really confuse things. Okay...pyramids, ancient civilizations, early visitations, okay, we get it, Mr. Anderson. But so what?<br/><br/>For a film entitled Alien Vs. Predator, it sure would have been nice to see MORE Alien Vs. Predator over the mean ET's going after the typical cardboard, somewhat stupid array of ""experts"" (we're TOLD through poorly written expository dialogue). We're treated to at least ONE well staged AVP fight. After that, clones from Alien and mostly Alien3. There's an attempt to mix in Aliens...but again, the potential seems to overwhelm Mr. Anderson.<br/><br/>This film is apparently opening big, but should tank the second week. I'm no big advocate of violence in films, but the violence was what made these films unique, especially the Alien franchise. The Alien was created to mess humans up. They're very organic. The Predators, on the other hand, are very evolved with weaponry. There was a great potential of organic vs. tech to be exploited...but no...Mr. Anderon misses it. Lots of recreated shadowy hallways, a couple of predictable, non startling attempts to jolt us...and uninspired plot. The NOISE LEVEL gradually increase throughout the film, usually a bad sign.<br/><br/>It would have been much more interesting to have a documentary showing off the details of the outstanding set. <br/><br/>Wait for DVD."

","I went into ""Alien Vs. Predator"" knowing it would be a cheesy flick, but I was hoping it would be a good one, it's not. Helmed by ""Resident Evil"" director Paul W.S. Anderson, the picture starts out promising. When a satellite owned by robotics developer Charles Bishop Heyman detects heat beneath the ice of Antartica, people of various profession are recruited to inspect the mysterious findings.<br/><br/>Heyman (Lance Henriksen) meets the group and explains to them an ancient temple is the location of their expedition. He joins the group and together they search for fortune and glory. Unfortuantely for them, what they walk into is a centuries-old war between two alien species. It takes about 30 minutes before the action takes off in this 90 minute movie.<br/><br/>
Unlike previous franchise efforts, ""AVP"" is lacking in blood and gore and is rated PG-13. That's kind of pointless since the hard-core fans are those who love that kind of thing. I went with this movie until the point when Heyman signs his own death warrant by yelling to a Predator, ""Hey! Don't you turn your back on me!"". It's silly and it only gets sillier as the movie goes on. As for the ending, don't get me started.<br/><br/>I guess the franchises are both truly done for. Congrads to director Anderson who continues to show how much of a hack he really is. I have know idea why Fox chose him to direct.

"wjeffer","Null","0","0","16 August 2004"," THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, THE WORSE THIS FILM GETS!!!
","While I did experience a few fun moments while watching this film, I must say that - overall - this film was poorly made if for no other reason than because elements of the story seemed to disregard basic elements of the first two Alien films (1979 and 1986)(we'll pretend Alien III and IV just don't exist). <br/><br/>First, why did the Aliens not take as long to gestate in their human hosts in this film as they did in the prior Alien films? Second, are we really supposed to believe that the Queen Alien (or anything for that matter) could have been kept ""on ice"" for such a long time and did not suffer any ill effects (e.g., atrophied muscles)? <br/><br/>Third, why did the Predators even go back to Earth? According to the story told by Sebastian (Raoul Bova), the three Predators nuked everything when they were overtaken by the horde of Aliens. If everything was nuked, how did the pyramid survive? How did the Queen Alien survive? HOW DID ANYTHING SURVIVE? There would have been nothing for the Predators to go back and fight. Or did the three defeated Predators have a special bomb that only annihilated everything above ground? <br/><br/>FOURTH - and this little development was just asinine - how was an Alien implanted in the final Predator? Anyone who paid attention to ANY of the films knows the birth of an Alien is a three-step process - Facehugger lays an egg in the host, the egg gestates for a time, the Alien erupts from the host's chest cavity. No Facehugger attacked the final Predator to lay an egg inside him. And anyone who tries to argue that the Queen Alien infected the final Predator during their final battle is just deluding him/herself. Why the filmmakers skipped such a key factor in the creation of the Predator/Alien hybrid is beyond me. Yes, it's obvious they set the stage for a sequel, but COME ON! They could have put a bit more thought into it, don't you think? <br/><br/>Then there's the timeline regarding Bishop's existence. Was his death in this film explained in any way that would help us believe that a android made in his image would exist 175 years later (the time frame for ""ALIENS"")?<br/><br/>
When flaws like those listed above become apparent and it seems the filmmakers (writer[s], director[s], continuity staff, etc.) disregarded the fundamentals of good storytelling, it's hard for someone to keep his/her belief in abeyance and just ""enjoy the film"". Movie-going is becoming too expensive for the audience to tolerate such shoddy filmmaking.<br/><br/>
Someone needs to take Paul W. S. Anderson aside and tell him that special effects don't make the film. A bad film is a bad film and special effects just distract the audience for a time; they don't cover up such obvious flaws very well. On the other hand, in a well-made film, special effects are just icing on the cake. Unfortunately, no matter how many bad films Anderson makes, as long as they make money for the studios, they'll let him make as many bad films as he wants. WHAT A SHAME!!!"

","If you've bothered reading though the reviews this far, you have either a lot of patience or a lot of time on your hands. Or both.<br/><br/>After seeing AVP, and I consider myself a big Predator fan and knowledgeable in the lore. I'd say this movie is watchable but it could have been better. I say this as I've waited for this movie since Predator 2 shows an Alien skull in the trophy case and after Phill Norwood first drew the Dark Horse comic Alien vs. Predator and then it was turned into a novel.<br/><br/>This move follows the basic ideas of the original Dark Horse comics, but there are certain aspects of it that director Andersen drops. Make me wonder if he even bothered to do a little research into what has already been established, such as the Yautja's or Predator's weapons being resistant to the Alien's acid blood. Really how many can they kill if their weapons melt after each kill? And the face huggers can latch on a Yautja but after seeing a Yautja tossing an Alien around like a rag doll I would think they'd have the strength to yank a face hugger off, providing they do it before it paralyzes them.<br/><br/>Alien drones are supposed to have the intelligence of a dog, it seems to me these Xenomorphs are getting a little too smart. I would think the Yautja would know everything about these parasites seeing as they've hunted them for hundreds in not thousands of years.<br/><br/>No it's not an Oscar winning movie, then again most movies that win Oscars suck in my opinion anyways. LOTR being an unusual exception, yes honestly I didn't think it would win. However back to AVP, It's not the greatest, but it is mildly entertaining and very watchable. Unlike another film I could mention. And while the Yautja making googly eye looks at the human female mountain climber might have looked silly and like an attempt at a little romance. I think it was merely the admiration of one successful hunter to another."

","Many of the young fan base that wants to watch this sci-fi horror action comedy romance (OK I can't isolate a genre, but we can pretty much kick out romance,) haven't been around long enough to watch one of these good films in the theater. Heck even I was too young to watch one of the good 'Alien' or the only good 'Predator' in the theater. I did however get to see 'Alien 3' and 'Predator 2.' My reaction to that was the same as my reaction to this. I paid hard earned money to see this.<br/><br/>
      So after watching twenty minutes of character build up, we learn A) There's a survival type woman who will lead the expedition B) One of the members of the expedition has kids and is likely to call an alien or predator a 'bloke' in this yarn, and finally C) Lance Henrikson is likely not a robot sent back in time. We also find little to no reason to root for any character in this movie. In 'Predator,' 'Alien' and 'Aliens' we could identify each character with their personality. From ""I aint got time to bleed"" through to ""Game over man. Game Over!"" We had an assortment of fun characters to watch as chaos ensued in the past. <br/><br/>      Characters, of course, die in this movie. Then a funny notion comes to mind. The enemy of the enemy has weapons of mass destruction. Can the humans become friends with this of the two species? The possibilities for making this a romance flick might be growing hahahahahahaha. Maybe a sequel can involve a Predator flipping through the Alien's little black book."
"animalchain","Null","0","0","15 August 2004"," Great Buddy Cop Flick
","Spoiler Alert Such a shame this movie stunk. Really bad. The characters, actors and director all made for a pedigreed movie. What we got instead was...crap!<br/><br/>First... the action was monotonous. Each human character (about him we care nothing due to the complete lack of character development, which would have been OK, had the movie spent more time on the main attractions - the A's and the P's - but it didn't)pretty much got it in the same way: trapped in a maze, then boom - snatched by an Alien, or walking along, then boom - speared by a Predator. Save for an intense first fight scene between an Alien and some Predators, the whole hunt aspect - whether being chased by an Alien or stalked by a Predator - which gave the other movies their suspense and terror, is absent.<br/><br/>Second... the gore was nil. I'm not saying that gore is essential to a sci-fi/horror film, but the namesake franchises had some, and, as such, so should have this film. The director used neat little camera angles, or simply cut to another scene, to avoid showing deaths. This would have been sort of OK, had their been some tense, nerve-racking chase/hunt just before. The lack of gore would have been compensated by lots of suspense, or vice-versa, but there was none of either. Even the chest-popping scene was watered down: they actually showed one breaking out of a woman's chest, but it was quick and the shirt just happened to be red (I can hear the conversation at fox...""I have to have a chest-popping scene."" ""No you don't."" ""Yes I do."" ""Too gory. ""I'll make it quick."" ""Too much blood will get us an R."" ""Oooh - I know! We'll put her in a red shirt, that way we don't see any blood."" ""Perfect. The fans should be happy then.""<br/><br/>Third... the plot was convenient. Weyland's satellites picked up the heat source, but no one else's - military or civilian. This allowed them to be the only ones there. A mining town just happened to be at the site 100 years earlier, despite the fact that it took a huge ice breaker to get this crew there. This allowed them to keep in line with the whole they-come-every-100-years-thing (and did I see a plastic letter board, much like you'd see on a modern restaurant's sign - you know, where you slide the plastic letters into the slots to say things like ""Eggs Bacon Coffee 2.99"" - did they have those in 1904?). The resident archeologist was able to decipher everything the hieroglyphics said, so the audience could have one of those this-is-where-everything-gets-explained scenes. The Queen Alien decided that this time was the time to have her soldiers free her from her shackles, so we could have the big her-comes-the Queen-and-boy-is-she-pissed scene (apparently, it took her a few thousand years to come up with the idea). The aliens popped out of the humans toot-sweet, yet it incubated inside the Predator for a really long time, so we could have the uh-oh-Predator-on-the-table-I-just-bet-it's-gonna-yup! scene at the end.<br/><br/>Lastly (and most importantly)... the Predator's were disappointing. They started out gung-ho, rough and tough, their hulking presence intensified by these slow motion scenes when their thunderous steps pulsate through out the theatre. Then...the last one left makes nice. What? The moment when he makes peace with the resident expedition leader is the moment when I knew I was watching a bad movie. The last quarter of the film stopped being a sci-fi/horror movie and started being a buddy-cop action flick. It even had the requisite big fiery escape scene, wherein the two buddies latch on to a cable cart and zip their way to the end of a tunnel as fire from an explosion chases after them. Right out of Die Hard or Bad Boys.<br/><br/>P.S. - I've always been partial to the Aliens as opposed to the Predators. The Aliens are sleek and slithery and devious and nasty and could care less about giving you a fair chance. The Predators are big and hulking and clodding and on some testosterone fueled high, like an overly aggressive high school jock with something to prove. The Aliens are the scary guy who sits in the back of the class and watches you and drools over you and wants you. Much creepier, the Aliens are. So I was a little upset that the Predators basically enslaved a Queen and forced her to breed just so they could hunt her offspring and then they were made to be the good guys. I'm glad the Queen got the last one at the end. If only she had been able to grab that woman and take her down to the depth of the ocean with her. Oh well."

Well, wasn't the Queen in a cryo stasis in the beginning of the movie? Ummm...She falls into ICY water in the end.... Well, maybe the second half of the Weyland Yutani Corporation goes after the queen in a second expedition. This leads them to discover the alien species for further erperimentation. Perhaps the queen doesn't live through the Ice Stasis this time but the humans can learn about it through tissue samples.

Mr Yutaini gets HUNGRY and builds the ""COMPANY"" for one goal. FIND THAT SHIP. Well, about a hundred or so years pass, I forget exactly, but the Predator ship crashes on that planet in Alien I. The Pred/Alien morphs into a queen ""as Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park, LIFE WILL FIND A WAY"". The new queen lays a bunch of eggs and Viola! A new hybrid of the hybrid. They look like the aliens we all know and love, but they have a more Hunter aspect, and the gestation period changes. It becomes a bit slower.

Also Weyland, who was bishop in the 2nd and 3rd Alien movies, somehow dies in 2004, and then creates a robot thats based off his physical features more than 300 years later...hmmm...Also i love movies nowadays, there's been so many good ones, mostly because of the MPAA(motion picture association of America), appeasing the MPAA is one of the number one reasons movies go bad...and all the damn protesters along with the MPAA, who say ""if you don't have a minority as a positive role in this movie we're going to boycott it"" and the director is tripely as stupid for falling for it...not to be racist but oh my god a minority is going to boycott my movie if we don't put them in the movie and make them cool, so lets have an Italian guy, a Russian guy, a bunch of white people who die and for the main star we're going to have a double minority, a black woman...leave it to miss halley barry look alike, which I'm almost positive it was her and they just gave her a fake screen name in the credits to become friends with the predator, when originally it was a Japanese chick and she was accepted as a predator and got the suit and mask rather than the Predator making a half assed sword and shield out of an alien head and tail, although i think those were decent ideas...This movie pisses me off so much i could go on forever...but seriously, you want a good AvP movie...get in touch with me, give me 10,000,000 dollars and i'll make a movie that people will wanna see, and is true to the original movies and concept of AvP"

I was overjoyed to see a movie that leaves out cheesy laughs and Danny Glover. The aliens really came off well, much more active and vicious through the magic of C.G. It was nice to see the queen in realistic action rather than a large costume with mechanical limbs. The predators were what you'd expect and stayed true to the previous films. My only beef with the movie is the bond that forms between the lead human character and a predator. However the fact that a single female is the surviving lead stays true to the alien franchise and the respect shown by the predator is not new to the Predator franchise either (i.e. the elder towards Glover in Predator 2). The story in my opinion was an interesting and unique way to bring the franchises together. Overall I think AVP is better than Alien 3, Resurrection, and Predator 2 but still behind the others (which are classics). This movie for me puts Paul W.S. Anderson at par for films.

I'm not a self-proclaimed cinemaphobe, so I'll stay away from comments on direction, lighting, etc - I'll just tell you what I thought of the movie.<br/><br/>Though I've been waiting for this, it took me a couple of weeks after opening to get to see it. In the meantime, I'd heard it panned, so I wasn't expecting much, but after waiting this long, nothing was going to stop me. I'm so glad I don't let other opinions inhibit my movie choices, or I would definitely lost out! I thought the movie was great - just what I would have wanted. When we watch all the other Alien movies all we see is the Alien creature ripping up humans with little-to-no resistance. This movie delivered a whole other side of the creature when it meets a foe ""equal"" in brutality and strength. We actually get to see it take a beating hand-to-hand with a worthy opponent and in some cases, taking a beating. We get to see it celebrate a victory and/or get its butt royally kicked!<br/><br/>I liked the continuation of a strong female lead who's not just some tough-girl, but a survivor who does what it takes to make it through the situation that she's fallen into. I've heard ""where's Ripley"" many times, but c'mon, if we continue with the same character in every movie it's going to get stale. <br/><br/>I also appreciated the hesitant truce between human and Predator to fight a common evil. They were comrades born out of necessity with a grudging respect and need for one-another - not exactly going for a latte after the next kill.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie delivered just what I was looking for: a good and meaty fight between Alien and Predator with a human influence (how can we relate without it) and an ending that leaves me waiting for the next one. Most of all, there were no happy duo at the end, walking arm-and-arm back to their rescue ship, just a loan survivor after a long and harrowing battle. Kept me going, and looking forward to AvP2."

So, I was ready to watch a crappy movie. I was ready to make certain concessions. Nothing original necessary, no great plot, little coherence is even necessary. All I ask is that you don't require me to be a moron to enjoy it. Unfortunately it failed at even this meager task.<br/><br/>The story takes place at the end of 2004. But for some reason the boss of ""The Company"" who is very much alive in Alien3 is dying, and oh no *spoiler* dies in this movie. No explanation is offered. How is it that a man who dies in a pyramid buried hundreds of feet under ground which is latter blown up is alive hundreds of years later looking exactly the same as he did before. I don't know, does our good friend Mr. Anderson know the answer? I think not.<br/><br/>Another thing. Where did all the full grown aliens come from. One minute they're bursting from the chest 5 minutes later they're full grown. What gives? You get the feeling that the guy who wrote this movie never even saw the alien movies.<br/><br/>Finally the fight scenes between aliens and predators were pathetic. It looked just like two guys in costumes rolling around on the floor. I wouldn't have been surprised to see miniature cardboard sky scrapers at their feet. <br/><br/>Oh Predator we'll be friends forever . . ."

","I have been a fan of both franchise since I was first introduced to them. I have always followed the plans for them to make a film pitting the 2 against each other. I have the books and the games. When I first heard of this film, I was upset. I thought it was gonna suck. I didn't agree with what direction paul anderson was gonna take these franchises. <br/><br/>I was proven wrong. This film was excellent. I loved it. It was full of action and it was a wild ride from start to finish. He put the stories together perfectly. I admit, I would have rather seen more fighting, but other then that, It was a great film. Never in my life did I think they could pull it off, but now, anything is possible.<br/><br/>I hope for a Sequel someday that will be even better then this. 5 out of 5 stars, I applaud Paul Anderson."

","I don't care what you say, Alien vs. Predator kicked ass. It was everything anyone could have hoped for it to be and more. It reminds me of the good old days where you could make a nice action thriller without having to worry about things like ""acting"" or ""character development."" The aliens were just as kick-ass as they should have been and the predators just as pwnage. No subplots. No love interests. Just predators kicking alien ass, aliens kicking predator ass, and aliens and predators kicking human ass. Everything was just fine. I'm usually an anal retentive ass when it comes to franchises, but there was nothing in the movie that made me say ""They should have done it that way"" or ""actually its supposed to be like whatever.""<br/><br/>Now some may say that the movie was irritating because it was all dark and you couldn't see what was going on. Now I want you to go watch Alien again and realize that that's how the whole damn film was done. You don't really see anything till the very end. Also I don't see why everyone thinks the fight scenes were poorly coordinated. I thought they were just fine compared to those in a movie like Daredevil.<br/><br/>Finally, the subject of the PG-13 rating. Need I remind you that most of the other Alien and Predator movies were made in the 80's and early 90's, when it was much easier to get an R rating. These days it almost takes full frontal nudity to pull an R, and I'm sure we can all agree that that would have been totally uncalled-for in this movie. The other thing that made the others R was swearing, and I'm sure no one really cares if there were a few fewer 'fucks' and 'shits' in AvP.<br/><br/>I will conclude by saying there were a few things that could have been made better, just to be fair. The Italian guy did start to get on my nerves about half way through, especially since the actor couldn't settle on one accent. Also the setting in Antartica sort of tore down the premise that the Predators have a high heat threshold and normally hunt during heat waves, such as in the two Predator movies. Fortunately, they did have the one pred take a flamethrower without flinching, which made it better.<br/><br/>So, all in all (and yes, I realize is my third conclusion) AvP was good. The fight scenes were awesome. Aliens and Predators were always killed in cool ways, which is very important. The movie was not bogged down by subplots or character development, which isn't that important anyway. Who here can tell me all the names of the crew of the Sulaco? Or Dutch's commando team? So that's my spiel. If you didn't like the movie, go to hell."

","If you are one of the only people alive who have not seen any of the Alien movies and you plan to see this movie, you should enjoy it. However, for those who have seen all of the Aliens and Predator movies wait for this to come out on DVD 5 day rental.<br/><br/>The director and writer of the movie, Paul Anderson, who claims to be an avid lover of both series has found a way to destroy the basis them in this movie. He forgot some of the most basic of elements of the movies while doing the movie. This movie did not really even come close in grabbing the audience nor did it even scare you. Wait there was once scene without either the Alien or Predator that was scary. <br/><br/>Alien Vs. Predator? There were 4 confrontations with the Alien(s) and Predator(s). The movie should have been called, 10 humans running around with heads chopped off in a building with some Predators and Aliens. You can probably tell what my vote was for this movie (6). The reason it was so high is due to the fact that the few confrontations with the 2 stars, they were not that bad.<br/><br/>If you decide to see the movie in the theaters, don't expect to be blown away with excitement."
"Cacus7","6","0","0","14 August 2004"," A disappointment for true fans
","I wanted so much to like this movie -- after all, fans of both the Aliens and Predator franchises had been waiting for over a decade for the two to clash on screen. While this movie might appeal to new fans, I doubt it will satisfy people who have been following the franchises since their inceptions. While the effects and creature designs were decent, this movie lacks one thing that makes some of the older films (most notably Alien, Aliens and the first Predator) fun to watch over and over -- the characters are, almost without exception, one-dimensional and unengaging. There isn't any really unique character in this one, like Ripley in Alien, Newt and Hicks in Aliens, or the triple threat played by Arnold, Jesse and Carl Weathers in predator. I honestly didn't care who lived or died.<br/><br/>Speaking of deaths, I know i wasn't the only one disappointed by the studio's decision to make this a PG-13 film. While some clever cinematography made it seem like you were seeing more explicit violence than actually was shown in frame, it lacked the stark, dark realism that was especially effective in the first Alien film. Add to that the incredibly short running time (well under 90 minutes if you were to remove the end credits) and you have a film that could have been, should have been able to do a lot more with a cool story concept than was the result. Hopefully, the inevitable special edition DVD will restore some sequences that were cut from the theater, help to flesh out the characters, and provide a bit more blood for hardcore fans of gore. Seeing how much Alien and Aliens were able to be improved by adding in cut footage, I haven't completely given up on this one yet, but I definitely won't be seeing it again before it hits the dollar theaters."

","If you like action and thriller movies, I'd consider this worth the money. Its one of those movies that are probably better seen in a theater unless you have a state-of-the-art theater system at home because of its special affects. I don't recommend going there with expectations it'll knock the pants off any of the former Predator or Alien movies. Its more-or-less what you'd expect if you've seen the others. If you go there just to enjoy it, then I'm sure you will. I enjoyed it, and its pretty much average with other action/thriller/sci-fi movies I've seen.<br/><br/>The female, the chemical engineer, Italian archaeologist and the business owner (forgot their names, so forgive me) play their parts well. All the rest seem to be unimportant to the plot of the movie and more extras than characters. It perhaps would be nice to develop their characters more so we could feel sorry for them when they are killed. :-)<br/><br/>I think its a good movie for kids, not only because it'll probably be more exciting to kids who haven't seen this sort of thing too often, but because I could tell kids enjoyed it by what they said with each other when leaving the theater. For adrenalin junkies that have seen a lot of movies like the Alien and Predator movies, it probably won't be too shocking, but might keep you entertained. I don't really think its necessary to have seen Alien or Predator movies prior to seeing this one, but it might enhance your understanding a little, or alternately might spoil it a little... Depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a movie to portray a battle between alien and predator in the way you'd expect, than you probably won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>I agree with the previous reviewer that it took too long to get to the action, but it does serve the purpose of making people relaxed before the carnage starts, which might get their hearts going. Unfortunately, they could have developed this a little more and made the transition a little more pronounced, so it'd be like having someone blowing a horn in your face while you are meditating. They gave us a little too much warning. Adrenalin junkies might find a new roller coaster more scary and startling.<br/><br/>I think the supposed history of the Predator race and human civilization is plausible and interesting if you ignore that the scientific knowledge and puzzle solving skills of most of the characters in the movie seems to be contradictory -- sometimes brilliant, sometimes pathetic, sometimes wrong (like with the Mayan long count) or insulting our intelligence (like with the aurora). That's about all I can say without spoiling parts of the movie. I recommend not to pay too much attention to the scientific background of the movie, and simply enjoy the action. Another reason its probably better for kids who won't over-analyze the sketchy scientific and archaeological background.<br/><br/>So anyway, I think you'll enjoy it, but keep your expectations to the level of remembering you are going to see a combined sequel of two series that already have sequels and that there were already video games on this theme."

","I expected to see a half assed attempt to revitalize two sagging franchises - sigh - I wish I would have been that fortunate.<br/><br/>Alien Vs Predator played out like a comic book - filled with big explosions, epic battles and appeals to some played out warrior ethos. Bah ! Both of these franchises were based on elements such as tension, style and subtle use of creature effects. After seeing both Alien and Predator on screen for extended periods of time BOTH creatures lost their appeal and mysticism. Like all classic monster movies, it is better to see too little than too much (the original Alien, Predator, Nightmare on Elm Street...etc).<br/><br/>A hackneyed plot, cardboard cast (although the acting is about average for this genre) and music that was predictable at best left me wondering how this movie is going to last beyond the opening weekend. Please. Wait for video for this one....and when it comes to video/DVD rent something else instead....might I suggest Equilibrium ?<br/><br/>Sadly, the Alien and Predator license now join Robocop on the '....we are relics from a bygone era who have no business being trotted out for the masses because they will see how one- dimensional we truly are."" <br/><br/>Somebody stop the fanboys from making movies.

","Spoiler Alert When I first heard of the this movie, I was both pumped up and scared. I didn't want them to cheeze it out - especially with a PG-13 rating. But the money was there, the special effects were there, and the story seemed to be pretty good all things considered.<br/><br/>Where I felt we were all hugely let down was how Predator kept getting beat up throughout the entire flick and how a human played such an important role. I mean, predator is a warrior of the galaxies, yet two of them die off in the first half of the movie - and the last one only kills one alien without a gun. That was very disappointing. Predator and Alien should have fought more often in the movie and the predator should not have had his rear end handed to him like it was. THE PREDATORS SHOULD NOT HAVE LOST AS MANY FIGHTS AS THEY DID, ESPECIALLY THE SECOND PREDATOR WHO HAD THE FACE OFF WITH THE ALIEN - that was bs.<br/><br/>What was even worse though was the fact that a woman fought against his side and saved his life on three different occasions: once in the scene where she killed one alien (and the predator made the spear and shield for her), then when she provided the lift back to the main ground (out of the tunnel), and last when she stabbed the queen alien in the neck right before the alien was going to finish off the last predator. <br/><br/>In the end, without the predator's gun, her and the predator killed the same number of aliens - that's just plain sad. I really don't understand who they were cattering to when they made this movie. Why put humans as a force to be reckoned with? It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>In the end, I agree with most of the people here when they say that you can't go in with high expectations. But if you are prepared to accept the politically correct gesture of humans saving the day and that the predator is, in the end, the one being hunted, then you will enjoy it."

","I must say that I'd been hoping for someone to make this movie for a long time. And I'm satisfied with the way it turned out. I wasn't expecting it to be a culminating document to the predator and alien series, and it isn't.<br/><br/>Overall this movie delivers in a fun action packed ride that lacks the lurking-in-the shadows, never-seen-in-broad-daylight that characterized both alien and both the predator movies, and I'm glad it didn't either, I wanted to see aliens and predators beating each other up and that's what I got. This is the part of the movie I wanted to see and it's the only part that is enjoyable.<br/><br/>The script could have been much more convincing on behalf of the humans, that two young archaeologists could just up and read writing ""in egyptian, aztec and cambodian"" is simply idiotic, not to mention that none of the glyphs are egyptian, the archeaologist is just too smart to be believable. This just among many rough details. The humans are basically just a side-dish that allow us to understand what is going on. I'd rather have heard a couple of mumbled grunts and occasional words from the predators because the acting on behalf of almost all humans concerned is below average except maybe lance henricksen, and the protagonist is a laugh, with her overly-zealous over-acted and cliché behaviour.<br/><br/>CG and other special effects are top notch and the result is completely believable. Makeup is also very nice on the predator's behalf.<br/><br/>Essentially, this movie is Predator 3, not Alien 5. It does a good job of introducing facets to the predator race's character that was lacking from both previous movies, and fans of the previous predator movies and universe (myself included) will very likely enjoy this movie. The influence of the alien series is felt mostly in the dark, claustrophobic environment and nothing of any real importance is introduced about them.<br/><br/>Worth seeing, and I sure hope they come out with an R-rated alternative on DVD sometime soon, I'll be buying it."

","Spoilers I was a little disappointed in the movie also but it wasn't all that bad. I did enjoy some of the action and the plot a little. I've read sum of the other comments I do agree on some of them. It would be hard to believe that a pyramid would be underneath earth for some period of time without being found so soon. I sort of read a plot summary so I already knew what was going to happen. If it wasn't for that then I wouldn't have like the Predators in this movie (there fighting skills were really sloppy) given the fact that they were supposed to be teenagers helped explained that. You can tell that they were young by the one who took off his mask at the end versus the adult one at the very end of the movie. I also didn't like the how they killed everybody off so soon and the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>I wouldn't completely slam the movie but it could be a little better than it was. <br/><br/>Out of 10 I would give it an 8."

","From the perspective of a fan of the Alien movies - This is a very entertaining movie. Don't expect much in the way of a sophisticated plot or to ""make sense"" in terms of real history or the alien mythology. But, there are lots of well designed critters running around and, thank Cthulhu, it appears that the aliens(for the most part) are not CGI. I would compare the way CGI is used in most movies to the use of the digital drum machine in music. Once the visuals/music is recognized as being digitally produced, the effect can become quite annoying.<br/><br/>The first Alien movie drew heavily from 1950s films like ""IT- The Terror from Beyond Space"" for the general premise and ""Night of the Blood Beast"" for the idea of an alien using a human as a living host for embryos. What set this movie apart from the drive in flicks was a superb cast of great actors and sets and creatures designed by true visionaries like Giger and Moebius. Aliens expanded upon the alien ""mythology"" and was a well crafted/well written sci-fi action movie. Alien 3 was a terrible, perhaps the worst, betrayal of fan loyalty by Hollywood idiots. So was Resurrection with the incredibly poorly designed human/alien hybrid(where was Paul Blaisdell when we needed him most?) and all those ""action flick"" one liners. I never intend to see either Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection again. Ever.<br/><br/>However, this new film I will see again. And, I will go back and watch the Predator movies. I may tune out the lame dialog and whatever other faults I may see in AVP, but I will enjoy the ""Mountains of Madness""(the Lovecraft story, not the movie) atmosphere and the visuals. Sure, a more intelligent movie remains to be made that will add depth to the Alien/Predator Mythos - I know there are great scripts floating around - but, in the meantime, this will do quite nicely."

","I just saw AVP last night (Aug 13). While it is not the best film in either series (those being the 1st in each series) I thought it brought them together well.<br/><br/>It sets the film in Antarctica, 2004. That ties in to Predator, which has always been a here and now series. It ties in with the Alien movies by using Lance Henriksen as Charles Bishop Weyland, owner of the Weyland Industries, which I thought was a nice tie in. It also answered for me how the company knew about the Alien to begin with.<br/><br/>Weyland hires a group of scientists and explorers to uncover an ancient pyramid buried in the ice of Antarctica. The pyramid ends up being, what else, a breeding ground for aliens. The predators come once every hundred years to Hunt the Aliens as a right of passage. The science team unwittingly become entangled in the hunt and have to fight to survive.<br/><br/>It had a good story, good characters, and the fights were just cool.

","Well after about 13 years of waiting I finally saw AVP on opening night. I was very pleased with the outcome. Leading up to the opening of the film, the net (IMDB included) was full of fanboys talking all kinds of trash. W.S. Anderson sucks, this movie will suck, blah, blah, blah. Well they are wrong! I don't know what the Comic Book Store guys of the world were expecting, but the movie kicks ass and don't let anyone tell you different. AVP haters are the same kind of people that worship the ground George Lucas walks on while at the same time ripping the new movies for ""not being like the originals."" Whatever. I've said my piece now on to the movie. <br/><br/>MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD The first 30 minutes or so is a bit slow, as they need to lay down the story and introduce you to the future dead humans. Wisely, the movie doesn't concentrate on the humans too much as Anderson knows who are the real stars of this show. The Predators make their entrance into the movie with a look onboard their ship as it approaches Earth. Their computer displays are all projected in 3-D, probably so they can see them with their infrared vision. The infrared vision by the way is a bit changed from the first two movies. It's more refined and not as blurry as the original movie's vision. More computerized is the best way I can describe it. The Predator's weapons are the same as in the first two films with the exception of this throwing star with retractable blades that is at least as badass as their plasma cannons, which by the way you won't be seeing as much. The Alien/Predator fights are really spectacular although in a few sequences you can barely see what's happening as everything is moving too fast and the camera is really zoomed in. It reminded me of a Godzilla movie at those moments. Still, the power of these two heavyweights is awesome to behold and both the Aliens and the Predators give and take in this battle. There are casualties on both sides, just about all the humans die,(of course) and despite the PG-13 rating, there is plenty of violence and blood. At least of the glowing green and acid kind. The Predators didn't make much use of their cloaking devices in this one. It didn't help them too much anyway. You come to see this movie for the stars, not for the acting,(sucks) or the storyline(minimal). By the way that the votes are going so far I would say that you are either going to love this movie or hate it. Oh, I almost forgot. They set it up for a sequel. I won't tell you how but it looks pretty cool. This is the best movie to come out since Dawn of the Dead. F***** awesome!!!!!!!!"
"Turks","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," AvP review from a hardcore Alien and Predator fan
","As a huge fan of the Predator and Alien films *hugs alien quadrilogy box set* I've been waiting for this movie a long time. As a kid (age 8 I believe) Predator was my favorite movie, and it still is to this day. I loved the Predator and Alien films and I had my first orgasm when I saw the Alien skull in the Predator ship in Predator 2 (I kid about the orgasm, but it was awe stricken). The possibilities swarmed in my head, Aliens and Predators fighting a dream come true. My two favorite film franchises were tied together.<br/><br/>As a kid, this was most exciting I already read all the Alien comics and the Predator books, but now Dark Horse comics brought something new to the table, Alien vs. Predator comics. I ate those babies up. I've been a huge fan all my life. Hell, the first video game I ever beat was a Final Fight style Alien vs. Predator game at the movie theater arcade (I got third place high score too). So you can tell I have had high expectations for this film ever since they started writing drafts for it in 96.<br/><br/>So time passes as I get older and although I don't read the books or comics anymore, I'm still an avid fan of both franchises. AvP2 happens to be my favorite First Person Shooter and I play it quite often so I haven't deviated from my love of the franchises completely. And once I heard about this movie I hopped outta my chair and jumped for joy, once I heard who was writing and directing it I mellowed out and shook my head in disbelief/shame.<br/><br/>But having said this, you know I'm hard to please. I'm a hardcore fan who wanted the best movie in the world, but found out one of Hollywood's worst well known directors was at the helm. I just saw AvP and what can I say? It was written and directed by Paul Anderson of Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil and Event Horizon fame. Who better to direct a film with the two biggest sci-fi franchises than the king of mediocre action films? But in all seriousness, it wasn't that bad. If you're a casual fan and liked any of the other Alien or Predator films you'll find something to like. As far as summer movies go, if you turn your brain off after walking in the theater you'll be able to enjoy the film for what it is. A popcorn flick made to show off alien species killing each other. <br/><br/>But for the hardcore Alien and Predator fans, there is a rich bit of research that was put into the making of this film. I would have to say this is director Paul Anderson's finest piece of cinema and you can tell he had a huge love for both series (he has stated in interviews Alien is his all-time favorite movie and he used to read the comics). The movie actually uses parts/ideas of the original Alien script (pyramid in Antarctica) and many elements of the Predator novels and comics. Anderson even goes as far into delving into the Predator comic-mythos as to show the young Predators blooding themselves (a ritual of smearing Alien acid blood over the forehead as a right of passage that originated in the Predator novels).<br/><br/>*Spoiler* He even barrowed a concept in a Predator novel I read a while ago where a woman proved herself when fighting a Predator and got blooded by the clan, then fought along side the Predator warriors. As a hardcore fan all these little nods to us franchise faithfuls made me smile as I watched the action blaze on screen. *End Spoiler*<br/><br/>So in many ways, Paul Anderson created an enjoyable film with a depth that I thought the film would be lacking. However there are many disappointing parts as well. While the story was plausible, it needed more time to fully develop on screen. The characters were as could be expected, a few good actors and a bunch of untalented fodder that were hired for their ability on how well they screamed for their death scene. The special effects however were in my opinion brilliant. I'm so glad Anderson went with the classic man in monster-suit instead of making everything in CGI. It just looks so much more real using real effects and not relying on computer animations. Not one time when I looked at an Alien or Predator did I question weather the creature was real or not, the costumes were truly convincing.<br/><br/>However my main complaints are these few things: They changed the Predator's mouth for some unknown reason and I think it looked much better before. They slimed the chin down making the mouth smaller so when the tusks spread the mouth wasn't as wide and appeared small. Another beef I have with this film is the matrix bullet time effect was used on several occasions. Nothing pisses me off more than the bullet time effect. However this travesty can be overlooked, but my head still shakes in shame when I see it. And of course you cant have a Paul Anderson film without cheesy dialog and an awkward moment.. This film had both. Cheesy lines were spouted off by many of the 'fodder' and thanks to Andersons 'brilliant' directing skills he managed to turn an awesomely badass scene of a Predator blooding a human into a quasi-romantic scene between the 2 creatures I half expected them to make-out on screen. However the idea of a human being blooded is still cool. I just think the scene was paced wrong, and it fell though because of that.<br/><br/>Lastly what bothers me is that the film needed another 30 to 40 minutes to have fully been a great film. The most likely reason why the film was cut though was to make it into theaters for those ADD kids with short attention spans. Because I know Anderson said in an interview he was going for an R rating so he could add in more fun stuff, but then Fox stepped in and said he had to cut it down to make a PG-13 rating (so they could get more revenue in box-office sales) and said he needed to shorten the film to better suit 'movie goers'. Here's to the hope of a director's cut with 30 minutes of added footage, and hopefully a little more gore (there weren't enough human slaughters shown on screen and I think that Fox and the MPAA made them cut it out to get a PG-13 rating for a broader audience). <br/><br/>*Spoilers* My last complain comes in the fact that 2 of the 3 Predators are offed in the first 20 minutes of their appearance, by only 1 Alien no less. In the comics it took at least 4 Aliens to take down 1 Predator. However that same Alien was the main antagonist through the remainder of the film, and was a major badass of an alien, if that makes up for it. Also the fact that they made a Predailen at the end of the film was rather silly in my opinion, but at least a clever nod to the Alien Vs Predator videogames on the computer. *End Spoilers* <br/><br/>But overall as a hardcore fan of both franchises I can confidently say this is Paul Anderson's best effort in cinema and an agreeable Alien/Predator film, while also being a monster movie that can be enjoyed by anyone.. That is, if they don't have a stick up their ass when walking into this film. I can only hope that the DVD will have a director's cut with a bit more gore."
"jeffreydoneil","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," Maybe matinée prices. Full price? No way
","Okay, first off this IS going to have some spoilers...<br/><br/>I was actually pretty impressed with this movie, after seeing ""Alien Resurrection"" my hopes had pretty much died for the Alien franchise. But then this movie comes along and I think that it just needs a little CPR. The small things that did irk me could just be a product of my overly anal mindset. Or could be some plot points that were either intentionally left out or (gasp) ignored altogether. Like:<br/><br/>1. The growth time for the aliens is way disproportionate compared to the other movies. They basically had full grown aliens after 30 min. Okay, the predators couldn't very well be stomping all the baby aliens for 87 min, not much movie there. And the incubation times were all messed up too. But okay film does have to move along.<br/><br/>2. The first predator goes down without a fight, Second one puts on a good show, and yet is still lacking. I'm thinking, These are the guys who are so bad, that it took Arnold to take them down. But then I remember that ""Oh yeah so did Danny Glover"". But still, They should have been a bit tougher to bring one down, at least take more than one alien to do it with.<br/><br/>3. The Predators were pretty willing to show themselves to everyone fairly early on, but then again the movie is soooo short I guess they did wait until halfway through.<br/><br/>4. I thought their tagline was ""Whoever wins. We lose"" not ""Neither side is going to win, and to be quite honest, we don't lose either"". I mean you'd think we'd wise up after a while with movies like Freddy vs Jason so fresh in our memories. But sure enough, to make one side win would just be impossible. It felt like calling the all-star game a tie all over again. When it comes down to it, I want one of them to win, not this we both win crap.<br/><br/>5. Then again, since we're joining the universes, what happened to all the predators in the future? Logic tells me that since a) the ""Alien"" side has never mentioned the Predators b) but the 2nd Predator movie shows an Alien skull at the end. Therefore i can only come to the conclusion that the Aliens did win and the predators are extinct at that time. Or maybe no one had even thought of the Predator movies at the time when Alien was being made. hmmmmmm....... <br/><br/>I'm sure the rest of you have seen other things in this movie that you'll point out but for me it wasn't a bad movie. For all the shortcomings, mainly the runtime, It is a good movie. And for each negative point, you could also find a positive point. I am glad I saw it in the theater, just wished it wasn't full price."

","Okay, I just saw this movie last night and have some things to say about it.<br/><br/>First, I was/am a big fan of the original Predator/Aliens movies. Their sequels were alright. I was/am a huge fan of the darkhorse comic series Aliens/Predator/Aliens vs Predator. <br/><br/>Now, about the movie.<br/><br/>1. Length: Too short 2. Special Effect: mostly fabulous except the end fight scene....some pretty cheesy CG there....overall, the mix of CG and puppets/suits was really good 3. Action: Very good....for the whole 10 minutes of it. Overall, there was little hard core action. 4. Character Development/Script: Okay, this was really, really weak. <br/><br/>Character Development.....now being a fan of the original movies/comic book...I was expecting a good movie but I was also expecting to discover a new ""Hero."" However, character development is incredibly poor. After the movie, I asked my friend who had been the main chick!!?? (Lexx btw). I could not, and did not identify with any of the characters (except maybe that Italian guy).<br/><br/>The script...this was really really weak!!??? First, why bring down automatic weapons to Antarctica? Second, how come the Aliens take such little time to gestate in their hosts??? Third, Who Wrote The Characters Lines??? They were probably worse than a Steven Segal movie....no, they were worse. Wow, talk about crappy dialogue!!??<br/><br/>Basically, the Director relies on a great CG/Puppets and some good (but short) action to compensate for his total lack of character development/script.<br/><br/>To sum up...this movie does have some strong points (especially for die hard Aliens/Predator fans) but overall, it was a disappointment. Personally, wait for it to come to DVD or at least the cheap theater (if you have one available). <br/><br/>Overall rating: 4.5/10"
"Jigsaw1999","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," 20th Century Fox's ""We'll let anyone direct a feature"" program
","I'd like to personally take this opportunity to congratulate 20th Century Fox for their ""We'll let anyone direct a feature"" program, as well as congratulate Paul W.S. Anderson for participating! I really hope someone can get me an application before the end of this year so I can apply, because when you see a studio and a director set the bar this low, how the hell can you fail? <br/><br/>I can't believe 20th Century Fox spent over $70 million on a film that effectively destroys two of the greatest monsters ever to grace the silver screen. What's worse, I can't believe I spent $10 to see it in the theater on opening night. If you're looking for a movie in which the Predators (which look like they're suffering from Down syndrome thanks to the special effects team under Paul W.S. Anderson's guidance) battle the worst CGI aliens ever conceived on film...then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that neither Paul W.S. Anderson nor any of the studio executives involved in the making of this film have a handle on story in this laughable movie (and I'm not kidding...during the screening, the audience broke out in unintentional laughter several times over the stupidity of the plot). The movie starts off with great possibilities. Lance Hendrickson is fantastic in his short-lived role as the dying leader of an expedition that finds an ancient pyramid buried under the ice. And the elimination of the investigating team by aliens and predators, as well as some of the battles that follow, is fantastic. <br/><br/>But the movie quickly takes a turn for the worsea common ailment in all of Anderson's films. <br/><br/>When the surviving teenage Predator and the movie's only remaining human character (our heroine), played by Sanaa Lathan, become ""friends"" and he fashions a warrior's outfit out of the hide of a dead alien for our hero, the movie was over for everyone in the theater. <br/><br/>Speaking of whichdo you remember the original Predator? Do you remember how big the predator was when it was battling Arnold Schwarzeneger? Well, evidently these predators are suffering from some alien form of stunted growth or Sanna Lathan is a giant of a woman. In the final scenes where Sanaa runs side-by-side with a predator, she is about the same size as the mighty hunter.<br/><br/>The film is filled with ridiculous moments and some of the worst cliché dialogue ever uttered. 20th Century Fox should be firing executives over this.<br/><br/>Alien Vs. Predator. ""Whoever wins, we lose."" Just a clever tag line? Make no mistake...it's the newest studio gimmick: truthful advertising! This is one to be avoided. It's the closest I've ever seen a film come to duplicating the smell of a drunk passing gas."

","Just a horrible movie..(I thought it was a comedy as much as I was laughing at the 5th grade level dialogue/acting etc) But the honors for worst scene was when Lex and the Predator were running together away from the explosion. Laughed out LOUD!! The script is horrible with huge loop holes it stops making sense early on and dwindles into the lowest form of crap. Let me know what you think. The Predator was awful, the alien was pretty good. Sloppy looking face huggers, a lot of stuff looked fake. The director just lost his eye for detail. A poorly made film with a horrible ending.

","This movie was okay, but it could have been much better.<br/><br/>Let me start with the bad news:<br/><br/>1. Predator Vision Should have used infrared (red & blue), not orange. Plus the was not much sound at all.<br/><br/>2. Character Development Terrible. I felt like we only get to know 2 or 3 characters in the movie (Lex, Sebastian, Weyland). Since the movie was too fast, Anderson should have spent more time developing the other characters. I just got tired of seeing humans getting picked off and not knowing their name, motivation, etc. <br/><br/>3. Killings As mentioned above, humans got picked off too quick. I wouldn't even know half their names if I had not read the book and the IMDb credits.<br/><br/>4. Cinematography Camera was too quick.<br/><br/>5. Score Sounded awful at key moments, like the first Predator death scene. Also, sounded really corny when Predator showed his face to Lex. I thought they were going to kiss or something.<br/><br/>6. Fight Scenes Only like 2 or 3 Alien/Predator fight scenes. Since this is an AvP movie, there should have been a lot more. Maybe if he'd of stuck to 5 predators and didn't make them get killed so quick, then we would have more fight scenes. <br/><br/>7. Contradictions In Alien 3, were learn that Aliens don't kill humans who are carrying alien embryo. We know the Predator is carrying one, but aliens try to kill it, and eventually do. <br/><br/>Lex said that the cold could freeze you in 3 minutes. But she seemed to be out their with the Queen a lot longer than 3 minutes.<br/><br/>8. Flat Out Ridiculous If Predators can see aliens inside of humans, then why the f*ck would they bring a dead predator on board their mothership when he has an alien inside it?<br/><br/>If the water is frozen, then how the heck can the Queen drown so deep?<br/><br/>Now the good news:<br/><br/>1. Plot Thought it was decent and interesting. Could have been better if the movie was longer to allow the tension to build up.<br/><br/>2. Shifting Pyramids The claustrophobia adds to the suspense. But again, the movie was just too short. They could have extended it. For instance, when Verheiden and Miller were trapped, Verheiden should of at least killed some of those aliens.<br/><br/>But here is the kicker. Despite the disappointment that this film was, the audience actually clapped at the end. I am not kidding, no one walked out like I hear others did in other theaters. The question is, were they clapping because they were entertained or were they clapping because it was finally over?<br/><br/>In conclusion, Anderson sucks, f*ck you Fox for ruining my summer and 14 years of anticipation, but it was okay."

","I can't believe all the critics ripping this flick. It's an irrational feeding frenzy for a movie that was quite satisfying, though much too short. You can tell that plenty was left on the cutting room floor to achieve that PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Still, the story was extremely clever. Predators come down to earth, share advanced technology with humans and are worshiped as gods. In return, humans agree to sacrifice some folks so that the aliens can breed inside them. Once the little aliens pop out, the predators prove their machismo by hunting the aliens for sport. <br/><br/>Put the story in 2004, add a hot chick (Sanaa Lathan), and that's an A+ story line in my book.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the plot development is boring and fragmented. Once the action starts, though, the cream rises to the top. The last predator standing befriends the hot chick and they team up to open a can of whoop-ass on the aliens. As usual, the aliens' demise is less than certain, leaving an opening for a sequel. Let's hope we see more alien vs. predator of 2 hour length with an R rating.<br/><br/>As an aside, the trailers don't do justice to the movie. In fact, they seem to have no relation whatsoever to the story line. ""Whoever wins, we lose"" has squat to do with the film. Fire the ad agency who came up with this tag line 'cause it sucks.<br/><br/>In fact, the predators would seem to be our friends in a sadistic sort of way, sharing their technology in return for a few human sacrifices so they can get their jollies hunting aliens.<br/><br/>Bottom line: critics suck, trailer sucks, film too short, shouldn't be PG-13, and can't wait for the sequel!"

The action was pretty good, although the movie would be way better if it was rated R and had some of the blood like in Alien 3. At least the thing had some plot in it, because all the people had a reason to be there. The Predators seemed like a bunch of punks without their guns at the beginning but the one Predator at the end was a bad ass. I didn't understand at the beginning why the queen was chained up but when the story unraveled it made since. The idea about the Predator and the women joining forces to kill the aliens was pretty stupid but the movie had to end somehow. Who didn't see that ending coming because if you had half a brain you could see it coming."

","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>In short: AVP takes two decent movie franchises, strips away any tension or humanity from the plot, and produces an end result strangely similar to Jurassic Park (starting with the recruitment of the scientists at the beginning and continuing on down to the T-Rex style Queen at the end).<br/><br/>The story and the dialogue are inane (""the first glyph is Egyptian, the second Aztec, the third Cambodian""...at least TRY to insult my intelligence, for goodness' sake).  Unlike its predecessors (especially ""Alien""), AVP doesn't bother trying to develop its characters; the heroine does not fill Ms. Weaver's alien-fighting boots and only provoked laughter from the audience that I watched the film with (particularly the silly scene where she is given a spear and a shield made out of an alien carcase).  There is none of the horror or spookiness of ""Alien"" or ""Predator"".<br/><br/>This was more like a video game, which may be intentional marketing - there were certainly plenty of basement-dwelling geeks hyperventilating in the audience after the extended alien-pred brawl scene."

Good points:  Coherent plot that does not try to tie into the previous films; excellent alien monsters and queen;  loved the predator's bad attitude; Lance Hendriksen; a couple of good showdowns between the predators and aliens.  Bad points:  The whole rest of the cast; many of the early predator/alien contacts too jumpy--I just HATE those quick cuts; too few really good encounters--I felt a little cheated that the movie wasn't longer with a few more good one on ones between aliens and predators.

The way the movie filmed, granted it's supposed to be dark underground, it took away from the finer movements that were not clear because of the bad lighting.

","Not too bad, not too bad. I don't think I wasted that much money seeing this one. Not only does it provide great special effects (and yes, a lot were non-CG), but it provides the suspense and action that any Alien/Predator fan will enjoy. There were no smartguns, SADARS or flamethrowers in this one, but that's alright. The trailers don't really do the movie justice. I went in thinking the movie was going to be really bad (some say it was, and that's their opinion). It turned out to be well done even though James Cameron sat out this time. One problem: the ending. You'll agree with me if you've seen it. Overall, a pretty good movie, and one that most should see. And remember: if you step outside the AvP mind frame and just concentrate on the war between humans, aliens and predators, you'll like this movie a lot more. Think of it as Saving Private Ryan with acid gorged ""lizards,"" menacing armored hunters and terrified people, and it will all make sense..."

","Spoiler I saw the movie and i must say i liked it,but as with every movie there are things that people don't like. I cant say i cared for the way that the predators were treated like bitches. My biggest concern was that i feel in the some parts of the movie it was rushed just to get it over with and end the movie. for example, when the first pred died, it happened pretty quick, then the next fight scene with alien and pred took about 2 minutes but was rushed when they decided to let the alien kill the pred that had been kicking his ass. I except that the pred died but not by the little mouth from the alien, thats just saying they had no other way to kill him so lets just kill him he isn't a main char. We wont get started on how the humans died left and right. I am not knocking the movie, i loved it, but i just felt rushed with some of the deaths, one last thing is... how many times did they put the alien symbol in the movie, we know the symbol we have seen it and or own the collection, its all over the box."

","I just want to say one thing, how does anyone figure Alien to be as strong as pred? think about it... in aliens 6-7 marines kill more then their fair share of aliens, they kill a ton and that was just a few humans. In predator, one predator kills a whole commando team by himself. save for arnold who pretty much won by dumb luck for a few reasons. so by the transitive property if a few humans can kill a lot of aliens and one predator can kill a lot of humans, then predator should be able to spank aliens ass with ease. just a thought.<br/><br/>""you sat down with the mad Russian and he emptied your pockets"" -Edward Norton, Rounders"

","I saw this movie tonight, and it was horrible. The script wasn't quite as bad as Pootie Tang, but it belongs in the same category: Crap! In addition to that, the acting was pathetic. The director even managed to get a bad performance out of Lance Henrikson, who is usually good in his films. The bad thing is, I actually like the director of this film. I enjoyed Resident Evil and Event Horizon. But it makes me wonder how RE2 will turn out with him writing the screenplay. The effects in AVP are alright, but nothing to get worked up about. There are a couple of plot holes and plenty of annoying characters, as with just about every horror film ever made. This one is just so sub-par. Trust me when I tell you that you can make better use of 90 minutes than to see this film. Go rent Alien and Predator at your local video store. Then, after you've watched them, use your imagination to think up a movie where the two legends meet and have a war. I am sure whatever you come up with will be better than the garbage that is wreaking havoc on your local theatre."
"kerryman86","6","0","0","13 August 2004"," promising premise falls short of expectations
","The recent additions to the Alien and predator sagas have fallen short of their original first films. Alien, Aliens and the original Predator are the classics that set the stage for countless imitations. Alien 3 lacked the suspense or action that the first two films possessed while the 4 installment was so awful as to not be worthy of the being considered a true alien movie. Predator 2 also was a mediocre attempt at capitalizing on the first films successes (it should be noted that the original was Arnold's true break out film as his marketability rose substantially after this movie's release, a feat unable to replicate). In combining the two genres in the much anticipated aliens vs. predator we have a film that could have been much better, much worse but managed to be in the middle. First critical point was the overuse of bad music (why not keep with the original scores of either aliens or predator), another sore point why did the film take place on earth why not follow the plot of the hugely successful video game Aliens Vs. Predator 2, budget perhaps?, it also lacked the claustrophobia that the first or second films had, also the action started too quickly, the people died to easily for you to care. The dialog between the grunts lacked the authenticity of the rapport that bill Pullman had with his fellow marines in aliens finally the new heroine in this movie lacks the magnetism or authenticity that Sigourney weaver offered Ripley. In short go to see it to get out of the house not too view another classic in the making."

","**Warning: Spoilers ahead**<br/><br/>I should have seen this coming. When I first heard that Paul W.S. Anderson was going to be directing this movie, I was really worried. With Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, and Soldier under his film-making belt, I wouldn't have really considered him to be the best choice to direct a movie with two of the greatest sci-fi creatures ever. But when I saw some pre-release internet featurettes with Anderson talking about his plans for Alien vs. Predator, I immediately got the sense that he really wanted to make great movie. His enthusiasm for the subject matter convinced me to give him a chance. Now that I have seen Anderson's finished product, I should have realized that wanting to make a good movie, and actually making a good movie are two completely separate things.<br/><br/>The plot of AvP centres on a pyramid that was discovered in Antarctica by the Weyland Corporation. The corporation's owner, Charles Bishop Weyland, heads up an expedition to the site, only to stumble into a battle between the aforementioned Aliens and Predators. The premise of the story is a little hokey, but I was willing to forgive it because the story's main purpose was simply to find a way to have these creatures be in the same room with each other, which was all I cared about.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was at best stale, and the dialogue that came out of these actors' mouths was worse. Lines such as 'it's like finding Moses' DVD collection' were just some of the things in this movie that made me roll my eyes back. Also, even after a long speech detailing how not to explore anywhere alone, as soon as the explorers arrive on Antarctica what does one of them do? He explores an abandoned building alone (my eyes are facing the back of my skull at this point). Still, knowing that this is a Paul W.S. Anderson movie I expected this. I will say though that there was one bright acting spot in this entire movie, and that was Lance Henriksen. He plays the sullen Charles Weyland (as well as the android Bishop in Aliens and Alien 3), and is the only person who was able to pull of a decent acting job.<br/><br/>My one major complaint with this movie is the fact that it focuses too much on the human characters. If I recall this movie was named 'Alien Vs. Predator' not 'Watch the Humans Run Around Scared'. My guess is that director Anderson thought that by focusing on the humans and their plight it would create a meatier story. Now don't get me wrong. I think it's great that Anderson wanted to add more depth to AvP, but I went to see this movie with one single purposeto see Aliens and Predators kick each other's asses.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it takes about 30 minutes before we get to the first fight (and I should note this is only a 90 minute movie), and when they were not fighting the movie was (frankly) kind of boring. Also, there was this scene towards the end of the movie where the Predator and a human survivor (I won't say who) were running together with things blowing up behind them in slow-mo Matrix style. They were both acting so 'buddy-buddy' like and quite simply it looked out of place and incredibly cheesy, but you would have to see it to understand my full meaning.<br/><br/>If you are an impatient reader, you might have already scrolled down to the bottom of my review and saw my final score of 6 out of 10, and you are probably wondering why, after all the bad things I have said, would I give a score like that? Why not a 3 or 4 out of 10? Well, despite the movie's many flaws it does have a few good points. First and most obvious, the special effects in this movie are top notch. The design of the Predators' ship is just amazing. The costume design of the Predators and the weapons that they use are spectacular. Also, what few fight scenes between there are between the Aliens and Predators are jaw-droppingly good. Seeing a Predator twirl an Alien 360 degrees through stone pillars before throwing it against the wall was just plain cool. However, these few high points are not enough to save the movie.<br/><br/>I'll be honest though. Despite Alien Vs. Predator being a disappointment, I hope it does make a lot of money. By doing well at the box office, hopefully Fox will greenlight Alien 5 or Predator 3, or both. However, should Fox decide to make an AvP sequel down the road, they NEED a change of directors. I know this is just wishful thinking, but it would be great if Fox could get Ridley Scott (director of Alien), James Cameron (director of Aliens), or John McTiernan (director of Predator 1), because those guys could make an excellent AvP sequel. I would hate it if Anderson's Alien Vs. Predator is the last hurrah for two of the best sci-fi creatures in movie history.<br/><br/>I give Alien Vs. Predator 6 out of 10."

","Yee-Haw! What a fun, wild ride this was!<br/><br/>I thought this was Anderson's best work so far. (no, I'm not an avid Anderson hater like so many here on this board are) It had a pretty good storyline but the special FX totally stole the show. The Predators never looked cooler. The Aliens, along with their queen seem even more vicious than in the previous Alien films. The Alien effects were fantastic . Tons of slime, hissing and acid blood.<br/><br/>MINOR SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>The story is very similar to Aliens only instead of Ripley and the Colonial Marines, we get a scientific research team...who happen to have packed automatic weapons.. A team assembled by Mr. Weyland travels to the unknown only to come under attack by both the Predators and Aliens. Much of the cast, no, I take that back...all of them except one are fodder and end up with either an alien in their chest or a Predator's wrist blade slicing them up.<br/><br/>The sets are top notch...a lot of detail was put into them. The pyramid where much of the movie takes place in is enormous. It literally has everyone trapped ""Like rats in a maze"" as one chemical specialist/team member points out.<br/><br/>The cast is also surprisingly good. All except one. That goddam Italian professor Sebastian who feels the need to read some heiroglyphs every few minutes and tell the story matter of factly. (that's him in the very top picture) It's the way he speaks, as if us, the audience, are total morons and will only understand the events happening in the movie if he tells us. Aaagh! Needless to say, I wanted him dead and when my wish came true, oh man was it good. I thought for sure there was going to be one of those obligatory ""Kill me"" requests like in the previous Alien films but that never happened. Never in a movie has one character been so annoying. That was the one major drawback to the entire movie....one badly written character.<br/><br/>Another cool idea was the last surviving human and last surviving Predator teaming up together to fight. Many people will no doubt find that utterly ridiculous and the worst part in the whole movie but I found it to be a cool, fun and action packed team up. I thought it was a great idea. The last surviving human, who I shall not reveal, is lucky that it's a teenage Predator they hooked with and not an older one. An older one would've never considered such an alliance and probably would've gutted them on the spot. There is a reason why the Predator allowed that person to tag along and to find out, you'll just have to watch the film. I'm not telling.<br/><br/>Oh and another thing...everything I read about this film says that there are 5 teenage Predators... Nope. There are only 3.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film 3 1/2 out of 5 stars. It was a fun popcorn flick."

I was impressed with the combined use of CGI and animatronics/puppetry (almost Stan Winston-grade).<br/><br/>also, it was cool being able to see the predator use all his cool weapons. i wish i had that suit.<br/><br/>that's about it.<br/><br/>BAD THINGS: story was pretty lame. my friend told me it followed one of the AVP Dark Horse comic stories; i think that is what happened. the movie was basically a ""movie version"" of one of the comics, instead of a movie of the Aliens or Predator series. thus, its story was very cartoonish, simplish, and devoid of any character development. now, i wasn't expecting Citizen Kane here, but the dialogue was so cheesy at times and so ridiculous, people were laughing out loud in the theatre. another problem i had was how the film HAD to show exactly how the predators used to rule earth, etc etc...what about just some subtlety, and mystery? does everything have to be explained 100% for everyone so explicitly?! <br/><br/>and where was the blood? now, i wasn't looking out specially for guts, but it was so frustrating never seeing anyone get ripped in half, Bishop-style!!!!<br/><br/>several notable moments:<br/><br/><ul><li>the archeologist, within a few seconds, suddenly is able to fluently read the etchings and figure out exacty what the history was, blah blah blah. he also ""suddenly"" figures out, ""oh, yeah, the giant Tetris blocks move every 10 minutes"". </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>when the predator became all nice and made lex an honorory predator, with her own wittle alien shield and spear. awwwwww! they're so cute together! this is when the audience just started giggling. wtf!??!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the SLOW MOTION BAYWATCH RUNNING SCENE with predator and lex while the temple exploded behind them. come on. how could anyone not laugh at that moment. the audience was rolling on the floor at that point. what is this, some episode of Knight Rider?!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the denouement after the explosion, when the lex and predator got all intimate, looking into each other's eyes. predator-human love!!!! audience started making porno bass-line riff sounds here.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>i'm sorry, i can't think anymore. it just pisses me off.</li></ul><br/><br/>if i had expected more, i would have been sorely disappointed. overall it was a simple popcorn flick with action. it REALLY DOES NOT DO JUSTICE TO THE ALIENS OR PREDATOR FRANCHISES. it really should not even be considered part of those series. it should be considered a video-game-turned movie, and that's it."

","This wasn't necessarily a BAD movie, it just wasn't a very good one. I could go on and on about every bad scene (like a huge brawl between a Predator and an Alien that is very brutal and then moments later a different Predator killing an Alien in one stroke of a blade, or the VERY CHEESY scene of the Predator and Alexa running side by side like Batman and Robin) but I decided that the ending to this movie was what shot itself in the foot. Let me explain:<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the Predators could look inside (detailed X Ray to be exact) the humans' bodies (i.e. Wayland's lung problems, the alien inside of Sebastian's chest) but at the end of the movie an Alien pops out of the dead Predator's body in the Predator space craft. WHAT?!?!? How ON EARTH could a dozen (that we saw on screen) Predator's NOT see the Alien chestbuster inside of the dead Predator? Secondly, wouldn't the Predator have been able to communicate somehow with Alexa before he died to let her know that there was an alien inside him? Oh yeah, and I could be wrong, someone correct me if I am, but don't the Alien chestbusters die when their host is killed? BIG SCREW UP. I did like the movie very much until the Predator kind of ""tag teamed"" up with the woman (Alexa). After that it just got kinda weird and cheesy. They made the Predator too nice, even if it was just an ""adolescent"". All in all, I would pay to see this movie once just because it IS Alien Vs Predator even though they could have made this movie MUCH, MUCH better. <br/><br/>Last but not least Alexa's line ""You are one ugly mother..."" in reference to an Alien toward the end of the movie is a disgrace to Maj. Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger's character from the original Predator)."

","As a HUGE predator fan and solid Alien fan, I approached this movie with great anticipation. It turned out to be just average in my view - lots of potential that was not fully realized. Almost as if they had a time limit (90 minutes) that they couldn't exceed. Give this movie another 20-30 minutes to flush out a few things, add a few more sets, and build suspense...Oh well, still worth an afternoon viewing!<br/><br/>The aliens looked fairly good although I was a little disappointed by the Predator with his mask off. He looked a bit more ""rubbery"" than in previous films. The cast did well enough with the female lead stealing the show.

","AvP at first glance seems like it has a little potential. The predators looked pretty sweet in the previews and it had some sweet special effects. But after seeing this movie I have found myself doubting movie making and where it stands today. Taking two very good series and combining them to make a movie may have seemed like a good idea, but what worked in the comic books just doesn't play out on the big screen. The journey starts off with a group of archeolgist that venture off to Antarctica to explore a pyramid buried deep in the ice. They get there and discover the entire history behind its existence and why it was there in a mater of minutes. In a matter of hours everybody is dead. Even the characters that they tried to develop still have nothing to offer the viewer. Nothing came together in this movie, and i still cant believe how the ending occurred. Think of the worst possible thing that could happen to this movie while your watching it, it just might go there.The story doesn't stay true to the previous alien/predator films leaving me no choice but to give this movie a 3 out of 10 stars."

","As a longtime hardcore fan of both franchises involved, I am proud to announce that this movie got it right. The way these creatures function is very specific, and many things have only been hinted at in previous films, but were all dead-on in this movie (although the aliens seemed to gestate pretty fast... perhaps proximity to queen? psychic demand from queen for fast drones???)<br/><br/>The CGI is awesome and the effects are perfect. The creatures move PERFECTLY.<br/><br/>The plot isn't too strong, but this movie isn't about plot. This isn't, say, The Usual Suspects, or something. This movie is about a setting and a setup and some background, and then its about the events, and the struggle.<br/><br/>Lots of characters die in this film, of all species involved. This is rightly so, whenever these species clash, especially in this sort of setup. For one, the humans were grossly lacking any control or power, as they had no foreknowledge of anything that could happen. Think of how nearly everyone in Alien died, and that was just one creature! My recommendation is to not get too attached to anyone!<br/><br/>If you are a serious fan of Alien and Predator, don't listen to what anyone says about this movie, most of the complaints are just ignorance of the mythos."

There are so many possibilities to bring these two icons together and this is the best they could come up with. Everything about this movie was bad: local drama company acting, a horrible script (too many holes and clichés), way too much use of computer created images to carry the story (if you want to call it that), lots of quick cuts and shots to mask the poor action, not to mention a Rubics Cube of a pyramid and a bogus tag line - don't we help the Predator win?

","I am a big fan of both franchises and have been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I first heard the rumors like 8 years ago. I just got back from seeing it and it was a huge disappointment. I was expecting it to be silly and poorly acted but I was more correct than I should have been. I was at least hoping for a couple of good scary moments but that didn't happen. I would have to say that Paul Anderson definitely failed on this project that he somehow has been working on for two years. The original Predator was silly and poorly acted but it was still a great movie because of great action, characters, and some frightening scenes. The same can be said for at least the first two and maybe the last alien movies. I personally didn't like Alien 3 but thats beside the point. AVP should have been rated R just like the rest of the Alien and Predator movies. I read in an interview of Paul Anderson that he wanted to carry on the tradition of both franchises. He went down in flames on that point. Almost all of the deaths in AVP were either off screen or the camera was jumping around so much you could hardly tell what was going on which is hugely frustrating to watch. Well, I just wanted to voice my opinion and read what other peoples reactions were to this movie."
"Randomideas123","Null","0","0","13 August 2004"," Reason why invisibility might not have been used as much
","I haven't seen the movie yet, I'm going tomorrow, but just for future reference and to answer a question you had, I know why the Predators probably didn't use invisibility against the Aliens. If you played the video game (Aliens Versus Predator or the sequel on PC) You would know that invisibility is useless on Aliens, because the Aliens sense the pheramones that other creatures emit. Invisibility doesn't seal in your scent, so the Aliens could still sense the Predators, invisible and all by their smell. besides, stealth consumes energy slowly, and that same energy is used for the various energy-powered weapons, like the shoulder mounted cannon. Again, this is all from the games, but I think that the info is still relevant to the movie universe."

","When I saw the trailer for AVP, I was expecting a great movie. Action, adventure, obscure and made-up religious references, and suspense. I found myself shot down for all but the religion. I have never seen a more predictable movie. Even technical discrepancies in the movie were predictable. Every single time a character couldn't see the enemy, it was above them. You could even figure out the order in which the scientists would die. Most of the time, it was nearly too dark to see anything at all. The ending was possibly the most contrived you could expect. I was enjoying it despite the poor script until I saw the end, and all respect I had for the script writer left the building. However, I will say that it was well cast, and had superior effects and good scenery. Now add a decent script and you'd have a good movie."
"Trex21","6","0","0","13 August 2004"," A noble attempt
","Overall, it was about what I expected. Action-packed, little character development (from the humans that is), and a high enough body count to keep the fans happy. Non-fans will not enjoy it much, but they should know to stay away. A few scenes are laughable (not in a good way) but it should satisfy the viewers. PG-13 wasn't the way to go--it looks like a pale attempt to draw in families or teenagers. <br/><br/>There were a number of characters that had some potential, but the vast majority of humans didn't last long. When are producers going to realize that people need to have an emotional connection to the characters or we don't care when they die or are in pain, etc. I understand that the Aliens and Predators are the central characters but they are one-dimensional, we need more from the humans. Hopefully, a high-level director will want to take over either franchise. It can give some much needed life into the series."

During one particularly corn-fested scene, I fully expected the Predator to pull out an air guitar, flail away, and shout out a Bill and Ted-esque ""Whoah!"" This scene will stand out in my mind as one of the cheesiest Sci Fi moments of all time. All this aside, I will admit that the visuals are top notch, as well as the audio, which I have come to expect from Hollywood blockbusters these days, but when these elements are outstanding, it makes the final product all the more disappointing, when one thinks what might have been."

","Well I saw this movie last night.....And I myself have been waiting for it for a year or so now ever since I heard it was coming out. The director of this film is the same as the first Resident Evil.....And those of you who have played the games know that he made sure it did not follow them. He does the same in this movie. When you go to see this movie FORGET everything you have ever learned about Predators and Aliens, Because this movie doesn't follow any of it. Firstly when a person in this film gets impregnated with a alien baby it pops out in less than 5 minutes. But in all the other movies previous it takes a few hours to a entire day. Now Second.....Predator blades are made partially from Alien blood so that when they fight a alien the blades will not melt due to the acidic content of the blood. BUT! in this movie the blades melt. *ahem* Thirdly....I must say....this movie...has the WORST acting I have seen in quite awhile....well since the Matrix movies and Keanu Reeves. Fourthly.....The camera shots during a fight scene are just....how to say it...not on the fight scene. Example: Predator beating on the humans, camera shows humans on floor and predator's feet....continues to show feet of Predator and walls while you hear and see in the corner of the screen the humans getting owned. Not only that but this movie would try to do things that in the end wouldn't work out or make sense why they didn't do/notice things before. Example: Predator has alien on back, alien gets shot by a human, human is facing east towards the entrance to the pyramid....Predator turns and camera shows 5 more aliens standing....hanging out.....like they were watching a game of basketball on the local court. Now there is no way in all the Hollywood world that the human could not have seen the other aliens....and if seeing how the aliens are there I HIGHLY doubt they would just hang out and watch as one of their kind is slaughtered. Now....*AHEM* After about the first 5 minutes of the film it goes from switching locations continuously to simply utterly cheesy and contradicting. The CG is about the only good thing in this film. The direction, acting, makeup, costumes, camera work, plot, script, screenplay, storyboard and even the music is just a better to laugh at then actually take seriously. I REALLY tried to enjoy this film beyond A doubt I did, But in the end the only highlight of the evening was the Trailer for Resident evil 2, and the Credits signaling the end to the travesty of a film. ~~~2 1/2 out of 10.

While I was not expecting to be completely amazed by this film, knowing full-well that it could never surpass the original Alien or Aliens, I was indeed pleased with much of the film, itself.<br/><br/>The action, while poorly edited, was heightened by good effects and the storyline, while admittedly a bit far-fetched, was decent overall. I was also pleased to see the re- emergence of the insect-like head of the alien, complete with the translucent dome upon its crown from the first Alien film.<br/><br/>But quickly my favor for the film turns bittersweet. For one, as mentioned by other reviewers, having AVP be PG-13 after having six R-rated movies is potentially a bit dissuading. After all, an avid fan like myself wonders what unparalleled gore, frights, and effects may have been compromised for FOX to rake in some extra dough.<br/><br/>Secondly, and this one is a bit of a SPOILER, how do you kill-off a character in a movie that takes place several hundred years BEFORE his reappearance in a previously made film?

","To say that I had low expectations of this film would be an understatement. I expected butchery of all related materials - both the Alien and Predator film franchises, the Dark Horse comic series, and the various related video games. What I got was better than I ever expected; Anderson not only shows that he is a fan of the franchise, but faithfully adopts the material into a pleasurable experience for fans of the series.<br/><br/><ul><li>WARNING: EVERYTHING IS SPOILED BELOW -</li></ul><br/><br/>By ""faithfully adopts"", I mean that the movie is basically the first AvP comic series from Dark Horse. The time period and setting is changed, as are all the characters - but the basic structure and plot remains almost identical. At the same time, he expands upon some concepts and even weaves in a bit of historical conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie should be familiar to anyone who has a passing familiarity with the AvP franchise - a group of Predators have come to a planet (in this case, Earth), in order to test a batch of (assumedly) juveniles. But us Humans muck things up - and the overconfident Predator juveniles get slaughtered along with the Humans.<br/><br/>Just like in the first comic, the surviving Predator teams up with a robust Human female, who shows her worth by killing an Alien. She is Blooded and Marked by the Predator, who gives her the Predator's own Sigil. Together, they manage to destroy the Alien habitat, though the Predator is mortally wounded in the conflict.<br/><br/>This is where it departs from the comic's plot - the Predator's clan shows up, taking the remaining Predator's body back onto their ship. She is given a reward, like Danny Glover's character in Predator 2 - though this reward is certainly much, much better than an ancient pistol.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a reference to a creation of artist Dave Dorman, something that was incorporated into the AvP2 video game by Monolith. Numerous similar references are included in the movie - from Bishop's ""do the thing with the knife"" scene in Aliens, to Predator's ""You are one ugly mother-"" line. One of the characters also bears a striking resemblance to a model from AvP2.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear why I really enjoyed this movie - but I'm not sure how well it will do at the box office. The AvP comics are not nearly as widespread as Spiderman or X-Men, or even The Hulk or Daredevil - maybe along the same lines as Hellboy. I hope it reaches its core audience, because fans of AvP should *NOT* miss this excellent movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

I did however like the a much bigger view into the history (althought the storyline of aliens traveling to ancient time on earth is getting really old) and a look into their lives, when they are aboard the ship. I did however lose a lot of mystery and intrigue with both species. The thing that was great about the alien series was ya never knew anything about the history of the aliens or where they came from. AVP doesn't answer where they came form but showed a glimpse into their past. I also don't like movies where the characters have to explain what everyone or everything is doing in the movie as if we cant figure it out (example: when the Italian guy said the predator was marking himself, a thing great hunters do) I said I don't think the movie was horrible but someone that isn't a Alien and/or Predator fan will think its crap and wont be turned onto either saga."

"angelus-18","5","0","0","13 August 2004"," Decent Yet Unsatisfying
","Alien vs Predator is a film that isn't as bad as many people make it out to be. It isn't a great film by any stretch but bringing the Alien and Predator together on-screen isn't exactly an easy task, especially with 20th Century Fox pulling the strings. Paul W. Anderson seemed to impress them well enough with his concept and this is what Fox whipped up.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the film goes against continuity set in the Alien films by placing Aliens on present day Earth. They manage to get away with it however by setting the film in the remote region of Antarctica and keeping the Aliens beneath the surface. The setting is something I found to be fantastic about this film. I enjoyed the Arctic Whaling Station as well as the Pyramid beneath the ice. I wish more time was spent both on the surface and in the Pyramid to build up the atmosphere and tension of the film. The setting of the Pyramid was brilliant but it really wasn't used to it's full potential. Of course the reality of discovering a Pyramid so far beneath the ice is a stretch but we'll ignore that for now. If more time could have been used to create a sense of fear when wandering through the Pyramid, especially once separated from each other, the quality of the film could have been greatly improved. <br/><br/>As for the characters themselves... they were decent. I didn't hate any of them and some attempts at characterization where made but ultimately it feels as if they are rushed and just shoved upon us. I guess the trouble is that none of them are really that interesting and whether they live or die is of little consequence to us. Lance was definitely a welcomed addition to the cast, even if it goes against Alien continuity if you consider Bishop in Alien 3 to be human – this being the popular consensus.<br/><br/>Of course the real reason everyone wanted to see this film is because of the title creatures. While they are portrayed well enough although many issues are to be had with both. The Predators were not the Predators we had become accustomed to in the first two Predator films. They are bulkier and certainly aren't as wise as we have seen in the past. The wrist blades also appear different and perhaps the most notable change is the Thermal Vision. Many people feel the alteration of the Predators vision style severely hurt the quality of the film but it is never something that really bothered me. It was used well and the ""Alien"" vision mode the Predators had looked great. My only real issues was their wrist blades – I don't really mind the change of look but if your hunting a species with acid for blood shouldn't your primary weapon be more potent against them?<br/><br/>The Aliens, especially the Grid, were portrayed well although in behavior they seemed to shift between clever and mindless beasts throughout the film. The costume designs really aren't the greatest (they are the same suits as A: R with a black coat of paint) and the CGI appeared quite bad in certain parts. The Alien Queen however was fantastic and contributed to many great shots and moments in this film. <br/><br/>The name of this film however is ""AVP"" and that is one of the big let downs in this movie. There really weren't many scenes of Aliens fighting Predators. There was one major clash but not much beyond that. People who go to see a film titled Alien vs Predator expect to see lots of clashes between the two. The level of gore in this film is another reason it often faces criticism from series fans. I however don't think it is needed for there to be buckets of blood to make a good film. The PG-13 rating takes nothing away from this film what so ever. More Predator and Alien blood would have been welcome of course.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is an adequate film that would be greatly helped if fleshed out by 10-15 minutes of tension building scenes. Some people will argue it needs much more than that but I truly believe a few more quality scenes would help improve this film. The film really does start out with a lot of promise. It really does a fairly nice job of building up excitement yet unfortunately fails to deliver in the second half. More screen time for the title characters and certainly more duels would have made this film stand out a lot more. Once great element of the film is the cinematography as there are many beautiful shots in this film, especially on the Predator ship and within the Pyramid itself. The potential for this was great and the end result is all right but it could have been much more."

","I just went to see AVP. I have read some of the online reviews by just a few, all of them seem to be negative. Some said that the Predators are not well done, or that they do not live up to the Predators in the 2 previous titles, but they are all wrong, and it seems that they did not do their reading. I am not sure if this constitutes a spoiler or not, but Anderson was able to incorporate some of the material from the comics and novels into the movie, I wont tell you which ones however, you should see for yourself. Anderson had a big job ahead of him, and that was to satisfy all of us rabid Alien/Predator fans. I think he does the Job well, my only comment would be that the movie moves along very fast, which may or may not be the result of editing done to secure a PG-13 Rating, which despite the hype is really pretty acceptable. You get all the Predator and Alien action you need, and there is a decently constructed story line as well. Overall I think that those who have been bashing this movie because it did not meet their preconceived expectations have missed the boat entirely. Great Movie (B+/A-)"

","the movie was great. there are a few stupid moments though, but you almost have to expect that in order to enjoy the movie, we're only human. the movie's general idea for their story comes from the alien vs. predator books, ""hunter's planet"" and ""prey"". if you have read them then you will understand the movie better. i'm not really a fan of director anderson, but this is one movie of his i really enjoyed. ""resident evil"" was better than i was expecting when i saw it. if this film could of been longer and been able to show the moviegoers the history of how the predators actually use the aliens, the final rating would be much higher than what we will rate it on IMDb. i'll predict about a 6.5 on IMDb, but personally i give this one an 8!!! i imagine there will be many who will have harsh comments about this film, but i promise if you are a fan of the ""predator"" and ""alien"" movies and enjoy a good popcorn flick then you will enjoy this movie. have fun and enjoy.<br/><br/>8/10 i'd easily watch it again"

","The first change and the most important of all is the director. Paul W.S. Anderson said that he's the biggest fan of the Predator and Alien movies..... o.k. pal, STAY AS A FAN!!! You should be directing Disney movies.<br/><br/>Second change: The Predator facial make-up sucks!!! Stan Winston, were the hell are you??? The make-up effects in this movie has a made-in-a-garage-by-a-sorry-ass-fan look like. Plus they changed the Predator's original and flawless design. Shame on you!<br/><br/>Third change: the character's power. In this movie Aliens and Predators are equally matched! What tha F__k? Judging by film history, Predators are more powerful than Aliens. The Predator's skin and armor were immune to small arms fire, the Aliens also has this ability and in this film Aliens could scratch and even pierce the Predator's helmet, and a regular human can wound a Predator with a handgun! God damn!<br/><br/>Fourth change: Sound Effects... only certain sound effects..... Could you believe a Predator roaring like a lion and not the same way he did in the other films? The same thing for the Aliens. <br/><br/>Fifth change: The score. It doesn't include the original Alien or The Predator music score that we all know and love.<br/><br/>Sixth change: The Predator personality. It doesn't mimic at all the way Kevin Peter Hall moved, acted, reacted, all those wonderful movements that gave an unique stile to the Predator. The way I see it, The Predator died along with Kevin. Rest in peace my friend.....Plus... they didn't say a damn word in the whole movie. They could speak and understand English perfectly in the other films.<br/><br/>Seventh Change: The movie length..... only 90 f------g minutes! What were they thinking?<br/><br/>Final change for the day..... Restore the Predator's code of honor. He knew that he would die once the alien bursts from his chest. The enemy would defeat him and that is not acceptable for a proud warrior race. Normally he would self-destroyed himself but he didn't. And in the end a Predator-like alien bursts from his chest generating more mysteries than the movie solved...... damn!<br/><br/>This thought gave me a idea for a new A.V.P. movie...... Alien VS Predator 2 : The marked one's Revenge......<br/><br/>Plot: A new breed of alien has emerged.... and the Hunters thought that the Marked One will be honored to avenge her dead friend!

"jiolado","6","0","0","13 August 2004"," A let down
","As a huge fan of both the Alien and Predator films, and the comic/video game version of the series, this film was a major let down. Although the creature effects of the aliens were amazing, the CG was top notch & the fights (though few) were pretty sweet, this movie lacked in two major aspects it needed most...good story telling and at least some what decent acting. I wish that director Paul Anderson had spent more time on casting and creating a complex story to tell then just effects, since so many questions have been left unanswered in both the series and as to how they truly come together. They could have went much more in depth with Henriksen's Weyland character, and established how, when and exactly why Bishop came to be. They didn't really set the time frame well either, as to how. I wanted answers as to how Weyland appears in Alien 3, assuming that is much, much further in the future, yet does not even make it half way through this so-called prequel. <br/><br/>The first 3 Alien films had a strong lead character, Ripley, who really made the movie, Weaver's acting was great and really put you in the film. This movie tries to do so with it's new lead female character, but doesn't even come close. The film is way too rushed, in the prior Alien films, when a face-hugger attached itself to the victim, ready to lay it's demon seed into the unwilling chest, this was usually a long and dramatic time frame, while in AVP, the entire episode of being impregnated to having the creature burst through the chest literally came into play within seconds. When the anticipated scene of the predator removing his mask finally happened, frustration ran through my body. I thought we passed the point of bad creature design and effects when we left the low budget Predator 2 behind - the new predators, while they look amazing masked, look worse than the poor looking predators from the second film. The original 1987 predator still looks the best by far. The movie is worth checking out though for the effects (namely the alien) and fights, the last scene in the movie is awesome, and lives up to what the comic series intended. Although I was upset with how this film turned out, especially in the lack of story and horrible acting, I do hope it grosses a lot of money, in hopes that another sequel to the originals can come into play and hopefully succeed and live up to the originals."
"dmkay","4","0","0","14 August 2004"," The pits...
","Ah, what might have been.  AvP has to be one of my personally most anticipated movies ever.  And it's one of the most disappointing.  The problems with this movie are legion:<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>1) It's only 87 minutes long, and at least half that time is wasted on a boring setup that is neither believable nor entertaining.  The pace increases once the title characters FINALLY meet up, but by then there's only about half an hour left in the film.<br/><br/>2) The rules of the two series are monkeyed with.  Predators are only supposed to visit earth where it's very hot, as established in the first two Predator movies.  So where is this one set?  The South Pole, naturally.  The time an alien takes to gestate in a human was at least a day or two in ""Alien,"" but in AvP it only takes a few minutes.  And the alien blood apparently burns through the Predator's wrist blades and armor, but not their spears.<br/><br/>3) Certain scenes have either no setup or no payoff.  For example, when the Predators first kill humans, the scene starts with a human waving his green laser-sighted pistol around for no apparent reason.  This scene comes out of nowhere.  For a bit with no payoff, consider the creation of the ""netted"" alien character...it's seen twice, at least, and seems to be set up as identifiable for a reason...but nothing ever happens to that particular alien worth noting.  It's as if that alien was set up to do something special and then had its payoff scene cut out.  Another curious bit: Why did the lead African-American character and his buddies bring assault rifles? It seemed at first like they must have planned to capture/kill an alien, but nothing ever comes of that.<br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>1) There are some kick-ass Predator scenes.  And the idea of Predators using alien blood to mark themselves is cool.  The effects are OK.  But that's about it."

","Alien Vs. Predator<br/><br/>
	I had very high expectations of this movie because I, like many others, had been waiting for many years to see this adapted to film. I would like to state right now that I did enjoy this film and think it is an alright addition to both series. Now with that said, AVP does have its problems, some that hampered it very much. The following are my problems with AVP.<br/><br/>
1.Lack of violence<br/><br/>I am not saying that this needed to be some kind of epic bloodbath, but almost all violence was committed off-screen and what was done on screen was IMO barely worth a PG-13 rating. Much of what made great shots in previous films like chestburstings, Predator claw kills, and so on were all off-screen. It really did not seem fair to deprive die hard fans of these acts that are common in all the respective films of these series. Going for a PG-13 rating was by far the worst move that Paul Anderson could of done.<br/><br/>
2.Lighting<br/><br/>	Many of the action scenes were very poorly lit, and I had a hard time to make everything out that was happening. I understand that this took place in a pyramid 2000 feet under the surface, but it could have been a bit brighter for the viewer's sake. <br/><br/>3.Predators<br/><br/>	I don't believe that the Predators were adequately represented in this film. First off there should have been more than there were, and they should have been tougher. I wont give anything away but the movie doesn't seem to be fair in depicting which species are better. <br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>        Well, those are my main beefs with the film. I did enjoy it, but I just think it could have been better. The performance of who played Lex Woods was good, and the interaction between Predator and Human was interesting to say the least. I give this film 8/10, and I think any fan of either series  should see this film just to see what impact it may have on their series of choice. That and you may end up enjoying this film. I think this is a positive step in both series, and am interested and excited to see where it takes us. I just hope Paul Anderson or whoever does the sequels will take suggestions like mine seriously."

","I went into this movie not expecting too much.  I had purposely stayed away from most of the spoilers and previews.  All I saw going into the movie were the latest commercials for this crossover movie.  The setup is basic. Humans detect ancient pyramids in Antarctica and want to investigate. Surprise surprise the pyramids are from a time when the Predators used to be worshiped as gods.  This particular pyramid was used as a kind of training ground for young predator wannabes.  So you've got Aliens down below, Predators up above, and Humans getting caught in between.  Set up complete, now on with the movie.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie is purely for set up purposes and survives purely by the classic effect that horror movies have of setting you up for scary parts and making you jump out of your seat.  What I like about this movie is that the first third there is nothing to jump at and basically pokes fun that you are so ready for an Alien or Predator to jump out that it's downright hilarious after the fact.<br/><br/>When the Predators and Aliens start showing up the somewhat weak, but serviceable, setup and dialogue takes a back seat.  I was just telling my friend last week that I was disappointed that not many modern day movies survive or thrive with little to no dialogue.  Well this movie does a good job of that in the last 2 thirds.  There is very little dialogue especially after the star woman is the last survivor and meets up with last surviving Predator.  The result should be well received I hope.<br/><br/>Are there plot holes or inconsistencies?  Yes, there are.  One of funniest I thought was near the end when the Predators left star woman without a jacket and she didn't even have PN (perky nipples).  Heck!  It's the South Pole and I never noticed that their breath was showing up.<br/><br/>If you can put that aside, then I think what we have here is a movie that is at least on the same playing field as the original movies, Predator and Alien.  Now I hope everybody goes to see this crossover so that we can look forward to a sequel which I hope fills us in on some of the teasers they left for us.<br/><br/>I gave this 8 out of 10."

But to my surprise, its not that bad!<br/><br/>The Bad: Directing was a bit weak, a film of this stature required a much more talented director..but most any director with some talent could have done a better job, at least one whose skill was equal to the hype of the film.<br/><br/>The Humans, their dialogue is just plain stupid.

","Most movies I have seen that are based on video games have turned out to be brain fodder with the exception of ""Resident Evil"" and now ""Alien vs Predator"".<br/><br/>I thought they did a very nice job combining the two alien creatures into one movie, although I think I noticed on glitch in their time line.<br/><br/>If the ""predators"" only visit earth every 100 years (1904 to 2004 was 100 years) as described in ""Alien vs Predator"", then what were they doing here in 1987 and 1989 ? Are we dealing with two different ""sects"" of predators who alternate their visits to Earth ? Or what ? It was never explained in the movie.<br/><br/>Other than that, I loved the way the movie flowed and the way the characters eventually interacted with each other in the end. The predators, with all their advanced technology, eventually had to cooperate with us lowly humans to achieve a common goal.<br/><br/>I guess the moral of that would be that we should ever assume that we're superior to less advanced civilizations because we never know when we'll become dependant upon those lesser civilizations for their help or for knowledge we need."

Maybe closer to bland as they explain everything that is going on before the war commences. But the second half is great if not a little predictable at some moments. Watching the alien races battle is more fun than you would think, for everytime it seems that one side is winning, the other side bounces back with glory. And then it happens again, and again, then vice versa, and one more time for good measure.<br/><br/>hands down the best part of the film is when they are fighting. it is also pretty interesting to see the Predators interact with the humans after they realize that they will not survive without each others help.<br/><br/>
The pyramid has a few unexplained areas however. One example would be how it is always changing when there isn't a true power source that is capable of doing such a thing. the film explains that this pyramid has been changing shape every hundred years so the Predators can come back and perform coming-of-age hunts with the Aliens, who are released again and again as a result of the transformations.<br/><br/>Overall not bad, but it could have been better if some areas were a little more explained.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

","Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of both the Alien and Predator franchises. I had been waiting for this film since the very first day I came across the ""Aliens Vs Predator"" mini-series from Dark Horse in the fall of 1990 at the wee age of eight years old. I have been following the evolution of this idea to the silver screen ever since.<br/><br/>Midnight. August 12th. My 14 years years worth of wait comes to an end. I wasn't expecting anything superior to ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"" -- unlike most of the fanboys on all the forums -- just a fun time at the movies and the return of my two favorite creatures to the big screen. I got what I was expecting -- though perhaps a little less. <br/><br/>Let me just break it all down like this ...<br/><br/>Great creature effects courtesy of Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis -- especially concerning the Aliens. I didn't really care for the altering of the mandibles on the Predators though. That was my only gripe with any of the creature effects. Everything else was very adequate.<br/><br/>Great special effects courtesy of John Bruno (a veteran FX master of such great effects-laden films as T2 and True Lies amongst many others). All the computer generated imagery is damn near close seamless. By far the best (and most epic) effects of any film in either series.<br/><br/>Quality action through out -- though I will admit the PG-13 does hamper a good deal of the proceedings. I wasn't expecting it to be so obvious after witnessing the overt amount of violence in recent films like The Chronicles Of Riddick and The Lord Of The Rings -- but it most definitely was at certain points (Namely because of the obvious edits made by Fox in order to ensure a lower rating than ""R"" to attract younger audiences.<br/><br/>My main problem didn't lie with the the direction, writing, acting, etc. I actually thought all of the above was just fine. Its not all on par with the greater films of either franchise -- but (as I said prior) I wasn't expecting that. I can say it was definitely an improvement upon Alien - Resurrection (though I know that really isn't saying much).<br/><br/>My main problem with AvP is the obvious meddling from 20th Century Fox. Here's just a few of the obvious indications that AvP was given SEVERE cuts prior to release. The script for this film is 110 pages long. Its a common fact that one page of a screenplay equals one minute of screen time. AvP is nowhere near 110 minutes in length if you subtract the EXTREMELY long ending credits. Further proof that numerous edits were made is the lack of crediting co-screenwriter Shane Salerno in the final cut of the film. Another fact -- the tracklisting for the official film score (which really wasn't all that good or bad) lists ""1904"" as the score's opening -- yet the scene in 1904 is completely absent from the final cut.<br/><br/>All in all -- a sufficient way to kill 2 hours of boredom if you are a casual fan of action / sci-fi hybrids. There were two showings at the theater where I saw AvP and both were full of extremely young people. Nobody older than myself (21) and most everybody who was a casual fan had a great time and began clapping and cheering at all the right parts.<br/><br/>I really don't know what to say if you are a devout fan of Alien and Predator like I am though. I guess you should all go see it to satisfy your curiosity. Just don't go into the theater with high expectations. Its not so much like an Alien or Predator film as it is your average creature feature of the summer. <br/><br/>At least there's hope for the director's cut DVD -- as there is surely a copy laying in wait for release after witnessing the many obvious edits through out. A few extra scenes of character development and plot setup would surely be a welcome addition (and most surely exists on the cutting room floor at 20th Century Fox)."
"st_riot","Null","0","0","14 August 2004"," Cool but bad, and can someone debunk my observation?
","The movie was cool and the effects were pretty good (preds couldve been a little more menacing), but everything happened way too fast. From gestation to deaths to fights to 'plot' advancement (whats this? oh **** get out! OK phew). It was all too hurried to be anything near the epic clash it should have been. Little and meaningless character development, and too much focus on pointless crap. Many things were just not believable. Seriously, why do people let scenes through in which a 'scientist' enters a room and upon a brief glance at some symbols, has assimilated the dialect and has an in-depth synopsis ready for recital?<br/><br/>Also, correct me if I'm wrong, or I at least missed something, but consider the following: 1. Alien and Aliens both dealt with the Weyland Corporation, 'The Company'. Ripley blew up their ship in 1 and Burke was pissed about it in 2. 2. Ripley was in stasis for 57 years between Alien and Aliens. 3. The real Weyland, model for the line of androids which Bishop belonged to, appeared in the end of Alien 3, knowing all about the species and wishing to get a specimen (just like Burke in 2). As far as I remember, he didn't die in 3.<br/><br/>(some obvious spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>So then, if in AVP, this is THE Mr. Weyland, why doesn't he recognize the facehugger/xeno sculptures on the walls? Or the telltale burst chests? Why doesn't he recognize the xeno when its right in front of him? This would lead us to believe it took place before the Alien series... except it obviously Didn't, since he DIED. Plus, if Weyland Corp was made well-prior to Alien, and was still around in Aliens, and this guy is THE Weyland (presumably the founder), its hard to imagine he would still be alive. The exact timelines aren't given, but youd have to stretch to make any sense of it. Don't give me any cloning or next-of-kin bs, the way it was presented just didn't make sense. Why is that?"

I have to say that almost ruined it for me as I have been anticipating this film for years. All the hype about the PG-13 rating and the lack of press screenings is unfounded. I guarantee that most of the main stream press who see this film will pan it. But this film isn't for the main stream press...it is a piece of candy for die hard fans of the genres and franchises. It wasn't meant to be an award winning epic....just a little bang for your buck to pass a summer evenings time. So with guarded anticipation and a deep breath I settled in for what I expected to be a flop. I was actually relieved and surprised at just how alright this movie was. Of course the plot left a lot to be desired, of course the acting was so-so, of course there were a lot of cheap thrills...but isn't that what a summer movie blockbuster should be?<br/><br/>To make a long story short, if you are a fan of the franchises looking for a serious and groundbreaking sequel to both franchises...forget it you will not find it here. But...if you are a fan of the franchises who likes to sit in a dark theater, with a big tub of popcorn, and likes to be just entertained...you will probably get a kick out of this film. For all those overcritical whiny poor sports who were apparently expecting to see an Oscar contending film with Tarantinoesque dialogue, Spielberg's visionary touch, and Shyamalan's knack for originality and context...get a life and lighten up...you need to come up for air sometimes.

","Okay, so, there's going to be a few spoilers in here, and I'm not going to work to hard at filtering them out, so, deal. <br/><br/>First, lets start with some of the things everybody's bitching about, eh?<br/><br/>1) A Girl and her Predator. I've read lots of so called ""fans of the franchise"" pan this idea, but as one person I noticed pointed out, this was actually a feature from the original Dark Horse AVP comic book, so if you ARE a real ""fan of the franchise"" you'd know this, and understand why it was included. Could she have been a more developed, and interesting character? Yes, but that leads to bad thing #2<br/><br/>2) The humans were all ""cardboard, flat"" characters. Well, duh. It's ALIENS vs PREDATORS. Granted, Fox could have tried finding a script that had characters we cared about, lets not forget that essentially, and this is commented on in the big ""centuries old flashback"" sequence that in this conflict, and this temple specifically designed for this conflict, humans are the cannon fodder. They're meat for the grinder, and they're given as much sympathy as a cow in the slaughterhouse in this film, and perhaps that's fitting, eh?<br/><br/>3) 2 of the 3 Predators get trashed too soon. Well, hrm, lets think, they're basically the equivalent of a 16 year old taking their driver's examination, they're not all going to pass. Duh. It's safe to presume that the Predators in the Predator films were full blown adults, hunting solo, who had proven their mettle. The Predators in this movie however, are not proven. It shouldn't surprise anybody that they get killed. They just weren't good enough to survive. Duh. It is a test.<br/><br/>4) The alien gestation rate seemed WAY off. Why, yes, yes it did. It only took minutes. As the films progressed however, the gestation rate of the aliens went from days, to hours, to minutes, so, in a sense it kind of follows a trend there. Secondly, a little creativity, god forbid, on the part of the audience and the idea that the freshness of the eggs may be a factor in the gestation rate ""solves"" this problem. Alien's eggs were decades, or centuries, old. Aliens, I don't recall clearly if we even see a chest buster in that film. Alien 3 had NO egg, just a surviving face hugger and a baby in Ripley. Alien:Resurrection only took hours based on the ""survivor"" they found, but there really is no way of accurately gauging the gestation rate as the lab had all the time it wanted to breed its aliens. So, yea, it takes a leap of faith, but this one offense can be tolerated. Besides, a gestation period of minutes was the only real way that the ""hunt"" could be executed practically in the film, so lets all agree to look the other way, or not, but still, one sin isn't so bad.<br/><br/>5) The Predators don't even get their guns at the start. Well, yea, that makes sense. When one of the Predators DID get his gun he wasted 4 aliens in about 40 seconds, so, it's a darn good thing the humans prevented the Predators from getting the guns or this movie would have been over in 40 minutes, when it was already too short.<br/><br/>6) The movie was too short. Clocking in at about an hour and a half, I was left with the feeling that if it had been allowed to get the R rating, it would have run longer, and been more satisfying. Maybe an unrated DVD will come out and my hunch can be confirmed or denied. For now, one must merely speculate. Que sera sera.<br/><br/>7) Why'd they bring those machine guns on a dig like this? I'm guessing to kill other salvagers, maybe? I don't have a clue. Aside from the one explanation for a .45 handgun, which was fair, we don't really know, and it is a mildly annoying plot hole, but, ya know, crap happens. On a similar note, why didn't home boy take a sample and date the pyramid before they entered it? Why didn't anybody stop and ask what those giant Predator statues on the stairs were? I dunno. Some things got sacrificed just to get the plot going, so it goes. It could be worse.<br/><br/>8) Why did she have the alien head on her arm, what good does that do? The Predator demonstrates that the alien exo-skeleton is, surprise surprise, immune to alien acid blood, hence, it was a SHIELD. If one pays attention and trys to figure out non-verbal communication, especially when one of two characters worth paying attention to can only speak with roars and bizarre mandible gestures, this isn't even a question.<br/><br/>9) What's with Bishop? Well, yes, obviously, he's a throwback to Aliens. It seemed pretty clear. He ran Weyland Industries. No, Ripley did NOT work for Weyland Industries. She worked for Weyland-Yutani. Obviously there was a pretty big corporate merger between AVP and Alien, but it doesn't seem to put any holes in the Alien timeline like some claim. Why did the android Bishop look 18 years younger than the living one? Perhaps the builder was trying to capture his ""Glory Days."" Seems like a rational, reasonable, act of hubris to me. This also helps explain how Weyland Yutani gained data on the Aliens to send Ripley and the Nostromo crew to that deserted ship to find that fateful specimen in Scott's horror masterpiece. (For the record, if you want to say anybody ""killed"" this franchise, stick it on James Cameron. He's the one who bled all the horror out of the series and replaced it with automatic weapons and cardboard soldier characters. A3 pathetically attempted to bring the horror back, and A:R, well, that was a bad comic book/novel rip off with a HORRIBLE ending.)<br/><br/>10) How did the Queen Alien get to the surface? She climbed. Obviously somebody blinked, or was in the bathroom, or perhaps at the snack bar and missed the tell tale slime on the lift-sled that the heroine found as she and the surviving Predator ran desperately away from the monster explosion coming right behind them.<br/><br/>11) Aliens aren't smart. Uhhh, yea they are. There's a well documented history of Alien tactical intelligence in the franchise. The lone aliens in Alien and Alien 3 do a splendid job of staying obscure and meeting their prey one on one in order to insure an advantage. In Aliens and Alien:Resurrection, the aliens are quite capable of arranging ambushes, escaping imprisonment, and surreptitiously finding holes in perimeter defenses. (This is actually a GOOD thing about this movie, I'm surprised I read this silly idea somewhere.)<br/><br/>Okay, I think that's MOST of the whiney so called ""Franchise Fan"" complaints that seemed to stem from people who obviously don't realize there's TONS of material about these characters BEYOND the films that this movie is VERY faithful too. Now, on to the good things.<br/><br/>First, production values were great. Creature effects, visual effects, and set design were fabulous. The subtle hints of the alien life cycle amongst the cyclopean predator statues was a nice touch. The temple was impressive looking, and the monsters were probably the best portrayals on film for either of them yet, with the Predator a massive hulking beast, and the alien staying incredibly similar to Giger's original, with all the benefits of advancements in SFX technology to make it menacing. Oh the things Ridley could have done with the creature effects of today... alas...<br/><br/>The best news in this film is probably for alien fans. Why? Because this movie finally shows the alien prowess. It only makes sense. It isn't until now, when the aliens fight the Predators that we see why the Predators consider them the most dangerous, and worthy, prey in the galaxy. They're strength, speed, and instinctive will to win is portrayed fabulously (the intentional use of the acid blood as a projectile weapon after injury was a real nice touch, of which there were a few).<br/><br/>The Queen Alien, while spending most of the film chained, exhibits her usual shrewd cognitive abilities by summoning her brood to free her (Plot hole here, why didn't she do this LAST time, 100 years ago? Maybe cuz the Predators got their guns and blasted all the Aliens in 10 minutes? Who knows.) But most importantly, we finally see the awesome and terrible power of a pissed off Queen as she rampages through the temple and then tumbles with the temple survivors on the surface. Super strong, and lightening fast, this Queen kicks about 1000 times more behind than the Queen in Aliens, and the Queen in Resurrection never even got off her egg sack, so, its about time we see a Queen rock some unlucky carbon based life-form(or Predator, are they carbon based, does anybody know?) or another.<br/><br/>So, after debunking MOST (not all) of the complaints mentioned, and pointing out that the true lethal efficiency (That's what the Aliens were ALWAYS about, EFFECIENCY, they live to breed, and don't hesitate to do anything it takes to expand the hive. THey're not evil, they're not mindless, they're simply like an very, very, very highly evolved, very dangerous, ant, which is the heart of their beauty) of the Aliens portrayed in this movie, I find myself feeling this film certainly could have been better, but was a long, long way, from being bad. I suppose on a scale of 1-10, I'd toss this one a 7.5, an 8 if you don't like fractions."
"luckypickledegg","Null","0","0","13 August 2004"," this film was ehhhh.
","Personally i liked this film, being a long time fan of all the Alien and predator movies and also an avid reader of the dark horse comics. i think they did a fantastic job of connecting the two different franchises. The second Predator movie was the only instance that an ALIEN can and was linked to a predator, (the alien skull aboard the predator spacecraft, the trophy), and of course the comics. sooo to have a connection between to different movie character and still come of OK was good i thought.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see the movie take place elsewhere, other than antartica, maybe have the movie be more like the original arcade game, How the humans and predators join forces to defeat the massive hive mind after the earth had been overrun by aliens.(Sequel Sequel) huh Anyway, i really enjoyed the connections made between ancient human cultures and the predators, most notably the Aztecs. (((SPOILER))) Also some people have bad mouthed the predators ability or lack thereof when fighting and combating the aliens. i for one will not badmouth them. First off, theses predators that are battling these aliens are the few exceptional but YOUNG worriors in there culture. These hunters were selected by the elders to battle the ultimate warriors in a test of there ""Predatorness"" get it. These predators have not battled aliens there entire lives, they have only trained for it by hunting other species. i understand then that the scene when the predator makes the woman armor and a weapon out of an Alien skull and tail would be totally bogus based on my previous statement. However i believe that the predator would try to be well learned in their enemy and there enemies attributes, hence the weapon making skills.<br/><br/>So please when viewing this film, please take into account you probably don't know s**t about the Aliens or the Predators. Don't bad mouth them or ill hunt you down pred style. peace"

","OK, first things first. (SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I know the first thing everyone is going to s*** all over the Predator respecting allowing the woman to help him hunt the Aliens. But that's exactly what happened in the comic. The Predators accepted the female character as a Predator, and she hunted with them. The other is the birth of the Preadtor/Alien hybrid at the end. This was plucked right from the game. So before everyone goes off chalking these two plot points up to bad writing and cheese, they were pulled from previous incarnations of the Alien vs. Predator universe.<br/><br/>Second, for a PG-13 movie, I thought it was still pretty damn good. A small bit of blood from the humans, and plenty of gurgling and crunching noises.<br/><br/>Lots of gore from the 2 alien species was to be had.<br/><br/>Third, there were only a few things that I was hoping for that I didn't get.<br/><br/>More Predator vs. Alien free-for-all fights. The only one you got was during the flashback of one of the first battles. Granted, the one-on-one fights were awesome, but I wanted to see more ""royal-rumble"" style fight scenes. Also, I was hoping I would get a little more detail and info on Weyland and his corporation, since Weyland-Yutani is ""the company"" in the Alien movies. <br/><br/>I was pleased with some of the ""for true fans only"" bits thrown in. Weyland in his office doing the knife trick that Bishop does on Hudson in ""Aliens"" briefly was my favorite. There are others as well, but I'll wait and see if people find them.<br/><br/>I have to say that overall, I was pretty impressed."
"basilmckeon","2","0","0","14 August 2004"," Some spoiler info, negative writings
","OK..Paul Anderson (writer and director) calls himself such an avid fan of the Alien AND Predator series...but yet he overlooks one of the most basic aspects in this movie.. er, an Alien takes a couple of days to incubate inside of a human, not five minutes.. That was one of the most pathetic oversights I have seen in a movie. You have to keep it real..<br/><br/>There was only something like seven aliens total in the movie, yet they dominated both humans and predators.. that was pretty lame, considering there were three predators. Predators have more brain capacity, better weapons, they're freaking tough.. they're like the most elite lifeform ever though-up, but two of them get taken out right away. What's up with that? Not to mention I'm sure they would have studied the pyramid and how it changes - they knew the terrain as well. Now, I know they're supposed to be in a trial.. so they're not yet warriors, but there's no way the pred society would just send them on their way unless they were sure they were ready for the task. The aliens were portrayed as way too powerful in this movie.. aliens are weak, they're fragile, a predator should be able to rip right through an alien head no problem. The one pred that survives is good, yes, but I think the other ones should have been just as good. One alien takes out two predators...there's just something wrong with that. What aliens have going for them is numbers, but in this movie that's the one thing they didn't have.<br/><br/>Now another thing.. the pyramid. The predators destroy the civilization if they are going to fail... well that pyramid is still standing, so it must have seen a few fights in it's lifetime. Yet there was absolutely no sign of previous battles. They certainly did a good job of knocking up all the statues and pillars this time. But wtf, the first battles were just a breeze? OK, so the predators didn't get their trusty shoulder cannons from the start.. but come on now, a shoulder cannon doesn't make a predator. They should have STILL been able to take on the measly force of aliens with what they had.. they were still well equipped, even if they didn't have their shoulder cannons. <br/><br/>So the dig team moves in...way too far. WTF. That is not the way to go about discovering the greatest discovery. I don't think anyone would do that. That is obviously dangerous.. even without the knowledge of aliens and predators. They should have waited, checked out the outside, took the time to read the writings, etc. But instead they had to Indiana Jones it and plunge into a huge, unknown pyramid.<br/><br/>Character development was the worst I've seen in a while. I felt nothing for any of the humans. The beginning was horrible, it was way too rushed. The acting sucked, the dialogue was amateur. This movie was a grade-A failure. Pure disgrace to both series. Not to mention it's PG-13, and therefore has no promise to be scary in any way, shape, or form. Scary is one of the best parts about the originals! This movie had much more of a *yawn* approach.<br/><br/>The good: the special effects aren't bad, although sometimes the aliens look hokey. The predator has a few cool new toys, the story isn't too bad (although it makes you wonder how in the future no one knows anything... an island of Antarctica has a huge gaping hole.. one person survives, a big time head-of-company man disappears, and on top of that, all these experts are gone as well. Someone's going to notice. Don't think there wouldn't be an investigation around that).. but that's really all the good.<br/><br/>If you're a fan, you'll watch it anyway, but seriously, this movie sucks."

","OK first to before I spout one word and the bashing of no talent hacks such as Paul ""wish I has a clue"" Anderson, a warning: *********SPOILERS*****************<br/><br/>Now let the tirade began . . . <br/><br/>The Alien franchise as well as the Predator franchise<br/><br/>(BTW, for the moron who said Predator wasn't a franchise, any film which inspired comic's, video-game's, Novels and countless legions of fans, constitutes as a franchise.)<br/><br/>is probably one of the highest regarded icons of Sci-Fi/Horror cinema. These two film icon's became a part of modern pulp culter and was often times parodied (ala Spaceballs). I'm an avid movie fan, have been since I was a young child. I own a impressive DVD/VHS collection which has taken me 15 years to get it to the point of where it is today. I own every Alien film as well as both Predator film's, and have seen them enough times to know what I know about each is respective universe. These films are one of the main reason's why its so great to love film.<br/><br/>Each film in its own right has as one member above has posted had a unique and original blend of flavor, thrills, story, and plot. All why staying true to the original formula that made each successor great. <br/><br/>True that not all of the films throughout the Alien and Predator franchise's have been the best but each deserving to be a part of the franchise. With that said<br/><br/>AVP DOES NOT<br/><br/>After seeing the film today on its opening day I was filled with a mix of dread and a mix of anguish and heartbreak as I walked out of the theater. How could anyone in their right mind make a complete joke out of an iconic staple in film history and than the answer dawned on me as fast as the question. MONEY!!!!<br/><br/>20th Century Fox wanted something made and targeted for a general audience at the same time playing on the fact that all the hardcore fanboys and normal fans would turn out. Even though we all know it should be rated R like all SIX other films in the series. <br/><br/>To 20th Century Fox I say this. May you choke on every single damn cent you rob for RAPING AND KILLING two beloved franchises in cinema history (ala George Lucas)<br/><br/>What starts out with a lackluster back story and ends with one of the biggest damn slaps in ANY FANS FACE EVER! <br/><br/>The Story: Charles Bishop Weyland, Multi - Billionaire (and thats as much as we pretty much our told about him, other then the fact that his health ain't so good) played by Lance Henrikson discovers through his satellite system's a underground pyramid 2'000 feet below the surface somewhere over in Antartica,through heat signature's so on begans the assimilation of a team to treak and discover this long lost Pyramid. The teams assembled is Heli'd off to a ice breaker class frigate and on its way to the mystery. I'm not going to get into the acting being that it was a Sci-Fi flick i didn't think the acting was going to be spectacular but compared to this I've seen better acting in Killer Klowns from Outer Space.<br/><br/>Anyways our humans get to the site, after a few more mins of why were going there and why Alexa Woods or LEX thinks its a BAD IDEA, anyways it doesn't take much to talk her into going. Soon after things attempt to get going and without spoiling too much of this trash, The Predators return to their Pyramid for the 100 year coming of Age ritual for three teenage Predator's which involves the awaking of a hibernating queen, Once things take off the action scene's comense one after another in garbled quick cuts and watered down action I thought i was watching WWE at one point. 87 mins isn't a lot of time to set up much of anything be it story, character development or whatever.<br/><br/>I understand the speeding up of the Alien lifecycle for story point or the lack OF. But to kill off not one BUT TWO Predators in such a weak fashion and as quickly as they did annoyed me. But the thing that pissed me off and turned me the most sour were the three but very IMPORTANT THINGS.<br/><br/>1) The second I saw ""Scar"" (Predator) and Lex join forces I had to put my head in my hands and sigh. To make something that inane happen and rip apart the storied lore that so many filmmakers spent to make Predator what it was was ripped apart and blow into a thousand different directions as soon as Scar and Lex ran side by side from the oncoming explosion GIVE ME A G**DAMN BREAK. This is AVP not *&^%^*ing Predator and PALS. I understand the sense of Respect and what it takes to get it amongst the Predator cultures as showed in the films and the books and I'm sure it would take more than some stupid twit icing not ONE but TWO Aliens, which I found stupid considering the fact that Two Predator's were bested so easily BY ONE ALIEN.<br/><br/>2) Rating this PG-13 in the first place, I knew from the get go what this was going to do. TRUE, Blood and Gore don't make the story, But if those two original elements played a reacurring role in all SIX other films than YOU DON'T TAKE IT OUT. If the damn things not broke don't TRY TO FIX IT.<br/><br/>3) and most important of all, Paul Anderson, a HACK of a director, who if someone competent was running 20th Century Fox, would never EVER have been ALLOWED near the script or direction or anything remotely to do with the film other than selling AvP merchandise at a theater in L.A. somewhere. With a Track record such as his: <br/><br/>Event Horizon: A mediocre film with poor direction<br/><br/>Mortalk Kombat: HAHAHAHAH I don't even need to speak on this one<br/><br/>Soldier: See above Post<br/><br/>Resident Evil: He did the same thing to AvP with this one for me, I'm a huge fan of the games Afetr i saw this one I really hated Anderson.<br/><br/>It makes me sick that he wrote Resident Evil: Apocalypse so I expect much of the same pointless crap.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this movie could have been made with the exact same story without Alien's or Predator's and youd truly see it for what it was a poorly written, poorly conceived, poorly directed film. The only saving grace of the entire thing was it used Aliens and Predator's without them as I've said Anderson wouldve had nothing but his stupid lame STORY"
"Facehugger2K8","6","0","0","13 August 2004"," Not a total letdown...has its moments!!!(SPOILER)
","I just came from Alien vs. Predator, in a theater full of screaming fans rooting for their favorite titan in this epic battle. Being an Alien fan since I was two years old, I must say that this was not a total disappointment, as others have pointed out. There were some factors though, if avoided, would have made this a much better movie. Factor#1: Lack of consistency. A few scenes in the movie does not go along the ethics of the creatures. For example, after the face-hugger deposits a parasite inside the host, it takes the chest-burster a few hours before it comes out, as we have witnessed in the original movies. In this movie, it takes place in a few minutes, killing off half of the major characters, before they get to do anything. Factor#2: Slow motion. Not sating that it looks bad, but some scenes look absolutely ridiculous in slow motion, while others look great. For example, when the facehuggers jump out of the eggs to clamp on their victim's faces, the camera shot in that scene was awesome. On the other hand, towards the end of the movie, when Lex(Sanaa Lathan) and the remaining Predator run for their lives, chased by a nuclear explosion, that scene left everyone in the theater laughing. It kind of reminds of that scene in Shrek, when Shrek, Princess Fiona, and Donkey run for their lives in slow motion followed by the fire-breathing dragon. Factor#3: ""Predator: A Love Story"". What I'm referring to is the romance-like scenes that seem to entangle between Lex and the remaining Predator. For a second there, you would think they're about to kiss. Now, I'm not a big fan of Predator so I don't know how he acts and all, but I am sure it is not like a sick twisted version of Romeo and Juliet. Overall, it's worth your money, I would go see it again. Actually, I am gonna see it again. It wasn't as cool as the original movie versions of these creatures, but I think that's due to the fact that Paul W.S. Anderson was the director, whom I feel tries too hard to please his audience. Anyway, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. It will definitely make my DVD collection. Keep it strong, Alien. You're still the best to me."

"elbarto-1","6","0","0","13 August 2004"," Could have been so much more *spoilers*
","Let me preface this review by stating that I enjoyed all of the previous six films that precede AvP.<br/><br/>There are 2 ways to explain this movie-<br/><br/>1. Anderson made a 2hr film (rating notwithstanding) and had to edit it down to 1hr 30min. This is my opinion of AvP. Many scenes from the novelization (book)and even some from the preview were not present. Every single thing in this film felt rushed from beginning to end. You are ""introduced"" (I say this sarcastically because unless you read the book you will not know 3/4 of the cast's names) to the cast and are in the pyramid area within 10 minutes of the film. The book didn't get there until it had introduced each character in detail and had given you enough back-story to each so that you could (whether or not you chose to) care about them when they are killed. In the film you don't have any idea who people are, -nor do you care. ""Oh..that guy's dead"" *shrug..move on*. Another reason I feel strongly that this movie was chopped was the quick edits everywhere. just about every scene in the film could benefit from another 30sec here, another minute there, and this damages the continuity of things (the biggest sin being the incubation period of the Aliens. What used to take many hours now goes from face hugger to full grown Alien in a matter of minutes!) From the introductions to the fights, everything was too limited and quick. If you were to blink during a fight scene, you would lose the ability (if you had it to begin with) to follow the jerky, poorly edited & irritatingly dark action. Which brings me to my next complaint- The lighting was not in the favor of the audience (maybe it was just my theater, because the ""clips"" on the net were much more detailed and well lit) everything (in the pyramid) was a struggle to see what was happening. I was sitting in the back row and it was like trying to watch from the front row. This combined with the blazing speed of the edits made the fights almost unwatchable. It was really a shame because the action scenes (and most scenes dealing only with Aliens and Predators) were the strong points of the film. I thought that the Predators for the most part looked pretty good and the Aliens looked great. Its just a pity we couldn't see more of them on some vicodin instead of the ritalin this film was on. The Predator vision was well done (they use different spectrum's for Aliens/Humans/other) and is consistent with past films. The Predator without his mask is a different story altogether- Stan Winston must feel pretty good right now because no one can top his Predator, it was the only one that looked real, Predator 2 and AvP look like fake rubber masks. This is by far the worst looking Predator face I have seen yet. The ""Elder Predators"" at the end looked better than the main character, Why? you tell me. The same thing goes with the Face huggers and just about anything showing flesh. It looks like rubber. Really too bad. I know that this would be a better movie if all the little gaps were filled in. And I don't mean violence or swearing (for a PG-13 it wasn't bad) I mean character development and filling out the quick edits. Heres hoping they do it on the DVD.<br/><br/>2. This was the movie Anderson actually made and it's crappy. He needs to learn how to write Dialogue and pacing into his film, action alone is boing and without proper character intros and good on screen dialogue any movie will fall apart. Perhaps this is the way Anderson chose to deliver a bad movie - make everything so blurry and fast that the audience wont be able to decipher the crap. I feel that Resident evil, Event horizon AND Alien resurrection were better than this movie.<br/><br/>Pros/Cons:<br/><br/>Pros: Predators (masks on) and Aliens looked great Action scenes were cool Queen was awesome settings and colors were good looking Predator vision was good Special effects were well done Violence was intact but not over the top<br/><br/>Cons: no character development at all really bad predator face/face huggers relies on the viewer to have seen the other movies. terrible fight editing obvious scenes missing/edited out/movie felt chopped EVERYTHING FELT RUSHED no down time at all nothing to make you care<br/><br/>In closing I would give this movie a 50% or 5 stars out of 10 It is 50% good for action and special effects And 50% bad for acting, character development and editing I truly believe that this was not the movie we were intended to see but it does little to help the quality of this film.<br/><br/>P.S. I am very open minded and feel that most people will HATE this movie. I did not hate it I just felt it was very incomplete. Most folks would rate this movie 20% or 2 stars out of 10 I would guess."

","I've been waiting for this movie ever since I played AvP 2. While I've seen all the movies in the Alien and Predator series, I never really got into either series; they were fun movies to watch and little more. After playing the game, however, I found myself getting quite excited at the thought of this movie. I mean comon, Aliens and Preds duking it out while soft-skinned humans are caught in the crossfire. How cool is that?<br/><br/>Now before I talk about the movie, I must make it clear that I'm WAY more in favor of the Preds, and in their defense, the Preds aren't evil at all - they just hunt for fun, much like how we hunt deer and other game animal (You'll see why I make this argument after you watch the movie).<br/><br/>The plot in this movie is minimal but interesting and sufficient. There are definitely some discrepancies from the original movies, i.e. Preds are now hunting Aliens exclusively. Apparently soft-skinned humans are just too easy. The bottom line is, the story is good enough - nothing too memorable, but nothing you'd groan over, either.<br/><br/>Now with that out of the way, we can go on to the good part - the action. And boy it doesn't disappoint. Although few in number, the action scenes in this movie are absolutely awesome. The special effects are very well done, lighting is used very well, and the director pulls off some nice (but old) camera tricks to squeeze in that PG-13 rating without losing that gory feeling. Now some people complained that Preds died to Aliens too easily in this movie, and I have to say... what do you expect? The Preds that were killed did not have their Shoulder Cannons, and were completely caught off guard. I gotta admit though, after watching the Predator movies, one tends to have the notion that Predators are invincible killing machines, and they are - against humans. Aliens on the other hand, are the masters of melee/stealth combat, and they can also see Predators even if the Pred is cloaked. But don't worry - the last Pred does his species plenty of justice, not saying the other two went down easily.<br/><br/>With all that said, the movie itself is a good $10 spent, if you're watching it for the kick ass fights. If you go in expecting an Alien style movie, however, you'll be sorely disappointed."

","SPOILERS First off, let me say I am outraged at the film's PG-13 rating. Here's a<br/><br/>quick overview of AvP: There were no trademark ""Predator"" skinned bodies. The only ""Alien"" chest-busting scene is an eight of a second long and it<br/><br/>is cut immediately after the aline bursts out, so u see absolutely<br/><br/>nothing gory. There was no huge, climactic, epic scene with heards of predators<br/><br/>charging into heards of aliens. There was no definitive winner. EVERY Predator stab is edited either so you see the person being stabbed<br/><br/>from the chest up, so you CANT SEE THE STAB, or it is edited so you see<br/><br/>the predator swing, and then cut to a small splash of blood on the<br/><br/>ground. No nudity. Barely any swearing. Stupid plot.<br/><br/>And that's about it. The plot is something ridiculous, along the lines<br/><br/>of that the Predators brought the Aliens into existence in order for<br/><br/>them to have a fun game of hunting. There wasn't a difinitive winner,<br/><br/>just like Freddy vs. Jason, however FvJ had a very interesting cool plot<br/><br/>, AND it had adult content and GORE, unlike AvP. It sucked. .........."

","Not really. I got a free ticket when I purchased the SE Predator DVD. The movie really does not connect with either of the alien, predator story lines and doesn't have an ounce of suspense to it. The story really doesn't make sense at all and really isn't that interesting. The aliens aren't really scary and the predators aren't impressive either. The ending is contrived and the movie was boring. The PG-13 rating also really hurt the movie. How can you take two very violent franchises and make them kiddie friendly? It makes me sick. Hopefully resident evil 2 will be worth seeing now that this director isn't in charge of it."

","I saw AVP the first day it came out in my city. To tell you the truth I had stong doubts about this film. However, the film turned out to be pretty good. I'm glad that they provided some background in the film of why the two races were fighting in the first place. The history was explained and it made the film so much better. The acting was good and the special effects and costumes were also well done. The fight scenes were done extremely well. The computer effects didnt make the fight scenes too ridiculous either. I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the Predator and/or Alien films. People who haven't seen those films should give them a try and also see this sequel."

","The Alien series was really terrific.  Predator was OK.  But the two series have worn themselves out.

What's next: Alien Vs. Godzilla? or Predator Vs. Lex Luthor? or Lex Luthor Vs. Riddler?<br/><br/>Generally people like to see the end of a villain.  When he dies and gets wiped out, that's it.  We're done with him.  We can put him behind us and go on.  But when he keeps coming back, people will give up and go on the next one.  Not so with heroes.  Long series are based on heroes, not villains, because we like to identify with the good guy, not the bad guy.  If we keep seeing the villain come back, it drives one into apathy, since the villain wants to do us in and we can't seem to wipe him out.<br/><br/>It was time to end off on Alien and Predator before this thing was filmed.

The others were still good quality entertainment.  When I heard this movie was coming out, I thought it was going to be awesome!  About two weeks before release, I heard it wasn't going to be released to the critics and I thought it would suck.

I had problems with the following things in this movie.<br/><br/>It was made WAY too child acceptable.  The violence was toned down a lot so the movie would make more money by getting kids in the theater.  This movie would have benefited by seeing more graphic violence instead of implied violence.<br/><br/>They didn't stick to what made the previous movies successful.  The whole premise of the movie was a little unbelievable.  Just look at the way they set the temple up for instance.  I think the story could have been a HECK of a lot better.<br/><br/>Now, I thought the Alien and Predator fight scenes were very cool.  However, there weren't many in the movie, which turned me off a little bit.  I think this movie would have benefited from 15 more minutes of fights between the creatures.  It was a short movie anyway, so just they should have just added them in.<br/><br/>The bottom line is if you liked the franchise movies, you MIGHT like this one.  The key is not going in with high expectations.<br/><br/>5/10"

","As a fan of both series I can say that this was an excellent way to combine them. My biggest fear was that the PG-13 rating would hurt the movie, but it doesn't. Not in the least. I know a lot of people want to see the violent eruption of the Alien chestburster in all its' gory glory. Here, of course, it's done off camera. But director John Carpenter once said, ""Everyone knows what a man with a knife is going to do. You don't need to see it."" So since we've seen the alien burst, and seen the Predator slash, we're not missing anything if we don't see it here. Besides I'm sure it will be on the unrated director's cut DVD. My only complaint is that the movie is too short. Barely 90 minutes. I wanted more! But what I got I was happy with. Great visuals. The movie is thick with atmosphere. Great action. That's what you go to this movie for right? To see the Alien and Predator throw down? Well it's here and then some. Plus you get good tension very reminicent of the first two Alien films. While the dialog is, admittedly, very flat sometimes, the actors do fine. Sanaa Lathan is not Sigourney Weaver, but her character is firmly in control, and can kick Alien ass with the best of them. *SPOILER AHEAD* Her final confrontation with the Alien Queen is excellent. *END SPOILER* Lance Henrickson is a nice addition to link the series up, and his characters' nod to his ALIENS character is sly and hilarious. The rest of the characters are kind of stock, but the actors do well. Let's face it, we've seen enough of these movies to know who's going to get it and who's not. Let's not kid ourselves or berate the movie just because we're geek enough to know these things. Hell, when one character shows off a picture of his kids, I said to myself ""He's gonna get it first"", and low and behold....So if you want a tense, fast paced, action packed movie featuring two of the greates monsters in cinema history, plunk down your money, grab your popcorn, and have a good time.

","(WARNING:  MIGHT CONTAINS SPOILERS)<br/><br/>My one-line summary says it all!<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but the premise of this film is just too weak.  Also, while it had some fun moments, the filmmakers seeemd to disregard significant precedents set by the first two ""ALIEN"" films (1979 and 1986) and ""PREDATOR"" (1987).  This is most notable at the end, when the infant Alien bursts from the Predator's chest without its egg having been implanted by a Facehugger beforehand.  In case someone wants to argue the Predator was infected by the Queen Alien, how could this have happened?  Why this important step in the gestation process of an Alien was skipped defies credibility.  However, it definitely set the stage (so to speak) for a sequel.<br/><br/>As for the premise, are we really supposed to believe that a pyramid lay beneath the Earth's surface for such a long time and was not discovered for so many years?  Given the ritual of three Predators flying to Earth every 100 years to battle such a multidue of Aliens, are we also supposed to believe that only THREE Predators successfully battled so many Aliens until they were finally defeated (their prowess at such battles notwithstanding)?<br/><br/>Why didn't the filmmakers keep things simple?  It would have been so much more credible had the Predators simply flown to a planet already inhabited by Aliens.  Another solid premise would have been that the Predator species declares war on the Alien species and attacks their planet.  I realize this film was based on a comic book series, but come on, people, couldn't the filmmakers have put just a little extra thought into the storyline?  Had someone devised a solid premise, even the humans wouldn't have been necessary.  The film could have featured just the Aliens and Predators and been damned entertaining.<br/><br/>Oh, well!<br/><br/>Despite thrilling special effects and good battle sequences, at the end of it all, this film really isn't worthy of being grouped with its aforementioned predecessors."

Now we have AvP as a further testament to that same philosophy and complete contempt for the fans. No story, no plot, no acting, Nada.

"miscon","Null","0","0","13 August 2004"," A well crafted homage the genre ...
","So much negative speculation preceded last night's Los Angeles midnight screening, I was surprised the theater was packed with fans ... reminiscent of the 1970s/1980s, pre-megaplex era, when waiting on line (5 hours for ""Return of The Jedi"" ... 3 hours for ""Total Recall"" was the norm on opening night for blockbutser sci-fi). After all, the premier had been cancelled... no previews were made available to the press, hence no reviews. Personally I disagree as much as I agree with the Ebert's of the world whose cinema scholarship can't help but render jaded viewpoints no matter how intent their sincerity. To be sure, despite my childlike anticipation & a good lookin' set of trailers, I went with diminished expectations. And, as with ""I, Robot"" - was pleasantly surprised. One does not expect character development or catharsis from popcorn sci-fi. One DOES demand state of the art production design & EFX ... AND the respect of the film maker in knowing the mythology of the franchise(s) as we fans do. This was David Fincher's mistake in ""Alien 3,"" resulting in the near destruction of the ""Alien"" franchise & principal reason (IMHO) ""Alien Resurrection"" had such poor attendance. That wasn't a bad film, but suffered fallout from the misbegotten ""A3.""<br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson's ""AVP"" pushes all the right buttons for the fans. If watched closely, there are hidden treats to be found & I heard a lot of people go ""Ah!"" when they turned up on screen. The earlier films AND Dark Horse comic origins are well sourced, and perhaps, in an effort to please everyone (principally his Fox masters) Anderson misses a golden opportunity to pull off a ""Cameron"" style nailbiter. At 100 minutes, ""AVP"" seemed too short for a story that required touching all the familiar bases and adding new ones. There's plenty of action which (like in Spielberg's dino flicks) is not diluted by a relative lack of viscera. This might bug horror/gore afficianados, as might it's PG-13 rating, but great sci-fi is about big ideas, not wetwork. I suppose my greatest objection & Fox's greatest boo-boo lies in the inane tagline: ""Whoever wins, we lose,"" which has nothing whatsoever to do with the film. Surpirsing, considering Fox's history of brilliant tags: ""Alien: In space, no one can hear you scream."" ""The Fly: Be afraid, be very afraid."" If it were up to me, the film would be called ""Aliens And Predators,"" because there sure is a kit-n-kaboodle of both."

On the fun factor, it was about 7-8 since the predators and aliens looked very cool, but that is about as far as the fun goes. If you are a fan of the series, some of the weak plot and lack of development might not make the movie seem rushed. It went too fast for me. It was too short and everything happened too fast. (Spoiler) The first couple of predator dudes died WAY too quick. Also, the plot seemed a mix mash of action genre plots. Think Alien meets Armagedden meets Lara Croft meets The Core meets pick your movie with the world is going to die if this gratuitous group of the ""worlds best at everything"" can't save the day. Too much is left unsaid and too much is just done wrong. The end is lamers. The sole human survivor, who almost didn't even go because it was ""too dangerous,"" manages to survive bitter cold in Antarctica wearing just a t-shirt and jeans at the end of the movie.

","This movie should really be called ""HUMANS and a little bit of Alien Vs. Predator.""  But that's what you expected right?  Unfortunately Paul W. S. Anderson is a very gifted storyteller (I thought the whole Predators in pyramids hunting Aliens every 100 years, plot was very clever), but he sucks at character development.  Every character in this movie was so one dimensional that you couldn't wait for them to just shut up and get off the screen. Particularly the protagonist chick from ""Blade.""  Why couldn't they make her an older more bad-ass chick like Ripley?  Watching this girly `ice-climber' team up with the Predator (no, I'm not kidding) makes you want to throw up.  But besides that this movie is, well, okay I guess.  The fight scenes between the two species were all kinds of cool, the setting of an old Aztec/Egyptian/Some other culture I don't remember pyramid works beautifully.  It's a very cool and creepy environment.  What sucks is the PG-13 rating.  I didn't cry when I heard about this because I thought that it was all going to be monster violence that for some reason the MPAA feels kids can see.  But unfortunately there are a million would-be-cool gory scenes that were cut too short.  If people didn't like to see Aliens killing humans then all the other ""Alien"" movies would have flopped.  If this flick had more `fun' violence and gore then it would be easier to forget all the stupid things going on (like the Alien head attached to her arm, what is she going to do with that?  Have a puppet show?)  But once again I found myself blown away by the special effects.  They used a perfect combination of puppets and CGI, I'm so glad that we weren't forced to watch cartoon eggs open up and stuff.  But what everyone is going to cry about (myself included) was the before mentioned human chick and Predator teaming up.  I really thought that they were going to make out by the end of it, and when I saw their silhouettes running side by side like Batman and Robin in a Joel Schumacher film, I wanted to get up and leave.

","**SPOILERS ABOUND** I'm a fan of fun movies that don't take themselves seriously... kinda like Freddy Vs. Jason, (Notice the similar naming scheme... coincidence...?) and this movie is right up my alley. The movie begins with what I mapped as about 40 minutes of confusingly obscure plot development which was violence-less and very alien-less. With each moment the movie progressed the viewer was able to accurately guess what the next ten minutes of the movie was about to reveal. A crack team of specialists formed by a super-powerful billionaire with adventurelust going straight to Antarctica. Nice. Sounds plausible to me. The movie sags on the scenes developing characters. Come on. Who's going to watch this kind of movie to care about a sassy black lady? Or an Enlgishman who has kids? Bring on the pain. After the overdeveloped plot made sufficient ""sense"" the writers were out of ideas, and BOY does it show. For better, or for worse. As usual, the aliens run amok. The THREE predators were quickly reduced to two after some tragic mishaps, (filmed in bullet-time, no less) and the humans provided the screams and filler gore. Soon after unraveling any mysteries left in the plot, (which of course is completely BULLET PROOF) the people's population is soon reduced to one. The sassy black lady. The true turning point of the movie was when the lady proved her worth by accidentally sticking an alien with the predator's spear. After that, the best scene is set up. The lady and predator become friends.<br/><br/> From then on, the theater had a steady stream of chuckles derived from the scenes of the lady and her new buddy chilling out, (but not literally even though it's set on the south pole...). I don't know if predators come with different personalities or what, but for some reason this guy really liked the black lady, (notice my use of the term... not that it has significance, just because I never really caught her name). Staying true to the plot of a Greek tragedy, the lady gains everything, and leaves with nothing. Her friend is killed by the alien queen, just after the queen is left to sink to a watery and disappointingly boring end. The predators leave, and the movie ends. The last scene alludes to a possible SEQUEL. Oooohhhh boy! My thoughts: If the tagline is ""Whoever wins, we lose"" how did we lose? Was having that pyramid destroyed really considered ""losing?"" Did that lady die out there in the harsh antarctic climate, or was she unaffected like every other person in the move, (no shivering or steam breath at all!)? Why did that great predator have to die? Overall: 1/10 for real cinema, but an 8/10 for entertainment/fun. If I could choose, I would see it again, but not after that."

You know, just in case in this underground pyramid thing there are a bunch of monsters that want to kill them. Or, you know, penguins. Oh, and ice.

","But unfortunately, I am. And to say that this movie was disappointing is to be nice to it. It is a brainless action movie. Not to say that all brainless action movies are bad, but with the kind of expectations that were riding on this movie, they really should have picked someone else to direct it, Anderson was a terrible choice. The movie is done with in a little over an hour and a half. The whole time you feel no connection whatsoever with any of the characters. Remember the fierce dedication and belief in Lt. Ripley that was inspired in the first couple of Aliens? Well in this movie, I could have cared less who got killed and who didn't. It just didn't matter. The plot line was completely unbelievable, so when the going got bad, I took a nap. And by far, the very worse thing I can say about this movie is that it took the Alien out of the dark. Yes, much of the movie is spent in the dark, but from the previous movies the fact that the Alien spent time lurking in the shadows and was around every corner was the fear factor. In this movie, the Aliens were much more in your face, and this was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Now... on to the good part of the movie... which is that there are enough people that care about this series. And if we, the fans make a big enough stink Fox may just get the b@llz and decide to hire a decent director for the next one. The hope lies in the future, my friends."

I f*cking hate them for doing this, purposely making a movie that has no substance whatsoever just because they don't have to work hard to make a bunch of money because they know that many people will see it just because of the name.<br/><br/>The movie features a crappy plot with a slightly interesting premise, terrible acting (although Anderson really doesn't give any of the actors anything to work with, just look at Lance Henrikson, he's a good actor but he had nothing to work with here, so the person to blame for the terrible acting is Anderson himself), horrifically crappy camera work during the fights, extremely cheesy scenes that are funny even though they aren't meant to be, and A LOT of errors to do with both the Aliens and the Predators.<br/><br/>I give this 0 out of 5 stars, there is no excuse for this travesty of a movie."

If you take this for what it is, and on its own terms then you will find that this is quite simply one of the best action films in ages, and a worthy addition to both franchises.<br/><br/>The plot has a pyramid discovered under the ice on an island near Antarctica. A scientific team is dispatched and very quickly they realize that something isn't right. Proceeding under the ice they find that the pyramid links to many ancient cultures.

Seeming to pull chunks of story from any number of the Alien and Predator comics and novels the film makers have fashioned one hell of a ride.

","In 1989, everyone's favourite chest bursting xenomorphs went head to head with the galaxy's greatest intergalactic hunters in the Dark Horse comic series Alien vs. Predator; but it wasn't until a year later, when an alien's skull was glimpsed in the predator's trophy collection at the end of movie sequel Predator 2, that excited fans began talking about the very real possibility of a cinematic merging of the franchises.<br/><br/>Fourteen years later, and 20th Century Fox finally gave them what they had been dreaming of: a movie smack-down between the creepy, bio-mechanical critters with the extendable inner jaws and the imposing, dread-locked hunter/warriors. Unfortunately, with almost a decade and a half to develop their own ideas of what the film should be, fan-boys were less than enthusiastic when the finished product failed to meet their unrealistic expectations; other naysayers included the professional film critics, who complained about the film's lack of characterisation and clichéd dialogue.<br/><br/>It all goes to prove that some people are never happy, because in my humble opinion, Aliens vs. Predator delivers way and above what one might reasonably expect from the fusion of a gung-ho Arnie creature-feature (albeit a fantastic one) and a sci-fi series that had hit rock bottom with its last instalment.<br/><br/>Director Paul W. S. Anderson, who inexplicably receives a lot of flak from critics and viewers alike whatever the project, comes up with the goods as far as action, excitement and spectacle are concerned, making this film not only a hugely enjoyable piece of blockbuster entertainment, but also a treat for the eyes. The set design and special effects in particular are simply incredible, with a terrific combination of CGI and more traditional techniques bringing the nasty extraterrestrials realistically to life.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, they might not exactly be award worthy, but since when does a monster movie require the acting chops of a Larry Olivier or Meryl Streep? Everyone involved does what is necessary of them, with Lance Henriksen making a welcome return to the Aliens series, Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner putting in a surprising appearance, and lead Sanaa Lathan making a likable and very gutsy heroine.<br/><br/>All in all, I liked AVP a lot. My advice is to ignore the biased sentiments of the fickle fan-boys and pompous critics, and for once, go with the popular opinion: the general public took the film to No. 1 in the box office and made it a commercial success, and for good reason—the film rocks!"

","Director Paul W.

In fact, compared to the MA ratings of previous films in the franchise, this one barely warrants the M. It feels like a kid's movie. The creatures, while superbly computer generated, just don't feel gritty enough to produce the claustrophobic and arachnophobic intensities of the previous films. To put it simply, it isn't scary enough to be classed as a horror but falls way short of being an interesting sci fi. It also plays very superficially. The film lacks any real symbolism or depth.<br/><br/>The film is set in the present day as opposed to the distant future of the Alien films, which may lead hardcore fans of the Alien films to take offence to Anderson's 'tampering' with the timeline, introducing new facts and theories into the fray. Some fans might have preferred no plot at all, I suspect, instead opting for an hour-and-a-half battle between the two creatures.<br/><br/>Claims that it is the 'worst movie of all time' are great exaggerations, although any hardcore fan of the Alien/Predator films might come away feeling cheated.

","AVP is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe it was a mainstream, big-advertisement movie. It was completely horrendous in nearly every aspect: the acting was about the lowest class you can find, the plot was pathetic beyond imagination, and the whole of the movie was riddled with obvious flaws and irrational antics. Here is a list of some of the flaws and antics.<br/><br/><ul><li>The most simple and irritating of the flaws was when they're in Antarctica and they're walking around in a light winter coat and an exposed face. Yeah, pretty sure you'd die in like half an hour.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the pyramid there's alien writing all over the walls and the guys go up and read it. It's an alien language!!!! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Predator goes into the pyramid and he's about to kill the old guy, but then he see's the old guy has a disease or something so he decides not to kill him. That's fine and can be justified. But then as the Predator leaves the old guy, the old guy says ""Don't turn your back on me!"" And then he tries to torch the Predator with a lighter and some spray. COME ON!!! That's got to be the stupidest movie moment of all time! Picture this: You see a huge, hulking alien come up and is just about to kill you, but then he decides not to. So you tough talk the alien and try to burn him to a crisp? NO ONE WOULD EVER DO THAT!!! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the Predator makes the girl that shield and spear, I thought to myself, 'Cool, she's gonna go around and impale some aliens and stuff'. But guess what? She never uses the spear! Stupidest thing ever.</li></ul><br/><br/>There are probably some more big, stupid flaws throughout the movie, but I'm going to leave it at that. Even without the flaws, this movie sucked. The plot was just a rambling series of idiotic, gory, slimy action sequences. And the fight scenes weren't even cool! The only cool part was when the Alien impales the Predator's head with his extra mouth. That's about it. A dumb thing that I didn't get about that part was that the one Alien killed two Predators. I thought the Predators were way more powerful than aliens, because in that flashback on the pyramid there are three Predators fighting waves of Aliens. I don't know.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie was just a cry for help. I had no idea what was happening. They were all fighting Aliens and stuff, and before I knew it, they were running away and the pyramid blew up for some reason. It was extremely abrupt. And that's pretty much the whole movie in its sucky entirety."

","One word summary of the movie: Insulting. Or maybe blasphemous.<br/><br/>Alien was a work of art, setting the atmosphere just right, along with a healthy amount of death. Predator was nonstop and stunning action, making sure you knew each of the characters before they died, and making sure that the Predator was as awesome and VILLAINOUS as possible.<br/><br/>Alien vs. Predator did nothing of this.<br/><br/>Acting: poor. I've seen better acting in soap operas<br/><br/>Plot/Story: very weak. Predator's plot never really holds up to too much scrutiny, but it's so enthralling that you're willing to overlook that. AvP's plot is even weaker, but without the enthralling movie part. It's the kind of story a nerd in 7th grade might find cool, but the rest of us, especially those old enough to have seen the Alien and Predator movies in theaters, will break out laughing in the theater.<br/><br/>Direction: It deprived the Aliens of all their horror and made the Predators less predatory and hunter-like. In short, it was boring, cheesy, and often insulting to both the Alien and Predator movie franchises.<br/><br/>Effects: lame. Had the movie been rated R like all of the Predator and Alien movies, this might have been better.<br/><br/>Overall: This movie really isn't worth your time. If you're not familiar with either the Alien or the Predator movies, you should stay away from AVP because it's not that good of a movie. More importantly, if you ARE a fan of either of the two movie franchises, don't see AVP or you'll come out of the theater wanting to tar and feather Paul Anderson, or maybe sic a face-hugger on him.

Once there, through taking some unknown weapons, they trigger a chain reaction closing many of the doors, and waking the frozen Alien mother who lays the eggs containing face huggers that lay new Aliens in the humans. Meanwhile, the Predator ship has landed and three of the humanoid warriors have entered the pyramid to destroy the Aliens. Through inscriptions on the walls, they find out that these creatures used to rule the human race during the dawn of man, and the Predators had to prove themselves worthy by fighting the Aliens, but it ended when one of them set of a bomb to kill all in the area, this new battle is basically another chance.

"robocop4","8","2","6","21 October 2005"," In Defense of AVP
","While most critics have dripped acid on Paul Anderson's ""Alien vs. Predator,"" apparently due to prima facie objections to the very idea of a non-courtroom-drama with the word ""versus"" in the title, I was pleasantly surprised by AVP.<br/><br/>Is AVP as great as 1986's ""Aliens""? Nope. But I think comparing AVP to ""Aliens"" is to employ the wrong standard. AVP is not competing with that film, in much the same way that ""Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country"" was not competing with the sensational ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" No, ""Star Trek VI"" was competing with the largely reviled ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier."" Similarly, AVP is really competing with the oppressively dark, fundamentally unappealing ""Alien 3"" and the strangely goofy, utterly unexciting ""Alien Resurrection""; the last Predator movie, 1990's ""Predator 2,"" was released so long ago and did such middling box office that it hardly figures in the popular imagination anymore.<br/><br/>Some have complained about AVP's characters, arguing that they're mere sketches compared to the colorful, indelible personalities that James Cameron provided us in ""Aliens,"" and John McTiernan gave us in ""Predator."" While true, it's worth pointing out that the original ""Alien"" ""suffers"" from the same ""problem,"" so much so that a defensive Ridley Scott once said, ""The characters in 'Alien' are as defined as they need to be, no more and no less."" Just as the characters in ""Alien"" were largely, nay, archetypically defined by their professions and their professionalism (or lack thereof), the characters in AVP are defined by their jobs and the proficiency with which they do them.<br/><br/>Some have also complained that many of AVP's characters are dispatched too quickly. However, that's part of what makes AVP interesting. It's a real throwback to horror films of yesteryear, films that weren't afraid to toss virtually everyone to the wolves. Just when you begin to think, ""Oh, Anderson's spent too much time developing this character, giving him/her good lines and telling us stuff about his/her past, to just off him/her,"" that person buys it. It's delightfully perverse, and it's what the horror genre has historically been all about.<br/><br/>Then there are the complaints about the film's storyline, with some asserting that it's too simple (e.g. humans find buried pyramid; humans enter buried pyramid; sh*t hits fan) and others arguing that it overshoots the mark (e.g. humans enter buried pyramid and discover that it's remarkably complex, revealing all manner of information about the origins of human civilizations, namely that the titular Predators, much like the Monolith from ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" made a marked impact on the future course of man long ago). But I had few problems with the film's premise. Even the rather silly, pulpy quality of AVP's grander narrative conceits didn't bother me that much. (Then again, such conceits didn't really bother me in ""Stargate"" either.) And the simpler aspects of AVP's plot were its strongest suits, for they grounded the movie in a kind of gritty, easily understood ""reality,"" the kind of reality that was very effective in John Carpenter's better action movies, from ""Assault on Precinct 13"" to ""Escape from New York."" Yes, it's true that AVP never achieves the epic heights of ""Aliens,"" the best film from either franchise, a film so complex and dynamic that it required a running time of 137 minutes to tell its tale. But ""Aliens"" was, and remains, an exceedingly special film. ""Aliens"" is the like the cinematic equivalent of one of those out-sized rock songs from the 1970s, such as Led Zeppelin's ""Stairway to Heaven""; AVP, at approximately 100 minutes in length, is more like a Ramones tune: short but sweet.<br/><br/>In fact, two of AVP's biggest problems seem to be the result of breakneck-speed sloppiness: 1. the Alien life-cycle is inexplicably abbreviated, with chestbursters making their nasty debuts in tens of minutes rather than tens of hours; 2. the Predators' long-range weapons (e.g. spears and throwing stars) are acid-resistant, yet their close-quarters matériel (e.g. wrist blades and body armor) are not.<br/><br/>Regarding Issue One: I've read that Anderson accounted for this in the film, explaining that the Predators had injected bizarre hormones into the Alien Queen they'd captured to seed their battlegrounds, causing the eggs she produced to contain embryos that matured far more quickly than usual. This expository material was allegedly ordered cut by Fox because they felt it needlessly slowed the pacing of the film. If true, Anderson must be given a pass by the legions of angry fan-boys who've ripped him a new one over this.<br/><br/>Regarding Issue Two: According to fan-boys familiar with the AVP comic books, this is explained therein thusly: the Predators must earn every acid-resistant armament they receive. So if the Preds in the AVP movie didn't have acid-resistant wrist blades or body armor, that's on them. But it's also on Anderson to have somehow explained this in his film. However, I'm willing to let Anderson slide here, as the best characters in AVP to have provided this explanation were the Preds themselves, a decidedly taciturn group of individuals.<br/><br/>All in all, AVP did its job. With the exception of a handful of (de rigueur) overly-jittery/super-slow shutter-speed shots in otherwise well-made action sequences, AVP is a polished piece of work. Thanks to Anderson's direction, the ADI FX Workshop was forced to abandon the Mr. Hanky-looking design of the creature from ""Alien 3,"" as well as the beastly, overly slimy appearance of the extraterrestrials from ""Alien Resurrection,"" and provide the silver screen with its best looking aliens since 1986. Moreover, if you can't bring yourself to buy it when Sanaa Lathan's Lex throws in with and throws down alongside the last-standing Big Ugly Mother, nor get certifiably juiced when the Alien Queen finally extricates herself from Predator-imposed bondage and goes on an angry rampage worthy of a T-Rex in a ""Jurassic Park"" movie, then I'm afraid AVP simply isn't for you."

As far as the Predator films are concerned, they weren't ever interesting enough for me to even care about but after the TV industry began broadcasting the original Predator concurrently and non-stop for what must be some unofficial record for most over-exposed movie, it began to grow on me but only as far as scoring it a 6 while the made for-TV-budgeted theatrical follow-up scores absolute zero. <br/><br/>So imagine how surprised I was to be recommending 'Alien vs Predator' to friends as a movie I really enjoyed throughout the half a dozen times I've caught it on cable this week. I found 'Alien Vs. Predator to be a compelling, entertaining film for several profoundly fascinating thoughtful story lines and plot twists that I felt had been glaringly ignored and overlooked by the viewing public. <br/><br/>Some leave a movie like 'Planet of the Apes' or '2001: A Space Odyssey' with the bewildered, disappointed sense that they've just walked out on a movie about monkeys run amok and in the same way movie reviewers and audiences alike while hoping for universal Armaegeddon in a long drawn-out battle between two of humankind's ghastliest of interplanetary foes, instead had to settle for something rather underwhelming by comparison. <br/><br/>I found the plot line where the only human survivor teams up with the surviving Predator against the Alien horde very clever and well done. <br/><br/>And finally, something that I was particularly struck by was the scene where the Predator performs some sort of victory ritual and then bows in subtle seemingly gracious appreciation for the human's effort for saving its life a profoundly original and sensitive gesture I would have never expected in a movie like this."

","I don't write reviews on IMDb very often. In fact I had completely forgotten that I even had a login name. Anyway, I felt compelled to write something regarding the awful pile of shite that is Alien Vs Predator. Although it was some time since I saw it, I feel it needs to be ridiculed again in light of the recent DVD release.<br/><br/>AVP is without doubt the worst film that I have ever watched (and I've seen Police Academy: Mission to Moscow). I didn't even bother watching the last five minutes because it was just so terrible.<br/><br/>I want to keep this brief but firstly I would like to make an appeal to all film studios the world over. Please please please stop giving W.S. Anderson work! He's clearly a talentless waste of space and his small but significantly crappy portfolio shows that."
"alienmojo","10","2","6","26 January 2005"," Not as bad as I thought it would be.
","Thankfully I read all of the bad comments on here before seeing it and expected the worst. I was happy to see the movie was better than I thought it would be. It suffered from the same thing as Alien 3 and that was character development. Too many characters that you felt very little for. I saw a chance for some cool characters... mainly that girl who has the pistol and talked to Lex about condoms in the beginning. It suffered a bit like Alien 4 in that it killed off its characters, and usually the good ones, too soon.<br/><br/>My view of the Alien films is such. Alien is still hands down the best of the series. Anyone who says ALIENS was the best doesn't understand good movie making... they just like action. Nothing wrong with that mind you, but for pure cinematography, character development, plot, and suspense... ALIEN is the best. Then I like ALIEN 3. Yes, I said ALIEN 3. I, like most Europeans, liked the darkness of it and the changing character of Ripley. I work night shift by myself and listen to cassette tapes of the movies, just the sound mind you, and I really enjoy the dialogue of 3. Then I like ALIENS for the action. Then AVP. Then ALIEN 4. ALIEN 4 was the most depressing. It had everything going for it! Great actors! ...and I mean great! ...well except for Whine ona Ryder. Great sets and dark story. Then it gets stupid and kills the best guys first!!! Oh if they just could have kept the black guy and killed the guy in the wheel chair, then I would have liked it more. ...and that STUPID alien!!! Oh don't let me go there. Then the final scene where the ship crashes into America and looks to take most of it out we hear Call say, ""You saved the world.."" Yeah! Right! So don't be too harsh on AVP. The only two things I hated were the two predators dying SO QUICKLY and at the end the predators NOT SEEING the alien in their fallen comrade...although he could see it in the human. Since the Predator was dead and emitting no heat it would have been easy to see the alien. Oh well... nothing can be as perfect as JAWS was."
"trance__gemini","1","2","6","24 January 2005"," Whoever wins.....................WE DON'T CARE
","First off I just want to say is this what I waited so many years for? When the previews were out and the rating was PG-13 I was like 'This can't be good....' and I was right. Without divulging too much (not that there is anything interesting to divulge anyways) all I can say is this is not your typical Aliens or Predators movie - and I mean it in a bad way. No gore, no violence no nothing. What there is are the following - lame characters, unbelievable sequences, lots of snoring during the movie. I am so sadly disappointed in the movie because it just wasn't well done in all aspects given the fact that they spent 17 years preparing for this. The PG-13 rating was also an issue because how can you have no gore/violence if it involves Aliens and Predators? These days all they care about is making money at the expense of everything else. Trust me on this - I am a HUGE fan of Aliens and Predators and have played all the games, seen all the movies, comics etc This movie is really bad. Don't waste your life/time/money watching it. Its true. Whoever wins I don't care and one last word of advice : NEITHER SHOULD YOU!"
"jeff6644444","2","2","6","22 December 2004"," Another Hollywood sellout
","This movie is a classic example of an R-rated movie brought down to Pg-13 for a little more Box office love. But its just another exmple of a director trying to attract viewers with ONLY action, and violence. Of course, Alien and Predator are classics, but this nearly ruined them. Being a lover of both movies, i expected a lot more from this movie(which i shouldn't have). I would give it a 2 out of ten.On the acting(gag), if i didn't know what i was seeing, i would guess it was a soft-core porn(and a bad one!). Well i have to give the makers of AvP a break. They are just giving in to the Peer-Pressures of Hollywood. Money is very temping...who gives a hoot if you do a half-ass job, as long as you bring in the cash? Well the viewer does. But back to the point. Don't give up on the original movies, and pray to God they don't make an AvP 2!!!"
"jongruner","1","2","6","28 October 2004"," the heretic, all film prints should be burned!!!!
","Who the hell thought of bringing the comic book spin off to the screen? I mean the comics are rubbish! And this movie........!!!! The creation of what I'm sure will become a series of AVP outings completely destroys the Alien mythology, (forget the predator, it's rubbish) The dialogue in this movie is rubbish as is the effects, the alien, a smart calculating race, is ""dumbed"" down in AVP to become the game sport of the Predator aliens, with an Alien queen chained up in a egg laying chamber.<br/><br/>As the first Alien film established that humans did not come into contact with this race until far into the future, it makes this movie very hard to swallow, and who decided to give the predators personalities of the care bears? In all a bitter disappointment, but hopefully with the renewed interest in the Alien movies, perhaps an Alien 5 will be on the cards, with or without Sigorney Weaver?"

","I can take a lot when watching sci-fi films. I loved both the Aliens and Predator movies. And add to that the fact that I went into this movie with very low expectations due to the poor reviews I saw beforehand. <br/><br/>And I still came out of it terribly disappointed. I would have walked out had I not been there with friends. It was so bad that I found it more interesting to eavesdrop on the couple sitting behind me than to watch the movie - and people talking in movies is normally a major peeve of mine.<br/><br/>On paper this should have been a classic. The overall story concept wasn't too bad. The 'mythology' behind what was going on in the movie was clever. But thats about where the praise stops. <br/><br/>The characters had no depth. I could have lived with that, but everything about them dripped of cliché. But you'd think the action would make up for it. It didn't. I didn't find the action in any way exciting. Bad direction or what, I don't know. I just know I couldn't wait for it to be over.<br/><br/>Quite easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'd watch the D&D movie over and over again, straight for 15 hours, before I watched AvP again."

","SPOILERS LISTED! If you don't want to read the spoilers, then read this: THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLE!<br/><br/>ahem<br/><br/>So, why was this movie so mind-numbingly bad? For starters, hands down THE WORST lines ever... yes, worse than Wing Commander AND Basic. Second, a horrible story. I can understand a BAD story because in theory, having a movie with the Alien and Predator in it would not require a good story, kinda like porn or video games, both of which require plots, just not good ones. Third, TERRIBLE characters. I mean down right fake, unbelievable and hokey unlikeable characters. BOOOOO! Fourth, and this is by far the movies greatest offense: The scene in which the surviving predator and the surviving woman are running for 2+ on screen minutes from an explosion. This scene not only shows them comically running side-by-side-slow-motion-with-the-explosion-occurring-behind-them-and-them-outrunning-a-crazy-big-shock-wave, but ALSO involves, for some strange reason, a seemingly rocket powered sled. All that aside, the 2 actual fight scenes that actually seem to pit an alien vs a predator were subpar at best. Avoid this movie at all costs. Bad by action standards... and we all know that those standards are set depressingly low. -Keep that third eye open, Lateralium"
"baudeparts","1","2","6","15 August 2004"," Excellent special effects, horrible acting.
","Overall I think I rated this a 4. I mean who doesn't love Predator, just to watch Predator alone it was worth the money. Die hard Alien and Predator fans will find this a must see but don't expect it to outshine previous releases featuring these two monsters. When it came to the dialogue and humor, this movie fell very short. Lines from earlier Alien and Pedator movies are reused and didn't get even a chuckle out of most of the audience. Though Lance Henrikson stars in AVP, (played Bishop in Aliens) he doesn't bring very much to the screen. Most of his screen time is spent wheezing and coughing. The heroin was overbearing and lacked sex appeal. Ewen Bremmer (Spud from Trainspotting) could have been a lot more humorous. Should you see it? Yes.But I would wait for it on DVD."

","Sweet. Merciful. God. I don't know what I did to deserve seeing the abomination known as Alien Vs. Predator. Maybe I was just bored? Maybe I thought the movie would be as good as the other Alien/Predator films? I don't know. All I do know is that this movie spits on and destroys everything in the past movies. I would now like to make a few comments:<br/><br/>1) CGI does not work. At the end of the movie, there are shots of a CGI Queen alien that looks like a T-rex from Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>2) Total death of the Alien mythology. Okay, so now we have facehuggers who implant people and in less than 10 minutes, chestbursters pop out. What the hell?<br/><br/>3) Many plot inconsistencies, including: the strange Predator vision that has been changed from the previous movies, the fact that at the end of the movie there is a person running around in sub-zero temperatures wearing nothing but a sweater, the aforementioned facehugger-to-chestburster timeframe, the fact that two Predators can get wasted by an Alien in a span of 5 minutes, the number of aliens running around does not correspond to the number of potential hosts (most of which were killed), the fact that a Queen Alien is still living after many centuries, the issue of Charles Weyland having already showed up (or somnething like him) in Alien 3, and many others...<br/><br/>4) Cookie-cutter characters. Since this movie is only an hour and a half, no one really cares if any of the main characters die, Also, the acting is atrocious.<br/><br/>5) PG-13 rating. Obviously Fox wanted to market this to teenagers, and as a result, much of the gore and violence that were present in the previous movies are gone here (with the exception of Alien-on-Predator gore).<br/><br/>I wanted this movie to have an R-rating. I really did, and this is coming from a 16-year old. Being a person who owns the Alien Quadrilogy and has actually READ the AVP books (the same can't be said for many other people), I had high hopes for this. Then I realized that Paul W.S. Anderson (director of such box-office disasters such as Soldier and Resident Evil) was directing this. That's never a good sign. As a result, the movie is poorly edited, too short, and has bad acting. Don't go ee this movie. Stay at home and watch the originals. You'll feel much better.<br/><br/>""Whoever wins, we lose."""
"mvorloi","1","2","6","15 August 2004"," [SPOILERS], heh, as if this movie could be spoiled Seriously it is that bad
","Both the Alien and Predator franchises, with their ups and downs on any media (movies, novels, comics, etc.) at least gave you the opportunity to imagine beyond the obvious. The only thing this movie made me imagine were blind drunken squirrels in suits on the Fox movie lot approving this exercise in frustration.<br/><br/>Plot: Uhhh The Predators return every 100 years and send three warriors to perform a rite of passage on a pyramid submerged on Antartica. What really baffles me is that the Predators seem to use the human calendar to start the hunt and open their weapons chest. Say what! Why did the predators choose to teach the humans different styles of building/date keeping depending on the geographical area they lived seems only born out of their sadomasochistic nature. <br/><br/>Acting: The penguin that appeared early in the movie and criss-cross alien gave strong performances. Everyone else was apparently computer generated using 286's and given dialog so poor, that it is indistinguishable from that of any old Batman & Robin show. <br/><br/>Action to bore Ratio: 70% boring stupid and/or inane acting or explanations, 5% good fights, 25% blatant ripoffs of other movie's chase / spook scenes.<br/><br/>Originality: Since Vanilla Sky I have not seen a movie completely made up of other movies in such a blatant fashion, in a shot be shot format. To be honest I thought Weyland was hiring them to go check on his dinosaurs, and at the end I was expecting either Danny Glover or Batman to come out and beat the snot out of that queen!<br/><br/>Plot Holes: The plot is a hole, or maybe the hole is a plot, it's a Zen Thing. Though seriously what can you expect of the man who directed the movies from the Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil franchises.<br/><br/>Watch this film if: you are on a plane that's going down in flames, you'll look forward to die!<br/><br/>Avoid this film if: you are breathing.<br/><br/>Most stupid aspect of this movie: An Alien/Predator movie that's PG-13. What's next? A ""G"" rated American Pie movie?<br/><br/>Most enjoyable part of this movie: The Without a Paddle trailer.<br/><br/>Wishful Thinking. That the Predator bomb would be detonated during the first half-hour and everybody on Earth died liberating us from the awful acting on this picture."

","I just got back from seeing Alien versus Predator, and well, Paul Anderson screwed up yet another movie. Who in their write mind would allow this man to Direct, let alone write this thing? I love both of these franchises dearly, but that man ruined what could have been a sleeper hit. How? Let's review:<br/><br/>1) First off, the beginning. For the first half of the movie, the entire plot is just like Jurassic park (Potential Spoilers) A number of people, including a guide and archaeologists are summoned by a rich old man. They find a pyramid under the Antarctic and go on an expedition to find it. (End spoilers). This is literally the first half of this wretched movie. No Predators, no violence, no nudity, no cursing, nothing<br/><br/>2) The acting and script were absolutely horrible. Seriously, I think that one of the dudes who wrote one of the many comics/books involving predators, aliens or both should have written the script for this movie, instead of the worst director ever (Seriously, The Hulk, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake were better than this). In my opinion, this movie lacked a serious writer, a writer who would have put some god damn action in the first half of the movie. <br/><br/>3) The violence and cursing were definitely off. Maybe it's me, but every single Alien and Predator movie featured serious cursing (Ugly mother f***er, sexual tyrannosaurus, and the classic joke about the girlfriend's pussy), and they never wussed out when someone got killed (They showed the black dude lose his arm, people getting headbitten and facehuggings and chest burstings). They wussed out this time. Seriously, whenever someone got killed, the camera panned away from the screen. Here is a short list I can think off (Spoilers) When that guy is killed by the predators (the other two walk past him), when that chick was chest bursted and face hugged, when that guy was killing the facehuggers/when he got killed by them, when the alien finally kills the fat predator (end spoilers) In short, this movie could have been the worst movie ever (which it is), but if it just had a good chunk of violence, then we would all be happy. Off screen killings and one f-bomb don't cut it, and that idiot director should have learned that by now.<br/><br/>4) The way it disrespects everything about both of these franchises. First off, if their are only 3 predators, it just doesn't feel right when one of them goes out like a punk. (Spoilers) Second, how come the coolest looking one also went put like a punk? And how come his blades/armor got melted by the acid? Another thing I didn't get was why the main predator didn't kill himself after getting faced hugged. (end Spoilers). Lastly (Spoilers) Why didn't the predalien come out earlier? It would have definitely improved the entire scope of the movie and it would have added something to the entire mythology surrounding the aliens/predators. Besides that, we could have gotten a really cool action figure (end Spoilers)<br/><br/>I really hoped I could have liked this movie (I really enjoyed Freddy versus Jason) but it just sucked like a bitch. Still it was decent in some places, but when any other director (including Micheal Bay and any half-way decent music video director) could have made a better movie than this one, we have a problem. this is a pale reflection of the classic movies in both franchises, and Paul Anderson should be ashamed of himself. It is a sad day when a movie you wanted to love is crappier than all of the recent George Lucas movies, The Hulk, Catwoman, and White chicks. still it was much better than anything created by Michael Moore, and the movies elephant and Chicago. So, in conclusion, Alien versus Predator is better than most of the movies that win Oscars or the Cannes film festival."

I think it would have fared better if it was and R-rated film, but then again, the sequel was R-rated and that one didn't do too well either. I dunno why people dislike it, Nostalgia Critic reviewed it saying ""It is overall worth watching."" And there are tons of worse movies getting 4-star reviews, so yeah, I blame the economy.

"daryahorenko","1","1","2","29 May 2018"," Terrible, yet better than ""Alien: Resurrection""
","I know that the AvP aren't canon to either franchise, but there's so many things that don't make sense in regards to the Alien universe, like the movie takes place in 2004 and Mr. Weyland is played by the same actor who played Bishop in Aliens. It doesn't help that he's called ""Charles Bishop Weyland"" in the movie.<br/><br/>That's not the only things that don't make sense. 1) When we first see our main character she's climbing up a frozen cliff on a mountain. There's a wide shot where we clearly see that there's nothing but snow on the plateau above. By the time she gets there there's a helicopter and its pilot up there who... flew there without her noticing!? 2) Mr. Weyland gives his speech at the briefing while standing on a bridge inside the ship's hangar BEHIND the characters 3) Our main character and I will just call her by her name Alexa Woods (*great name*) from now on is taking a helicopter to fly to the icebreaker where the team is located. Why not land the helicopter on the ship while it's still in a harbor and save gas? 4) It's never explained why Alexa decides to stay on the ship.<br/><br/>The story of this movie is really not that special. Who thought it would be a good idea to make this a archeology movie? In the beginning we go from one place to another over and over again within minutes. ""Rogue One"" did the same, but in that movie it worked because the things that happened in those different places were actually relevant to the story. Here they're not.<br/><br/>All of the actresses and actors except Lance Henriksen are really bad in both their line delivery and facial expressions. The acting is better than the ""acting"" in ""Alien: Resurrection"" though.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the ""characters"". We're supposed to care about Alexa the most, yet we don't know anything about her. Oh well we do, there's a ludicrous ATTEMPT of an emotional scene where we find out about the story with her dad. We're supposed to care about Graeme, yet all we know about him is that he's OBSESSED with taking photos to the point where it gets really annoying. This is my first Predator movie. In this movie they do nothing but kill humans and xenomorphs. The xenomorph queen looks amazing of course, but why is there visible electricity all around her? And she's tied up, laying spores/eggs, whatever you want to call them but I'd rather call them spores because that's what it says in the menu of my Alien Blu-ray, similar to ""Alien: Resurrection"", where the xenomorphs are caged. This movie takes so long to get to the point which makes it really boring. Aliens did that, too, but it worked because the team we spent our time with was interesting and they were good characters. The human characters in this movie are hollow, boring and uninteresting and they suck at acting. They are really dumb as well. Once they're trapped in the pyramid they decide to enter its even lower levels.<br/><br/>Once we get the facehuggers they jump out of the spores in slow motion for some reason. That was absolutely pointless. There's a lot of overuse of slow motion in this movie.<br/><br/>In the original ""Alien"" there was quite some time between the facehugger leaving the host's face, the host waking up and the xenomorph bursting out of the person's chest. In this movie it's taking minutes or even seconds. The moments we've all been waiting for, the xenomorph and predator fighting look like garbage. It's just shaky cam, which is a shame because they have really good xenomorph props and the predators look really cool, too. And why can xenomorphs fall through the floors of the pyramid? I don't think they're THAT heavy. By the way, why can't the xenomorph queen outrun a human?<br/><br/>And there's no way I can review this movie without mentioning the jumpscares. For example there's a scene where we're made to think a xenomorph is about to show up but it's a penguin. SECONDS earlier Alexa touches Graeme from behind with the most clichéd loud music.<br/><br/>This was my first Paul W. S. Anderson movie and everyone says his movies are terrible and he's a terrible director and this movie was written by him as well, so I was very concerned about what I was going to see. And here's my opinion: He's a bad director, but he's even worse as a screenplay writer. What I hate most about his writing is that there's so many exposition scenes. Or maybe it's the stupid twist that the character have to team up with the predators. It's ridiculous when they say ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"".<br/><br/>I think Pepsi and National Geographic regret their product placements.<br/><br/>Oh and the credits go on for TWELVE MINUTES."
"Dutch90","7","1","2","22 April 2018"," Better Than You Think
","Call it lowering standards or blind fanboyism, but I place myself in the 'AVP is sort of good' camp. While the film definitely has its issues and doesn't live up to the potential of, say, the 1991 Peter Briggs script or certain fan fiction, it is not the train wreck people make it out to be.<br/><br/>15 years in the making, after a 1989 comic book followed by an easter egg in 1990's Predator 2, AVP was finally there in summer 2004. Fans were concerned about the choice to let Paul W.S. Anderson write and direct. While he's definitely made some mistakes along the way, it actually seems like a pretty logical choice in retrospect. He made a pretty entertaining Alien knock-off with 1997's Event Horizon, and his 1995 Mortal Kombat adaptation is generally considered to be one of the better video game movies out there. The same can be said for the original Resident Evil, his last film before directing AVP, which, unlike some of the sequels, wasn't half bad. <br/><br/>Granted, Anderson is no Ridley Scott or John McTiernan. While he is a superb cinematographer who really creates a sense of dread and impending doom in AVP's lengthy set-up (aided by glorious set design), when the action finally begins it is somewhat underwhelming. The camera is shaky, the editing is choppy and the amount of actual Alien/Predator fights is quite limited. We get one major showdown with the lead Alien, 'Grid', and one climactic battle with the Alien Queen. Between that, the action is limited to several short skirmishes including the welcome return of the Predator's plasma cannon. <br/><br/>AVP's characters are not as engaging as Alien's or as iconic as Predator's. Still, Sanaa Lathan - who I was unfamiliar with beforehand - manages to fill the huge heroine-shaped void left by Sigourney Weaver in this first Ripley-less Alien film. Lathan's portrayal of Lex is stern and righteous, even if she has little to work with. Lance Henriksen serves to connect the film to the Alien mythos by playing an ancestor to Alien 3's Bishop II (it's obvious Anderson is more of an Alien fanboy). The human/Predator team-up is a bit cheesy, but makes sense strategically - Predators function in a higher manner like humans, and working together against the Aliens was the rational thing to do.<br/><br/>Much has been said of AVP's maligned PG-13 rating. While I think horror in general is brought down by too much emphasis on gore as cheap shock value (I'm looking at you, Alien: Resurrection), the rating does result in a bizarrely bloodless chestburster scene, which is as great an offense as Live Free Or Die Hard's neutered 'yippee-ki-yay' line. Then again, the second AVP demonstrates that more gore does not a better movie make. <br/><br/>But let's focus on the positive things here - even if they could be better, the Alien/Predator confrontations are a thrill to finally see on the big screen. It's great fun to see the two creatures interact and how their abilities play off against each other, given that they were never designed to co-exist. It's amazing happenstance, for instance, that Aliens established that the creatures don't show up on infrared, which just so happens to be the Predator's way of tracking its quarry. Also, the amazing set design and cinematography make the film look like a 100+ million tentpole flick, when in reality it cost about half as much. There is also a plethora of easter eggs and throwbacks to previous films, especially the Alien half, that will please many fans. To top it off, much of the film looks great SFX-wise. The CGI looks a bit dated now, but is used only when necessary. Much of the creature effects are physical, and look better than ever. The poop-brown color and excessive slime from Alien: Resurrection are wisely ditched, and the Predators retain their tribal look (admittedly, AVPR had better looking Predators).<br/><br/>In the end, I think many detractors had been waiting for an AVP film so long they already had a perfect vision of it in their heads, and the film betrayed that vision by being something else. AVP could have been much more and things really hit a snag with the awful sequel. The perfect AVP film is still out there somewhere, waiting to be made."

","I really do not have anything else to say about this film aside from the fact that it was just average, but not needed to be made at all. I do think that the soundtrack was pretty decent and there was good action scenes, almost even great. But I didn't care for the characters at all and the effects seemed almost too realistic for their own good. I know that it sounds odd for me to say that, but that was just how I felt about the whole thing. So with a good soundtrack and action, but bad acting and too realistic effects, the film just ends up being totally average."

"InaneSwine","7","1","2","18 February 2016"," Not very thoughtful, but keeps you occupied
","I saw Alien vs. Predator a lot of years ago, and I remember it leaving a bit of a non-impression on me. I remembered it as a little dull, and a bit daft. But recently, I went through both film franchises again. I decided that after the stupid Predator 2, the boring Alien 3 and, well, whatever the hell Alien 4 was, AVP couldn't get much worse. Having given it another go, I was thoroughly entertained by it.<br/><br/>There's not much of a story, the plot is narrow and the human characters don't have much to offer. It was nice seeing the old familiar face of Lance Henriksen again, and Ewan Bremner and Tommy Flanagan are decent. As for Sanaa Lathan, she's certainly no Sigourney Weaver, but she does a fair job at holding her own as the leading lady. But after the first half, she and the rest of the cast really have very little to do. Once an hour or so is spent teasing us with slight glimpses, references and homages, the focus permanently shifts to fleshing out the history and mythology of our two titular beasts, moreover, watching them knock lumps out of each other.<br/><br/>First of all, AVP is a welcome improvement over the pathetic CGI blob of Alien 3 and the hybrid monstrosities of its sequel. The creature designs in this one are refined, back-to-basics designs that made the first two films work so well, including a welcome back for our favourite Alien, the Queen herself. All the Aliens are scary and menacing looking. Some have criticised their scenes for being too dark, but that's their trademark, and how they should have been kept. Surrounded by darkness, barely visible, not knowing which corner they're gonna leap out of next. In this respect, Predator becomes a much more threatening villain too. Adapting to the horror tone of its counterpart, it still delivers the action thrills the Predator films are known for. Watching the two of them fight is a real treat for the eyes and ears.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, in spite of everything it has going for it, it still doesn't leave that big an impression on me. It really doesn't make you think. But for its two hour run-time, it will keep you occupied. It's the best Alien film since James Cameron's Aliens and, dare I say, it's the best Predator film so far. I was expecting nothing more than watching the two beasts scrapping with each other and killing each other in imaginative ways. And that's exactly what I got. I'm a happy shopper."

","As sci-fi franchises go, I find the Alien and Predator universes to be quite fascinating, so melding the two into a single story line was done rather creatively here. I like the idea of the Predator hunters luring humans to a remote Antarctic location in order to breed Aliens for sport. Once you take it on faith the rival species could behave this way the possibilities are endless. The idea that a young teenage hunter Predator could form an alliance with a human like Alexa (Sanaa Lathan) was an interesting concept to explore and managed to distinguish the warrior as a noble creature. But the major revelation for me was how Pepsi managed to beat out Coca Cola for product placement honors for this picture. I guess a Coke and a smile just wouldn't have worked under the circumstances."
"DesertDogMedia","7","1","2","6 July 2014"," Alien vs. Predator
","Title: Alien vs Predator <br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: An unidentified heat source is found in Antarctica, so a group of explores go and check it out while being funded by a rich guy. They explore the pyramid that is the heat source and end up awakening the queen alien which then sends out her children. But their are also Predators after them as they are in their hunting ground. So it is classic horror movie events happened such as splitting up and getting killed off one by one. This is until the female protagonist is the last one standing and gives the Predator his weapon back, so she then teams up with the predator to kill the queen alien. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: Err.. I couldn't remember anyones names throughout the thing, mainly because everyone felt like CONI (Characters of no importance) to me. The only people I can remember as the main female protagonist, main male protagonist and that rich guy who funded the trip. I can understand that this movie wanted to go the only 1 person will survive thing from both 'Alien' and 'Predator'. But I had a hard time caring about any of the people. They had great acting, but their characters were flat and wooden to me. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: 180º rotation to reveal the temple along with a birds eye shot after the face hugger falls from the celling. Speeded up dolly shot as the eggs rise up in the sacrificial chamber. Worms eye after the layout of the temple changes and traps/splits up people. <br/><br/>Graphics: The CGI for the queen is good, but part of me was thinking it would be animatronics. But realistically as this movie was made in 2004, chances are it is CGI. CGI for the Predator's invisibility is decent as well, similar to the original, but seems to have improved slightly. <br/><br/>Costume: The costume of the alien and predator were great in my opinion, not too sure what was CGI and what has practical in the sense of the alien's screen time. But they both looked like how they did in their prime original movies. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: I can understand why so many fans were so ecstatic to hear that Alien and Predator were sharing a movie. Just as I can understand why so many fans were disappointed to see that the movie wasn't all it was cracked up to be. But considering that the Alien franchise went down hill after 'Aliens' this should have been a warning sign straight away, and honestly this movie is better in terms of logic than Alien 3&4. As you should know, Alien 3 killed of the secondary/main characters from Aliens. Making that entire movie redundant. Alien 4 brought by Ripley which completely negated Alien 3's ending. This movie explains that the Predators would hunt the Aliens for sport and use the humans as vessels. That makes much more coherent sense than Alien 3 and 4. But, it does have its problems. The temple has cobwebs, the temple is also located in Antarctica. No species of spider lives in Antarctica. The time of the story is set in October, this is autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. But this is also spring in the Southern Hemisphere. The movie presents it as constantly dark, this only happens from April to August. The rest of the year has constant 24 hour day light. Bar September and March. But this alters depending on where in Antarctica you are. But looking at light charts there is only 6 hour maximum of darkness and that is civil twilight. For those not familiar with civil twilight, it is when the sun has gone down but the sky is still bright, this is best seen at 9pm in early July. But regardless of it's faults and errors and truly forgettable characters, this movie is better than the 5 stars it's given on IMDb. It is one of those movies for people who like the franchises, but are not crazy about it."
"OllieSuave-007","6","1","2","7 May 2014"," Neat seeing two hostile alien groups duke it out!
","***minor spoiler in first paragraph*** With the Aliens, Predators and Promethesus movies all existing in the same continuity, this movie by time-line is the first film that precedes all the course of events, where an expedition of archaeologists, headed by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksenon) discover an Aztec temple hidden in Antarctica, inhabited by the Alien creatures. Soon, a group of the the Predator creatures arrives from space and to the temple, which is actually a training ground for their species where they hunt the Aliens. What results is a pretty epic battle of the two groups, with the humans being caught in the middle of the war.<br/><br/>I thought the special and visual effects for the creatures were thoroughly done and well-executed, making the creatures look realistic and menacing. It was very neat seeing two film-iconic space creatures, the Aliens and Predators, appear in one movie and take it out on one another.<br/><br/>The acting is OK, nothing too cheesy, and the music score is serviceable. However, I thought the overall plot is slow and lacks the tension and suspense of the earlier Alien and Predator movies. The story is very complicated and you would probably have to watch the movie multiple times to understand everything; I had to read the film synopsis to grasp everything. While the acting was OK, the characters weren't memorable; nothing as epic as the characters in the original Aliens and Predator films.<br/><br/>Again, it is nice seeing the Aliens battle the Predators, and those scenes did provide some good action fun. But overall, this film is very average compared to the earlier films.<br/><br/>Grade C"

","I first went into this movie back in 2004 not sure what to expect, just hoping it wasn't going to be completely stupid, like a SYFY movie of the week, or a disappointment like Alien 3. What I got was an entertaining romp which although not as serious to the origins of the originals was quite entertaining. Surly there was problems with dialog and lighting (digitally brighten the faces being the worst). The problem with dialog being just the standard stuff people would say, some may call it cliché but there is a lot of reuse and cliché phrases in the common language. <br/><br/>The good things about this movie are the action, environments, creatures, and the fictional history created involving how all three species were connected. Some may find that last annoying, a mishmash of different elements of history to create a basis for a story (not unlike Stargate or Chariots Of The Gods), but this is fantastical fiction after all. The environments, although on Earth, are moody and atmospheric, not to mention dark and claustrophobic. The creatures, a mix of CGI and practical effects, have never been better (especially the slime!), and I appreciate the return to the original Alien head design. And the action is as good as you can get without being ridiculous.<br/><br/>This movie is not great, like Alien or Aliens, and maybe just on par with Predator but it is a lot of fun."
"rdbrown-zeteo","7","1","2","3 October 2012"," I for one... possibly the only one... enjoyed AVP!
","I'm not one of those ""non-fans"" who just so happened to like ""AVP"".<br/><br/>I am a fan of both the Alien movies and the Predator movies (though I thought Predator 2 was only half as good as the first). <br/><br/>All the other Alien and Predator movies give us the depth that so many people complain wasn't in AVP. This movie is all about FUN! <br/><br/>Some people may complain about the movie holding back on the violence and gore. My opinion, the PG-13 restraint pushed the makers to be more creative with the blood and gore. There was a lot for a PG-13 movie by the way. It almost takes on an artistic/stylish factor as opposed to drenching the screen with it. <br/><br/>Sure, its AVP..... Not AVH (alien vs. humans), but without the humans then there wouldn't be aliens for the predators to fight. Without the humans, the AVP would have truly been a film lacking depth. <br/><br/>I didn't think the script was so bad. It wasn't great or profound in anyway, but enjoyable. That acting wasn't terrible like so many people are saying. Trust me, there are a lot of overrated films with worse acting. <br/><br/>Finally, my favorite part of AVP is the development between the Predator and the lead actress. I thought it was pretty cool.... who in their right mind can tell me that that is not an element of depth. If you want depth, just let the Predator kill all the humans and then what? Kill the Aliens... and then what? Anyways. <br/><br/>In summary, this movie is not so bad, in fact I very much liked it. It is really short compared to the Alien and Predator movies, but that's okay. It is exactly what it was intended to be but I guess most people didn't get that."

Good riddance.<br/><br/>Two scenes stand out - first the satellite find a heat source in Antarctica - in 2004 which no one has ever seen before. OK, maybe it's because of the newly ""drilled"" hole. Anyway you spend the first 20 minutes trying to figure out why no one has noticed it in the age of satellites. Then heroine befriends a Predator - my god that scene is so horribly cliché you want it to change its mind and kill the stupid woman already.<br/><br/>No, unless you are looking for self-punishment - this is something to stay well clear of.

","In my opinion, this crossover isn't as bad as the critics say it is, but to be greatly honest, it certainly isn't that great either. Before I can get to the pros and cons, I just want to say that I only saw two Alien movies and have not watched any of the Predator movies along with the remake two years ago, so I didn't do anything to watch them yet, but I really plan to someday or soon, maybe. So, you get my point, right? Anyway, on to the movie. <br/><br/>There are some let-downs that ruined the film for me. The story falls into the predictable zone (I liked the idea of Alien meeting the Predator, but the way.), the pacing's uneven, the directing is uninspiring, and the dialog is quite tedious. The characters are cardboard cutouts with no personalities and were just used as victims for the monsters and some of the acting is a mixed bag. Sanaa Lathan was very decent as Alexa and Lance Henriksen did a great job as Bishop, which makes them both interesting characters, but some of the actors just fell flat for me.<br/><br/>Despite it's flaws, there are some redeeming qualities. The visuals are pretty, the cinematography's very nice, the make-ups for Alien and Predator are solid, and the music from Harold Kloser is pretty darn good. The action is very outstanding with the Alien and the Predator fighting against each other coming off as the best and the special effects are surprisingly good.<br/><br/>So, is Alien VS. Predator bad? Well, compared to that godawful sequel that came out three years later, I say, ""No"", but in terms of story, it would've been so much better. It's a strictly mediocre film for itself. I'm sure fans of Alien and Predator will like it, but for others, I'd rather skip it."
"ClintWardley1","6","1","2","4 April 2012"," Hey I liked it. BUT??
","Okay as I always say in any review 'it's a movie, it isn't Shakespeare'. But sometimes I wonder if the scriptwriters understand the word Sequel. You would think that they would think, 'Goody, the back story is written now I can really get down to it'. That is, they build on the story, writing a script, which is continuation of the popular myth the previous successful movie created. In AvP they had the perfect opportunity, but instead of fitting the script to the myth, they, and they are not alone in this, (I sometimes think the screen writers guild must run a course called 'Sequel Writing – How to ignore the blatantly obvious'). They tinker with the details of the previous successful movies to fit their substandard script, (IE the gestation period of an Alien is changed to 30 seconds) rather than be constrained within the back story.<br/><br/>What this does is create an environment that produces plot holes. Because when you start tinkering with the basic story this leads down to making other changes that eventually creates more and more compromises. This movie had plot holes a plenty, but I just ignored them and enjoyed the shallow movie it was.<br/><br/>One comment though, the Predators better speed up the testing their Warriors. If the 3 Predators are an example of their best then these boys must be in decline. In previous visits they took on Aliens in there 100's. These guys had trouble with 9. I would ask their Coach, have they become too reliant on their shoulder cannons?? And whomever makes their Armour should be speared, please at least give these novices acid resistant Armour."

So there are two alien races who have been fighting for thousands of years and then they bring their fight to Earth where the Predators are considered gods and the Aliens are turned into pawns for the Predators way of deciding whether their teen Predators are worthy of becoming men. Humans are tricked into finding the Predator pyramid so that they can make more Aliens for the Predators. Alright story so far I guess.<br/><br/>But then somehow, the humans and the Predators begin to work together? And then the human and the Predator form some kind of special bond? Almost as if they have become close friends? If it wasn't for this then I maybe would of knocked the rating to a seven. This ruined the whole film for me. How can a human become friends with a hideous, killer monster from outer space? And how can a hideous, killer monster from outer space become friends with a human? The Predator should of just ripped her skull out like everyone wanted him to, not become a friendly big brother kind of figure for her.<br/><br/>I loved Predator, Alien and Aliens so I thought I'd give it a go.

If you view this film as part of the Aliens/Predator canons, and are precious about them, you are probably going to hate this film. It's not terribly well-made - the special effects are occasionally striking, but more often look a little clunky. The scene where they discover the Pyramid is a good example - it's hopelessly out of scale, and it even looks like 1980s bluescreen..... surely no-one In 2004 would have let that stay in the film? The script is wooden, it seems like it was written by a 17 year old retaking his GCSEs, but all credit to the actors, they do the best with it that they can. The characterisations are ersatz and formulaic, that's always a bit irritating, although Lance Henriksen's character has a decent flaw I wasn't expecting. There are huge plot-holes, I know a little about Aztec civilisation but the scriptwriters obviously knew less than I did! If you can suspend these not inconsiderable failings, there is an enjoyable hokumish action-thriller here, that's certainly worth 88 minutes of your time. The pacing is fairly good, the pyramid interior is a fascinating backdrop full of images and patterns from the Alien/Predator franchises, and the creature fight sequences are exciting, if a little confusing sometimes. I confess I was on the side of the Aliens, and cheered each time they notched a kill up! There's little of the claustrophobic horror of ""Alien"", just enough action combat but not as well choreographed as ""Aliens"" or ""Predator 1"", the chilling cathedral-like atmosphere of ""Alien 3"" is present but muted in this film, and there's very little of the humour and dazzle of ""Alien Resurrection"" and ""Predator 2"". But it's far from bad. It's just not great. I can think of far worse films. Watch it and make your mind up!"

","Now let me start by saying the characters in this movie aren't all that impressive. In fact you can flat out say they suck. What made the Aliens franchise, well at the every least the first two, so great is that you connected with the characters. You wanted them to make it out alive, and when they didn't, you actually gave a damn. When the characters die in this movie, I just don't care. Not to mention the story was complete bull.<br/><br/>Instead of taking place in the future, or on some distant planet, this takes place on Earth in the present day, Predators used to be Gods to the Mayans, Aliens treated like fodder for generic horror movie, temple was rebuilt after it got completely blown apart with the force of a nuclear bomb...what the hell?! This plot is complete and utter crap!! And the score was mostly..what else, sh*t.<br/><br/>But in the movie's defense, the Predators look awesome, as do the xenomorphs. It's been around six or seven years since this was released, so after all this time it comes down to the fact that simply don't walk into this movie expecting deep characterization, a flowing and coherent plot, memorable music or even R-rated violence. After all, it is no Steven Spielberg or James Cameron, it's Paul W.S. Anderson. That says it all right there. just expect a decent action flick."

Not by any means is AVP even in consideration to be called a ""good"" movie. But, I still enjoy it. I mean, yeah, the dialogue is cringe-worthy, the acting is mediocre at best, and the story sounds like a crappy fan fiction written by some 12 year old kid. It's stupid, but, it's entertaining. It does feel like the violence is severely held back, but in the long run, I don't think it negatively affects the movie that much. This film isn't even in the same league as the original films, but I still enjoyed it because it's a fun, action-packed experience. I enjoyed it despite it's blatantly obvious flaws, and it definitely is a guilty pleasure of mine, along with its sequel that suffers even more from the same problems. In the end, AVP is a fun, yet unbearably stupid film. 6/10"
"CandidlyCandid","Null","1","2","8 March 2009"," Rather Good
","Before going into the cinemas to watch AVP, I heard a rant of negative reviews about the movie. I went in with zero expectations but walked out pretty happy witnessing a fast-paced action with arguably two of the best characters and villains in Sci-Fi. There were really no boring bits, they had a good plot to go with, some biological history to back it up and the fighting execution was done rather well. Shame, but this movie had a dull rating of PG-13, which limited more detailed and bloody fights which was unfortunate, considering the Predator and Alien movies are pretty gruesome at times. Apart from that this movie was rather enjoyable, the Predator and Alien returned since their last unsuccessful installment in their series to deliver a good action flick. A recommendation to all Sci-Fi and Action fans."
"dondanhernandez","8","1","2","7 January 2009"," A decent sequel
","Many people found Anderson's vision something of a let down. Predator fans complained that he gave the upper hand to the alien, alien fans complained how the birthing and maturing process of the alien was sped up a lot. However the film nonetheless stays true to its origins comes into the classics of the series and walks away humbly. <br/><br/>Spoilers: First off the movie though PG-13 still retains the elements of the series we don't need massive amounts of gore to get the effect and thing is bot the alien and predator movies were actual pretty subtle with the gore, I've seen other PG-13 movies that had more gore than the original alien and predator movies. It focuses on Charles Bishop Weyland and his discovery of a pyramid that has the elements of three ancient cultures and could possibly be the first pyramid ever built. At one time humans worshiped the predators as gods and as a way into adult hood the predators utilized the humans to birth aliens so they can begin a hunt. The aliens however have a faster life cycle which was one major let down but the rest of the film sticks with what made the others great, a long lead up to the any of the action, characters who are somewhat well developed and that you kind of care about. People die but not for just the sake of dying the deaths seem natural and you care when a character goes. The predator as well is given more emotion, showing the ways of the species. He joins forces with our main character a somewhat sub in for the Sigourney Weaver role and they form a somewhat awkward bond. Action ensues and some really kick ass moments happen. With this film Anderson has outdone himself making a great homage to the series and creating an interesting prequel that expands the mythology. It may take place on earth but it's in Antarctica and by the end it seems no one not even our heroine makes it out alive so no one gets to figure out about the aliens. Adding to that I'd like to say of course the alien was given the upper hand if anyone read the books or comics a predator could not face an alien with his bare hands hence the reason the predators had their asses handed to them up until Scar gets the plasma caster. According the book series only one predator took an alien on barehanded and walked out alive and he lost one of the husks due to it. I know my mythology on both series and happily say this films keeps true to its source material and is a far better film than Resurrection was, c'mon what was with the baby at the end that was some really cheestastic crap."

","Sure, Alien vs Predator could have definitely been a better movie. But I still find it to be an enjoyable watch. It has plenty of references to the original films. AVP has great action sequences, though you do have to wait a while for them to start. I personally believe that there should have been more predators. Then there would have been a few more fights, and a few more alien deaths. (And I am more of an Alien fan than a Predator fan.) Still this film is very fun to watch, and moves pretty quickly. It's a great film, if you can accept it for what it is. Af first I didn't really like it because of the comments I read on IMDb, but have grown to like it."

I'm really surprised so many people really didn't like it as I'm a big fan of Alien and Aliens and to a lesser extent the Predator movies. <br/><br/>I think it delivers on the AVP premise. You have some aliens, some predators and some humans and some of them aren't getting to the end in one piece.<br/><br/>What I really like though are the sumptuous visuals. The Predator in the pit standing on the mountain of skulls, the queen being dragged down to the bottom of the ocean, the bullet time face huggers, the alien in the predator net, the alien getting spun by its tail.

"emperor_bender","5","1","2","9 March 2008"," Disappointment at its prime
","I watched the Predator movies after seeing parts of Predator aired on Spike TV. I watched them both 3 or 4 times because I enjoyed them so much. I zipped through the Alien series but I still liked them and got to know the Aliens' history as well as the Predators'. I then set my sights on Alien vs. Predator in hopes of seeing an excellent, action packed, historically accurate Alien AND Predator movie mixed together as one. But I was clearly wrong. <br/><br/>Not to be rude or demeaning but this movie was pretty bad.<br/><br/>The Positive: Don't get me wrong, the action was decent, the CG were great also. And Lance Henrickson even appears as Captain Charles Bishop Weylend (obviously a reference to the Alien movies, where Bishop the droid worked for the Weylend company), he was good in this movie. Also, I liked how the Predator was actually more of a main character than some random killer. The Predator was probably one of the best characters and everything. Also, the story was pretty good.<br/><br/>The Negative: As I said the story was good, there were some huge problems with it. One of them was their history. Why was it that the Aliens' and Predators' histories were randomly intertwined. However, this was never previously mentioned in any of the other movies, and I do think this is something that should be mentioned. Also, the aliens were on Earth...why? The fun of the original movie ""Alien"" was that they were randomly found in space and never heard of. If they were on Earth, are we that dumb that we've never seen them before? Also, if I recall, the Predators only came in hot weather, hence only in the South American jungle or in L.A. during a heat wave, so why are they suddenly in the NORTH POLE? Aside from that, the pacing in this movie was bad. All the characters were killed in one small time period, then there would be long periods of nothing happening.<br/><br/>This movie was disappointing. I wouldn't call it terrible, but still...<br/><br/>I give this a 5/10. Sorry, better luck next time."
"zardoz-13","8","1","2","8 February 2008"," Ultimately, ""Alien Versus Predator"" is well worth the wait.
","Anybody who suffered through the lackluster ""Predator 2"" should remember the final reel when Danny Glover found himself inside the dread-locked Predator's spaceship and saw an Alien's skull displayed on the wall in the trophy room. Of course, that throwaway bit of set dressing meant nothing to the Glover character, but it struck a deep chord with ""Predator"" enthusiasts. Since ""Predator 2"" came out in 1990, horror fans have been rattling their cages in anticipation of the ultimate sci-fi showdown between the Alien and the Predator. Reportedly, the success of New Line Cinema's ""Freddy vs. Jason"" spurred Twentieth Century Fox executives to green-light this crossover creature feature.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, ""Alien Versus Predator"" (*** out of ****) not only surpasses ""Predator 2,"" but also stands up to the original ""Predator"" for sheer audacity and imagination. Meanwhile, ""AVP"" tops ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection."" Altogether, ""AVP"" furnishes the back story for both franchises and offers a bigger playing field in terms of spectacle. Writer & director Paul W.S. Anderson deserves credit for spinning this gripping, white-knuckled, suspense thriller out of a bit of set dressing. He spends the first hour drumming up suspense before the title characters tangle, with a clever twist ending. Without a doubt, ""AVP"" qualifies as everything any hardcore ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" aficionado would want from a such a monster-match-up. The Aliens drool their acid blood, telescope their slimy double-jaws and whirl those bayonet tails with fiendish abandon. Oh, yes, let's not forget those icky pods with those knuckle-boned face-hugger critters that jump out of them. Anderson neither cheats audiences nor short-changes either creature. The biggest complaint that industrial-strength horror fanatics will voice concerns the violence. The producers scaled back the creature brutality, so ""AVP"" could obtain a family-friendly PG-13 rating. For the record, all four ""Alien"" movies and both ""Predator"" movies received R-ratings. Essentially, the savvy producers trimmed those crucial blood & gore shots, making things appear more poetic and less pukey, while telling the same story. Presumably, the DVD will feature an unrated version for ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" followers. Nevertheless, ""AVP"" ranks as one of the best monster mash movies. Indeed, the preposterous plot and the obvious ending are hopelessly predictable. One monster cannot win. Think about it. Hollywood wouldn't make any more movies about the monster that lost, and Twentieth Century Fox would be out of a franchise. Suffice to say, ""AVP"" duplicates the philosophy of all those wonderfully cheesy Nipponese ""Godzilla Versus"" whoever epics and takes it to a higher level.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Alien Versus Predator"" is a prequel. The story unfolds in the fall of 2004 and a satellite in a low orbit owned by Charles Bishop Weyland (gnarly Lance Henriksen of ""Aliens"" fame) has identified a heat source deep in frozen Antarctic wastelands. More importantly, the satellite reveals a sprawling pyramid submerged 2,000 feet below an old whaling station mysteriously deserted one-hundred years earlier by its inhabitants. Weyland dispatches his right-hand man, Maxwell Stafford (Colin Salmon of ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), to gather a team of experts to take him to the pyramid before anyone else. Weyland is so anxious to enter the pyramid that he disregards his own health and the safety of his people. Reluctant ice guide leader Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan of ""Love and Basketball"") joins chemical engineer Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner of ""Trainspotting""), archaeologists Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova of ""Under The Tuscan Sun"") and Thomas Parks (Patrick Troughton's grandson Sam Troughton of ""Sylvia"") and driller Rusten Quinn (Carsten Norgaard of ""Soldier"") who is anxious to bore a shaft through the ice to the pyramid before a storm strikes. Plans change when they discover a thirty-degree tunnel has mysteriously appeared from the surface down to the pyramid. Once our heroes reach the bottom, they feast their eyes not only on the hidden pyramid, but also a part of a feast, caught as they are between extraterrestrial Predators on safari for hideously deadly alien species. Imagine ""The Most Dangerous Game"" with creatures preying on humans, and you've got a fair idea about what ""AVP"" has to offer.<br/><br/>""Resident Evil"" lenser David Johnson frames every shot in ""AVP"" as if he were photographing an art film, while Richard Brigland's production designs contribute to the eerie atmosphere. No stranger to sci-fi sagas, writer & director Anderson helmed ""Event Horizon"" and ""Resident Evil."" He stages several interesting scenes, especially when the shrieking queen Alien thaws out and lays her eggs for the forthcoming battle royale. He takes us inside the Predator spaceship as the warriors arm themselves ""Rambo"" style with wicked spears and throwing discs that deploy knife-like blades in flight for maximum penetration. The first half of ""AVP"" resembles ""Stargate"" for its hiring sequences. Sanaa Lathan's introduction on an ice-crusted mountain is ingenious. The heroes' arrival in the other world recalls similar events in ""Stargate,"" too. Shunning any form of nervous humor, Anderson hypes up the hokum by trapping our heroes--excuse me, monster bait--inside the dark, spooky confines of a pyramid that reconfigures itself every ten minutes like the structure in the ""Cube"" movies or ""Thirteen Ghosts."" You can expect a fair share of false alarms, close-calls, and cliffhanger scenes. Ultimately, ""Alien Versus Predator"" is well worth the wait."
"MaxBorg89","6","1","2","27 January 2008"," Decent middle section in an otherwise messy smack-down
","After loads of comic-books and video-games, it was only a matter of time before Alien vs. Predator made it to the big screen. Of course, the task was always going to be risky, given Predator 2 was largely ignored during its original release and Alien: Resurrection is unanimously despised by all fans of the face-hugging monster. That Sigourney Weaver and, allegedly, Ridley Scott condemned the operation before filming had even begun made things worse, as did the news that the movie would be written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, a competent visualist but a terrible screenwriter (as the Resident Evils testify). In the end, what emerged is neither the complete disaster expected by sceptics nor the great action/horror movie AVP devotees were hoping for: it is a film that, despite having some good set-pieces, leaves the viewer with the impression that the magic of both franchises' early years is largely missing.<br/><br/>To be fair, Anderson does try to come up with a decent excuse for pairing sci-fi's most popular mass-murdering extra-terrestrials. In fact, the idea itself is not that bad: expanding on some loose threads from the original films, the story sees Predators as creatures who have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. Apparently, it is they who taught us how to build pyramids, in exchange for a few humans to sacrifice: every five centuries or so, they would serve as hosts for Alien eggs, which would later spawn grown-up victims for the Predator's rite of passage. One of the locations for these rites is a pyramid in Antarctica, and a mysterious heat wave originating from it has attracted a group of scientists led by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), co-founder of the Company seen in the Alien franchise. Naturally, there is no time to say ""Something's wrong!"" before the major bloodbath begins.<br/><br/>Actually, there is very little blood in the movie: whereas all other entries in both franchises were proud to boast an R-rating that enabled them to do almost anything (Predators skinning their victims, for example), AVP suffers from a PG-13 which was imposed by the studio for commercial reasons and seriously dampens the fun: sure, the two monsters kicking the crap out of each other are fun to watch, but where is the brutality both species crave and deserve? Even worse than the lack of explicit violence is the character development: James Cameron's Aliens is justly famous for how the director carefully crafted each of the human players and made Ellen Ripley more than just another scream queen (hell, how many science-fiction flicks can brag about receiving an Oscar nomination for the female protagonist?); this movie's heroine, played by Sanaa Lathan, is likable but nothing else, and the rest of the cast, mostly comprised of nobodys (apart from Ewen Bremner), is just a bunch of expendable idiots. The biggest disappointment is Henriksen: chosen deliberately to remind viewers of his role(s) in Aliens and Alien 3 (Charles Bishop is the man on whom the androids were based), he has absolutely nothing to do but stare at random and look concerned. Even a gratuitous reference to the knife scene in Cameron's film fails to give the slightest thrill.<br/><br/>On the flip-side, AVP is a good-looking picture - not as gorgeous as Ridley Scott's work, but fluid and slick enough to ensure boredom rarely kicks in. The highlight is a flashback showing how the battle began, but such scenes occur far too seldom to make this an above-average experience.<br/><br/>""Whoever wins, we lose"" said the tag-line. After seeing the movie, it's more like ""Whoever wins, we don't care"".<br/><br/>5,5/10"
"stormlord-2","6","1","2","11 January 2008"," Not Bad At All
","Actually I think that AVP is not a bad attempt at such a film. The characters while unremarkable are fleshed out pretty well in most cases. The trouble of course is that there are to many people in this film. The reason Alien worked so well is because there were only 7 people in the whole film and as such you could spend some time on them. When you have large number of people running around and getting killed it's impossible to feel anything for them.<br/><br/>Anyway on the whole this film was OK, not great but OK. The visuals were good with the Aliens and Predators looking as mean as ever, the pyramid was dark and atmospheric and the introduction of Lance Hendrecson as Weyland certainly gave the film a great deal of credibility. I have just come back from watching AVPR and believe me this film is a masterpiece compared to the latest attempt to continue this shrinking franchise.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"natanji","10","1","2","6 January 2008"," Not as bad as some purists here might make you think
","There's a bunch of really negative comments on this here, but it doesn't quite fit the idea that I got of the movie. To understand this movie you first have to understand that this game is not only based on the Alien and Predator movies, but also on the game series. And if you look at it from the game's perspective, this film is probably the best game adaptation I've ever seen because of the way it shows its characters.<br/><br/>*next part contains spoilers* The movie shows both Aliens and Predators in an interesting new light that adds nicely to the universe everything is based on. The Aliens freeing their Queen by their own force shows an interesting addition to the behavior as a swarm/nest, very much like ants. Using their own acid blood to do so, even if it means killing each other - what counts is that the race survives (remember Alien 4: Resurrection?).<br/><br/>The Predators are shown as hunters, but also as humanoid creatures that have honor and dignity. Although shown in the games, this might be a bit surprising to anyone who only knows them from the movies. Humans and Predators can work together against a common enemy, and our heroine even is accepted as a hunter. A very interesting and unsuspected outcome.<br/><br/>To sum it up: the movie itself is pretty standard. You get a good action movie without much of the ""Alien"" horror atmosphere. You get a pretty nice attempt to connect both the Alien and the Predator universe that could have been better, but is coherent at least. And last but not least, you get a very nice addition to the known characteristics of both species - perhaps that's the most interesting part of the movie. And I can pretty much guarantee: if you like Predators as much as I do and know about their backgrounds, their values, their society, then you might love this movie."
"towt","6","1","2","30 December 2007"," Not the worst movie ever but....
","I would have really liked them to do more with this movie. Sure it sets itself up for a good storyline, but honestly, it needed more. It felt more like Indiana Jones (with all temple and it's traps), combined with a Military movie.<br/><br/>What is even worse, is that they seemed to have taken elements from the Predator and Alien books, and put those plot elements into this movie. Pick up a copy of Aliens vs Predator: Prey and tell me the final battle scene with the queen isn't right out of the ending of that book.<br/><br/>My biggest beef with this movie was that it was rated PG-13. While I don't think an R rating would have made this movie much better, it doesn't fit with the rest of the movies being all R rated. At least give us the blood and gore if you won't give us plot or character development.<br/><br/>A good movie to see once, but don't think this is what the Alien or Predator movies are like."

","I decided to write this after reading other reviews, which were without few exceptions almost all, systematically written in 'the-worst-movie-ever' style. Boring! In summary, while AVP wasn't the greatest movie of all time, it definitely isn't the worst either though most reviewers apparently wanted to give that image rather desperately. Instead of repeating what is wrong with the world etc etc, proposing suicide and crying about own existence I try to be brief.<br/><br/>Since I had seen alien- and predator-movies, read few comics and played AVP-game, theme wasn't such surprise and movie wasn't such disappointment to me. Though dialog was bit shallow, seeing Lance Henriksen once again in this theme was such a joy. Without further spoilers, see it yourself and then go write your very own review.<br/><br/>All in all, as the summary says, this is worth watching, a nice attempt. Though movie isn't actually worth 10 (excellent) the overall score which was near to 5 while writing this isn't reflecting my opinion either so I gave 10 in hope to give even minor boost against those suicide-reviews."
"moviemaster-11","4","1","2","4 September 2007"," Not completely terrible but, not good either..
","I have to give this movie credit for a couple of reasons, the special effects are quite good as are the puppet and suits the special effects team used to animate the aliens and predators. The good special effects is the only reason I didn't give this movie a 1.<br/><br/>To start off the story is very boring. There is action in AVP but, not enough to get that heart pumping and blood flowing. The PG-13 rating states:""Slime and gore"". There's not much gore but, there's a heck of a lot of slime. Aliens and Predators are getting blown to bits left and right. There's so much goo in AVP I wonder if they asked Nickelodeon to provide the slime effects....<br/><br/>The actor list is filled with mostly unknowns except for Lance Henrickson. He may be pushing 50 but, the man known for his role in Aliens still gives a good performance.<br/><br/>Many fans of both franchises were outraged by AVP and I can't say I blame them. This movie is nothing compared to the classic Predator, and Alien movies. One of the worst parts of AVP is the fact that it's just not scary. The scenes that are supposed to make you ""jump"" barely succeed at doing that. If the movie had a R rating they could have pulled off more frightening scenes.<br/><br/>Another quip I had with AVP was that if you had to sum up AVP in a sentence it would be:They walk around in a big pyramid and get killed by aliens. The characters wander around getting trapped behind walls FAR too long. I was getting bored waiting for the aliens to kill these dorks off.<br/><br/>As a movie critic I try not to expect good things from films. I've learned from my years watching movies that if you get your expectations too high for a film often you'll be let down. Unfortunately I expected AVP to be a great flick and I was let down. AVP-Requiem is looking promising but, as I said before, I thought AVP looked promising too.. We'll just have to wait and see."

","to completely omit any suspense, intelligence or excitement from combining two of the adult franchises with the highest longevity value.<br/><br/>First things first, Alien, brilliant. Aliens and Predator, great, Aliens 3, better than it was given credit for. Admittedly Predator 2 was a bit poor, and Alien 4 was... well... tits. While an AvP movie was probably long overdue, the franchises were a little bit weak at the knees and needed a bit of a revitalisation. A film that captured the suspense and aggression of Alien, Aliens and Predator combined could be memorable if even half done correctly.<br/><br/>Step forward Paul WS Anderson. I liked Event Horizon (probably because Fishburne, Neill and Pertwee were eye-catching), but lets face it his other movies are tripe.<br/><br/>There is an awful lot wrong with this film, and to be honest, you could tell exactly what they would be when you saw who was in charge of the project. Contrived dialogue, rushed scenes, bad editing, bad acting, desperately unengaging lambs-to-the-slaughter characters who are capable of collectively superhuman perception and insight (mainly for plot development) and also astonishing stupidity at the same time, a terrible premise, shotgun character development (many scenes have only a handful of quasi-emotive lines batted back and forth with questionable effect) and a total lack of any realism whatsoever. The predators are somehow irritating (you can imagine them being voiced by Chris Tucker if PWSA gets the sequel), they now have the strength to boot people through the air, and can also diagnose heart defects, while the aliens gestate instantly and are fully grown within around 4 minutes. Both creatures have also abandoned the simple virtues that made the first films so great.<br/><br/>Potentially, we could have had a study of two different types of hunter, one with limited scruples, the other with none. Instead it's like a video game, lurching from one 'cool' use of a weapon to another. In fact, you get the feeling that Anderson used the game for reference material, rather than the original films or comics or anything.<br/><br/>If they did the same with Alien and Predator that they did with Batman, i.e. shelve the turkeys and get someone competent in charge, hopefully they could erase the memory of this rubbish"

I'll give them that. What I don't agree with though, is that you can't have a movie where it's just Aliens vs. Predators, there would be no talking, only sound effects and music. You have to have human characters in the movie and they have to be very involved. Who wants to watch a movie with nothing but fight scenes between two creatures that don't talk? Would I have liked to see more fight scenes between the creatures? Yes, but that doesn't take away the fact that AVP was still a very good movie. Much better than the ""Freddy Vs. Jason"" film. AVP had lots of action in it, even if it wasn't always showing an Alien or a Predator. All movies have to have some sort of plot, and you couldn't have a movie based solely on Aliens and Predators fighting throughout. That would have been much worse for the movie. I take this movie for what it is: A highly entertaining film with lots of action and a good eerie atmosphere for the creatures to be lurking in. All I can say is, Love it or Hate it. I recommend it though to anyone who was a fan of either movies, Alien or Predator. Well worth a watch."

I also admit I was glad that Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) isn't in this film. Giving the Predator a personality was pretty good idea as well. Sanaa Lathan was perfect for the new leading woman in this. Sigourney needs to watch out! As the other Alien movies left me wanting more and the Predator films had me wanting the end, I was more than hoping for a sequel to this Blockbuster!

You would expect more than just one Predator & HUman against the world, but that should come out if they ever do a part 2!"
"ExpendableMan","5","1","2","20 April 2007"," A bitter disappointment
","It's been two and a half years since the release of Alien Versus Predator and you can still see the collective fanboy disgust at this film reverberating round the Internet. On the one hand, you've got to thank Paul W. Anderson really for giving fans of the Alien franchise something to talk about besides David Fincher killing Hicks, but on the other it is undeniable that even with the benefit of hindsight, the critics who derided the movie when it was first released were right in their estimations. This is definitely a weak movie and considering the awe-inspiring smackdown it should have been, it's understandable that the geek contingent, myself included, were bitterly disappointed.<br/><br/>The chief problem of course is the lingering sense that it was knocked out for a quick buck or two and nothing more, with the target audience made up of hip youngsters who listen to nu metal and have a TV in their room permanently switched to MTV. You know, those idiots who walk around with their jeans slung low so that we can read the labels on their groovy Calvin Klein boxer shorts? Well, in keeping with the music video aesthetic, things move quickly. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me at all if Anderson's directing approach had consisted of him stood off camera, waving his arms at the cast while shouting ""come on come on, faster faster, more flare, more zing, more kapowzer! The Ritalin's wearing off!"" We've barely met any of the characters before they're being jetted off to the Antarctic to meet a series of unpleasant endings. The action starts roughly half an hour into the movie and fifteen minutes later, nearly all the principle cast have been killed. Where was the gradual build up of tension? Where was the careful handling of atmospheric unease? Where was the mounting sense of dread? Oh, that was what that penguin scene was all about...right.<br/><br/>Adding to this is the fact that you really don't give a damn about any of the people involved, they're merely there to provide explanations and die screaming. As such, none of them really develop any further than the sketch pad and it's amazing they even bothered to take the time to think up names. They could just as easily have been cast as lovable Scottish idiot, spunky tough black girl, dashing Italian know it all, dying old fella, bastard British bloke and expendable extras. An entire generation of movie goers jumped with astonishment when Kane's chest burst open, shed tears when Vasquez blew herself up and punched their fists into the air with reckless enthusiasm when Arnie's final trap worked. All you're likely to do this time around is stare blankly and count the seconds until the next one.<br/><br/>Woeful though the plot, characterisation and cheesy dialogue may be (the ""hunter's moon"" conversation is the stupidest thing ever. Ever ever ever), Alien Versus Predator does have one thing in its favour...<br/><br/>Man, when the two species actually get round to killing each other, it's so cool. Years since imaginations were set reeling by the trophy scene in Predator 2, there is a terrific burst of adrenalin when the two finally collide. The bruising one on one duel at the centre of the film in particular is totally bad ass, with stone masonry and ancient bricks being shattered into dust as the two monsters collide, acid blood spurting, wrist blades glistening and mandibles flailing as they try to wrench each other out of existence. Its popcorn munching mayhem of the highest order and just about the only thing that the movie does well, but still enough to lift it into the realm of passable entertainment.<br/><br/>It cannot disguise the fact that AvP isn't the almighty ruckus that teenagers and twenty-somethings have dreamt of all this time. Truth be told, it's not a bad film and if it hadn't contained the two famous beasts, but replaced them with new creations and gone under a different title, it'd probably be regarded as fun little B-movie. Given that the sequel is imminent, you can only hope it improves in the second round but otherwise, fans of both series would be better off seeking out the original Dark Horse graphic novel that was at least as good as the earlier movies."

","My Take: Good special effects can't save this crappy AVP.<br/><br/>Honestly, I am a big fan of the ""Alien"" films. I remember watching ""Aliens"", the 2nd in the series, and really enjoyed it, so what do I do? Watch it over and over again. Easy for you to say that it was one of my favorite films of all time, but too me, ""Aliens"" was a lot more, as in other films I consider ""the best"". I like ""Alien"", ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" too. I wasn't as much of a fan of the ""Predator"" films though, but I think the 2 films were awesome action adventure/sci-fi hybrids. <br/><br/>So with all the facts mentioned, it's easy to say I'll be enjoying ""AVP"" that much as I did with the originals. But sad to say, I didn't. In fact, what a letdown! Well, as much as I'd expect or as I did with the originals. Why? That's it, it's pretty hard to say how such a film that aims so low still falls short of the mark. Was it the story? Well, the story was about a group of renowned adventurers and explorers summoned by billionaire Charles Bishop-Wieland (the man who designed an android version of himself to hide his identity in two of the ""Alien"" films) to join an expedition in Antarctica to investigate an Aztec pyramid, which sent them a mysterious message. So was it the story? <br/><br/>Was it the acting? Sanaa Lathan was the lead actress who, by any chances, makes an alliance with a Predator to fight the Aliens to hell. She was pretty heroic, but her acting, not much Sigourney Weaver-like heroic. The rest of the supporting cast was a mechanical and awfully boring (both characters and acting), for a lackluster film as this. So was it the acting? <br/><br/>Or how about the over-abundance on special-effects and under-emphasis on a better plot? Well, that may be the biggest explanation, but was it the element that screws this all up? <br/><br/>Perhaps it's a little bit of all the wrong things about this movie that left me totally disappointed. It's a movie about Aliens battling it out against Predators! Who could you screw that up? But don't let my comment stop you from showing this to the kids. They may be the ones who'd enjoy it (anyway, it is PG-13 so why not?). It's pretty hard not to like a package that offers you two of your favorite film creatures facing-off, but it is easy to mention the bad things about this so-called ""film"" (in my opinion, it's on the wrong threshold between movies and video games). Bad acting and bad plotting. I am a fan of the ALIEN series, and I did like the two PREDATOR films, but AVP is still a total letdown, and for those who haven't seen a single ALIEN or PREDATOR film, it's still bad enough for you. In fact it may just get worse than it is.<br/><br/>Rating: * out of 5."

","Now, at the risk of being unpopular, I actually really quite liked this movie. It may have had something to do with the fact all I really wanted that night to watch was a very slightly challenging (and I will admit, the film was not overly challenging, in any sense).<br/><br/>Perhaps I was expecting a balance between the naive optimism of Alien and the Gun-Ho Attitude (ho ho ho) of Aliens. You know, in Alien, when they honestly though the Docbot would 'cure' Kane of his stomach ache. And that bit in Aliens with the remote controlled sentry guns running through whole belts of ammo, like a shooting gallery - who amongst us would be able to deny that was cool?<br/><br/>And perhaps due to being reasonably-to-totally wrecked, this movie delivered in spades all I was hoping. Despite being opposed on every front, I liked the way Humans were portrayed as so woefully inadequate, Aliens so powerful in hand-to-hand and being part of a superintelligent hive mind; and Predators being so all round grouse.<br/><br/>I liked the whole story for the movie, in that if humans hadn't been so nosey, the hundred year Predator hunt would have continued as in times gone by, the adolescent Predators were substandard in their hunting abilities. I liked several little things, like the Predators receiving the ""The Shoulder Cannons have been picked up"", looking at each other, and thinking ""uh-oh"" in Predator. As a problem; to this moment, I still don't understand why the Pred ship fired a laser shortcut to the Pyramid of Trials - unless the humans were not even noticed, and crawled like bugs into enemy territory, without even the realisation they had entered unfriendly terrain. I liked the way the academics were the appogee of their respective careers, in obscure and extinct languages, and their slow and inaccurate translations of the Pred temple. And they still got things wrong. Very reminiscent of Event Horizon's mistranslation from ""Save me from hell"" to ""Save yourself from hell"".<br/><br/>I also liked the way all the humans got butchered by the superior aliens. Supposedly hypertrained SAS marines and what not were devoured by rank and file aliens, and predators.<br/><br/>It really gave emphasis to Te expression, ""There are things Mankind was Not Meant to Know"". Almost Cthulhu-esquire, except people survived."

","Honestly, I don't get why so many people hate such a good movie. I, for one, think it was incredible. Granted, the character development and acting weren't the best, but this is a good movie.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a fan of either series to enjoy this film, and you certainly don't have to listen to overcritical insults to its few weak points. I like it. I can see why certain people wouldn't, but no one has to go around slashing it to pieces, saying ""This is the worst movie ever made,"" when there are thousands of far worse films that the reviewers have obviously overlooked.<br/><br/>That being said, it really depends on who you are if you're going to like the film or not. My opinion: it's excellent, and way underrated by past-series purists."
"LemonVampire","5","1","2","18 January 2007"," A great movie for fans of the Alien and Predator films and AvP comics and games
","As a fan of both the Aliens and Predator films, and especially the Alien vs Predator PC games, I thought AVP was a great movie. It wasn't perfect but it's far from the over-exaggerated garbage that most reviews seem to feel it is. Ideally, the Alien Vs Predator movie should have been set in the Aliens timeline, on some colonial world with the marines in the center of the conflict. When I first heard that AVP would be set in present day Antarctica, I thought that would be the biggest mistake of the film. But I think it worked out great. I especially love how the film establishes the beginning of the powerful and ominous entity later known only as ""The Company."" I've heard a lot of people complain about Lance Henriksen being in this film as though it breaks continuity with the previous films, but I think it works to establish continuity as it was intended to. Henriksen plays Charles Bishop Weyland, the founder of the Weyland corporation and the person that the Bishop android would later be modeled after and whose descendant would try to coerce Ripley into helping the company. The film begins with Weyland's company discovering a pyramid in Antarctica and building a team of scientists to go be the first to discover it. Meanwhile the predators are on their way to begin a hunt. They show up and resurrect a queen alien that's been kept frozen inside the pyramid. The queen starts producing eggs for the unsuspecting explorers walking into the pyramid. The characters are all pretty forgettable canon-fodder that get killed faster than they should. To the credit of the director, some effort is clearly made to develop the characters, but the very nature of the film restricts the amount to which one could do so. This movie is Alien Vs Predator after all, so a lot of it is going to be about them. My biggest complaint with the characters is that the one woman who brings a gun, which is pointed out in a great scene, never gets a chance to use it before being arbitrarily killed. The aliens look great in this movie and I love the idea of the hero alien with the cross-hatch markings on its head. Now the problem with the aliens is that they grow from facehugger to chestburster to full grown xenomorph in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days as in the previous films. This fact is made even more prominent by the fact that the pyramid changes every ten minutes, so it only takes about twenty minutes for the entire xenomorph life cycle. But the length of the alien life cycle is never really specified in any other film so one could assume that it varies depending on conditions. And, even though twenty minutes is a bit ridiculous considering the amount of growth they go through, it's a movie; it doesn't have to be perfectly believable. If this is the only complaint one could have with the aliens, then it's not enough to ruin the movie, unless you're the kind of person who wants to hate this movie. Then there's the predators. I'm not sure what's wrong with them exactly. They just seem to be too big. I don't think they're really much bigger than in the other predator films but they just seem bigger. It especially seems that they are too thin at the waist and too wide at the shoulders. But this is a minor complaint and barely noticeable if you're not obsessing over it. Now we come to the meat of the film: the fights. The big problem with the fights is that they happen to fast with the camera too close and shaking. This is something that's become all too common in a lot of action movies lately. Every new action movie has to be faster and more intense than the last. So to make it more intense, let's put the camera right into the action, so now you can only see an arm or a leg flailing about. But that's not intense enough, so let's shake the camera so it seems like there's more happening. All these things combined together make for a bit of a mess. But, again, I don't want to over-exaggerate this. It's not as though the entirety of the fights do this, just some parts of them. The rest of the fights are great, and there are some really clever things that we've never seen before (I especially love the slow motion facehugger scene). And that's about the extent of complaints one could have with this film. As I said, overall, this is a great movie for fans of the Alien and Predator franchises, unless you're the kind of obsessive fan who wants to hate the film before you even see it and who is going to get hung up on some small issues."
"Punk19","7","1","2","13 January 2007"," Better than Expected
","Before I get to the real review, I need to say that I didn't see this movie because of all the bad reviews it got. The trailer looked nice, but from what everyone was saying, it wasn't worth any of the time to watch it. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, who was also the screen player.The alien characters were created by Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, and the predator characters were created by Jim Thomas and John Thomas.<br/><br/>Okay, so a signal is received by a satellite company, owned by Charles Bishop Weyland(Lance Henriksen), in which they see a heated source that looks like an underground pyramid. Weyland decides to round up a few experts, so that they can go and find out what and where this pyramid is. The first person they contact is Alexa Woods(Sanaa Lathan), who is climbing a ice ledge at the time. Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova) an archaeologist and his assistant Thomas Parks (Sam Troughton)are then contacted. Alexa is then in a helicopter and meets Graeme Miller (Ewen Bremner), a man with two young sons.<br/><br/>Sebastian, Alexa, Thomas, Maxwell Stafford (Colin Salmon), Mark Verheiden (Tommy Flanagan), and Adele Rousseau (Agathe De La Boulaye) all meet on a boat and discuss with Weyland about the situation. Alexa decides to leave, luckily she changes her mind at the last minute when she finds out that an amateur guide is going to replace her. She tells them three important rules then they go off in search of this pyramid.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a Predator ship is coming towards Earth. A group of Predator youngsters are watching a virtual hologram of the pyramid while they prepare for the upcoming battle with the alien species that are living in the pyramid that the humans are going to look for.<br/><br/>The group of scientists, guards and other people walk towards the pyramid and slide into it. One steps on a stone that falls and releases the alien queen, which has been frozen for 2000 years. She thaw's out and starts laying eggs. Meanwhile the humans have reached the sacrificial chamber.<br/><br/>The teenage predators land on Earth and start their trek in getting to the pyramid. They have to hunt and kill the aliens to be seen as adults. So this pilgrimage is actually a mission to adulthood. Before they actually get to the pyramid, they indulge in killing the humans above.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the alien eggs have hatched and have released Facehuggers. Adele and Graeme are killed during this and chestbursters result. Alexa and the rest of the group have discovered the guns that the predators are to use in fighting the aliens and take them, resulting in the predators rampage in trying to get them back.<br/><br/>Almost all of the humans in the group are killed, only Alexa survives. The predators are no worse, two of the three have been killed, leaving one. This one predator and Alexa team up and fight off the queen. At the end of the movie, the surviving predator is killed. An elder gives Alexa a war spear and leaves. When the predators leave earth, they have no idea that their fallen comrad has been infected with a chestburster and soon the creature bursts out of his chest, resulting in an alien/predator hybrid with both mandibles and the long tongue-like appendage.<br/><br/>A sequel is to be released sometime in 2007, presumably October or December. This movie deserves more praise, because it shows that we humans can in fact fight alongside other races besides our own. I give this movie a seven out of ten, it needed more action. Other than that, it was a pretty good movie to watch. I highly recommend this and the other Alien/Predator films."
"warren-1976","9","1","2","14 December 2006"," AVP - Could it ever win?
","Could this film have ever won? The usual complaints have been levelled at it from fans of both franchises. There's too much action. There's not enough action. There's not enough about the humans. We don't care about the humans, let's see the creatures fight. The predators should/shouldn't do this. The Aliens should/shouldn't do that. Alien Vs Predator (Or AVP for short) has a formidable task. It has to satisfy rabid fans of both franchises from around the world, while creating a marketable film that will appeal to a wider audience. Does it succeed? The director, Paul Anderson, has a patchy career, with the dubious distinction of having started his career with several video game-to-movie conversions, such as Mortal Combat, and Resident Evil. Oddly enough, he has been one of the few successful directors in this unusual sub genre. However, video game movies are notoriously difficult to raise above the level of cheap popcorn fun, and rarely gain critical praise. His other films, such as Event Horizon and Soldier, have also met with relative critical apathy. Many fans balked at the idea, when they discovered Anderson was to helm the new AVP movie, fearing a disaster.<br/><br/>Creating a tangible link to the original Alien films, Anderson has roped old pro Lance Henriksen, back into the franchise. By placing the film in our present/near future, he is able to set up Henriksen as the billionaire businessman Charles Bishop Weyland, progenitor of the all-controlling 'company' that would become Weyland Yutani, and eventually create the android 'Bishop' in his image for Aliens and Alien3. As such, AVP becomes a prequel to the Alien films, setting up the 'company' and explaining its possible fascination with discovering this alien species.<br/><br/>To his credit, Anderson has managed to include some original twists to both franchises, re-creating for the first time since Alien, a real sense of discover and mystery. Going against the expected archetype, Weyland is not the usual 'evil' businessman, but someone trying desperately to give their life meaning before they die. Sanaa Lathan provides a suitable replacement for the 'Ripley' type lead character, previously play by Sigourney Weaver in the originals. The supporting characters are all drawn quickly and well, though perhaps a little more expansion would have been welcome.<br/><br/>As for the Predator franchise, we are treated this time to not one, but three of these formidable warriors, their weapons are expanded upon a little, and for the first time we almost come to see one in a heroic light.<br/><br/>Anderson admits to being an enormous fan of the originals, and you can see this in his work. There are several visual cues that subtly reference the older films. As for the setting, Anderson has made a very brave decision, and avoids simply re-treading the same old thing. By placing us in the frozen Antarctic wastes, we are still in an almost alien world, remote and isolated, yet still on earth. In turn, the temple maintains the dark and menacing atmosphere he needs, while not placing us in the usual confines of a metal spaceship or future world. Bucking current trends, he also opts for shorter action scenes, which are brutal and frightening, rather than the balletic kung-fu that seems the current norm.<br/><br/>One complaint levelled at the film, was also its PG-13 rating. Yet there is plenty of gore on display here, in comparison to the earlier films. Would Alien or Aliens really garner a much higher rating if released today? This is by no means a bloodless movie. It just so happens that most of the blood isn't human, and as such the sensors go easy.<br/><br/>All in all, AVP is a good movie. Not without its faults, it still manages to raise itself above the level of most disposable special-effects action flicks of recent years. CGI is also kept to a minimum, and effective old-style effects used where possible. It is a worthy entrant in the ongoing Alien and Predator franchises, and you could do far worse. If you see AVP, you may not see a masterpiece, but if you don't go in expecting miracles, you will see a good movie that leaves you satisfied, and doesn't disappear from memory the moment you finish watching."

","After hearing lots of negative feedback about 'Alien VS. Predator' I had my expectations pretty low.

The pyramid, of course, contains one deadly alien Queen and, to grant the other beast in the title, the predators are on their holiday hunt trip.<br/><br/>After most humans and predators have been wiped out by the aliens we get to see a pairing of predator and guide Alex (Sanaa Lathan), whom together wipe out the rest of the droolies.<br/><br/>If you can forgive pretty weak basic plot, and I see no reason you couldn't as this is an action film, the action is very entertaining. The aliens kill predators and humans and the predators kill aliens and humans and the humans just mainly die, like the humans they are.<br/><br/>I could write a lengthy article about the inconstancy's in the film. Most of them happen during the monster brawls, and mainly deal with the alien blood and the predator weapons, but I won't.<br/><br/>Paul W. S. Anderson has managed to make pretty decent action film.

However, it was with some enthusiasm that I took myself off to the cinema to watch this. I was hoping for more than I got, unfortunately.<br/><br/>None of the characters were worth wasting an iota of empathy on. (Spoiler coming) I really gave up when the Scottish bloke started talking about his family: anyone could tell he was going to die horribly - it was almost a parody of the scene in ""Hot Shots"", which was itself a parody!! God, talk about insulting one's intelligence ...<br/><br/>(Another spoiler) And then we were supposed to believe that the ""Corporation"" from the real ""Alien"" films was the same as the one in this film. For Weyland-Yutani to have lasted that long would be a greater feat than, say, having the Dutch East India Company around today! Rubbish!!! (Another spoiler) However, there is one (sort of) redeeming part of the film. As a person with a scientific background, I could never sort out how the Aliens could have evolved - they are just too perfect: specialised, yet flexible; animal yet intelligent; they don't use tools, yet they got into space. AvP sort of answers this for me - Aliens were bred, or even specifically created, by the Predator race for sport! Specific traits were engineered so that Aliens are the ideal opponent. I am now happy with the apparent perfection of the species, but it takes something away from the overall mystery of the Aliens - just like in Alien 2, where, instead of just catching glimpses of the creature, we were served up lots of closeups, something of the fear is taken away, and I don't really like that.<br/><br/>I've seen the film on DVD since that time at the cinema, wondering if it was the failure to reach my expectations that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. To a certain extent, yes - it was not as bad as I remembered - but to bring an Alien film to the levels of ""The Mummy"" franchise is not something anyone should be proud of..."

A group of scientists find an ancient pyramid and go to explore. There they find themselves trapped in a war between Aliens and Predators and they are the bait. At 100 min long the movie moves quickly and the fights are furious. All aspects of Aliens and Predators are seen here from the chestbursters and facehuggers to the predators lethal arsenal of weapons. Sanaa Lathan plays the lead and whilst she ain't sigourny Weaver she makes a mighty fine fist of it. Its a pity everyone else is poor even the usually cool Ewan Bremmner. Lance Hennrikson is also on show but his appearance only causes you to make unfavourable comparisons to Aliens in which he played the Android.

AVP is clearly not for everyone. Given the huge fan base of Alien, Predator and similar sci-fi films, a whole lot of people went and saw AVP back in 2004 who, for very legitimate reasons, hated it. Almost 2 years later, however, when viewed without all the hype surrounding it and by people who are approaching the film with an open mind and a strong interest (in other words, people, like myself, who would view a film that was completely slammed by critics and audiences 2 whole years later), AVP is a surprisingly impressive pop culture and cinematic work.<br/><br/>Take home message?

","OK, I'll concede that he can perhaps direct an action - not horror - film, and maybe put more money on-screen than he has in his wallet, but there is no way he could ever be mistaken for a writer! (It should be noted that others share the shame in the writing credits.) This plot would be cheesy even in a video-game... and its not the story from the AVP comic that green-lit this movie! Just putting familiar props in the background does not capture the essence of the source material.

There is occasional plot weirdness, as when Stafford and his buds suddenly pull out their automatic weapons as soon as the hunter's armament appears in the crypt -- and why were they kept there, anyway instead of being carried in.

","The English Oxford Dictionary states that ""The Point"" is ""The most significant or relevant factor or element"".<br/><br/>I agree, for Alien Vs. Predator seems to be lacking any relevant factors or elements that are remotely connected to the original Alien and Predator.<br/><br/>This bombardment of butchery can produce such a negative awareness, that the participating viewer would be in complete ignorance of the fact that the original Alien and Predator franchises should only be judge in their own unique right. Here we have a horror movie amalgamation of what would seem to be a poor creation of a Frankenstein's Monster.<br/><br/>We have no kind of narrative to relay any past information to the viewer; all we are given is a poor description of two fighting Cultures who both have the necessity for using the human race for reproducing the Alien life force. Then when these newly born creatures are born, by growing inside the willing victim, ripping open the stomachs, to fight against their archenemy, the Predator.<br/><br/>This concept here exploits past creations of others hard work, trying its best to make something of itself by pretending to be something it certainly is not. Both the Alien and Predator creatures here are neither terrifying nor are they believably realistic. As this movie is being sold on the pretence of the Battle of the Giant's, then it has missed all significant and relevant points of reason. This reason being if you are going to amalgamate two-horror franchises, then you had best make them what their reputation's represents, such as suspense, originality, a good story and a better script.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality that Alien Vs. Predator has is its artwork, having an original cinema quad poster framed and hanging in my home, this is a shame that the actual movie can't live up to its imagery. <br/><br/>Is it any wonder that Alien Vs. Predator was nominated for the 2005 Razzie Award for Worst Remake and Squeal?<br/><br/>Point taken?"

","Ever since I was in grade school there were two ""vs."" movies my friends and I waited for, Freddy vs. Jason and Alien vs. Predator. I enjoyed both, but AVP left me a little short on joy.<br/><br/>AVP is the sort of film that causes you to suspend disbelief. I can accept this, but it gets to extremes. First, I don't believe for one second the best ice climber in the world is a girl from the south side of Chicago. Second, there aren't any spiders in the arctic, despite the proliferation of webs in the film. Third, I remember this from Earth Science, it doesn't generally snow that much in the arctic circle. Fourth, after spending more time telling us about how the cold would kill an poorly clothed individual in a matter of minutes, our unlikely heroine survives for quite some time in the final battle scene of the movie without warm clothing. There are other points, but these stuck out the most for me.<br/><br/>I would have to say that the lack of AVP action on the screen was a disappointment. I understand what was being done, but in reality, that's why I paid my $9. I want 90 minutes of nothing but on screen mayhem from my two favorite space monsters. Acid and screaming, clawing and biting, the two sticking random pieces of body armor into one another. The whole 9 yards. Instead I got about 8 minutes total of the two on screen together.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the spectacle of the time they had on screen together, and I really enjoyed the deepening of the Predator myth. I also enjoyed the physical presence of both the Alien and Predator on the screen. As I have said though, I wish I had gotten more of both."

","...they will get it right. Better than many angry fan-boys (myself included) would have you believe, it still isn't as good as it should have been.<br/><br/>Satalites pick a heat signature underneath the ice layer in the Antarctic. A research team arrives and accidentally unleashes the alien creatures contained within. Simutamniously, a pack of young predator hunters arrive to begin their initiation hunt into adulthood. 3 species, only one survivor.<br/><br/>The first, huge mistake the film makes is it's white-washed PG-13 rating. All four 'Alien' and both 'Preditor' films were pretty hard R-rated; so why ostracize the fans of the films in such a way? Answer: so that kids can't in too, even though it's a horror/action film that kids shouldn't be watching anyways.<br/><br/>Next up is the pacing of the film. Every one going to see this knows the deal with the aliens, knows the deal with the predators and knows that they are going to be fighting each other. So why spend the first 57 minutes of a 100 minute movie trying to wrap all the plot details in a mystery? Answer: actually, I don't have anything for that, there was just no reason for it. If you make a film called 'X vs. Y' you better not take 2/3 of the film for X and Y to start scrapping on each other.<br/><br/>Which finally brings up what the film does right; once the pointless exposition (which fails to ever explain that the predators are supposed to be teenagers) is over and the action kicks in the film shifts into high gear and zips along at a break neck pace. The first battle between the two malevolent ETs is a great bit of action violence; my only complaint with it is that it makes the dull first hour of the film look all the more dull by comparison. It does finally give you what you want, it just makes you wait a long time for it.<br/><br/>For the first hour of the film, it give it a 4, the last 40 minutes get an 8; ergo- <br/><br/>6/10"

","As a science fiction fan, I have seen all the Alien and Predator movies, and was interested in both series. For years there were rumors of an AVP movie, and the comic book made the encounter look awesome.<br/><br/>Then they made the movie.<br/><br/>To say I was disappointed is not entirely accurate. I was also irritated, annoyed, and generally unhappy with this movie. It was trumped up to be the ultimate encounter, and it ultimately sucked. We begin with the always clueless humans of pre-Alien, post Predator 2 Earth who discover a ""thermal event"" in Antartica. The usual mixed team of soon-to-be victims assembles, lead by Charley Bishop Weyland, billionaire adventurer. (One assumes Weyland Utani is named for him, since we know the Bishop androids in the Alien movies are based on him).<br/><br/>The humans arrive, and they begin sniffing around. They wake up one morning to discover that someone has laser drilled a hole directly through the miles thick ice to the core, which happens to be an ancient pyramid. Since no one finds it strange that a hole suddenly has appeared, they of course all go inside and proceed the start the Alien antics.<br/><br/>Predictable, poor effects, and a paper thin plot kill this movie. It could've been SO much better. By the end, you don't care if anyone survives, you just hope YOU survive the two hours of boredom that are AVP.<br/><br/>Ugh."
"BlueDragon21120","6","1","2","24 August 2005"," A predator sequel ( I suggest you read, despite spoilers) If your an Alien or Predator fan)
","If your a huge Alien fan, then turn back and move away from your copy of this movie. This is by no means a prequel to the Alien Saga and it basically ruins any respect you would otherwise have for the intelligence of the Aliens set up in the Alien series. No fan of Alien could possibly accept that they are only bread for hunting. We know that an Alien would cleverly kamikaze it's self on a spaceship if it meant its own prey, and for that matter way of survival, had no way of escaping with out it (see Aliens). Preditors however, are set up in this story to be the creators of every civilisation on earth, and we are more or less told that they already own the world as they were treated like Gods when they first arrived. This is all very far fetched especially the part where we are told they only return once every hundred years to breed and then kill Aliens, but this is total horse s*it because the first two Predator films are set in the 70s and both depict human slater. If this film were the introduction of Aliens and a sequel to the popular Preditors it would have definitely had a bigger impact, it doesn't give any further information on the Aliens and totally blows away anything you thought you knew about the Preditors. I enjoyed this film for its special effects, mostly real not CGI (phew), a 3rd chance to see the alien queen was nice even if the story was so lacking and it was cool that they tried to give it a spin at the end showing an alien bursting out of the Predator with a Predator mouth. This could mean one of two things, this is either a sequel opener for AVP, or it is a really bad explanation of how the Alien escape and later settle down waiting for Ripley and co. If this is really how the Aliens escape the clutches of the Preditors, how come they don't have predator faces in the other ALien films, as you would assume they would if the only one left living had that DNA.<br/><br/>(Sigh) Over all this film is utter rubbish from a plot view and it by no means meets predator standards, let alone Alien which in my opinion is worlds better than Predator in the first place. This film would need a pretty amazing sequel if it doesn't want to risk being forgotten for ever by the majority of AVP fans."

","One can only hope not. I held off on watching this one until I found it at the library, and for once was not overly distraught that it was a full-screen copy. Widescreen would have been a negligible improvement. Paul W. S. Anderson is not one of my favorite directors, though there were bits and pieces of films like ""Soldier"" and ""Event Horizon"" and even ""Resident Evil"" that I enjoyed. He has a good visual flair, if nothing else. However, he's not much of a screenwriter. ""AVP"" plods, to put it kindly. The characters are pretty much made of cardboard, and the plot, such as it is, is uninteresting and derivative. Anderson plays fast and loose with the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" mythoi and fails to bring anything new to either one. The action was a rehash of previous ""Alien"" set pieces. Much whining has been heard over the PG-13 rating, but for the level of violence, I was surprised that it didn't get an R (and here I thought even one use of the F-word would guarantee that--guess I was wrong). I imagine AVP played better in theaters with speakers booming, but on the small screen it was remarkably unexciting and uninvolving; I put it on pause numerous times to go smoke a cigarette. Our doughty female lead played her part above and beyond the call to duty, but no Ripley was she. The rest of the cast was essentially faceless but tolerable (the little spiky-haired blonde was a cutie, I will confess; I'd like to see her in something with genuine substance). Lance Henrickson was obviously collecting a paycheck. Even the ""surprise"" ending was cliché (and highly illogical). Overall, it played like a fanboy comic book aimed at the pre-teen set. I gave it a 5 only for high production values and excellent FX."

I was looking forward to some Alien vs. Predator vs. SpaceMarine action and I must say that I feel that I've been let down.<br/><br/>The story or should I say bad excuse for the movie, really is bad. The relationships (trying not spoil here - watch it you'll know) in the movie are so lousy ideas for a story that I almost cried.<br/><br/>After seeing all Alien movies and the Predator movies one have some to expect certain things and elements from such movies - the chill of some of the alien movies, the action, the seriousness of the aliens/predators. None of these elements are fully lived up to in this movie! The effects and the acting in this movie isn't that bad but still far from great... watch something else."

","I saw it and had no real high hopes for it and it still did nothing for me in terms of action or anything else. hey i like so-called mindless films too but this goes beyond that. the story is my biggest problem because if you have seen the 1st 2 of both films you have a idea of what to expect (but its i guess this is from the comic book of the same name or something like) but if you know the story of the other films you will be disappointed. predator 2 started the whole thing about these two creatures in perhaps in a battle of some sorts in the past so why not jump on that idea instead of this? and this story does not even make sense and also the time frame and the whole bishop thing i'm not even going to get into and besides i thought that the predator likes very hot or warm climates."

","** YEAH, HERE WILL BE SPOILERS ** <br/><br/>Recap: A satellite suddenly detects a heat signature under the ice in Antarctica. Soon it is discovered to be a pyramid, that contains features from pyramids all over the world (South America, Cambodia and Egypt). The head of the corporation, Mr Weyland, assembles a team to on an expedition to the pyramid. Among them are archaeologists such as de Rousa and survival expert Woods. However, as they reach the pyramid and expect to start drilling down to the pyramid they discover that a tunnel mysteriously has appeared during the last 24 hours. AS they venture down the tunnel and then into the pyramid, they discover that the pyramid was used as a sacrificial temple, and that they are not alone. A hive of Aliens has been awakened in the pyramid and three Predators has arrived to hunt them. The humans are in the line of fire, and as they get separated in the (changing) maze that the pyramid is, they get slain by Aliens and Predators alike...<br/><br/>Comments: It is evident that much work has been put into the set and surroundings. They are detailed and nice, with some goofy exceptions. It is unfortunate though that the same level of work hasn't been put into the story for example. A lot of time was spent to introduce first the different (main) characters, then the pyramid itself. We got to see and hear about the mythology and history of the pyramid (and the AVP mythology). However, on the part that I suspect most see this movie, the fights between Aliens and Predators, we see very little. The action part of the movie is over very quickly. Most of the Aliens are not slain in combat, but by a bomb. Quick and efficient, but not exciting to watch. The hero and heroine only escape this explosion because that the scientific team has assembled a sledge (pulled by wires on the ground) that actually can outrun an explosion. Impressive (and annoying). Then there are the mandatory end fight, between our heroes and the Alien Queen. It is short and not very thrilling, I had kind of lost interest by then (mostly because of how they handled the other Aliens). This takes place on the surface of the ice. I presume that it is cold on Antarctica, yet the heroine don't seem bothered by having to remove some of her clothes... In short, the poor story overshadows everything else. The character depth and development is mostly non-existent, but that is no problem in a movie like this, and doesn't disturb me. As said above... much of the details in set and history are very good but you can't make a movie out of that. Some of the fight scenes that are there are good though, and leaves an unsatisfied desire to see more. In total, a disappointment. I expected more...<br/><br/>5/10"

","I'm a teenager, and on the flip side of fan-boy I despised this pathetic kindling sack of wasted opportunities and shattered dreams. My father took me to see this movie in August 2004, and I enjoyed it. Please note that it was my first foray into the Alien world. I had watched Predator already, and after AVP, I asked my father to rent Alien and Aliens. Words cannot express how much I loved those movies. <br/><br/>Next, I decided to rent Alien3. That film made me weep (in a positive way mind you). The Alien franchise was growing on me. Eventually, I got around to Resurrection, which, despite it's MANY flaws, was semi enjoyable. By this time AVP was coming to DVD. I wanted it badly, to see if my viewing experience could denote if it was worthy of it's predecessors.<br/><br/>It was not.<br/><br/>Aki, first up; the script. It resembled some cheesy 80's action flick, courtesy Roger Corman. Dialogue was off-kilter, lines were flubbed, and that one guy wouldn't shut up about his kids. I have news for you pal, your kids are not winning you anything by referencing them all the time.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting. Most of it was fine, but the secondaries such as Thomas (someone's assistant, I can't even remember his name), Quinn, and that one girl with the freaky hair gave such wooden performances I'd not have been surprised if the wind knocked them over and they were revealed as cardboard cut-outs.<br/><br/>And the effects. I'm noticing a disturbing trend nowadays. Films are using too much CGI. When used in moderation, CGI is a wonderful tool- it can convey a greater sense of realism when used properly. Jurassic Park did it right. AVP did not. I silently tapped two fingers on my sleeve, but didn't applaud at all, Anderson's decision to use suits more. That however doesn't subtract from the fact that there was still too much CG.<br/><br/>In closing, there are many things wrong with this film. If you can spot them and still enjoy watching this movie then you have an okay attitude. If you can spot the errors and heckle them, you have an even better attitude. And if you can invite Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, and Kevin Murphy over to watch this then you have the best attitude of all."
"RoaringFourties","4","1","2","9 May 2005"," Too many unnecessary issues
","First of all, this movie satisfied my expectations as to the conflict predator/alien. Great special effects, the monsters are just as you would want them, really neat hand to hand combat between the two, but ...<br/><br/>A number of things bothered me greatly.<br/><br/>The first was in the 'sacrificial hall' where one of the sci guys immediately jumps to the conclusion of 'heart sacrificed' and is told that that is not where the heart is and bones turned outward blah blah. Full stop. You'd expect some kind of discussion at that point but sorry, they just leave it at that. I guess THEY didn't see the original alien movies ...<br/><br/>Then the archaeological type reads all the symbols like they're a book in plain English.He warns to not take the predator shoulder rocket launcher type thingy; But not the first, no, not the second either. He doesn't utter his warning until the last one is taken. Oh, well.<br/><br/>This is an odd bit, about the predator shoulder rocket launcher type thingy. It seems that is their primary weapon. Without it, a single alien whacks two out of the three predators in short order. Leaving those thingies down there for us mortals to completely screw up the whole plan of taking them once the predator apprentices get there is just plain stupid.<br/><br/>Then nothing was more obvious than the last predator getting 'seeded'. Now, this last predator sees the gestating larvae in the human victims but in the end they take his seeded carcass without inspection? They have to, like, not look at him to miss the damn thing wiggling around his bronchial tube! And what happened to aliens not attacking seeded hosts?<br/><br/>I am not going to mention that one of these predators would never ever ally himself (herself? Their are certainly bitchy enough!) with a human 'breeding tube' for their favorite prey. OK, so I did mention it.<br/><br/>After all we saw about alien(s), do we really think going down in water is going to kill one of them? Especially the queen bitch? Schit, a whale will dive 5000 feet to hunt pussy (the octagonal kind) ...<br/><br/>regards, Mac"

","The knives were out for AvP before a single frame of film was shot. The news that Paul W. Anderson was going to follow in the footsteps of Scott, Cameron, Fincher and Jeunet was met with disbelief in some of the more rabid corners of fanboydom. They needn't have worried though, their beloved xenomorphs have such a minor presence in AvP that it barely registers as an official part of the Alien cycle at all. Things actually start rather promisingly, with the intriguing premise that the Predators may actually be responsible for the first sparks of human development and civilization. This was touched upon in the first Predator movie (and lifted, of course, from 2001) but is expanded on here. In a piece of casting that suggests some intriguing plot twists (Which, needless to say, never materialise) Lance Henriksen plays Bishop Weyland, a billionaire industrialist whose spy satellites discover an ancient temple under the Antarctic icecaps. In opening sequences blatantly reminiscent of Jurassic Park he assembles a group of 'experts' to join him on an expedition. This long-ish introduction sets up the predictable, but enjoyable, scenario. Unfortunately they're a rather colourless gang with only Henriksen and Ewan Bremnar's Geoff-Goldblum-Alike having any spark about them. Once they reach the site of the temple both logic and interest begin to wilt somewhat. Why has nobody previously mentioned the whaling station which by amazing coincidence was built slap bang on the top of the site? Of course, the whole thing is a cunning Predator trap to breed new Xenomorphs for an intergalactic game of Battle Royale. It's giving nothing away to say that Anderson kills off his best characters far too early and leaves us with a very poor Ripley clone. The films real problem however is that it is actually a premise in search of a plot. This is real video game material but the film's wafer-thin storyline simply can't stretch even to a meager 90 minute running time. The title, too, is more accurate than you might imagine - those expecting huge swathes of aliens and legions of predators in some kind of Helm's Deep style kick-ass showdown are going to be sorely disappointed. Rarely do we get more than one of each species on screen at a time, which is probably why the movie isn't titled Aliens vs Predators, but feels like a con nonetheless. Anderson appears to believe that his trump card is the big Alien Queen/Predator/Ripley Clone showdown but he then completely flubs it with the most unspectacular of anti-climaxes and an alien queen who seems to have borrowed her motion capture from Jurassic Park's T-rex. Ultimately AvP provides such a poor use of both franchise's that one can almost forgive the slow decline into mediocrity that has previously blighted the Alien cycle."
"rosscinema","4","1","2","25 April 2005"," Film ultimately lets down it's fans
","There is a question I would like to ask to the people that were fans of both franchises and it entails what exactly they were expecting from something like this. I personally had no idea and one would think that's a good idea but alas, it doesn't help matters because the makers of this never really thought out a good story. Story is set in the present where we see tycoon Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) who's satellite has picked up something that turns out to be a pyramid under the ice in the Antarctic. Weyland assembles a group of scientists, drillers, and archeologist's headed by Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) who leads the expedition.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** While searching the pyramid the group finds a strange cache of equally strange weapons but they trigger something and they end up trapped which also awakens a mother Alien who starts laying eggs. Meanwhile, three Predators show up on top and they get a signal that something or someone is disturbing their weapons and they venture down under the ice and find Weyland's group trapped. Once they start killing everyone the Aliens start showing up as well and ruin their plans as they must now combat each other and things change drastically when Alexa teams up with a Predator to kill all the Aliens before they reach the surface.<br/><br/>This is directed by the ambitious but consistently disappointing Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon, Soldier, Resident Evil) and while it's clear he's a fan of sci-fi his vision (if I can call it that) runs somewhere around the comic book or video game mentality. If I have to give him credit for something it would be the way he sprinkles in references from other films like the Antarctic setting that comes from ""The Thing"" or ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" which is being played on television. Anderson doesn't really waste the viewers time with character development and I had to laugh when one character pulled out his wallet and started showing pictures of his kids. You know he was going to get it! The action scenes offer nothing special and the script is basically your run of the mill Alien fare with the assortment of characters being picked off one by one and of course the film ends with a scene that suggests another sequel. Even I was intrigued (to some degree) by the basic premise but the story never lives up to it's potential and one has to wonder how different this would have been with a better director."

","When a heat signature from an ancient pyramid is seen from a satellite, billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) assembles the best technical team that money can buy to investigate why a structure of its' type is located 2,000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. But the reason becomes all too apparent when three Predators stop by to frag some Alien hides as a rite of passage.<br/><br/>Paul (Event Horizon / Resident Evil) Anderson once again tackles the sci-fi genre, this time with mixed results. After over ten years of development you'd think Fox would have came up with something better. They try to bridge gaps between the series and tighten timelines but what they throw out is a mixed mess. Some of the action sequences are decent enough but since they went with a teen friendly PG-13 ""AvP"" suffers from off-screen kills and closely cropped battles that leave fans unsatisfied. The script has the usual weak character development as they are mostly cannon fodder. The most developed character must be the survivor. Right? Sadly they use a lot of CGI when it would have been a lot better and cheaper to use a practical effect. About the only saving grace of the film is an excellent sound design which is showed off well on the DVD's dts track. Very disappointing."

","Gaudy, lifeless predators take on similar aliens in this dull dud. Paul W.S. Anderson, not to be confused with P.T. Anderson, mortally wounds another franchise. Between him and Uwe Boll, video game movies are getting an even worse name. This could have been a exciting movie. Instead of trying to get old cast members and reference the other movies, the people involved should have spent some time on little things like plot and a good director. Anderson is only interested in making things bigger: longer claws, group of 20 humans, 3 predators, and hundreds of aliens. James Cameron did something similar with Aliens, but Cameron increased the spectacle without decreasing the humanity. Sanaa Lathan, Raoul Bova, Tommy Flanagan, Agathe De La Boulaye, and Lance Henriksen are all good, but Lathan is the only one given a chance to do much. The fact that I can write predator and alien and be confident that my reader will know what I speak of, tells a lot about these franchise's popularity. This is a poor substitute for the other films that hopefully will not destroy any chance for further entries in either series."
"Moonhawk1975","7","1","2","8 April 2005"," ...or how Hollywood took two franchises and flushed them down the toilet
","Over ten years of hearing rumors about this film being made and waiting and waiting and then more waiting as nothing comes to fruition. Two more (disappointing) ""Alien"" pictures will come and go and still no confrontation. Finally, it is hereand THIS is what we get? I was at least vaguely entertained, but this should have been much, much better. This movie succeeds (barely) on being short and having a lot of (uninspired) action scenes. I wasn't bored, just extremely let down.<br/><br/>First off, I had problems with the premise. A team of scientists discover a ""heat bloom"" from Antarctica and venture out to discover a pyramid buried under the ice. Now, I know next to nothing about science, but wouldn't a burst of heat large enough to be detected from outer space be warm enough to melt the ice? Anyway, once there they discover the pyramid is a weird series of mazes and moving chambers that seemed to house a pre-Aztec sacrifice ritual. We soon discover the humans are merely there to gestate the eggs of the Alien species. And the said aliens are merely the prey for a race of the alien Predator species, who like to hunt the acid-blooded beings.<br/><br/>Now comes my second problem (believe me, there are many more between one and two; this is just the order I am describing them in): what exactly do the predators do? We know from the first two ""Predator"" movies that they like to travel to Earth to hunt us weak humans every hundred years or so. But, in the meantime did they fly by and check on the pyramid? I can just see them in the 1500's taking a cruise through outer space and thinking ""Nope, the silly human race has not advanced enough to travel all the way to the coldest region of their planet, dig miles beneath the surface of the ice, find our pyramid, bring to life those nastier, slimier aliens and let us hunt. Let's try again in 1600. Who's paying for gas this time?"" And the aliens sure have a wonderful shelf life! They have been dormant since before the Aztecs! And come to life at the first sign of human lifethousands of years later!! <br/><br/>The human element is the weakest of many weak factors. There is absolutely no point for any of them to be there, other than gestating the eggs and providing dialogue. Of course, after hearing them talk, I could have done without the latter. Poor Lance Henriksen is completely wasted here. He is cast as a modern-day ancestor to the guy who would go on to finance the expedition to the planet of the aliens in the 1986 sequel (at least I think that was who he was; I think I lost a lot of brain cells watching this). Here, he's just a character with a familiar name and a wonderful actor trying to make the best out of what has been ""written"" for him. None of the other actors make any sort of impact whatsoever; they are merely present to die.<br/><br/>And what were the so-called filmmakers thinking in dumbing down the aliens? In the four Alien movies, they were very scary creatures; kind of like outer-space versions of sharks. They were deadly and existed only to kill and would go to any means to do so. Here, they seem like a pack of barely vicious dogs. And they are much smaller than before; now they are the outer-space version of a pit bull.<br/><br/>Blame must lie with director Paul W.S. Anderson. He has made some stylish and decent (plus the excellent ""Resident Evil"") movies in the past. Here he just comes across as a talent-less hack; a director who was handed a dream project that knew would make millions and did not bother to make an intriguing story. For that matter, he barely bothered to make a movie. Rarely have I watched a movie and felt like I was looking at a video game. This is the equivalent of watching one that someone else is playing."

","I wanted to see an epic clash of two Horror icons, but what I got was a 3 hour National Geographic documentary.<br/><br/>Alien Vs Predator (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>The most awaited movie of the life time which features the famous characters created by Dan O'Bannon, Ronald Shusett and Jim Thomas, John Thomas. Alien and Predator both characters were well established and have a huge fans following, but a film that features both of them in one frame failed to satisfies the True Fans. Lack of Action, Thrills, Suspense, SFX make this lame chapter a CRAP. Director plus writer Paul W.S. Anderson didn't know how treat this EPIC EVENT into a memorable one. Using unknown actors and sucking back drops makes this movie reduced into a cheap documentary one.<br/><br/>Predator in the movie sucked a lot because of the way the movie crafted the Alien. Producers tried to blend the ideas from Video Games, Comics and previous movies making the viewers a brainless Rat. It's also because of that sucking Paul Anderson, what ever he does SUCKS at the next second. He wrote Blade 3 it sucked, he wrote this movie it sucked, and he is writing the new Batman its going to be SUCKED. At least he should have seen Freddy Vs Jason!

","Basically this film could have been so much more!! Two of the greatest Alien Menaces put in a battle arena and i'm sure everyone was expected some battles of mammoth proportions,with a few puny humans caught up in the middle of it all. I enjoyed the film but felt it had been sold short on the battle scenes,and it always has to come down to a human defeating the aliens or the predators, why must it be this way , why cant the predator kick everyones ass then take its trophy's home with it . Why don't they just cut out the weaker of the hunter killers and just have a film Sigourney vs Arny. In summary Alien Vs Predator had it moments , just not enough of them ."

","For a complete experience I would recommend finishing the AvP game. All of my friends warned me this is a terrible movie and I've rented the DVD expecting the worst. Well, it was a pleasant surprise. I am a BIG Alien and Predator fan and what really put this movie alongside its more illustrious predecessors it's the fact that it stayed within the Predator universe. I mean the hunters have a code of honor (if you've played the game you'll understand better) and they stick to it. The movie, in my opinion, simply is a fresh point of view on the Alien/Predator filmography. The film have a few drawbacks, though. First of all it's too short for the amount of action involved, the incubation of the drones seems to be done on time-warp, the symbols on the walls are instantly read by the expert and so on. But... you have only an hour and a half for a lot of action so here is little room for witty screenplay."

","This film was a major let-down. Anderson is not a bad director, and Event Horizon and Resident Evil were passable horror films. Unfortunately, I think AvP had too many writers and producers involved, and any original vision got watered down into a PG13 movie that looks like it was made by a committee.<br/><br/>Although technically slick, AvP is a pastiche of clichés with the most contrived plot I've had the misfortune to witness for some time. Just because I'm willing to suspend disbelief in Aliens and Predators doesn't mean you can expect me to swallow the 'deus ex machina' plot of this movie. At least Alien 4 managed to come up with some unique twists. AvP on the other hand is entirely predictable.<br/><br/>The most disappointing aspect is squandering the strength of one great franchise (Alien) and one good franchise (Predator) on this mediocre movie."

","I felt Paul Anderson was the perfect choice to direct this film. You'll find lots of controversy of this, because most people either loved or hated his previous films like Event Horizon, Resident Evil, and Mortal Kombat. <br/><br/>Story wise, I felt this film was very clever. I think some people were disappointed that it didn't revolve around the comics and novels based on the same theme, but I felt it was an OK move. <br/><br/>One of the things I was most impressed with was the mixture of real tangible special effects and CGI. It was a grand blend and executed in such a fashion that you couldn't distinguish the two from one another. It's something we don't see enough of in science fiction and horror films these days and I can't praise Anderson enough for making this wise decision. <br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad either, I thought everyone did a fine job. Especially the great Lance Henrikson. And newcomer composer Harald Kloser provides a score that totally deserves to go alongside Goldsmith's, Horner's, Goldenthal's, Frizzell's and Silvestri's work. I suppose the film isn't entirely flawless. A friend of mine pointed out that the alien chestburster cycle went way too fast. I have heard that there is a deleted scene that explained the reason for this, but I'm not sure how it would have fit in with the film itself. This could be just a rumor though. However, I think any flaws that there are are petty and don't detract from the over all film itself. Some people griped about the lack of blood and that it was the first Alien and Predator film to get a PG-13 rating rather than an R rating. Let's be honest, this is a movie about two alien races fighting against one another. Lots of slime, goo, and green alien blood. Besides, I believe it was a smart move to go for a PG-13 rating to ensure wider audience appeal and gross. <br/><br/>I think the film definitely has a vibe that's reminiscent of 'Aliens' and the first 'Predator'. This is a great Science Fiction film, and the best Summer Action Blockbuster of 2004. It stands alone, but serves as a worthy addition to both the 'Alien' series and 'Predator' series. As an avid fan of both franchises, I couldn't have asked for more!"
"DJExcen","6","1","2","8 February 2005"," This movie is Sci-Fi, not Action.
","If you go to this film expecting to see an action flick, I will tell you right now you will be definitely disappointed. Paul W. S. Anderson is a master of the Science Fiction genre and taking two action legends and mashing them together would surely generate a good movie right? Almost.<br/><br/>As I said before, this movie is Sci-Fi, not action. Anderson's previous movies were all very interesting, and this was no different. I have heard the predators described as being fake-looking, and almost plasticky, however the make-up and animatronics people did a good job in replicating the look of the aliens and the predators from the original movies. I was a big fan of the two franchises, to be honest, and looked forward to watching this film.<br/><br/>I was fairly disappointed with the lack of pacing and suspense in the film. Anderson's other screenplays, Resident Evil I and II, have had similar pacing problems, but he is getting better. That being said, the film was poorly paced and the suspense factor was just not there, relative to Ridley Scott's original masterpiece.<br/><br/>Overall, the film not bad, from a visual effects perspective. With a bigger budget and better pacing by way of script, it could have been much better than it actually was. I would recommend seeing it after the rental price goes down, and not earlier.<br/><br/>I give it 3 out of 5 shoulder-mounted PPC cannons"
"jrfranklin01","4","1","2","7 February 2005"," What Happened?!
","I was initially disappointed in knowing this film was going to be rated PG-13, in an effort to soak up all teenagers the producers could muster. All of the Alien and Predator films were rated ""R"" for a very good reason. And anyone who felt and understood the horror, suspense, disgust, etc. from the work of those films would have shook their head (just as I did) at the mere mention of a PG-13 rating. To combine some of the fictitious universe's most feared creatures and have them go head-to-head under a PG-13 rating is almost comical.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I watched AVP and was pretty impressed for about half the film. The big fight scene with an alien and a predator was definitely the best of the whole film. The director managed to execute all the gore and mayhem he could without really getting too explicit. Quite a bit of the violence is actually suggested. I guess after having seen the Alien Quadrilogy, you really don't need to see a bunch of facehuggers jump on people to know what's about to happen. But even with these ""saving graces"" to do the film credit, the second half (normally the more important of the two) peters out big time. Instead of getting a massive battle of a bunch of predators fighting a swarm of aliens, (SPOILER) we see one predator and a woman fleeing from an explosion that takes out all the aliens. And just to show how Hollywood sometimes never changes, we get a repeat of ""Aliens"" with the queen alien surviving the explosion. A final battle ensues with the predator and woman taking on the queeny.<br/><br/>Maybe there just wasn't the budget to execute one of the best ""versus"" battles out there, because this film could have easily added another thirty minutes to an hour of footage. I think too much time was wasted in showing the human expedition team trying to uncover/discover the temple. And the whole bit of using the aliens as part of predator warrior training was a bit hokey, but not near as hokey as the ending. Can anyone say ""Predalien""? 4/10"

","Your enjoyment of this film will depend on whatever expectations you have going into it. As a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises, I had hopes for this one. They weren't high hopes, but I wanted something that I could at least say, ""well, that was pretty cool"". I also expected a decent kill factor. Not much of any of the above happened.<br/><br/>Lance Henricksen, in a non ""Bishop"" role plays a scientist who leads a team to Antarctica to discover what is supposed to be the first pyramid. Naturally, there is reluctance in the main expert (Sanaa Lathan). The team needs to get 300 feet underground to reach this pyramid and avoid any other explorers on the same mission. Little do they know that the other ""explorers"" are about 8 feet tall and comes from outer space and carrying many sharp weapons and ugly fangs. Apparently the Predators want this pyramid as well. This pyramid is being guarded by some other bad asses. Those would be the Aliens led by big bad mama. For reasons that are explained not very well, the two species don't like each other very much.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are few and far between. There needed to be more of them and they needed to be better. The audiences of these two franchises are very familiar with these guys and something new needed to be offered instead of the typical popping out of nowhere and showing it's big fangs. These bad guys weren't very interesting.<br/><br/>What I did like was the pyramid that they were all stuck in. For someone as claustrophobic as me, I found the pyramid was very very creepy. The scientists all got trapped and stuck in various parts of this thing and guess who was waiting for them.<br/><br/>This movie isn't horrible, but it isn't any good either. It falls in the middle between garbage and an OK rental. If you like either of these franchises, it's worth a look just to satisfy your curiosity (**)"

"extracrispy","6","1","2","4 February 2005"," Too many holes....
","Questions: Killing an Alien is harder than killing a human, so why not use humans to train the predator youth and save the Aliens for the adults.....either way, I can get my head around that. They have a ""special"" hunt in the Antarctic every 100 years where they hunt Aliens.....which is in no way linked to humanity's future encounter with the Aliens 400 years from now. But that still leaves questions: <br/><br/>1.Why build pyramids? Are they trying to say that humans learned how to build pyramids from the Predators, and then migrated to different parts of the world and tried to reproduce these pyramids on their own (leading to 3 divergent ""types"" of pyramids: Egyptian/Aztec/ Cambobian)... <br/><br/>2. Where did the humans learn to build pyramids? It wasn't in the icy Antarctic. So the flashback of pyramids with Predators is happening in South America (with humans worshiping Predators). But, this would mean that the Aztec Pyramids would have been built by the Predators and would have the symbols of all three cultures (like the pyramid in the Antarctic). That isn't the case. <br/><br/>3. Why did the humans worship the Predators if they hunted the humans? <br/><br/>4. Is it possible that the first humans actually did learn to build pyramids in the Antarctic thousands of years ago before the polar ice caps had been formed? I think I'm onto something....<br/><br/>OK, so here's the story:<br/><br/>Predators come to earth thousands of years ago when it is still warm and tropical (before ice age).....they find a world that is perfect for the creation of a ""hunting lodge"" in which to hunt Aliens and train their youth for future combat in outer space. They see humans as the perfect subservient creatures to feed their Aliens. They build a pyramid in the Antarctic (back then a tropical paradise)....the humans are used as hosts to grow the Aliens....the humans don't complain, they are stupid. The humans learn how to build pyramids, and worship the Predators.....The humans migrate into different parts of the earth and form different cultures that retain basic knowledge of Pyramid-building but with their cultural differences integrated. (Even the Sphynx in Egypt looks like a version of the Predator)..... The Predators come back to earth every 100 years, which is like a week in predator time.....in preparation for their hunting trip, they activate the Alien-baby machine to produce offspring.....this heat is traced by the Weyland Corporation which sends explorers to check it out (saving the Predators the trouble of having to find humans to use as hosts - Which begs the question - how would the Predators have fed the Alien babies if the Bishop corporation hadn't gone exploring?)<br/><br/>Beyland corporation goes on to build the first human-like robots that later help Sigourney Weaver fight the Aliens (unrelated to this story).<br/><br/>Predators also come back to earth every 30 years (not sure, need to check Predator #1) to hunt regular humans in Vietnam and Los Angeles (warm climates).....This is also completely unrelated to the hunt in the Antarctic!...<br/><br/>So it's basically a completely different story that has absolutely nothing to do with the original Predator or Alien movies and simply uses their good name to start a new, unrelated (except by name) story.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed it, but it deserved the attention to detail that a true fan and aficionado would bring to the table."

","Finally, the two sci-fi franchises meet, as was prophesied in Predator 2., when the head of an Alien was seen in the Predator's trophy room. This was in 1990. For fanboys, it's been a long 14 years.<br/><br/>Having seen one other crossover movie (Freddy versus Jason!), I wasn't too stoked for this one. When you take two movies that have their own histories and mush them together into the same movie, there are going to be some inconsistencies.<br/><br/>I'm not a fanboy of either series, so I can't speak to the movie's accuracy in that sense. All I know is that Alien = bad (i.e., attacks humans) and Predator = bad (i.e., attacks humans).<br/><br/>The basic story here is that a group of scientists discovers an ancient pyramid in Antarctica, and when they explore it they find themselves in a battle between the Aliens and the Predators. Place your bets, kids! The over/under on bloodshed is forty gallons; the Predators are favored by 19 vats of slime.<br/><br/>As with all disparate casts, the expedition is composed of scientists from varying backgrounds: a mechanical engineer, a couple of archaeologists, a mountain climber/guide, and do forth. Oh, and men with guns. Their mission is to get to the pyramid and see what's what. Leading them is Lex Woods (Sanaa Lathan); she's a tough, strong leader. You know right away she'll make it through this ordeal alive, because much of the pre-expedition focus is on her. You know, to endear her to the audience. Other characters are given short shrift by comparison.<br/><br/>Neat little trivium: Lance Henriksen, who was in a couple of the Alien movies, here plays industrial billionaire Charles Weyland, whose company found the pyramid and is financing the expedition. Lance looks pretty haggard. I mean, he always did, but now he looks like Clint Eastwood before Clint got his Botox injections. But I digress.<br/><br/>Anyway, long story short - they get there, find Aliens have attacked the previous expedition (from 1904!), and then all hell breaks loose as everyone has to fight to survive.<br/><br/>There are plenty of good things to say about this movie. For one thing, the set design and special effects are fantastic, making the viewer forget the pedestrian plot and the shallow characters. Come to think of it, though, the characters really aren't all that shallow, compared with other recent sci-fis. Take Supernova or Event Horizon. No, seriously, take them. Same idea - heterogeneous crew, Something Evil afoot - and yet the effects weren't good enough to distract us from the crappy dialogue. In AvP, there aren't many memorable lines (if any), but it didn't matter.<br/><br/>And here's why. By now, we all know what the Predator looks like (seen near the end of P2). And we've always known what the Alien's looked like. So there was no sense in keeping either hidden from view. This is Alien versus Predator, so let's see 'em fight! And fight they did, with our feckless humans stuck in the middle. This time, since we've seen some of what either species can do, some human characteristics are attributed to them, particularly the Predators, (yes, Predators plural), such as War paint, honor, and rituals.<br/><br/>AvP is a very diverting, action-packed movie - there aren't any slow moments, and it follows through on its own premise."
"Derek237","5","1","2","2 February 2005"," You get what you paid for..
","With a title like ""Alien Vs Predator,"" you're obviously going to expect some alien and predator battles, hopefully with some human interaction as well. AVP doesn't disappoint in that area. I thought the fight scenes were very good and the only saving grace of the movie. Other than that, well, there's nothing else. This is a bad movie.<br/><br/>It starts out okay enough, the pacing is true to the original alien films. It's slow and builds up tension...only to use its first shock on a penguin. But oh well. It only gets worse from there, though. We're introduced to a bunch of characters we obviously don't give a care about and are more than likely to die in terrible ways. That begs the question, why exactly are we being told that they have loving families waiting for them at home? Are we supposed to feel sympathetic when they die? I mean, come on, it's all or nothing. You should either not care at all about a character and chomp on popcorn as they're brutally killed, or truly feel bad when they die. AVP put me in an uncomfortable position. I didn't feel bad but I felt as if I was expected to.<br/><br/>The plot's ridiculous. I think anyone who's seen it and either loves it or hates it can agree with that. I don't think I've ever heard that it's a brilliant, original plot from anyone. But, honestly, I didn't really pay to see the movie for a plot. That would be nice and all, but I really just paid to see aliens and predators beat the ever-loving @#$%&! out of each other. I wasn't let down. That's the only merit the movie has anyway.<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10"

","The acting was just horrible, in part perhaps because the characters were one dimensional stereotypes. No big deal, this was not that kind of a movie.<br/><br/>The plot had potential But the thing that ruined the potential for me was the lack of attention to detail. A good hard, science fiction work is allowed to stretch the facts for the sake of a plot. But c'mon folks, the remnants of the party re-emerge on the surface and it must be balmy. The heroine's hair isn't even blowing. She looks like she's dressed for a day's jaunt on a mild winter day in Ohio. This is Antarctica, and when they went down in the hole perhaps a day ago at most there was a raging storm. The ice had not melted and they needed an icebreaking ship to get to the island, remember? And the chopper ride to reach the ship was all dressed up as a death defying expedition into the maelstrom of all time.<br/><br/>Then we have a winch which pulls a trolley of sorts up and down the 30 degree grade in the tunnel. We are supposed to believe that this beats an explosion out of the hole, racing just ahead of it. The cables on the winch are shown reeling frantically, as if any such device could in the wildest of imaginations outrace the explosion. At the very least they could have dressed the device up, encasing it in high tech finery in a concession to achieving suspension of disbelief. But you have to see this thing to believe it -- it looks like a medieval well bucket mechanism.<br/><br/>Then the trolley flies out of the shaft, a few seconds ahead of the explosion (apparently the cables on the winch actually beat it). An enormous eruption of flame is followed by shots of our heroes running through town, apparently unphased by what must have been a rather bone jarring impact of the trolley on ""terra"" frozena after being shot out of the tube.<br/><br/>Oh well. If you go to have twitch fun, it's not all that bad. But it could have been a whole lot better. I suspect that 99% of the effort went into the pyramid, and there was simply nothing left for the rest of the movie."

","In school, seven is a C, and therefore,... painfully average.<br/><br/>I love both alien and Predator, and unfairly biased Predator. That is main reason this movie is average for me, because the predators died far to easy. One didn't even get to fight an alien, he just got to get sneak attacked. And then, the same fuggin alien kills his buddy likes it's nothing. I think the director had an opposite unfair bias. Nonetheless, the movie was definitely lacking in plot, character interest (I felt no remorse when the first twenty people died, because they were unimportant) and most of all, length. If ill sit through 4 hours of Lord of the Rings, just because i love the series, then 2 or three hours with AVP would have been fine. Go ahead, make the story better, make the characters connect, make the aliens die like ants under the Predator boot, Ill sit alone in the theater. Also, the director's original idea was better, five Predators. Or better yet, a war like it was advertised. Letsee, OK, here's a better plot off the top of my head, then some manhood ritual. Somehow (remember, off the top of my head) the aliens are on Earth. Lets go ahead and make Earth a holy place for the Predators, give them a religion, for further development. So the Predators decide that Earth must be protected, and, Lo and Behold, a war. There. Maybe not better plot, but would make a certainly more suspenseful movie. Just, you know what, more action would have been great. I didn't really go for a plot anyway. I'm done.

","When you think of Vs. movies you think right away, ""how cheesy"". Freddy Vs. Jason is one that comes to mind, and yes Cheesy is the word. This is not the case in Alien Vs. Predator. I've seen many bad reviews of this film saying the story was stupid, but i have to disagree. The way the 2 characters came together made sense to me. Though the actors in the movie were a bunch of no names, their rolls in the movie didn't really matter, expect for the woman. Though i'll agree the way the movie ended was just alittle cheesy, but again it made sense to me, SHE WON! I think for what it was, Alien Vs. Predator turned out pretty damn good. It could have been a lot worse. Not the best movie ever made, but i enjoyed it. The ending left it open for a squeal...but i think its better left where it was."

There also was not enough fight in it for my dollar, and the fights could have been a Lil bit better. The end was also the worst end of the year, and maybe in the top 5 of bad endings. SPOILER: The Alien popping out of the Predator's chest and being a half alien/predator was just asinine. I mostly blame the lame director they got, and this also being the ONLY movie in both franchises rated PG 13.

","Alien Vs Predator (or AVP as fanboys would call it) is the joining of two pretty good franchises, but instead of making it something of quality, this movie is like a road accident.<br/><br/>AVP has some sort of ""plot"" involving scientist discovering an ancient pyramid thingy in Antarctica, but have found a place where predators (the big alien dudes who like to hunt Arnie) used to breed aliens (the Ripley variety) to hunt on Earth. Of course - the scientists fall prey to some aliens and predators alike. One by one - they all get hunted down (except for a pretty stupid heroine - of course!).<br/><br/>If you didn't think this movie could get any steeewpidier - one of the surviving predators teams up with the surviving human and try and put a stop to the naughty aliens (at this is the point I would normally walk out of the cinema).<br/><br/>I think this movie was supposed always supposed to be crud. Not only did the highly-talented (cough! - note the sarcasm) Paul W Anderson direct it, but he also had writing credits too. I definitely had low expectations for this one - but it was probably worse than I could ever imagine.<br/><br/>There was no fear or dread in this movie. All the deaths were predictable - and you would have to have rocks in your brains to not work out who survives.<br/><br/>I only hope that there aren't any more Alien and Predator sequels made! There is definitely a diminishing returns effect happening with both franchises. I can only hope Sigourney Weaver pushes anyone with ideas of making more sequels out of a space-ship with a fork lifter machine.<br/><br/>Woeful stuff!"
"harace","8","1","2","22 January 2005"," Below expectations, but still good
","*Contains spoilers*<br/><br/>Reading some of the reviews, I could conclude that most of you(respect to the exceptions) are disenchanted about this movie. I can agree with some of the points, like a Predator teaming up with a Human, but that did not annoy me up as much as the fact I mention below:<br/><br/>This is where this becomes a spoiler: I do not understand and I do not even want to know why this movie degraded Predators so much. I can't believe that one Alien killed two Predators and the third(and the last one) gets 'facehuggered' a good ten minutes after the fight begins.<br/><br/>Talking about face-huggers, I also find it strange that Aliens evolve way too quickly. It must be a result of the Director's decision on how to make the movie more whirling. Aliens birth quickly, OK, but what about the 'fecundated' Predator? How come it survived for so long? Also a note on Alien life-cycle: How is that possible that the Xenomorph births from a Dead body? I obviously mean the Italian guy(don't know the name) and the Predator.<br/><br/>I loved how the Predators looked like at any rate. The one last thing I did not like about Predators in this movie is their vision modes. Why did not they leave the old-style Predator mask sound? That was the best. One other thing: I find the into part VERY long, it is even longer than the action part itself with the Credits.<br/><br/>To sum up a whole, I had really loved this movie despite all what I wrote."

","I'm so glad someone noticed that this movie has terrible rip-off themes from other movies that it detracts from the actual story or what semblance of a story there is... the reference to CUBE was right on. Pyramids should never need to shift and reshape themselves to keep people and predators out... utter BS... and the worst thing about this movie was that supposedly humans were such an ultimate ""prey"" in the previous predator movies and now in AVP when they look at them... the predators immediately disregard the humans as nothing more than a nuisance and not even worth much to kill. These predators do not consider theme humans a threat in the least. this is such utter disregard for the previous movies that i almost couldn't stand it."

A lot of people say this movie is crap and granted it isn't exactly what i hoped for either, but like I said, it has a few good parts. I enjoyed the major (and only)beat 'em up scene between the alien and predator. this scene could have been done better as that big predator guy was way too cool to be killed by just one alien. disappointing end to that scene! I also agree with pgray2's comment about the buddy scene. Most of those who say the movie isn't as good as the written material. I agree with this. most movies (if not all) that have been based on novels or comics are rarely good. Steven King's 'Christine' is a good example of a good book gone bad on screen. Visually AVP is impressive. The predators look more intimidating than in earlier movies and the aliens look....well...as weird as ever and both of them kick ass. I will probably purchase it when it becomes available."

"NoOneCanHearYouScream","Null","1","2","24 November 2004"," Glad I bothered
","Understand and accept all the comments and criticisms of AVP. But when I finally saw it last night (alone, the only person in the entire theatre!) I actually rather enjoyed it. For all the ludicrous hokum of the script and set-up/back story at least there were some ideas on screen, unlike, say the very limited scope of Alien Resurrection. I also found the way the story, such as it is, resolves more satisfying than Resurrection. I agree that the fight sequences are somewhat inconsequential. For all that, some nice dramatic ideas, especially the pyramid reconfiguring - certainly more inventive than the confusing chase/decoy climax of Alien 3. The face hugger scenes are suitably horrible and the Predator space ships satisfy. Given the script, thought the cast did well. Was not convinced about Sana'a Latham until she played the more intense scenes (the brief moments where she starts to lose her nerve, or has no lines at all to work with in the climax). Good job. Also enjoyed the all too brief appearance of Agathe De La Boulaye. Bit of a franchise tradition here for me, prematurely killing off characters (John Hurt, Charles Dance) who I think are working well in the movie. I'd say the real victim of the movie are xenomorphs - inside the pyramid, they are not nearly nightmarish enough. Having said that (and not wishing too give away too much) the scenes near the end with whale bones work stand comparison with other memorable moments in the franchise. It's much more a Predator movie (and I didn't like either of the originals).On its own terms, as a B-movie, without AVP is enjoyable. Come on Ridley - let's have Alien World."
"Adorable","7","1","2","15 November 2004"," Choppy but Still Evergreen
","Correcting numerous misconceptions about its creation, the AVP license brings to bear two of cinematic history's most potent science fiction symbols. The beloved Alien and his more civilized counterpart the Predator have been satisfying lovers of quality big screen entertainment for three decades now, and, with AVP under their belt, enter a new century of (hopefully) continued excellence.<br/><br/>However, contrary to many a belief, AVP has little to do with the popular video and computer games bearing the same moniker. Although the core ideas are identical, AVP the movie hails from a split second cameo by an Alien skull back in Predator 2, which later gave rise to a bevy of comic book reiterations. No matter what the reason, any recurrence of these two must be true cause for ululation, for it has been way too long since we last beheld either one (1997's torrid Alien Resurrection). <br/><br/>Sadly, though, more than love and admiration went into releasing AVP. Fox decided to convey this momentous occasion using a PG-13 vehicle, major mistake and deviation from both Alien and Predator series, each known worldwide for its subscription to gratifying violence, suspense, gore and mature language. Conversely, the 2004 addition has almost no blood, spares audiences most frightful moments, and uses its solitary F word with frugality so obvious it would shame the world's proudest of misers. But even if you can live with all these faults, remember Director Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil) probably intended and crafted this to be a full-on R rated monster mash. Since the studio decided, in their infinite mercantile wisdom, to hack and chop AVP at will, the resulting mess feels decidedly disjointed and helter-skelterish, often providing odd pacing and strange time sequences. All told, AVP's way too short, with characters buying the farm prematurely, micro-sized action segments and a sense of rush-job carelessness often associated with low-budget TV productions. And you simply know there's an agenda behind all this. Fox, playing The Company a bit too seriously, are doubtlessly working on a Director's Cut Special Edition Multi-Disc Box Set as we speak, wetting their collective lips with glee. Thank heaven for gullible fans.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, AVP's still a solid flick, mostly due to the sheer power evident in its two key personalities. Even encumbered with bad politics, Alien and Predator still come through paws and fangs a blazing, causing audiences to cheer zealously as their fateful encounter unfolds. Speaking of which, the story's set in present day earth, so don't go expecting Colonial Marines and M40 pulse rifles. Instead, the movie offers a possible explanation as to where the Aliens came from to begin with, pitting them against a team of clueless human researchers and adventurers who think they're heading to Antarctica in search of long-lost relics. Upon arriving at the frosty hinterland, the warm-blooded expedition soon realizes there's more than mummies and fossils going bump in the catacombs, as we see the good old Alien posse getting their groove on and teeth into people's faces left and right. Led by Charles Bishop Weyland (yes, The Company's alleged founder, done by Lance Henriksen), the excursion further stumbles upon hideous tragedy when a crew of Predator braves arrives to test their mettle and camouflage gear. Things soon escalate, with Alien and Predator mixing it up amid several triumphant moments designed to make long-time addicts go ""yeah!"" in their stadium seats. <br/><br/>To its massive credit, AVP uses very little CGI, opting to deliver excellently old-school effects and animatronics. Most creatures appear to be either mechanical models or guys in rubber outfits, and such skill in light of today's synthetic movie scene surely warms the heart. As far as the project's budget goes, as well, modesty seems to have been the operative concept, reaching a reasonable $65 million, mere pittance next to other Hollywood blockbusters. AVP exudes professional production and smooth execution, a trademark for its director, yet given a too-short runtime and brutal editing priorities, it plainly needs more space to show its true colors. Therefore, and while aware of Fox's cunning greed, this reviewer will indeed wait patiently for the unrated, expanded revision to reach store shelves or cineplexes. Such a product will grant the movie's extraterrestrial stars (from face hugger to queen) a better chance to share with us all they have to offer. As for the humans, in their present condition all stand as too brief and superficial to really care about, but you can tell several characters in their camp will benefit hugely from increased exposure.<br/><br/>The film also includes at least one novel plot twist, novel within the context of both franchises, and you'll be surprised at the new light thus shed on one of its main constituents and his social prowess. Nice touch, and well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Much the same can be said of AVP as a whole. We waited ages for this one to come out, and in retrospect, it's been highly justified a tenure. Sure, Ripley's absence did not go unnoticed, as didn't all of the picture's other problems, but just like she said in Alien 3, the critters have been a part of our lives for so long, we can't even imagine ourselves without them.<br/><br/>Rating * * *"
"pal-o-lo","5","1","2","16 November 2004"," Okay, but not impressive.
","Well, there isn't much to say about this one. It is an okay action movie. The special effects, and costumes were fabulous, but the rest didn't measure up to it. <br/><br/>Lance Henriksen gave probably the worst acting performance in his career. He always seems to have a very strong presence on the screen. This was not the fact here. He seemed to almost disappear in all the ruckus. As if he were bored to hell by the whole movie. I was actually relieved when his character died. <br/><br/>The woman that had the lead role, sorry I don't remember her name, performed much better. Although by no means worthy of even looking at an Oscar, her acting alone saved this movie from being a total let down. Even though she gets totally squashed by the looming shadow of Sigourney's Ripley character, she does deliver the goods in a convincing manner. Instead of trying to act like Ripley, which would have been a catastrophe since no one can fill her shoes, she chose to do it her own way. And it worked! <br/><br/>But the camera work were too bad. I got totally confused, trying to find out where the heck they were! There seemed to be no point what so ever, what way they walked. they just stumbled, ran and fell around, with no plan! Luckily the sole remaining young predator seemed to know where he and the environmentalist went. But it didn't help on me almost getting a vertigo feeling. And we very seldom got to really see the hieroglyphs, as they always were too far away or in an impossible angle to see. Mostly they just looked like decoration, ugly decoration.<br/><br/>Still, all in all I enjoyed the movie, with all it's weaknesses. Let's face it, one doesn't go to this kind of movie, expecting to get a excellent written plot. The plot here were minimal, but did work to some degree. Although, I never understood why that Alien Queen never had escaped before then. And I am wondering why that queen didn't die from all the bullets and energy blasts she got struck with in the end. If i don't recall wrong, Ripley killed queens left and right with a gun. Not to mention that there was no way in hell this queen could survive the blast from the predators bomb! It was designed for that purpose, for crying out loud!!! As the queen was pulled down into the deep, the possibility of a sequel were jumping almost painfully at me. THE ALIEN QUEEN RETURNS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA TO SEEK HER REVENGE!!!! BWAHAHAHA!!!! <br/><br/>And finally, the one thing in the movie I really couldn't swallow, the ending. It just HAD to come! AN ALIEN/PREDATOR HYBRID!!!!<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie, but I hope to God they never make a sequel.<br/><br/>Thats all, folks."
"Tompson","7","1","2","16 November 2004"," Something like this is hard to rate
","Being a die-hard fan of both Alien and Predator movies, the prospect of combining both in the same movie is very alluring. While the sheer charisma of the Predator creatures (created originally by Jim and John Thompson) carries a long way, there are multiple reasons why this film does not reach the final distance. The biggest flaw in my opinion is the running time of 90 minutes. There is simply no way you can completely deliver the story successfully in that time without compromising the available potential of it. <br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson, the director, takes (voluntary or forced) disturbing shortcuts too many times. Particularly, the pacing in the sequence where the Italian archaeologist explains with his lightning speed interpretation of the ancient wall-markings the history of predator-alien-ancient civilizations on earth is just lousy. That is just one example of not-so-great pacing of the film. I liked Anderson's Resident Evil because of its straight-forward style that does not spell everything out for you -- action that trusts audience's wits at least to some extent. AVP needs to spell out everything so that nobody misses a thing. Admittedly, the Italian guy is the one explaining everything (and BTW, there are such people in real life as well), still it manages to destroy the joy of figuring things out yourself.<br/><br/>I have heard reports of studio pressure to modify the end product quite a lot (less visible violence & gore to get a PG-13 rating, at least). I am hoping that the real thing will be released on DVD sometime in the future as I also witnessed very good action sequences and suspense in the movie. Many reviews complain the lack of character development in AVP, but that is a minor concern in my opinion - humans play the third fiddle in this one anyway.<br/><br/>A low seven is the verdict. Hope to see the dir.cut some day for higher ratings."

","I'm a huge Alien fan (with the obvious tag-lines ""seen all the films, many times"") and I was nothing short of euphoric when I heard that the Alien saga would be extended with AvP. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I feared that it would only be a low quality spin-off with a lot of action with no brains behind it. Fortunately, Mr. Anderson gave a work of art to the fans on both sides and provided an interesting story behind the action we see in the film. So, now we see the cons. I have two main criticisms for this movie. Firstly, a technical mistake in the incubation period of an Alien. When the first Alien comes out of 'Adele' the other members of the group who were attacked by face-huggers at the same time as she was still have it stuck on their faces. Now, as I know it the fecundation period of an Alien has four main phases 1) the face hugger infects its victim 2) the face hugger dies when the fecundation is complete 3) the victim awakens 4) the young Alien comes out a few hours after the victim awakens. In the film, the time lapse between phase 3 and 4 is practically inexistent (app. 43 seconds). Secondly, as a fan, I felt that the film was too short. If the director expected this film to be an epic he should have tried to produce more than 101 minutes of runtime. But, as I said the second point comes from a fan's greed for more. Mr. Anderson wisely preferred quality instead of quantity, but both would have been great in my opinion. To conclude, I would give this film a 9 or a 10 rating because I got what I wanted after all these years of waiting.

On the other hand the effects are good, the plot hangs together and the action moves at a cracking pace.<br/><br/>You pays your money and you takes your choice - if you are happy to sit back and enjoy the ride of the big screen action I think you'll enjoy this movie.

The final battle at the end was especially good.<br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes were a bit too blurry, resulting in you wondering what was going on.

There were no shock factors and obviously most of the gore had been cut out but I don't think I'd like to meet an alien or a predator on a dark night.

"glennrparker","Null","1","2","29 October 2004"," It does what it says on the tin
","If you read most of the reviews for this film, you'd think that the Alien and Predator films were Shakespeare and beyond criticism. But each one is basically about an unstoppable killing machine disposing of a group of anonymous people. OK, Alien and Aliens contain more characterisation than most, but the plots are basically the same. Bearing this in mind, AvP, to use the annoying moniker given to this film, does a good job of fulfilling the requirements of both franchises. Furthermore, I think it actually works for the film that it is populated by a cast of unknowns. For once, the viewer can't be sure who will emerge as the survivor once the killing is done, or indeed if anyone will survive. It also means the film can get down to the real reason it exists - to show Aliens fighting Predators, which it does in spades. The film does a good job at filling in backstory for both franchises, although it leans more towards Predator than Alien. Plot holes are finally patched up as the story arc across all of these movies is completed.<br/><br/>** SPOILER **<br/><br/>AvP sets up a sequel premise which could nicely dovetail the end of Alien: Resurrection into a further outing for HR Giger's creation. I should add that I'm not referring to the blatant set-up at the end of AvP. These last 20 seconds of the movie would have ruined it if the film hadn't contained such strong material up to that point. It felt as if the director hadn't paid enough attention to his own script, with a needless and illogical sequel set-up barely ten minutes after a much more logical one had already been established. I plead that the producers ignore it in the inevitable follow-up.<br/><br/>** SPOILER ENDS **<br/><br/>I thought AvP was a fun and action-packed addition to the Alien and Predator franchises, with a strong cast and impressive visual effects. Certainly not the thoughtless mess which many reviewers would have you believe."

OK, so the characters, with the exception of Weyland, are a bit thin, but that was inevitable. This film is about the Alien and the Predator. The Aliens are as evil and deadly as ever, and the Predators are finally shown to the honourable warrior race they really are. Don't expect Shakespeare, but expect a darn good action film.

Great stuff - the lot of it.<br/><br/>I thought the story fitted in perfectly, I'm not a comic book freak, so I don't know exactly what angle they took in the books regarding AVP but I thought they fitted this in perfectly (after Predator before Alien). Pyramids etc - fine, humans used to worship them - fine, they are the ultimate hunters - fine, they destroyed pretty much everything when beaten so as not to ruin the earth - fine, they need humans to perpetuate the game - fine - it's all good!!!<br/><br/>I've heard a lot of people moan about the cast, but when you put the whole thing together you can maybe understand Sigourney Weaver being a bit tentative about being involved in another Alien film... but after this I would think she'll be up for the concluding part which can only be a prequel to Alien.<br/><br/>If you like Alien or Predator you must watch this!

"Lucky_C","6","1","2","21 October 2004"," So-so (beware, spoilers)
","I went into this film with magazine reviews racing round in my mind. Not that good, they said. For obsessive fans of the originals and teenagers only, they said. Personally, I ignore such reviews. They are often done by serious minded critics, and films like these are not for serious minded people. They are for people who want light entertainment. I stand by my theory, though AvP did test my faith. It's not a bad film, but not particularly good either. I was disappointed by it. The previous Alien films (yes, even resurrection) were, in my opinion, good films. Aliens is one of my favourites of all time. They are very well written, and all follow a simple formula. They have a small group of people who are thrown in an unescapable situation, and get picked off one by one. The same applies to predator. And this means the characters have to be strong. However, AvP deviates from this formula. The characters are irrelevant, given second place to the carnage. Often one-dimensional, we don't even know most of their names. A short film already, ten-fifteen minutes back story would have been useful. A previous history between Lex and Weyland would have been wonderful. Whilst we're on the subject, Weyland was a completely wasted character. The founder of one of the most powerful companies on earth, the prototype for the Bishop droid, and not a word on his history. Inexcuseable. And killing almost all of them off in a very short space of time is a waste. Far better to kill 3 or 4 off at one point and then to kill them one at a time. However, it's not all bad. The fight scenes are fantastic and seeing the alien and the predators fight still thrills me. But like the rest of the film, the fight scenes are far too short. The aliens fail to convey the same menace as they have done in previous films (despite the fact that this is the first alien film i've seen on the cinema screen). The characters are a lot prettier than in prior films though, Anderson has done a nice job of remodelling them. It's a pity that during kills, we have to flick back and forth, in order to get a small rating. Overall, not a bad film. The fight scenes make up for the lack of characters and the pyramid is a nice touch. But (and please take note of this for the sequel fox), we desperately need some better developed characters. We want to care when they die! We want to feel what they're going through! That's why we go to films. Giving a character a couple of kids isn't enough.<br/><br/>Lazy. 6/10"

","Sometimes it's really good to see a flashy, violent, fun movie where you just don't need to think.<br/><br/>AVP starts economically, with a quick zip round the world recruiting dashing scientists (shades of MI2 and the LXG), sticks them on the Piper Maru (X-Files?) icebreaker, and send them off to a newly discovered pyramid under the Antarctic ice (with CGI 3D floorplan only slightly altered from Resident Evil 1).<br/><br/>Don't forget to break off for regular adolescent fanboy 'guns & ammo' shots - guns into holsters, cartridges clicked into chambers, blades extending, straps strapped, zips zipped etc. After all, it breaks up the obvious dialogue where people essentially deny they're all going to die, and who could possibly be out here anyway..<br/><br/>I really liked the Predator ship shots, and the 'hunters are coming' moments.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, the whole setup is pretty efficient (great to see Lance Henriksen back), and although you immediately guess who's going to survive, I think we've got deaths within about 20 minutes.<br/><br/> From then on, it's all over-blown portents and Cube-style morphing rooms, with the dumb humans trapped between the Predators and the Aliens (both of which do look really cool - and I was particularly pleased that when the two of them 'get it on', the fight is good and brutal - playing properly to their strengths & weaknesses).<br/><br/>So it goes - there's a flashback which might have been more fun as a longer sequence, but I enjoyed the attempt to wrap it all up in legend & mythology - and then the boss fight at the end, which - although it has a few cheesy moments - is also pretty good.<br/><br/>I can't mention the corniest moments in the film, but you'll know them when it happens - and there are a few gaps in its own story logic, but nothing you can't ignore. Something else I was also pleased with is how potentially annoying characters are swiftly dispensed with.<br/><br/>The almost-end was a bit too ""Predator 2"" for me, followed by an obvious (but good) final shot at the very end. And then there's plenty to talk about with your mates afterwards as you discuss the coolest (and daftest) moments of AVP on the way home. What more could you want from this film?<br/><br/>Well, actually I wanted a more serious mix of chills & ambiguity - more Alien (1) vs Predator (1) - but what we get it a mix of Aliens (2) and Predator (2), which is fine by me.<br/><br/>And yes, it is much better than Freddy vs Jason (although FvsJ was acceptable).<br/><br/>Final thought: that it would have been hilarious (given the timeline) to have had a cameo - maybe a warning message, or at least something - from Arnie (following his own rumble in the jungle, which would have been about a decade earlier). But I appreciated the nod to 'Bishop' all the same."

Not only was there insufficient battle scenes between the two species but we still don't know who won the battle between the two species.I think Anderson is actually hinting another movie by adding the sort of cliffhanger ending on it.But this movie has much to improve to rank up there with the other alien + Predator films and it is a disappointment but if you are a die hard fan of this then you may see better of it than me."

","Both films have a cult following and when you put both together for one gigantic battle you are hoping for something equally special then someone like Paul WS Anderson signs on the dotted line to direct. I am not a keen fan of his to say the least but I loved Event Horizon which is his best work to date and by the way he's going it will be forever. <br/><br/>With something like Alien VS Predator you have to have a director who knows what he's doing. Because Paul Anderson directed films like Mortal Combat and Resident Evil so the studio bosses are likely to go with someone like Anderson, I think it's because he's cheap and not just in directing. I think everybody expects to much from a film like this, you just have to look at how Freddy VS Jason was treated. What I expected was an all out no holds barred action gore fest and I don't think I even got that granted that the theatrical version is not Anderson's full cut. Still since PG-13 and 12A were exposed over the years studio bosses know they can make more money if kids can get the chance to go and see it just like adults can, make it one big happy family occasion so when Alien VS Predator was announced with these certificates I straight away expected no gore but I would have least liked some action. The first fight we see between the Alien and Predator was quite good and it had me pumped up but they are not long enough to satisfy my needs. <br/><br/>In the middle of nowhere a pyramid buried thousands of feet under the snow lies a pyramid. Weland Bishop and his company come across it and want to lead a team down there to see it for themselves. There is not much information on what they are going to do when they get there, only to go down into this long shaft tunnel thing and look at it and apparently make history but of course this is not long lived. I don't want to say to much as the plot is quite interesting when it comes to the history of the Alien and Predator and you should see that for yourself really. I don't think this film is as cheesy as some say, the acting is very good and is hard to criticise, but what makes this film not that good is the plot holes which really leave you quite frustrated and wanting more. It's not as bad as they say and is highly enjoyable in parts but we really have expected a lot but the reason for this is there is so much to work on to make it quite epic especially when you learn how this all came about thousands of years ago so you can't help but feel cheated in that aspect.<br/><br/>Watch it and you will like it, but if you're a hardcore fan you are likely to dislike most of the film all together and we have Paul Anderson and Studio bosses to thank for this, Resident Evil anyone?"

","I saw this last Saturday (Aug 21st)....and this is what stayed with me, starting with the negative - so I can end on a positive note :<br/><br/>n1] If one bothers to make a movie, one should endeavour to remove the most obvious plot-holes as to not ""alien-ate"" (sorry - couldn't help that one) the movie-goer. On that topic : -> Why did the Preds bother doing so much hand-2-hand combat ? When they picked off several lesser human opponents in P1 and P2, with lasers, heat-sensing, ..etc ?? -> Having used them to {I guess prove the worthiness/courage in combat - don't they already know they likely will not survive with odds of X (read more than 20) to 3. While _NOT_ using their cloaking/armour and technology ??? -> Another thing that also annoyed me was the clothing - although it could be debated that below the surface - some insulation is provided by the snow - like an igloo...still on the surface ?! -> Also, a mission that seemed somewhat risky, would have seen the risk factor go waaay up, after noticing a brand new hole - going straight there and some energy activity... send in the marines (maybe the ancestors of Hicks, Vasquez, and all the other really cool crew). -> Time to throw in some techno-stuff, like a woman - deciphering some scripts, and some binary code on the walls - they could have nicknamed ""mother""... etc.<br/><br/>p1] For the all the maligned reviews, the action and cgi - were eye-catching and well done. p2] I enjoyed the combat scenes and the way the lead-lady ""be-friended"" the Pred#3. p3] I liked the dynamic aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all - I enjoyed it ... especially since my expectations were low and the movie delivered the basics (no storyline, minimal character development) but kick-butt mano-a-mano.<br/><br/>Hope AVP-2 is better defined though - so much more can be done...."

","Warning: some of my comments may be construed as spoilers.<br/><br/>
First of all, I want to say that I liked this movie. The before-hand critics weren't very open to it, and the people in general had low expectations. However, it was not a bad movie. I have been a fan of both Alien and Predator since seeing each original series, as well as a fan of every other media type this pop-culture crossover has surfaced in. Therefore I had my own high expectations.<br/><br/>I will say this. It was cool. Despite being subject to some piddly studio-enforced time constraint, it played out well for an hour-forty movie. I felt the effects were well done, the aliens did not look in any way as deficient as those in Alien: Resurrection (mostly the queen), and the predators were quite excellent.<br/><br/>That said, I have some beefs. Being a longtime fan, I noticed some really irritating things.<br/><br/>The sense of time lapse in the movie was relatively basic; that is, it didn't feel like time ever really jumped forward by a big chunk. Because of this, the facehuggers seemed to take only a few minutes to implant the larval aliens, despite the several hour process intoned in the first two movies (which I consider the bible on all things Alien). I didn't mind this as much; so maybe the facehuggers are a little premature. However, this time problem arose with the chestburster stage. They set it up so that it seemed like the bursters also only took about ten minutes to fully mature, and exit their host. This, to me, felt way to fast. But, being a devout fan, maybe I'm just too obsessed. Finally, I felt that, even though it was cool and all, it was pretty shallow in terms of action volume. There aren't many big action scenes with the predators and aliens together, and they're mostly broken apart during the second half of the film (The first half is mostly character development and introduction). If it hadn't been for the queen's inclusion in the action, I doubt I would have voted on this as I did. To me, the queen really saves the movie. <br/><br/>And, it's definitely open for a sequel. Now I know, there haven't been any ""number one movie"" commercials for it, meaning it's general reception is satisfactory at best. But, unlike Godzilla, which was set up for a sequel that never came, AVP will most definitely get its sequel. This is because, using my example, Godzilla was a popcorn-action flick, and thought it may have earned its keep in sales, it didn't have the physical fan base to prod the sequel into production. AVP has that physical fan base - we've been around for twenty years. This means, even though AVP might not even make back its production costs, it most certainly will be sequeled simply to feed the fan's interest.<br/><br/>Oh, one last thing: Antarctica is really cold. Towards the end they seemed to have forgotten that."

","Stuff blows up, people get stabbed, great big setpieces fall down.  If this is all you require for an action movie, thumbs up, go to it, have fun.  It's rated PG-13, but don't let that dissuade you.  Your mind is already made up.<br/><br/>For the rest of you (and me), not so much.  The reason the first half of each franchise (Predator 1, Alien, Aliens) was/were so successful was not just because of the violence, body count, or cool-lookin' bad guy, but because they were pitted against humans we cared about.  We spent time with them, we got to see them in action, and that made it all the more horrifying when they're offed, one at a time.  We're supposed to be rooting for the humans.<br/><br/>This movie, like 'Freddy vs. Jason' before it, is made SOLELY for us to pick our favorite bad guy, and root for THEM, humans be damned.  Oddly, even ""FvJ"" had some character development.  In this one, we meet TWO whole characters in the initial set-up, and the carnage begins almost immediately. I don't care about the people, and now they're gone, and now I'm bored.<br/><br/>It's remarkably similar to Paul W.S. Anderson's earlier movies-- we don't count ""Mortal Kombat"" because he didn't write it, and we don't count ""Soldier"" because it sucked.  The shots of the holographic underground complex, the rag-tag recruits, even Colin Salmon's death.  Not only has it been done before and better, it's been done before and better BY ANDERSON.<br/><br/>The ending is pretty nice (if a little obvious), but getting there isn't really worth it, when only half the cast has any lines at all, and only half of them say something beyond ""Help Me!""  There's room for improvement, but somewhere in this 90-minute PG-13 C+ of a movie, there's a 120-minute R-rated A+, screaming to get out."
"calculon00","9","1","2","31 August 2004"," Great tribute, only minor flaws.
","I just want to say off the bat that I loved this movie.<br/><br/>Going into the theaters, I thought that the movie took place in the future. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it takes place in 2004 once the intro text stated the where of the movie in Alien tradition, as well as the when, in not-so Alien tradition.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was great, the character were decently developed, and the script well done.<br/><br/>************************SPOILERS BELOW********************<br/><br/>GOOD: I thought the acting and script was well done, for instance, when Weyland industries contracts Alexa Woods to be in charge of safety for the expedition the expedition crew doesn't take her very seriously (they seem to think that having guns will keep them safe from anything), one of her 3 BIG rules is to never go anywhere alone, advice which the expedition crew could not have ignored more during the course of the movie, as most of them are picked off one by one while they are alone by the predators.<br/><br/>While I don't know much about the predator movies, I am a HUGE fan of the Alien franchise, and I really appreciated the dedication to details from those movies, such as the company involved is called Weyland Industries, founded by Charles Bishop Weyland. This means that sometime in the future, Weyland industries merges with a corporation with Yutani in it's name and becomes Weyland-Yutani (""The company"" from the Alien movies) and creates the Bishop android in the likeness of Charles Bishop Weyland. It also explains how the Weyland-Yutani Corporation found out about the Aliens in the first place in the movie Alien. When I saw the actor that played Mr. Weyland, I didn't recognize him as Lance Henriksen (Even though I thought he looked like Lance Henriksen), because he looked so different from when he was in Alien3, 12 years before this movie was released.<br/><br/>BAD: I did notice one flaw in the movie however. After the expedition team is infected with chestbursters, it takes what seems like mere minutes for them to burst out of the chests of the team after being planted there. The original Alien movie showed that it takes several hours for a chestburster to burst out of someone's chest after being put there. But maybe I'm wrong, and many hours did pass while the team was unconscious and the two main characters wandered the lower levels of the pyramid, but if that's the case, they should have shown the passage of that much time somehow.<br/><br/>I also think it was stupid how Sanaa Lathan's character teamed up with the remaining predator. It completely out of character for the predators from what I know about them.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked this movie and I think it's an excellent tribute to the Alien franchise at least. This is actually the first Alien movie I've seen in theaters when it came out (mostly because I was born in 1986), and I will go see AvP 2 if and when it does come out."

The dark cold Antarctic underground pyramid worked well for both aliens. One of the problems I had was the fact that two of the Predators were killed too QUICKLY and too EASILY for my taste. The Alien Queen killing the last one was understandable but I forgot that he killed all of them at the end with his wrist bomb.

","I really really enjoyed this movie. Compared to the other Alien and Predator movies, my personal ranking probably places it second only to the original Alien.<br/><br/>I especially like the way that the queen in this prequel to the Alien series, supposedly dead and lost in Antarctic waters, may escape hundreds of years from now when her fetters finally erode, and become a loose queen on Earth, and an Alien sequel. (She's already survived thousands of years frozen and thawed repeatedly. And her skin is impervious to her own acid, so saltwater should be a piece of cake.)<br/><br/>And I like how the fact that aliens have already been on Earth explains how the Company seemed to know so much about the aliens from the very beginning - Weyland Industries had records of the fight in this movie, and the burned remains of alien carcasses, but were unable to recover the queen lost at sea."

If you didn't like AVP, then plain and simply: you don't like this genre of movie. Because this movie got me off more than anything I've seen in a LOOONNGG time. The passion and<br/><br/>attention to detail that Anderson puts on the screen is so evident. I've been a huge fan of both franchises forever and he did them BOTH proud. This is an<br/><br/>achievement. I'd like to thank Paul Anderson for making this movie. It's fun and I had a blast!!! My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it a 10 rating, is the fact that it's rated PG-13...come on, it should be R. Not quite enough gore! FOX: make a sequel!!"
"wckedmnkey","6","1","2","15 August 2004"," Cheesy but fun
","This film in no way holds up to any of the Alien films. And it barely holds up to the 2 Predator films, the 2nd of which was only mediocre. But if you're a fan of the genre' and want see an entertaining popcorn flick then you might enjoy this total cheese fest. And I do admit it was kind of fun to see these two species battle it out. Although it was a little odd that by the end they made one side obviously the good guys and the other the bad guys....as opposed to Freddie Vs. Jason where they were both obviously bad. The film is kind of a modern day Godzilla Vs. King Kong. And as entertaining as it is, you might want to just wait for it to hit video or even cable."

","How can Hollywood even get away with combining two rated ""R"" series FEATURES into a PG film?<br/><br/>The AvP idea had so much potential and this is what comes out of it, and believe me the story was only a small part of the problem. The acting was so horrible that over half (yes half) of the audience, including myself, was laughing at what was supposed to be the somewhat frightening moments (notice moments is plural). I didn't mention the 3rd that walked out, sorry. Wake up Hollywood! When I first saw Predator, Alien and its not worthy sequel Aliens, I couldn't sleep for weeks, afraid of the dark, even getting a little freaked out at my dog cause he growled like the Predator. Even the second Predator and the 3rd and 4th Alien sequels had their freaky moments, but this movie....is for kids. Like Mortal Kombat, or Resident Evil.<br/><br/>The Director, ahhh yes Paul W.S. Anderson, (Mortal Kombat, and Resident Evil) I would really hate to see a recreation of The Exercist Vs. Hannibal Lector....Rated PG. <br/><br/>For the Predator fans, I definitely know that Anderson didn't watch Predator. Ohhh, by the way, thanks for re-dubbing the creatures scream from the first Predator on to your not so Stan Winston looking creature WITH BROWN EYES. Your Infrared thermal image vision sucks, what happened to the wonderful colors and the blue background, even the other vision modes (non of which I could knew off hand) sucked, and what hell happened to the original thermal vision sound effects from the first movie, for those who do not know what I am talking about, it's that constant humming sound and the creatures heartbeat, even that famous WHIP-SNAP (sound element used when changing to infrared) which was such an important suspense factor in the first Predator has been reduced to nothing. Ohh and by the way according to Anderson, the Predators in AvP were based almost entirely off of the creature in the original movie. I know that John McTiernan, if he even goes to see this movie, will probably fall out of his directors chair.<br/><br/>On the flip side Anderson did a great job with the camouflage effect (thanks for not really changing it) especially on the weapons, which were another over-exaggerated element, nothing new.<br/><br/>For the Alien Fans, I must admit they did a great job with the look of the Aliens. However, the sped up life cycle seemed quick and painless (which was another stupid idea) why couldn't the one infected team meet up with the other non infected team and then the chestbursters could come out. What about the Predalien?  I mean a full sized Predalien. What about the queen? How did she get frozen in the first place. I could go on for hours, and I won't.<br/><br/>All in all, in the VS. debate, the Aliens did win this round. They killed two Predators in less then two minutes from each other. WOW, and the third Predator would have probably been killed in less the a minute after his buddies, if Anderson was also producing.  <br/><br/>Oh by the way Paul, the AvP comic book (as well as the movies) indicate that Predators can run faster then the average speed of a car, so why didn't the Predator just throw the girl on his back and run away from the blast. AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO BRING UP THE HUMAN/PREDATOR INTERACTION ISSUE, THIS ISN'T AN ""E.T.""/""Close Encounters"" FLICK. THAT IDEA REALLY SUCKED.<br/><br/>For the humans, I said it before, and I'll say it again, the actors performances where horrible. I can't make it any more clearer. Lance, buddy, what you needed the money or something????? Come on, you know better then to call on a 7-foot plus tall monster. Didn't they teach you that in acting class.<br/><br/>
As for all of you that liked this movie. Hey I am glad you liked it. At least there is someone out there who did.<br/><br/>
As for all of the so called ""AvP Haters"". I can only hope that if a sequel is in the works, please don't, but if it has to be done......James Cameron where are you!!!! <br/><br/>AVP - Alien Vs. Predator RATED PG - Anyone over 13 shouldn't see this, even with a child.<br/><br/>
P.S.  ""Whoever wins....we lose""  this is a lie, that last creature standing is a human."

","** Spoilers **<br/><br/>Another reviewer has called it junk food for the brain-- and I think<br/><br/>that's pretty accurate.  As a sci-fi movie (forgetting the franchises)<br/><br/>on a hot summer afternoon, it was fun.  A short escape from<br/><br/>reality.<br/><br/>But it really wasn't an Alien or a Predator movie in my mind.  They<br/><br/>just happened to show up in the movie.<br/><br/>I found the concept of the backstory interesting, and saw a LOT of<br/><br/>potential there.  What would make Predators (always established<br/><br/>as coming to hunt in hot weather) come to the ice?  The<br/><br/>connection between pyramids on earth between different cultures,<br/><br/>etc. -- all interesting little background info to make it just believable<br/><br/>enough.<br/><br/>But a movie that advertises itself as Aliens vs. Predator should be<br/><br/>ABOUT Aliens vs. Predators.  It seemed like the battles between<br/><br/>the two races were too brief, and too far between (an editing<br/><br/>problem, I imagine).<br/><br/>One of the things, particularly in Aliens, that makes the movie so<br/><br/>fantastic is that you care about the characters.  It makes their<br/><br/>deaths that much more effective and impacting.  Here, the<br/><br/>characters are barely introduced.  A couple don't even have<br/><br/>names.  There is no development of character, no connection<br/><br/>between them-- no real reason to care about them at all. <br/><br/>
A lot of the problems I attribute to the way-too-fast run time of the<br/><br/>movie.  Things that needed to be developed to solidify the plot just<br/><br/>could not be accomplished in the movie that was released. <br/><br/>
However, some sloppy story writing-- within the movie itself-- also<br/><br/>makes it, as a member of the Aliens or Predator franchises,<br/><br/>subpar.  For example, after multiple scans by the Predator to find<br/><br/>an alien growing within hosts, bypassing killing a main character<br/><br/>because he's old, sick, and weak, etc-- you want to have me<br/><br/>believe that his shipmates would not have scanned his dead body<br/><br/>before bringing it onboard their ship?  Riiight.<br/><br/>Again-- for a generic sci-fi romp, it was okay.  Needed more action,<br/><br/>needed a lot more time to develop the storyline and make me care<br/><br/>about it-- but the name is misleading for what was produced.<br/><br/>7/10."

","First off, PG-13 did not affect this movie whatsoever. I thought this was a great movie and Paul Anderson did an excellent job tying the game, the books and the 2 movie franchises together. You see hints of things from the past alien/predator movies, you learn about the culture of the predators as described in the books, and you see similarities of the whole scenario as in the game. I noticed someone mentioned why the predators dies so easily. It's a test, a hunt. Invisibility does not hide from the aliens, and the bigger the challenge the better. And the topic about the girl joining forces with the predator being stupid is completely off. That's the predator culture, prove yourself worthy and you are branded. I walked into the theatre wary of how good the movie is because of the bad reviews and ratings this place gave, and I walked out of it completely opposite, knowing that any aliens/predator fan should love this movie! 10/10"
"Triniman","4","1","2","14 August 2004"," promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up
","2/5  Alien Vs. Predator<br/><br/>Take two well-known sci-fi franchises and merge them into a film in such a way that you can be assured of a huge audience, but also, that the sum is greater than the parts.  Or as great.  This film isn't it.  Alien Vs. Predator is a cold, calculated `product' that is too contrived and formulaic to provide much intrigue or entertainment value.  And the most amount of suspense is provided courtesy of a penguin.<br/><br/>A corporate satellite, searching for evidence of natural resources, detects a significant amount of heat coming from an island in Antarctica.  The billionaire head of the company quickly hobbles together an expedition team to investigate what appears to be a pyramid with Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian traits, located 2000 feet below the surface.<br/><br/>The pyramid contains walls and floors that shift every ten minutes and hieroglyphics that are interpreted by one of the crew, to give them some sense of what they have found.  The maze provides so much overkill that an Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider fan would blush. The humans get into the maze, the face huggers do their thing and you have a nice population of Aliens for the Predators to hunt.<br/><br/>It takes one human to `birth' an Alien, so why are there so many Aliens in the place?  The gestation period took hours in the first Alien film, but here they seem to pop out with greater frequency.  The dialogue appears to be written by a 6th-grader.  There are no outstanding characters in the film, like a Ripley from the Alien series, although they try to create one in `Lex' Woods, played by Sanaa Lathan.  There's virtually no character development, so when they get killed, you don't feel anything.  Lance Henriksen plays the billionaire.  In one scene, he briefly does the `knife' trick from the Aliens film, where he played a `synthetic human.'<br/><br/>This film is an empty-calorie spectacle that doesn't satisfy, yet it promises too much potential for fans of either series to pass up.  At least we find out who taught humans how to build pyramids.<br/><br/>Review by Triniman"
"TheMovieMark","Null","1","2","13 August 2004"," One plot contrivance leads to another, and the next thing you know a massive war between Aliens, Predators, and humans ensues.
","Is there really any need for me to review this movie? Critics are gonna hate it, women and the elderly will try to avoid it, and fanboys will go see it no matter what. But I try to convince myself that my voice is *always* needed, so here we go.<br/><br/>If you have no interest in seeing this movie, then I really have no incentive to convince you otherwise. If you've already cleared your calendar and got your tickets, well, you probably don't have a girlfriend. But that's irrelevant. Much like you have to do whenever you go on a date, I suggest you lower your expectations right now. If you do that, then you might just come away somewhat entertained. There's no guarantee, but at least your chances will be better. Certainly better than getting that second date. *rimshot* I'm sorry; I just like to give fanboys a hard time.<br/><br/>AvP (as the hipsters like to call it) is not what I'd classify as a ""good movie,"" but at times it does pass for entertainment. I was never bored, and it kept my interest, so hey, I don't regret seeing it, but my biggest disappointment is that this could have been so much better.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty hokey, but I won't give it away just in case you prefer to wait for the revelation during the movie. However, I will tell you that the actual revelation is beyond cheesy. Here's the deal. The humans make their way down to the pyramid, we find out that the mother alien is dormant in the pyramid, and we see that the Predators are in their spaceship and they're headed to ... yep, you guessed it ... the pyramid. So I'm sitting in the theater thinking, ""So what's the connection? I hope they explain what's going on."" No problem.<br/><br/> Thankfully, a member of Henriksen's team can read hieroglyphics, and lo and behold, there are hieroglyphics in the pyramid! But wait, that's not the best part. Somebody actually took the time to write out the entire plot of the movie in hieroglyphics in the pyramid! So dude proceeds to read the plot summary to us as we're treated to a flashback. Give me a break. That's the best they could come up with? Couldn't they have, you know, put forth a modicum of effort and somehow developed the plot within the context of the movie? And don't get your hopes up, the connection between the three races isn't exactly sci-fi ingenuity.<br/><br/>Some more laughable moments involve an Aztec calendar and the reconfiguration of the pyramid. One of the guys from the team claims that since the Aztec calendar was based on multiples of 10 then this must mean that the pyramid was designed around that. Of course, that's the solution to all their problems. This is supposed to explain why the pyramid reconfigures itself every 10 minutes. Whatever, man, just whatever.<br/><br/>And yes, I realize that I'm referring to characters as ""dude"" and ""one of the guys,"" and believe me, you'll be doing the same thing if you go see the movie. Long gone are the days of Arnold and Ventura. Now say hello to... well, I don't really remember anybody's name, and I didn't really care to either. It's sufficient to say there's a bunch of people with accents, and we all know that accents are used in an effort to disguise bad acting.<br/><br/>One good thing about having mostly unknowns is that you don't know exactly who will die and who will live. However, one bad thing about having mostly unknowns is that there's a good chance they can't act and most likely won't convince you to care about them. I shed not one tear over any character's death. Did Mr. Scientist Geek just get killed? Yeehaw. Go Predator.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm just curious. If you came face-to-face with an alien, and this was the first realization of alien existence, what would you say? Would you be speechless? Or would you say, ""You want a piece of me?"" I didn't think so.<br/><br/> One other thing I need to address is the PG-13 rating. A lot of fans are upset about this, and well, you should be. The result is that this movie is fun for the whole family! Seriously, except for an ""f"" word, this is safe even for pre-teens. I don't think they should've had additional profanity (typically a sign of lazy writing), but this is a movie that should be overflowing with Alien/Predator gore and violence. Instead, we get a few sanitized fights with very little gore and very little slime. Some of the fights are cool, but there aren't enough, and they aren't as chaotic as they should be.<br/><br/>I'm also not a fan of the Predator with a heart of gold. There was a scene near the end where, I kid you not, I thought the Predator and Sanaa Lathan were going to kiss. Somebody in the theater actually said, ""Oooh, she's gonna kiss him!"" Folks, if you're a fan of the original Predator then you know that there shouldn't even be the threat of that happening! I have no idea what they were thinking there.<br/><br/>Let me end with a piece of advice for you. If you ever find yourself going one-on-one with a Predator and it turns its back and starts to walk away, man, just let it walk. <br/><br/>THE GIST  <br/><br/>Do you love movies that are filmed in a lot of dark locations with a lot of spooky music playing in the background all while characters are walking around slowly? Does this scare you and keep you entertained no matter how simplistic and silly the plot is? If so, then Alien Vs. Predator should keep you entertained. However, if you're expecting this to just completely blow your mind then I recommend lowering the bar of your expectations before entering the theater and try not to sob too much over the missed opportunities."
"jpintar","6","1","2","13 August 2004"," Entertaining
","If you go into Alien vs. Predator expecting a classic like the original Alien or Aliens, you will be sorely disappointed.  You must accept this movie for what it is and not compare it to the others.  It has exciting action between Predator vs. Human, Alien vs. Human, Alien vs. Predator, and then all three at once.  The movie has good production design in which a pyramid contains mazes, secret passages, and trapdoors.  But how this movie got a PG-13 rating is amazing considering the violence.  This movie basically covers the same ground as the previous Alien and Predator movies with little variation so fans of both series will not be surprised. Overall, if you enjoy wall to wall action without too much character development.  As a matter of fact, we don't care about any human characters. They are just there to get killed.  If you go, you probably know what you are getting into.  6/10"
"ghostscript","Null","1","2","12 August 2004"," Did both franchises justice
","Okay, I read the first review on here and unfortunately it is going to ruin the image of a very entertaining movie. So in a few words, I will say the first reviewer has no idea what he's talking especially since he admitted he hasn't seen any of the Alien movies. He just wanted his poor little precious Predator to just bogard through everything. So let's address his issues to give you a BETTER and more THOROUGH review from someone who is a fan of BOTH franchises.<br/><br/>First off, the human element is TOTALLY necessary. We're not talking elitist inclusion like in LXG where they just HAD to have an American character. But think about it, Predators can't talk! Neither can Aliens so how in the world did you expect to understand what was going on. If you want blood and gore and endless fighting, go play an Alien Vs. Predator video game! I'm sorry but I just can't stand when people trash a good story just because they wanted mindless action. Why not just enjoy the action there was and let people who know how to appreciate a story enjoy it.<br/><br/>I thought the story was very well crafted and ALMOST made total sense. Really the only problem I had with it was the character Charles Bishop Weland was of course the model for the Bishop android in Aliens. If I remember correctly, and I could be wrong, they said that the Bishop android was modeled after it's creator. I guess it could be Weyland's grandson or something as Aliens took place AT LEAST 75 years after AVP. But that was pretty much it as far as complaints.<br/><br/>If you're such a big fan of Predator, wouldn't you know that the Predators as hunters show respect for anyone who can take one of them down? It's part of their culture. Call it the code of the hunters. (SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN PREDATOR) In the first Predator, it was obvious the he respected Arnold's character but he was all beat up and his only choice was to blow himself up. Had he been bested without being fatally injured, I'm sure he would have shown the same respect they showed in Predator 2 and AVP. Also, Mr. Predator fan, Predators only hunt and kill something that is a threat to them. (SPOILER FOR AVP) Sanaa Lathan's character was not threatening him AND he respected her for killing the Alien right in front of him.<br/><br/>No one can expect the Predators to just kick the crap out of the Aliens, especially in hand to hand combat. The Aliens are savage and savie and have many built-in weapons and just live to kill so they can breed. You take the best game hunter in the world and arm him some blades and a Glave (ala Krull) and put him up against a lion. He might win, he might not, probably not, but if he won it certainly wouldn't be easy at all!<br/><br/>This was a very solid and entertaining movie with great action and a pretty good story to explain why all of this was happening. There were elements of humor, terror, suspense and some great fight scenes. I think I would have wanted to see a little more fighting but overall I thought it was a solid effort and this is coming from someone who has watched all 6 Alien and Predator movies over and over and knows what's what with their respective universes. So over all I would give it maybe an A-/B+. I thought it was a little short and I wouldn't have minded seeing a little more gore but it really wasn't necessary. The whole point of a movie is to be entertained and this one did it very well. Go see it yourself and judge, don't the word of a biased teenager or even a fan of both. Judge for yourself."
"bigham78","5","4","19","5 July 2006"," Alien vs. Predator
","I was very disappointed in this movie. I had heard there was supposed to be five teenage predators. They only had three. Not nearly enough fight scenes between the Predators and Aliens. The few they had are why I didn't vote this lower. I believe had there been a couple more battles of Predators Vs Aliens. This would have been a far better movie. I also don't get the lone survivor. This is far too predictable having just one lone survivor. This appears to be a running theme throughout Alien and Predator movies with the exception of Alien resurrection. I see nothing wrong with a couple of survivors you get to relate to throughout the movie. In my opinion this movie still left many unanswered questions for me in terms of the dreaded company. Charles Weyland is killed and it doesn't explain how ""the company"" learns of the Alien creature from this supposed before the time period of the original Alien movie. I hear they're going to make a sequel. I only hope they learn from their mistakes in this movie."

","AvP appeared on a movie channel tonight, and despite the dreadful reviews it received I really wanted to just sit down and watch an undemanding piece on entertaining nonsense. I usually really like that sort of thing - from the heady heights of the original Predator and Alien movies to the Die-Hards and the early works of the hilarious Jean-Claude Van Damme.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Paul WS Anderson has contrived to make a film that I couldn't possibly enjoy without the aid of non-prescription drugs or a prefrontal lobotomy. Now I'm just angry.<br/><br/>(spoilers warning) The first few scenes, gathering a team to travel to the Antarctic, and the dialogue in the helicopter between Alexa Woods and Ewan Bremner seemed to be setting things up quite well until a big bag of stupid was dropped from a great height, hit the screenplay and burst all over the celluloid.<br/><br/>The team leave their icebreaker and trek to the site of a pyramid buried two kilometers under the ice directly below an abandoned whaling station. A whaling station that is situated, as you'd expect, next to the sea. Why not just take the ship there? Well, obviously because this whaling station has been built upon a huge inaccessible cliff of ice overlooking the sea. I think I can see why this whaling station was abandoned.<br/><br/>Mr Anderson builds the tension by having Bremner surprised by a lone penguin. Penguins are, of course, well known for their solitary hermit-like lifestyle. Maybe this can be forgiven - perhaps there is a silent penguin colony just off-camera.<br/><br/>Next a ray from the predators' starship burns a 30' tunnel down into the ice, leading straight to the pyramid (being a pyramid, it's fortunate that the team leaders have had the foresight to bring along a talented Italian archaeologist, though I find it strange that his usually fluent grasp of the English language doesn't extend to the pronunciation of the word ""archeological""), which would make site of the pyramid, oh, 3.5 kilometers away from the station. Not what you'd call under it. (end of pedantry)<br/><br/>Some of the team get impregnated with aliens, and all I can say is there must have been a lot of quintuplets because soon the place is overrun by aliens. By soon I mean in the space of a few minutes. (sigh)<br/><br/>Later, the talented archaeologist translates an ancient text about spaceships. Not ""fiery chariots"" or some similar bit of mangled simile that wouldn't cause you to bat an eyelid in a film like this, but straight in there with the spaceships and aliens. That really curdled it.<br/><br/>God, I'm sorry, I really can't go on. This film has more plot holes than my ass has hairs - I'm all for suspension of disbelief but this really is taking the mick. It's almost as if things were being introduced into the plot just to be contradicted soon after - a sort of ""Where's Wally"" of errors for fans of the originals, or indeed fans of any kind of coherent plot development.<br/><br/>The only bit that really got my attention was the first one-on-one between a predator and an alien. I was willing to forget about all the crap that had led up to this point, thinking that *now* the film would really get going, until the predator, after a bit of brawling, beat the alien like a ginger-haired stepchild then stood around waiting for it to kill him/her, restoring the monotony.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Event Horizon, and I quite liked Resident Evil, but by all that is sacred, I hope no-one lets this man near a director's chair again.<br/><br/>I have waited for this film since Predator 2, and Paul Anderson has raped my childhood dreams. From ""In space no one can hear you scream"" to ""on earth no one can hear your howls of derision"". Zero out of ten."

I know this is a popular thing to do bashing this director and all but in this case he deserves it. Paul W. S Andersen, why is this film so bad? Why can't you for once in your career make a meaningful movie, with say meaningful characters? I challenge you Paul, a decent film is all I want.

","After successfully messing up film versions of both Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat, Paul W.S. Anderson has been hired to helm another project that should really make itself; Alien vs. Predator. The mind boggles, it really does. How this man continues to get work is anyone's guess - I don't doubt that his films make money, but surely the powers that be would be far better off hiring a director that knows what they're doing. Projects like this one and Anderson's video game movies were always going to make a profit anyway, so I cant understand why the studios don't hire someone good. Anyway, as the title suggests; AvP finally sees two of cinemas most menacing creatures face off! As a big fan of all the Alien and Predator films (with the exception of Alien 3, for obvious reasons), I was very much looking forward to this movie, even though my expectations were low, and alas; it didn't even meet my low expectations. I was expecting at the least to be entertained by a little bit of alien fighting; and although the movie has that and it's not boring; it also has lots of trite and dull moments and on the whole this film is one gigantic failure.<br/><br/>The plot isn't very original, but at least it gives the film the basis for an intriguing set-up. It preaches that the Predator's are coming to Earth on a hunting trip and, as they are the ultimate prey, they've re-animated a bunch of Aliens to fight with. The 'fun' doesn't end there, however, as a bunch of researchers are on the Predator's patch after discovering their hunting ground under the ice in Antarctica. This isn't a bad plot; it's not particularly intelligent, it's very simple and, as mentioned, it's unoriginal; but still. However, Anderson still manages to mess up even this plot with an awful 'revelation' part way through, a very trite and dull first half and an ending that is an absolutely huge cop-out, and doesn't do justice to the series' that spawned it. It's almost like Anderson got most of the movie completed, and then just decided to get the movie over with quickly. Maybe his dinner was ready or he just got offered another franchise to mess up, I don't know. Aside from all the stuff mentioned, though, the most annoying thing about the movie is the terrible characters and the even worse script that they had to work from. Quite why Lance Henriksen accepted this movie is anyone's guess, I know that he probably wanted his paycheck, but man, where's the self respect? Anyway, this movie isn't recommended."
"jvaldeztoo","10","3","13","16 July 2006"," A Perfect Blend of Alien and Predator
","Some primary points to remember when watching a movie tied to a series of movies is that plot, time line, and characters must follow a specific path to rationalize the story as a whole. It is most difficult to create movies based on the vast epics of comic books and video games because readers and gamers have expectations that writers and directors usually cannot satisfy. To begin, movies are limited by time - most viewers will sit through an hour and a half or maybe 2 hours. Rarely can a director get away with over two hours, and only in exceptional instances can a movie be 3 hours or more. Hence, what AVP followed made it a prequel to answer the questions of the previous movie viewers and keep the story fresh. This perspective lent the story an environment of the present by the course of the previous movies, focusing on the back story of both aliens and predator. Anderson, O'Bannon, and Shusset did a fantastic job telling their story and the length of the movie is perfect to tell all about it.<br/><br/>These gentlemen were creative enough to establish rules that were re-reasoned and re-rationalized from the previous movies. It would not be sensible to make this work for all of the comics, books, video games and so forth ever based on AVP because it would be impossible to know all the rules and worlds that other authors created. Essentially, the stories of Alien and Predator have been ""works in progress"" for all areas. Anderson, O'Bannon and Shusset worked together on ""their"" original ideas, which makes it rather official in terms of what the story is meant to be for all monsters involved. When new subsequent writers some day take over, it will take a great feat of intellectual strength to rise to the challenge. Consider the hereditary story of Star Trek, where new series writers have delicately tip-toed around paradoxes eventually writing them out of existence and into a void where an explanation is presented in the creation of something entirely new in a completely different series or movie. In short, books and video games have to be ignored because their story lines are not suitable for consistency: the driving aspects of the film.<br/><br/>This is where AVP fits in. It is the creation of something to explain ""some"" of the story but not all. Well directed by Anderson, AVP viewers are presented with the ""beginning"" - the part where characters such as Woods and Weyland fit in - where aliens fit in and their unexpected origins - and what predators do and why they come to Earth in first place. This beginning is beautifully orchestrated with the unsuspecting humans destined by their own greed. The predators are more plentiful in this movie, which explains their 1 on 1 performance in previous movies. The aliens are solidified as the same nasty creatures they've always been, which is the focal point for loads of action leaving the aliens to do their dirty deeds.<br/><br/>Also, viewers should remember that stories and their rights are property that is purchased, collaborated, officiated, and storyboarded, re-worked, thrown out and redone from the beginning and over again before exposure ever hits the film. Many fans forget that the audiences who follow alien, predator, and AVP (not to mention the general public) are all different. Their knowledge and understanding of the characters must be reconciled by the film or the film will never make sense. This is much harder to do than just picking one of the comic book stories and going with it. Keep in mind, that stories which fare well in books or in games are not necessarily the stories that fare well in theaters. Essentially, actors tell the story, not scripts and milieu may not necessarily be created by the environment described in a video game. Screen plays must be written so that lighting, props, camera angle, special effects and locations can tell the story as well.<br/><br/>AVP is a perfect example of what blending story lines should do - it demonstrates commitment to the academy and to the work of the previous artists who produced both Alien and Predator with substantial energy. It is clear that this movie crew succeeded because everyone involved had the shear will and ability to make AVP the best movie possible. The ""monster versus monster"" storyline is tough to pull off for any production crew. Sure, we would all love to see King Kong vs. Godzilla which would be a lot easier to do than Star Wars vs. Star Trek, but that doesn't mean it should be done - nor does it mean that we can do it competently without considerable effort. A story really has to work or there is going to be trouble and a lot of expense down the road. AVP is the best monster vs. monster movie ever made - which is truly an understatement.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have suggested that this movie has tainted the entire vision of the AVP series' and all is lost. It's disappointing to think that anyone would suggest that we could not continue a story because a movie was made in one interpretation. I look forward to viewing the incarnations of every idea because it is fun! Some day there may be a new Brady Bunch series, a new and improved Lone Ranger, or a better Robocop. AVP is a great movie for anyone looking for an action and sci-fi flick and not because it follows story lines so well (which it does) but because it truly excels as a movie. Taking a strict interpretive view of what a story ""has to be"" is ridiculous not to mention stressful for viewers. I look forward to AVP-2 because let's face it - you can never get enough of that long scary tongue with teeth at the end"

Predators hunting aliens and humans? Why not? But not with so many plot holes, undeveloped characters, bad FX, dialogues stupid beyond belief, illogicalities and all other kinds of stuff that would make Ed Wood proud.

","Could the crossover of the ""Alien"" and the ""Predator"" franchises be stopped? Probably not; it was going to happen sooner or later, as was hinted in ""Predator 2"". The question is whether it 'should' have been stopped. The expectations for this movie were, frankly speaking, low. No intricate plot is expected, just a full-on action battle between two of the most world-renowned and iconic alien designs ever produced. Which is all we get; even a little plot development. A group put together by Charles Bishop Weyland (played by Lance Henriksen) must investigate an unknown pyramid underneath Antarctica. Firstly, if you have watched ""Alien 3"", which is set in the future, where a younger version of the same character (Charles BIshop Weyland) is present, just ignore the incontinuity, because there are plenty more. Such as the completely improbable costumes; for example, no beanies are worn (and the cast is plunged into the surface of Antarctica) and a single singlet for a top layer of clothing for one scene.
Despite all of the flaws, there are scenes of suspense which can get you slightly anxious, but there is no connection to the characters; nothing for you to want them to survive (save for Ewen Bremmer, who plays Graeme Miller, father of two kids). Most of the characters you begin to discover and connect with, die within the next ten minutes (don't worry, that's not a spoiler)! 
As usual with these types of movies, there must always be the tough guy/girl who happens to hate the world for reasons unexplained, unfortunately, paired with a fine piece of overacting, the character just becomes worse and negatively affects the film. Another piece of nonsensical rubbish is located when, suddenly, these expeditioners pull out machine guns out of these huge cases... why would anybody have a gun? This pyramid is meant to originate from ancient civilisations, I imagine most of the people would be long dead! You can count the number of people who don't have a gun on one hand... (they must be the people who don't have foresight). As mentioned, there are some good scenes (like the costumes and occasionally CGI of the alien/xenomorph) which, are mostly (if only) the Predator vs. Alien scenes. There is some effective CGI which is present, but there are also poor, uneffective scenes, but nothing to take away any enjoyment. 
The film is watchable, but doesn't seem to affect the ""Alien"" or ""Predator"" universes (so far), so, unless you are eager enough to see this instalment, there are much better horror and action movies out there, just look a bit harder."

However, my dreams were crushed two minutes into the movie. Paul W.S. Anderson obviously was high while writing and directing this film. What other explanation could there be such a horrid film? With this film, it is proved ""Alien 3"" and ""Predator 2"" truly are not the worst installments in the two series. The story is awful, installing all this b.s. mythology that contradicts itself at every turn and if anything confuses the audience from the start. The cast is one of the crappiest ever and none deliver the thrilling performances I was expecting. Most people will find the characters boring and will be begging for them to be the next victims. And the PG-13 rating really limits the action, which is stupid because every film before this in both series is R-rated!! Sigh, the only high point is the xenomorph and predator suits and effects, which were dope. The first meet scene was the only part of the film I truly enjoyed and after that, yeah... go watch ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"" to wash this crapfest out of your head."

"Ithorianjedimaster2","2","1","3","15 June 2007"," A Predator-Sized Disappointment
","First, it started with a brief moment within ""Predator 2"" when the skulls of Aliens could be seen aboard the Predator ship. Then, it led to a very long chain of comic books that brought Sci-Fi Horror legends, ""Predator"" and ""Aliens"" against one another. Finally, you have . . . this movie, which isn't at all a good thing.<br/><br/>When ""AVP: Aliens VS. Predator"" was announced for the first time, fans all over the globe went NUTS! Seeing two of Sci-fi horror's titans collide in one movie that was constantly being told to be a future blockbuster hit. However, those fans were really cheering for the Second Coming of the Anti-Christ in the form of a movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts out simple. Weyland Industries discovers what appears to be an underground pyramid in the most unlikely of places: Antartica. In hope of gaining the discovery of the century, Mr. Weyland takes numerous explorers with him to the icy wasteland. When they arrive, they find a large hole that leads right to the pyramid, though it couldn't have been made by human hands and had to have been done overnight. Of course, the cliché ""Excitement over Caution"" kicks in and the explorers quickly drop the mystery of the hole and use to it their advantage.<br/><br/>While the humans explore the pyramid several miles under the ice, three teenage Predators, facing their ""Becoming-a-Man"" task, kill the humans up on the surface with relative ease, though later, their intelligence PLUMMETS! What do I mean by this? Well, you have the three Predators who are charged with facing and killing the Alien queen in order to return home a man, buuuuut the idiotic humans take their plasma weapons and leave them to fend off the Aliens with their blades. Of course, if it was the Predator for ""Predator 1"", it wouldn't need plasma weapons and use its blades to kick some Alien butt. It's the opposite here. Two of the Predators are quickly killed off, except for the last one, who seems to be something-of-an-expert since he is slicing and dicing Aliens back-and-forth with ease.<br/><br/>While these Predators are fighting for their lives in a battle that the very poorly-acted humans interfered in, the humans also get killed off fast, but it isn't done by the Predators. Though two people ARE killed by the ticked-off Predator, the humans, despite their 'high-tech' weaponry, are no match for normal drone Aliens and Face-Huggers, those little crab-like things that inject a human with Alien eggs. Finally, only one human is left, the protagonist, a woman named Alexa Woods.<br/><br/>Then, that's when the worst thing in the world happens. After Alexa surrenders the plasma cannon to the surviving Predator, he takes the weapon, clearly satisfied AND soon, they become FRIENDS and go off to kill the queen together. Every Predator fan, me included, knows that a REAL Predator would have said ""Oh thanks. I was a little mad that you guys took my plasma cannon in the first place, but thanks for giving it."" BAM! She gets blown away by the plasma cannon. Another thing that affects Predator standards is the fact that Predators wear the masks because they can't breathe our air very well and need the mask to provide the kind of oxygen (or whatever) that they need. Well, the director crumbled that up and threw it in the garbage and made it so that the surviving Predator REMOVES his mask personally TWICE. Once, was when he did it for no apparent reason and was ambushed by a Face-Hugger, and second, was when he wanted to go eye-to-eye with his human buddy. He roars in her face and the woman who was once horrified of this thing, just stares back with that kind of ""I'm not afraid of you"" look.<br/><br/>Same thing for the Aliens. It seems like whenever the Predator kills one, he cuts it in a certain way that makes it so that acid blood doesn't come out. Another thing the director screwed up on was when the queen, who is suppose to be the smartest of the Aliens and responsible to solely lay the Face-Hugger eggs, 'commands' her drones to destroy her restraints and then, breaks the egg sack on her and practically ditches the other Aliens to kill the Predator and human, which she somehow knows about, despite the fact that she was stuck in a icy metal chamber throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie tries to lead you off with slow-motion effects, lots of explosive debris during Alien Vs. Predator fights, and lots of screaming. But with horrible acting, a few very lousy special effects, and finally, a script that should be burned by Aliens and Predator fans, director Paul W.S. Anderson has found the formula of how to turn an easy-to-make blockbuster hit into an abomination that will go down in Sci-Fi history as the largest disappointment. Hey, at least Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace now has a roomie."

When they arrive, they find a hole drilled down deep beneath the surface of the ice; after setting up base camp, they descend the hole. One problem: the ropes break, trapping them in what they soon realize is a giant temple.<br/><br/>Soon after the humans find themselves trapped, the first wave of Predators arrive above the ice. They know (and the humans don't) that the temple is actually a holding place for a queen Alien and her drones.<br/><br/>Once the aliens are (inevitably) freed, the Predators wage war on the aliens- leaving the humans to defend themselves against the both (frequent) Alien and Predator attacks.<br/><br/>I will leave you with this: Don't listen to those who say this movie sucks- it really doesn't."

Bring together the two most fearsome off world life forms in movie history in a face off and then drop some poor schmucks in the meat grinder along with them.<br/><br/>Sounds good doesn't it? What a pity therefore that five films of back story (all right, six if you must count Alien Resurrection!) were all but disregarded in favour of this dreadful mess.<br/><br/>OK, lets get the good points out of the way first as it will be quicker. The soundtrack was a little generic but good and the penguin was cute.<br/><br/>Now for the bad bits, I hope you are sitting comfortably as this could take a while.<br/><br/>First the cast, some interesting choices and bringing in the original Mr Weyland in the form of the now very old looking Lance Henriksen was a good idea but the rest of the cast (with the possible exception of the aforementioned penguin of course) were forgettable, even the one or two established actors such as Colin Salmon.<br/><br/>The characters were woefully underdeveloped but in the majority this didn't matter too much as many of them were fairly swiftly dispatched in one PG-13 style ungruesome manner or another. It is remarkable though that Mr Weyland hired the best so called experts money could buy yet most of them seemed to know about as much on their so called specialist subject as I know about nuclear physics.<br/><br/>They weren't helped of course by a ropey script, some really atrocious dialogue and one of Hollywood's most infamous and indeed talent less directors.<br/><br/>Then there are our two main players themselves. The Aliens did their bit but for the majority of the time they seemed to content themselves with lurking on over hanging ledges and laughing themselves silly at the Predators.<br/><br/>The Predators provided the aforementioned amusement by being lumbering and inept beyond belief, the fact that they also appeared to have overdosed on coffee, doughnuts and pies adding to the unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>If this was a stand alone alien life forms having a punch up story (i.e. the Alien and Predator films did not exist) then this would just about worked but it isn't so it doesn't, and quite badly at that! The one thing that marked out the original Alien films apart from their overall attention to detail, excellent lighting, photography, cast choices etc was that after watching one of these, you would look around you in the dark, a little nervous as to whether an Alien was lurking just over your shoulder waiting to pounce, they were that good.<br/><br/>This family friendly padded rubbish had none of this gritty tension and even those parts of the 'plot' that were all but lifted verbatim from the original Alien and Predator films were so badly used, filmed and directed that even the most die hard fans of the two series could do nothing more than shake their head slowly in sheer disgust.<br/><br/>The really bad news is that this stinking turkey is to get a sequel - WHY? Has the cinema going public not suffered enough from this one. One predicts the murky world of straight to video may be the sequel's (better than deserved) fate.... I hope! Strictly a film for the bargain bin only, and then only if you cannot find your Alien ultimate box set or Predator DVD's."

The passing of time is well marked in this film and conflicts with the sequence of events. There is no time for what is shown to actually be occurring. If the minutes weren't counted for the viewer, maybe we could let this slide, but it drives me mad. The variations in size of the alien from one scene to the next is also irritating. The predators look good, although they are not portrayed as sharp as they should have been. And wasn't it established in the first Predator film that they come when it's really hot? Not every 100 years. The blatant disregard for all established information from the previous films drives me mad. Both story lines had great possibilities for a vs. film, and to just throw that all away for this ??? That, and why, oh why, is Bishop (Lance Henrikson) in this film? Hell, why not have Ripley ?

","I've put off watching Alien Vs Predator for a long time. I hold a great fondness for the first three Alien movies and regard the original Predator as one of the best Sci-fi action flicks ever made. I knew that AVP would be nothing compared to these classic films, and after the failure that was Alien Resurrection, I didn't want to be let down again.<br/><br/>However, one day whilst feeling particularly brave, I sat down and watched AVP, taking a deep breath at the start as if about to face an hour and a half of torture. <br/><br/>Sure enough, AVP was a poor film. The one dimensional characters and zero-point-five dimensional plot line proved my suspicions that this movie would fail to engage my interest. <br/><br/>Paul W.S Anderson fails to create any tension or excitement whatsoever. It's just a series of short, unsatisfying fight scenes, interspersed with a nonsensical script that just falls flat on every level. The human characters are without emotion or depth and even the Aliens, that were described in the first film as the ""perfect organism"", are reduced to nothing more than brainless, scuttling insects. Anderson also modifies the Alien life-cycle, so impregnation-incubation-chest bursting, all happens in a matter of minutes. AVP is the fast food take-away to the banquet that was Alien. <br/><br/>Redeeming factors are few and far between, but the occasional slow motion sequences, including leaping face-huggers and battling predators and aliens look great. The predators are armed to the teeth and more brutal than ever, and a final sequence involving the alien queen was impressive. <br/><br/>Alien Vs Predator was a bad movie, but what did I expect? When a film is made so unashamedly and exploitatively for profit, you have to be prepared for nonsense. I was initially worried that its tackiness would tarnish my memory of some classic cinema, but I am pleased to say however, that AVP is completely forgettable. <br/><br/>My advice is to not bother watching this movie. It is a complete waste of time. But if you feel you must give it a chance, don't spend any money on it and don't expect to be entertained. This way, you will get the most out of a terrible film that should never had been made."

","I saw AVP in theaters, the first Paul WS Anderson movie I see in a theater, and I love it. I love it, just that, is that simple. I will explain why, because I am sure many people will find this odd and extrange. As an AVP comic book collector that I am, is worth to say that this is a very good adaptation of the comic book with a nice touch of ancient history. Despite the silly dialogues and focus on the performance of Saana Lathan (she is just great, she is terrific, beautiful and an alien ass-kicker) and in Lance Henriksen (When he attacks the Predator with his breather). Also the creatures are nice too, well, not nice because they are slimy and some find them revolting, but they are cool, they are funny and they rock a lot, specially when they get together to have some fisting fun. If we add the great visual style of Anderson (more near from Event Horizon that from Resident Evil) and the re-introducing of our ""Queeny"" we have a good Sci Fi movie, based on two great franchises, that is not a sequel or a remake. Is another crossover that will not have sequel, so big deal, great job, well done Paul. At least you didn't try to direct Van Helsing."

Anderson's other movies (except Resident Evil), and he delivers what he should with this one too.<br/><br/>His script follows the both the alien and the predator-saga's pretty nicely, and it works well both as an alien prequel and third part in the predator series. I especially enjoy the scenes towards the end with only the predator and Alexa. Very close to the comic-books, and I liked that.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was better than I expected, and I hope for more sequels! There are some drawbacks though. It's far to little violence, it feels very bleak. Maybe the ""directors cut"" makes up for that. It actually also felt a bit slow sometimes, especially in the beginning. It could have been more character build-ups and back-stories woven into it. As it is now, it's a bit too straight forward.<br/><br/>However, the film works, it has some nice interesting things in it and it is well done.<br/><br/>The most major drawback however is that Antarctica doesn't look like Antarctica at all. OK, I haven't been there, but I know a few things about it. It's cold. VERY cold. We SHOULD see their breath! :-) THE THING from 1982 actually succeeds to make it look more like Antarctica than this movie does. It looks a bit like a studio, trying to look like Antarctica. ;-) Other than that, the film itself is fine. If you like Predator 2 and Aliens, you won't be disappointed.

The concept of the Predator is simply amazing...if you like geeky sci-fi...like I do.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything, the Aliens and Predators...are you sitting down...well, they fight!! This is a great special effects movie, and one that doesn't really flesh out the human characters. This is the kind of crap most people complain about. If I go to a movie called Alien Vs. Predator, chances are very high that I am watching the human characters to see the interesting ways that the Predator will dispose of them.<br/><br/>That being said, the guide, an actress who I have never heard of, actually does a good job in the film. She is the only human that does. Enough about humans. The Aliens are generally a grumpy crew, and the Predators are looking to hunt. What follows is a scene almost as grisly as my plate, after eating a 16 oz. Ribeye...rare.<br/><br/>If you like the franchises, and want to see a cool action movie, this is a must-see. If you want a sappy movie that captures the human spirit, please never talk to me."

","This was probably the best movie I have seen all summer!! The only thing that could have made it better would be if the girl and the alien had made out at the end. I mean, this movie had a classic love-story plot, but we never got the inter-species love pay-off. See, the best thing about AVP was that it really broke all the rules of good movie-making. I knew this movie was going to be good when none of the characters had names for the first half hour (or more!). And I was floored that they actually killed off everyone! Such balls! They just took the rules of good film-making and spit on them. And it worked! I don't think the writers even bothered to see if the plot made sense. Because frankly, I couldn't even list all the plot holes, they were so numerous! Amazing!"
"azrael24013","8","1","3","16 August 2005"," Great Lovecraftian And Pulp Material
","Literary Appeal - One thing that I'm not surprised about is that I've not heard any critics mention the setting and premise being close to H.P. Lovecraft's 'At the Mountains of Madness'. Lovecraft is considered to be basically the greatest horror writer of the 20th century, often called the 20th century Edgar Allan Poe; 'At the Mountains of Madness', one of his three novels, is considered to be his masterpiece. The Lovecraftian element of the film is something that will be ignored by almost everyone. In my opinion, this is one of the movie's strong points; the fact that the movie places the two most recognizable hostile ETs of pop culture together within this premise and setting. And the fact that this Lovecraft basis is esoteric.<br/><br/>Philosophical / Deeper Meaning Value - Most viewers also don't think about the darker and philosophical side of a movie like 'Alien', which is just as much Gothic horror as it is science fiction (like Lovecraft's work). In 'Avp', when the expedition team is standing at the mouth of the cave, no one even dares suggest that maybe ETs created the hole in the ground. I really liked this element, because it seems like real life; people don't want to be considered crazy for suggesting that they believe in the possibility of this reality. Lovecraft's mythos dealt greatly with the theme of mankind's small place in this vast universe, and the fact that most human beings ignore this...most people are probably just interested in the FX / rubber costumes and familiar hero characters. One article I remember reading in a paper, started with whining about how there was no Arnie or Sigourney, so the movie must be terrible.<br/><br/>The fact that the premise of the movie is based on a 'Chariots of the Gods' concept with the mixed-culture first civilization, is another strong point. And I've always liked the appeal of the Predator species being an ancient, advanced intelligent species that relies only on a primitive or basic society honor code to hold together their society.<br/><br/>Pulp Appeal - Not every movie is 'Citizen Kane' or 'Lawrence of Arabia'. 'AvP' is supposed to be a modern day 'Godzilla vs Mothra'; and it is a great rendition of this concept of film. It is not the most intelligent movie ever made. Part of the basis comes from video games and comic books, not Shakespeare, but it still manages to have some level of depth and intelligence while still appealing to 12-year-olds. Most comic book-based movies are just centered on action, and hero figures with fake values.<br/><br/>Production / Design - The flow of action and the storyline do move at a somewhat slow pace; this is one of the negative sides of the movie. But, the first 'Alien' film does too. And 'Predator', like 'Alien', does not reveal the creature until toward the end. Both are some of the best creature designs ever created. And the gestation of the Aliens was somewhat rushed; but if you think about it, maybe the Aliens were genetically engineered by the Predators to grow faster; they are certainly an advanced enough species. The eggs that were lying around inside the derelict craft in 'Alien' had been dormant for eons.<br/><br/>The set design of the underground ruins I thought was well crafted and designed, along with the awesome queen chamber reminiscent of the comic books. The scenes with the Predator craft descending from the sky were awesome. The action and battle scenes were well-executed and there was some level of unpredictability and suspense; but I agree with some critics who think there should have been a little more fighting between the two creatures. The queen fight sequence at the ending was excellent, and I like the way the female figure's role followed along with the comic series. The strongest horror element I think was the helplessness of the humans being trapped in the middle of the struggle.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give the movie about a 7.5 rating. A little bit of a slow and dry beginning. Some great esoteric appeal with the Lovecraftian basis (even though I'm not sure the team behind the movie intended this), some level of depth and intelligence if you look for it, and a good comic book-based movie."
"baba44713","2","1","3","13 July 2005"," Awful, awful, awful movie. Short though.
","My God, how this movie blows.<br/><br/>If you have any fond memories of previous Alien installments (even the atrocious Resurrection) don't go see this movie. If you are more of a Predator fan, don't go see this movie. Even if you are a fan of the AvP computer game, don't go see it. Actually you should see this movie only if you are under 13 and suffering severe ADD so the only thing that keeps you calm is constant action, jumping, flashing, firing and shouting, preferably for not much longer than an hour.<br/><br/>Which is precisely what this movie is - an extended computer game cut-scene with paper-thin characters who get killed off one by one in many boring ways including spears and alien tails, and mostly off-camera. There is some ""plot"", if you can call it that way, and it involves an ancient pyramid on the Antarctica which is used by Predators to hunt aliens for sport, and some humans who just happen to come by. We get introduced to this characters (human, that is) in the first few short expository scenes, and than they go to the pyramid to get slaughtered by whomever they come up first. Eighty minutes later film ends. With what's probably the stupidest ""shock"" ending of the 21st century.<br/><br/>This movie is the perfect example how a short movie with constant action can also be incredibly boring. I was mildly interested by the introduction, then yawned through the rest of it. It felt like I was watching a movie on fast-forward, which is not so strange, since almost every rule set by previous alien and predator movies is broken so the action wouldn't stop accidentally and the characters could get - God forbid - some depth.<br/><br/>Let me just give you an example what this movie expects are to buy - the gestation period of the alien is probably around 15 seconds, upon which he bursts from the abdomen and needs about 30 seconds more to achieve full growth. And predators are not that bad once you get to know them and kill some aliens in front of them. Blah.<br/><br/>See this movie only if you have about 80 minutes to kill, you've just popped the last bubble on that bubble-wrap and EVERYTHING else is already taken from the video store, including Freddy got fingered.<br/><br/>2/10, and only because I save the 1's for movies which make me physically attack my TV.<br/><br/>P.S. Oh, I forgot to mention that Bishop is in this movie. Ya know, the android from Aliens? Gee, now you MUST see this one, don't you?"
"gtc83","2","1","3","21 June 2005"," Four letters: D - U - M - B
","I went into this movie with a completely open mind, not knowing what to expect. I've liked, even loved most of the Alien and Predator films, and so I was moderately excited about this. In the first ten minutes, the die was cast; this is really not any better than any of those god-awful Sci-Fi Channel original productions. We start with out main character, a guide who takes various people through Antarctica. Everyone involved with this project is extremely concerned that she be the guide, because she's so good, and it's so important that they make it from the boat to the drilling site in complete safety. But the guide isn't satisfied that all possible safety precautions are being taken, so she threatens to quit. Everyone begs her to stay...oh, okay already. The movie is Alien vs. Predator, we're pretty darned aware that not all safety precautions are going to be taken. Give us credit for some intelligence already! Also, when they finally do need to get from the boat to the drilling site, they get in great big trucks and the trip takes about 30 seconds. And for this they needed a guide? Hello?!? And our marvelous guide even tells one woman that she shouldn't take a gun along. Oh yeah, this is the person we need leading us into the underground pyramid full of Aliens and Predators - little miss ""In all my years in the Antarctic I've never once needed a gun"". Sheesh! <br/><br/>And so now we get to the big underground pyramid and the Alien vs. Predator thing. I didn't know what to expect, but when the fights finally happened, I was appalled. These fights were just so incredibly childish and stupid, like crap that some 12 year old kid would think was really cool. I mean, they just swipe a scene from Robocop 2 and there you go, that's the big fight. Remember when Robocop 2 grabbed Robocop by the feet and swung him around, banging his head into various immovable objects? That's about it folks. Then there's a scene where an Alien sneaks up behind a Predator, but because he's the really cool Predator, he somehow senses the Alien's presence and swings around and decapitates him - the trouble being that you could see it coming a mile away. Soooooo predictable. At one point, a Predator takes a dead Alien's claw and uses the acid in it to etch a symbol into his helmet. Now, anybody with even half a brain in their head would figure out that this was some sort of rite of passage for the young Predator, but of course the movie assumes that everyone only has one-quarter of a brain, so they have a character explain this for the benefit of all us morons in the audience. Talk about pathetic. And don't even get me started on all the scenes where a face hugger flies through the air, but luckily the camera cuts to a slow-motion shot just in time for somebody to whip out a gun or a big spinning knife thing and cut it in half. This is the kind of trash that Charlie's Angels parodied. <br/><br/>And as if that's not enough, let's spend a moment on the characters. What has always set the Alien and Predator movies above all their imitators are the characters. Sigourney Weaver and Arnold Schwarzenegger were at the head of great casts in these things. Everyone vividly remembers the rest of the crew of the Nostromo and the Colonial Marines from Aliens. Everyone remembers Jesse Ventura and the rest of the guys from Arnold's commando squad in Predator. Heck, even most of the characters in Predator 2 were quite unique and interesting. Well, forget that. There really are no characters in this movie, just completely generic clichés without an ounce of personality between them. The main character is annoying, the rest are just walking dialog annunciators, though they do manage to annoy somewhat anyways. I can't even imagine ANYONE caring if every last one of these folks get killed off. <br/><br/>All in all, this thing was the most amazingly stupid, dumbed down movie I think I've ever seen. Even garbage like The Hulk at least gave the audience credit for being able to figure out the plot without having to have each event explained to them via expository dialog immediately after it happened. My god, what a complete and worthless failure of a movie. This one's for 12 year old geeks who spend their whole lives on the internet at various Star Trek and Star Wars sites, drooling over pictures of starships and junk like that."
"FRANKDRAFTING","8","1","3","10 June 2005"," Not as bad as they say
","I enjoyed this movie. I felt the special effects were good and while it does not compare to the tension built in Alien, I think it has its moments. I don't think it was meant to be a sci-fi masterpiece as much as a comic book quality thrill ride. The battle scenes are interesting and some of the scenery on the ice breaker at the start of the movie is very effective. Don't buy into the negativity. It's not ""Citizen Kane"" and it's not ""Frankenstein"". It's not meant to be, but it IS fun and that's what I want out of my sci-fi movies. Keep an open mind, and do not expect the thrills you received in Alien. The first time around is always the best, but this is still pretty good stuff!"

"JakeTheSnake106","8","1","3","18 May 2005"," AvP, Entertaining but has its flaws...
","AvP...didn't live up to my expectations, but was entertaining nonetheless. I feel that it lacked likable characters, a concept of time (For instance a lady gets a face hugger on her, then literally a few minutes later she chestbursts), a good storyline (The pyramid idea was interesting but I guess I would have rather seen maybe a story from one of the comic books rather than it), a good predator costume (The special effects in this movie were top notch in my opinion except for the actual face of the predator. I thought that it looked better in 1987 with the first predator movie), BLOOD! (This was the only movie in the whole Alien or Predator franchise to be rated PG-13. When Ewen Bremner's character Miller chestbursted and the predator caught the chestburster and snapped its neck there was no blood on that thing at all.) <br/><br/>I also did not like the idea that two of the three predators in the movie were dead within the first ten minutes of fighting. Then the third predator (Scar) ended up being a good guy and working with Lex (Lathan). I feel that that was a false image of the predator, if you look at the first two movies they were ruthless killers.<br/><br/>Regardless of anything that I said previously I liked the movie just for the fact of seeing both the Alien and the Predator in the same frame. I have been waiting to see this since I read the first Alien Vs. Predator comic book. Even know I was somewhat disappointed, I'm still glad that it was made."
"Metal133","3","1","3","13 May 2005"," 10 reasons why Anderson rips 2 of my favorite franchises apart with AVP
","I LOVE Predator, Alien, and Aliens. I thought Predator 2 was a decent film, same with Alien 3 (although I'm hearing the Quadrilogy version is amazing), and Alien Resurrection wasn't too bad... until the end... ANYWAY, Paul W.S. Anderson completely annihilated both franchises in the making of this movie In my opinion. 1st off, Most of the actors were terrible, as opposed to Predator and the 1st two Aliens which in those cases that was some of the best acting I've seen on film. 2nd, Anderson Fails to develop the actors, we know nothing of what they act like, their personality, all the characters just seem to be there getting killed (I don't even think I can name one person's name in the movie besides Sabastian, Alexa, and Mr. Weyland). 3rd, THERE IS NO SUSPENSE! In two Predator movies, there is a lot of suspense, especially during the scenes when the Predator kind of ""mimicks"" the actors voices. Stuff like that didn't happen at all. No scary moments to keep you on the edge of your seat, nothing of that matter. There's just senseless fighting. 4th, Anderson really messed up with the Alien lifecycle (dont understand what I'm saying? then listen) In the old Alien movies, it took DAYS (or long hours) for the chestbuster bust out of the chest. When it happens in AVP, it takes several minutes, in fact, the manly woman wakes up and gets chest busted in like 20 seconds. Also, it takes some time for the Aliens to grow too, which in the movie seemed to fly by... I kept a count on how many Alien's were killed and whatnot, and well it seems that more aliens are killed than there were humans (if you've seen the past Alien movies, you'd know this is impossible because there needs to be human hosts for the facehuggers to grow into Aliens). 5th, as said in the past Predator movies and I quote from Predator ""It happens during the hottest summers"" and I can't remember how many times in Predator 2 I've heard people say ""its hot"" or ""heat wave"" etc. Meaning the Predators usually stay around the hottest of places, well.... ANTARTICA! 6th, Also I'm sorry but, I think there should have been a little more gore and violence for a Alien and Predator movie, I mean, all the Aliens and Predators were rated R. 7th, The Predator THROWS his self destruct armbar into the hive... well, isn't this a crock of sh*t. Predator is supposed to go down when he knows he's lost, if he uses the self destruct, he's supposed to explode with it, which leads me on to 8. In Predator, the self destruct only took about what? a minute to destruct? two tops? yeah, it's the same here, but... Alexa and the Predator are deep in the hive beneath the pyramid also, under Antarctican(word?) soil. Somehow, it takes them 2 minutes to run out of the hive, escape from the pyramid, run down the many steps, run through the underground, and back to the motorized cart that takes them up to the top of Antarctica. 9th, When the movie ends, Alexa is left on Antarctica with NO ONE around... 10th, During a lot of the action scenes, the camera moves around way too much, so therefore I can't see what is going on. It looks like one big blur. Basically an overview, Anderson should have done more studying up no the film before he decided to make it or write the screenplay. once again, the characters are underdeveloped, the movie contrasts the past movies, there is no suspense which leaves you bored at times, the actors aren't the greatest... And I think they would have done a much better job if fox went with Peter Briggs script(Hellboy), which was WAY better. Also I'm hearing of an AVP2 now, I hope they get someone like Ridley Scott(Alien), James Cameron(Aliens), David Fincher(Alien3), John McTiernnan(Predator), or even Stephen Hopkins(Predator 2) to write the script or direct. Because Paul W.S. Anderson rushed into it, and didn't know what he was doing. <br/><br/>PS I cant go out without saying at least SOMETHING good about it can I? Well, some of the few fight scenes were pretty cool, and most people complain that the Predator teams up with Alexa, which I'm not saying is good, but it didn't bother me (however in the comic, Predator does team up with a chick, AND, if you notice in both Predator movies, the Predator not once kills a female...) And that's really all I have to say."
"Hector_The_Toad","9","1","3","15 May 2005"," Why this great movie has been criticized so much.
","Being a fourteen year old male, I realize the legendary Alien and Predator movies will never be rivaled by a modern day exercise in action, adventure, special-effects and overall great film making. However, having watched Alien, Aliens, Predator and Predator 2, I believe Alien Vs Predator matches these four movies in grandeur. I also think that AVP has been given an unfair time by the critics. I believe these factors are responsible: THE 'VS' TAG: Any film with a 'versus' in its title indicates it is going to be a rip off of two other successful creations and after numerous Godzilla vs. films from Japan and the fun but highly unintelligent Freddy Vs. Jason, AVP was immediately shunned.<br/><br/>DOESN'T MATCH THE ORIGINALS: And what sequel can? However, AVP does a pretty damn good job of it. The originals were more adult films and this one appeals to teenagers also.<br/><br/>finally CREDIBILITY: Alien and Predator pitted against each other? Sounds stupid? Not really. Two extraterrestrial species against each other in an unlikely area that has not been explored at all is an excellent premise for a science-fiction movie.<br/><br/>In short, AVP is a great action movie that does justice to the originals. Its harsh reviews are by biased critics who cannot fault the originals and are not open minded to new and improved films."
"MrNils","3","1","3","7 May 2005"," special effects were good but plot, acting and execution all lacked
","The movie was based off of an idea which had a lot of potential, but it was one of those ideas that had to be done right or else it would be terrible. Well they sure didn't do it right and they failed on many other things besides the plot as well. Even the cinematography was poor at times.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to start on the plot because i could go on about that for hours because of how ridiculous it was. I was laughing through out the entire movie because of the story and because of the way things lined up within the story. I will mention the biggest downfalls i found and why.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* kind of<br/><br/>The first major downfall of the movie is the very beginning where they immediately make the movie look like a cheap horror flick. The man runs through the town with no help being chased by an unknown fiend and eventually gets cornered and killed. The very first scene of the movie and i was already cringing.<br/><br/>The second major downfall was having a pyramid 2000 feet below the surface on Antarctica that was made by, not one ancient race, but three all putting in their special styles like some sort of co-op architecture project. I found this to be completely ridiculous along with the fact that these archaeologists knew all three of the ancient hieroglyphs.<br/><br/>The Third and by far the worst is the relationship between the Girl main character(i don't even know her name) and the predator. Girl gives predator gun. Predator walks away. Girl yells at him for walking away with out her. He makes a spear and shield for her out of a dead alien. The run away into battle together like a couple of old buddies would. For some reason i don't buy it. Their relationship continued to be dumb through out the rest of the movie and for a minute there i thought they were going to kiss. if any thing destroyed the movie it was this. I'm not saying that the predators can't be sympathetic, because they were at least in the second one after the main character killed one of their own, they saw he was a great warrior and spared his life. But that doesn't mean that they would join up arms with one just because she gave him his gun back.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, don't. Inless you are going to watch it with your friends specifically to make fun of it. I think that a 12 year-old would enjoy this movie, but once you start getting any more mature than that it makes you want to cry. I love both the Alien series and the predator series, even the game is awesome. But this movie lacked all the elements that made those movies good besides the good effects. 3 out of 10 stars"

","For some reasons 'Alien vs. Predator' has a bad name. Critics did not like the film. or maybe the idea of bringing together in one movie horror characters from two different flick series does not seem too original. Maybe so, but it was done before, and will be done more, I am sure. The film is not by far as bad as they say and I expected. I am a fan of the genre, and I would see almost all that was and will be put on screen in this genre, but 'Allien vs. Predator' has a consistent story, is not too difficult to follow, effects are OK, and the graphics are average plus. The original 'Alien' design was by the famous Swiss artist Giger, and the following films in the series including this one kept the cool repulsiveness of the original designs. Director Paul Anderson does not fall much from his original 'Mortal Kombat' and 'Resident Evil'. Main actress Sanaa Lathan is no Halle Berry, but I doubt that Halle Berry could have extracted much more from this role. The problem with the rest of the actors is the fact that they spend too little time on screen, and we do not really get to know them beyond the cliché, or even less. This is probably the main problem of the film - despite belonging to the horror-sci-fi genre it never succeeds to make the viewer too involved or too afraid. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","Why can't we just sit down, get comfy and just simply enjoy a monster movie? I know all the Alien movies by heart. I know the Predator movies by heart.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the idea of the 2 meeting each other. I could not decide ""WHO"" would win. I mean..... who could decide between an acid bleeding/spitting being with superb intelligence and survival instincts versus an invisible being with protection against such defenses? Simply because I did not enjoy Predator 2, I assumed that the Alien Queen would win the day. Some time ago ( I forget the year), I became confused about how the Queen survived, until after multiple watchings of all the alien movies, I eventually figured out how she survived. I am slow to get things in perspective sometimes and am not ashamed to admit it.<br/><br/>Anyway, here I am, facing a movie about 2 great alien monsters. I assumed the Alien would win, and even tho there may be purists out there that believe the Queen ruled the day, I reckon Predator kicked the ALien queen into oblivion (sorta!!1).<br/><br/>Paul W Anderon remained true to the whole saga of Alien. He paid the highest respect to his predecessors and did a fantastic job. AND he made the Predator better than before - Bigger, better, smarter, nastier etc etc etc AND he made Geigers Alien even better than before too!.<br/><br/>I read the reviews of AVP and decided I was not going to see it. I did because of other circumstances and I am so very glad that I did. I really do not care that there are holes or mistakes in continuity here and there. Within the first few minutes of AVP I found myself questioning certain things but placed them aside. Sometimes, you just have to suspend belief or practical knowledge and just get ON with enjoying the movie.. AND ignore the critics !<br/><br/>I give AVP 10 out of 10 for sheer enjoyment value."

It just can't work, neither of them is scary anymore and even worse this film lacks what could've been it's ONLY minor saving grace (you know, keeping me from walking out of the theater)- relentless violence and gore. It's nothing more than a sterile, Disney-style version of an even far superior comic book series. Both franchises are dead, and neither should be resurrected (no, not even by Ridley Scott). Just like 50-something rockers shouldn't reform and tarnish a great bands legacy. Let's stop the raping.

Yet this movie actually pulls it off. I went in thinking this is going to be a B movie at best, and came out of it wanting more. The likelihood of a sequel is slim, and I think the idea is only a carry over of the utter blowing away of my expectations. Now that I think more about it, I don't even remember questioning whether there were holes in the plot. That is something I usually do in movies like this. This movie was entertaining enough to force me to overlook the whole ""let's pick this apart"" type approach. It was surprisingly enjoyable."

"Brent_P","2","1","3","6 March 2005"," What happened here?
","Well, Paul W. Anderson just killed two of my favorite movie franchises in one foul swoop. I'm sure AVP looked good on paper or even sounded sweet in theory, but in the end it just doesn't match.<br/><br/>There was so many continuity and plot problems, I'll just stick to the basics because there is a 1,000 word limit here. The plot was a bit of a stretch. Basically, Predators having been harvesting Aliens for centuries in a pyramid located in current Antartica. The Predators used humans as slaves and hosts for the Aliens, in which the Predators would hunt for skill every 100 years. Now, a group of scientists have discovered the pyramid as the Predators planned out, jump started the process too early and started an underground squabble with Aliens. Now, if Aliens have been the ultimate adversary for centuries, why were the Predators wasting their time with inferior humans in the previous two movies? And, since the Predators like to hunt, why are they harvesting Aliens and hunting them in a controlled environment? <br/><br/>Too put in bluntly, this movies was WAY rushed. It is barely 90 minutes, and by the time the action starts it ends. The action scenes were the least bit dramatic, completely relying on unrealistic CGI sequences. Since when do 300lb+ Predator preform spin moves in mid-air like an Olympic ice skater? There was also no suspense factor which makes up most of the previous Alien movies. An Alien stalking a Predator is just not that suspenseful. The continuity with the Aliens was a debacle. The first human host had an Alien bust out of her rib cage in 5 minutes and the Alien was full grown in 10 minutes. The previous movies took hours. Another problem was the fact that there was more Aliens than hosts. The Predators didn't seem all that prepared either, with the majority of their weapons melting from the Aliens acid like blood. These invisible, stalking Predators that have been battling these Aliens for decades and can travel at the speed of light and create a weapon that's acid proof? But, if you're not really picky, the last 10 minutes put the bow on this beautiful gift. The last Predator puts their differences aside with humans and teams up with a woman to conquer the Queen Alien hand and hand with a Alien tail for a spear and an Alien head for a shield (don't ask.) The idea of it was bad enough and now seeing it will probably give me nightmares. After all is said and done, you treated to a glimpse of a possible sequel with a half Predator and half Alien creature sprouting out his gullet.<br/><br/>What this movie needed was a better director, more plausible screenplay and a little bit more time put into to it. I would only recommend this film for die hard sci-fi action buffs."
"ichabod81","6","1","3","18 February 2005"," A lesson learned.
","And that lesson is that if you don't expect anything, you might be positively surprised. Like I was. I really hated the idea of Anderson making this film, since he's like a studio pet to me. If the financiers want a PG-rating in order to perform better at the box office, he's the guy they call (Resident Evil, anyone?). Yet, Anderson managed to pull it off this time and I'm man enough to admit if I've been wrong. And I was wrong on this. AvP rocks.<br/><br/>Of course I would've preferred it if AvP had been more towards gore, like the original Predator or Aliens and Alien3, but it works the way it is. Anderson continues his trend plot outline in AvP which features a bunch of people getting in trouble in a hostile environment (Event Horizon and Resident Evil).<br/><br/>Most importantly, the thing that made me happy in Alien vs. Predator is that they were respectful to the original characters. The predators are as bada** as ever and the aliens are slimy and brilliant. Plus the action scenes kick a** and the effects are great enough to support them. Hooray! <br/><br/>**** / *****"

","Well sir, I don't like it. This may, MAY contain a possible spoiler, so that's why I have a warning up here... not that it really matters, as there really isn't a damn thing in this film that's redeemable.<br/><br/>I'll make it easy, here are the good points: -Decent looking aliens. -Some very mild violence, some fairly interesting fight scenes. -None of Paul Anderson's bloody techno music.<br/><br/>Didn't hurt it, didn't help it: <br/><br/>-Very standard 3-D Animation. <br/><br/>-Nothing new about the Aliens. <br/><br/>-People die. <br/><br/>-Decent special effects--no better than ""Aliens,"" although sometimes they seem ""not as good."" -Mildly interesting story--but--<br/><br/>The BAD: - <br/><br/>--the story lists 3 ancient civilizations, including the Aztec--claiming they built the pyramids in Mexico, when in fact, those structures were built by the MAYA, and the Aztec simply took over many, many years after the Maya disappeared. <br/><br/>-Story is loosely explained, as if it was made for a child to follow fairly well, and think is ""cool.""<br/><br/>-Story centers on an archeaological expedition to Antarctica--a land with no native human population to fear--what's with all the machine guns and assault weapons?? (Note: I was watching my kid run around screaming, so if it was mentioned & I missed it, it wasn't decently explained it would seem) <br/><br/>-Crappy acting. <br/><br/>-Uninteresting, uninspired characters with no depth--when they die, you just don't care. <br/><br/>-Use of, God help us, Bullettime during a scene with face-huggers. Yes, Hollywood's cheapest trend badgered it's way into the Alien/Predator franchises. <br/><br/>-Dialogue apparently ceases after the first third of the film.<br/><br/>And the Ugly Nasties: <br/><br/>-Yup, it's PG-13--and I watched the so-called ""Unrated"" extended version--it's still harmless, PG-13, kiddie trite.<br/><br/>-Use of the ""F-Word"" a whopping one time. <br/><br/>-18 ounces of human blood, no human-related gore whatsoever, and that means-- <br/><br/>-NO CHEST-BURSTING &<br/><br/>-NO STRUNG-UP, STRIPPED AND MUTILATED HUMAN CORPSES, A LA ""PREDATOR""<br/><br/>-Several Predators suddenly seem to be 9 feet tall for no reason. <br/><br/>-The Alien Queen is also grossly over-sized. <br/><br/>-The intelligence of the Aliens, which we witnessed in all prior films, is now relegated to that of ""really smart jungle cats."" <br/><br/>-More than once, a weapon is pierced into an Alien--and the acid blood queerly causes it no harm. <br/><br/>-An insult to those of us that are adults and grew up with the Alien and Predator franchises, despite the relatively crappy Alien: Resurrection and Predator 2--at least they were still R-Rated. <br/><br/>-Remember that horror-film hint you get from previous films, where everything was introduced gradually to build tension? None of that here. -Face huggers have suddenly gone from spending a couple days on someone's face to a mere couple minutes. <br/><br/>-Young Aliens are born in a couple ""hours"" rather than a couple ""days."" <br/><br/>-Young Aliens become adults, apparently, if you blink more than once while looking at them. <br/><br/>-Little story continuity--people get separated constantly, but you're never quite sure how, or for that matter, where they are, and then they die--but you never liked any of them anyway. <br/><br/>-Lead female character will set back Women's Lib about 20 years with her dullness and occasional incompetence--she's unlikable. <br/><br/>-Predator - human alliance? No thanks.<br/><br/>-Several Predators seem infinitely strong, while Alien numbers seem to grow unchecked--and unexplained--there weren't nearly enough humans around to make all these adult Aliens.<br/><br/>The one surprise I didn't mind: <br/><br/>-Predalien--although, it's host was stabbed through the torso, and thus, the creature should have died...<br/><br/>I watched this movie for free (checked out from a Library) and if you're interested in it, I suggest you do the same, it's really not worth paying for. You're brain will pay for it while you watch it. Alien 3 was head and shoulders above this. Hell, so was Resurrection and extremely cheesy Predator 2.

"ryan_kuhn","2","1","3","13 February 2005"," ""You're one ugly mother..."" movie.
","Hollywood is not the most loved segment of the American population, and it's formulaic, ""lets make a movie just to make money"" movies like Alien vs. Predator that continues the dislike. There was no reason to combine two scientific franchises, independently popular, into this gross monstrosity of a convoluted plot of a money machine. Not since the Flintstones met the Jetsons has there been a weaker crossover than this. I'll give the movie some credit, they came up with the most reasonable reason for the aliens from the ""Alien"" movies to meet the aliens from ""Predator"" movies. We find that over the millions of years that the two ""civilizations"" have existed in this vast universe, the Predators have hunted the Aliens (I know they're all aliens, but I'll refer to them based on which movie that were in for my own benefit) on various planets. To save the planet from the aliens for sure, but mainly, I think the predators hunt the aliens for sport; it's like shooting fish in a barrel. There are loads of actors who I have never heard of before, and based on their performance, will never hear of them again. Paul W. S. Anderson is responsible for this movie, in more ways than he should legally be allowed, he directed it, wrote it, and produced it, as well as probably walked the movie to each multiplexed. At least that's the impression I got from the credits, which Anderson may now hold a record for most times mentioned in a single set of credits. The movie is sloppy, the effects look like computerized effects.... from 1985. And what mother would let their boy or girl go to Antarctica in the middle of winter without their hats and gloves? Come on, really? This wave of smashing popular movie franchises together appears to have no end in sight. With that in mind, here's a brief list of movies coming to a multiplex near you: Darth Vader vs. Hannibal Lecter, Daffy Duck vs. Donald Duck (we saw a preview of that classic duel in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?), Drego (Rocky IV) vs. Mr. T (Rocky III), and the one I can't wait for, Mary Poppins vs. Maria Von Trapp (The Sound of Music), where my money is on Julie Andrews. Hey, at least after Freddie vs. Jason and Alien vs. Predator, these movie match-ups can only be an improvement."
"siektwo","3","1","3","28 January 2005"," wow what a waste...
","First off...i cannot describe how OFFENDED I am. This movie was such a terrible letdown, that it makes Freddy VS Jason seem like Star Wars (allthough Freddy VS Jason really wasn't a bad movie for what it was).<br/><br/>Lets see, you take two of the top sci-fi creatures EVER and put them together to fight? Sounds awesome huh? That's where the phrase, ""sounds too good to be true"" comes into play.<br/><br/>I simply don't understand how by mixing two sci-fi legends (aliens and predators) which span from a total of 6 R-Rated films ends up with the result being a PG-13 Rated kiddie fest full of CG and unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>Alien, Aliens, Predator, and Predator 2 were great sci-fi/action type films. I never enjoyed the last two Alien films though, but 4 for 6 isn't bad at all when you're talking about sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>After readin in Fangoria (Paul Andersen interview), i got pretty excited hearing all the ideas. Paul was talking about decapitations, chest bursting, lots of goo and blood. When the film hits theaters it becomes a watered down kids movie? NOT COOL for the fans.<br/><br/>The lack of quality blood/gore isn't the only problem here either. We've been watching Predator go toe to toe against marines and Arnold along with drug lords in LA. He shows NO MERCY. All of the sudden in AVP, we get a predator with a ""soft spot"" in his heart for a female human and they ""save the day"" together....awww, isn't that cute? SOMEBODY SHOOT ME."
"MirrorPete","3","1","3","25 January 2005"," Been done, and much better
","Coming out about 15 years too late, Alien vs. Predator gives us a skeletal version of a concept we've actually seen already. If you were the type to care at all about Aliens fighting Predators, then you've already read the comic, played the game, or written your own fanfic about it. The big-screen version adds little to the tired mythologies of both franchises, and any attempts at trying make the conflict work in both universes -- like the revelation that Predators have influenced human development -- come across as pure cheese.<br/><br/>Not to mention it's sloppy. The modern-day setting isn't used at all (at times, it even feels like it's set in the Alien-universe future, even though it's not). Fans of either franchise will fret at the tons of retcon, including the Predators-as-gods crap and very short Alien gestation times (except for the last one, which is never explained). There's also a notable goof where not one of the humans exploring the ""sacrificial chamber"" seems to notice the extremely large, fang-filled skull lying on one of the ""beds."" This doesn't even match up with the flashbacks that show humans, not Predators, being sacrificed to breed Aliens.<br/><br/>AvP: A very poor realization of something that was once considered a cool concept."
"ZanarkandBlitz7","3","1","3","21 January 2005"," Fun? Yes. Good Movie Overall? Not really.
","The over-all CONCEPT of this movie is pretty decent, and I really liked how Anderson intertwined the two creatures. I do agree with what most people say about how Hollywood is running out of new ideas so they just mix and match popular things from the past and make something ""new"". That really bothers me. However, this movie could have had potential, but it just didn't take the cake. However, There are little things that made it fun to watch. I urge fans of the previous movies to watch AVP and note the psychical characteristic of the two creatures. For example, ever wonder why the Predator wears a mask? They have their little computer heat sensor thing in there right? But what else could it be good for? Hrmmm... protection against the little face hugger things maybe? I found that to be rather clever. As I said before, the little things about this movie make it a good popcorn flick, and a fun analisys of the Aliens and Predators themselves. Forget about the story, the actors (and their bad acting), and the huge pyramid (which I agree is a complete rip off of ""Cube""... Anderson likes to rip off ""Cube"", he ripped it off in ""Resident Evil"" also....Moron... Note the Predator's net, its also stolen from ""Cube""). Overall, this is a forgettable movie that will end up on the shelves as another 99 cent buy. For those who are interested because you are fans, focus more on the actual clash between the two creatures. Its fun to see how stuff kinda makes sense if you were to bring them together."

","Alien vs. Predator had the potential to be the best film of the lot. An interesting concept, smart back story and adequate special effects could have made this a blockbuster. Sadly, this will not happen. Where to begin with this movie? First, 87 minutes was too short to properly establish the movie. Basically, it starts off with who's who and next thing you know they are in Anarctica. OK, that's fine. This isn't a think piece. But in an action film, action is required. The title of the movie was Alien vs. Predator. As I sat in the theater watching this piece of crap I thought I was watching the live action scooby doo movie. Thirty minutes of the movie was spent with the cast wandering around the temple falling through trap doors and falling walls. If I wanted to see The Haunting I would have rented it. We get about 5 minutes of Predators vs. Aliens. What a waste! I have two major complaints besides the lack of action. First, how quickly the scientist figured out what was going on. That's phony and secondly, why are the plasma cannons hidden in the temple. That's just stupid. The most interesting part of the movie was the last 30 seconds. I just hope they get someone else to write that movie."

","Many people like myself check the rumor mills and online for any news on movies like this. Being a Big Jason Vorhees fan who hated Jason X and loved the old character and liked Freddy some expected a lot from Jason Vs Freddy and it deliver. Being said I am a huge Predator Fan. The first predator movie is a classic to me. I like Aliens as well.<br/><br/>The movie was made for one reason MONEY $$$$$.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was rushed and didn't make much sense. After seeing how good the predator hunts in the 1987 original I expect a lot from them and 2 out of 3 of them are killed within 3 minutes on the screen. The third one then teams up with the last human alive to battle and kill the aliens they breed for hunting. The characters have no good lines and are not memorable at all. The female lead is a horrible scaled down version of Signori Weaver's original character. <br/><br/>The PG 13 rating will make Fox a lot of money, but it made me feel like I was watching a movie on TV and all the good stuff was edited out. Its like seeing your fav dirty comedy on TV and all the stuff is edited or voiced over and your feel incomplete.<br/><br/>Besides the fact there really is no over the top Big Battle, they really isn't any long Fights between Aliens and Predators. <br/><br/>There is a scene in the end when the woman is running from the Queen Alien that reminds me of Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>I felt the woman and the Predator became friends too damn fast after the Predator killed off the rest of the group. I even thought they might of made the beast with two backs.<br/><br/>This short movie jumped right into the pyramid and never left, and Fox did it again the Predator in this movie is like Jar Jar binks. It ruined the movie and hurt the franchise. If you want a good time Rent Predator (1987) or the original Alien. If you want to Spend $10 on a ticket and another $12 or soo on food and throw away $20 some bucks Check it out.<br/><br/>I hated the movie, but did notice a few 11/12 year olds coming out saying it was ""cool"".

","Well, I'll try to keep this one spoiler free. <br/><br/>Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. I saw the movie for free, I feel ripped off. <br/><br/>The movie lacks action, suspense, drama, plot, unique and interesting characters, or even any real point. I almost think that the writers and directors never once saw the original films, and only based their movie on, say, Alien Res. and Predator 2. Perhaps Predator for the NES instead. Or maybe the movie posters for the films. I don't know, don't want to know.<br/><br/>The fundamental problem in the movie is that it was almost trying to be mysterious. As if we didn't know what either Predators or Aliens were all about. Most of the action is out of the corner of the eye and fading away, so you're left to your imagination to visualize the gore that happens and they didn't use the Visual Effects Budget on. <br/><br/>The effects themselves are very, very dated. In the largest Aliens scene, they just duplicated the same effect. There is very little new here that wasn't seen in past movies in the way of effects. In fact, there isn't much in the way of effects that hasn't crawled its way into movies over the last 15 or so years. <br/><br/>There is not a character that could not be summed up entirely in more than a sentence. In a lot of cases, no more than 3 words would be needed, such as ""Cocky Warrior Woman"" or ""Explorer turned Fighter."" I don't mean this in a good way of distilling them down... that is literally all you will get on that character. <br/><br/>I could probably rant on longer, but hopefully you get the point. If you really want to see this movie, I'd say save yourself some disappointment, go rent a copy of Aliens and a copy of Predator, and imagine what'd it be like if they met. What you come up with will be better than what you'd see in the theaters. Even if it's the Predator and the Queen sitting down to a couple of beers and playing a game of Texas Hold Em.

There is no suspense what so ever, the direction is weak, the actors have nothing interesting to do, I can't remember the script but judging by the quotes on IMDb it is very ""special"", the story is at best a doodle on a beer mat, the structure and pacing are bad, not ALL the blame can be levelled at fox. <br/><br/>The film missed the point on so many levels, aimed at 13 year olds who have no connection with the originals, and alienates those who may have cared about two of cinemas greatest creature creations in three previously excellent films (Alien, Aliens and Predator, no, and no again Alien 3, any film that treats its predecessor with so little respect deserves no respect itself, although it becomes a master piece in comparison and finally the awful Alien Resurrection Joss Wheedon and Jean-Pierre Jeunet what were you thinking?)<br/><br/>If Ridley Scott and James Cameron were dead their graves would have to be cleared for take off as their coffins span out of the ground into the stratosphere (Goodness only knows what Giger makes of it all, should he have had the displeasure of loosing 101 minutes of his life watching this). <br/><br/>It wastes great concepts (A CGI Alien Queen! Models maybe expensive and old fashioned but can be sooo much more effective, in any case the queen scene was uninspired) and creates whole new stupid ones, an Alien Predator half breed!!!? <br/><br/>In conclusion your Honour, this mess is a wasted opportunity with little to recommend it, although it does have the same fascination involved in watching a slow boring car crash."
"zor_prime","3","1","4","29 November 2005"," AVP: Another Vile Prequel...
","Yet another prequel that shouldn't have been...<br/><br/>I recently bought this title (mainly since it was on sale for $14.98 at Wal-Mart). I am a really big Aliens fan (Aliens being by far, the best of the Alien movies), but I hadn't heard reviews of AVP from anyone I trust. It was a gamble to buy it.<br/><br/>Well, I've only watched it once, and I'd have to say it had the same intrigue as say... Predator 2. Marginally interesting on the merit of it's major characters (of course by major characters I mean the aliens and predators) and pretty decent CG/special effects, I wouldn't call it mandatory viewing (even for Alien or Predator movie, or Darkhorse Comic fans). Just as with the comics, some of the ideas in the film explain issues that come out of the other Alien and Predator movies (which is nice), but unlike the comic, the movie just lacked the substance that intrigues me as a fan of the series.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see Lance Henriksen in yet ANOTHER Aliens movie (although I like the actor, I believe it was kind of a bad decision to include him in the cast of this film). Yes, I do understand the connection his character has to all of the Aliens movies, I just think it was kind of sukc. I am something of a fan of Paul W. S. Anderson's work as well (Resident Evil, Event Horizon), but this was pretty bland. I would have to say that Resident Evil: Apocalypse had the same level of appeal. Just an example of a great idea with a pretty good storyline that was put together terribly, giving the film experience that Mortal Kombat sort-of cheesiness. I'm not sure I am happy to have bought the title. I would rather have spend the same money to put Alien Quadrillogy on layaway or something, heh.<br/><br/>As Hank Rollins said recently in his IFC show Henry's Film Corner: ""What happens when you take two R-rated, very successful franchises, and hybridize them together? You get a PG-13-rated piece-of-crap film called Aliens vs. Predator..."" ... I'd have to agree."
"maw212","2","1","4","18 November 2005"," Too predictable
","I awaited the release of AVP since Fangoria magazine released some of its script, but it was too ""high budget"" at the time (mid-1990's). Years later my excitement turned to severe disappointment due to the movie's lack of a strong plot. The characters were okay, the plot too predictable, left us hanging for a part 2 (I'll hold my breath) and what the movie lacked in substance tried weakly to make up with stunning CG effects (the only redeeming qualities of this film). All in all, I pray that whoever directs the next one will have a hell of a lot more of an imagination.<br/><br/>It also seems that the beginning of this new millinium brought forth a sudden surge of ""Dime-a-dozen directors presents...blah...blah...blah..."" more already been done hack job movies such as The Grudge same as The Ring...same as Gothica...etc( Sixth Sense was a more toned down Stir of Echoes). or EVEN WORSE !!! REMAKES!!! I mean come on!!! Remaking films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville Horror, Herby the Lovebug, Bad News Bears...well you get the point (I hope)... Has it ALL been done? No one in Hollywood has an original creative thought anymore. Nothing fresh, new and exciting? Let's dig up an old B-movie add more whistles and bells, more CG effects and feed it to the masses...and...and...and...Please whatever Divine forces out there DON'T LET THEM REMAKE CRAPPY MOVIES such as ERASUREHEAD, MORTUARY or another Dracula !!!! <br/><br/>What happened to creative genius or what movies used to be...works of art?"
"filmbuff-36","6","1","4","8 September 2005"," Fun monster action from two popular series, but human scenes and isolated settings dampen the show
","Movies made for fanboys are often a disappointing enterprise, but such is not always the case. Every now and then, a studio manages to get something right, especially when the premise is so intriguing it would be nearly impossible for it to fail.<br/><br/>Nearly. ""Alien vs. Predator"" is a testament to the durability of both film series, not quite the best realization of the idea, but still a very entertaining movie. Where it lacks the suspense of the earlier films, it makes up for in a sheer pleasure of witnessing a long awaited grudge match.<br/><br/>The Weyland Company has recently discovered an ancient pyramid located 2000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. Company CEO Charles Weyland(Lance Henriksen) has gathered together a team of explorers and adventurers to excavate down to the pyramid and explore the site. They include Alexa Woods (Sonaa Lathan), an expert on the Antarctic environment, Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), an archaeologist who specializes in civilizations with pyramids, and Greame Miller (Ewan Bremner), a photographer who comes along to document the event.<br/><br/>However, upon arriving at the site they discover that a hole has already been dug, as if it was in anticipation of their arrival. Once they enter the ancient structure, they quickly realize that it is actually a hunting ground. Two rival extraterrestrial species, one the warrior breed Predators and the other, the both insect-like and reptilian Alien xenomorphs, are at war with each other. The explorers quickly deduce they've been led into a trap, and must find a way out the pyramid while simultaneously dodging attacks from both killer species.<br/><br/>""Alien vs. Predator"" is the type of film made specifically for the fans and people of morbid curiosity. Like 2003's ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" the movie will divide up the viewers between their preferred monsters. I myself am an Alien man, but am open-minded enough to cheer on the Predators as well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there isn't much here that we haven't seen before, and furthermore, the movie lacks the kinetic edge that the original films in both series possessed. This is an action movie, but a dark and disturbing one at that. Still, the story moving this whole enterprise is basically just a gimmick, not a plot.<br/><br/>The movie also makes some nods to a few other sci-fi horror movies. The Antarctic location is obviously an homage to ""The Thing,"" and the pyramid, a death trap whose rooms are constantly moving around, is most likely a nod to ""Cube.""<br/><br/>As Woods, Lathan is smart, resourceful and tough but still vulnerable. She's obviously meant to be the Ripley character, though she unfortunately lacks Sigourney Weaver's human edge. Lathan is up to the challenge, and it's neat to see her in this sort of environment after doing dramas like ""Love and Basketball.""<br/><br/>Henriksen is fun in the role of the billionaire adventurer who wants his immortality. As the only real established actor amongst this cast, he adds a level of professionalism that would otherwise be missing. His role is also an inside joke for fans for the Alien series.<br/><br/>The other actors are competent, but not special. Most of them are just fodder for the monsters, but Bova manages to make an impression as the Italian archaeologist looking for a missing link between the different pyramid civilizations, only to find that he's sorry to discover just what it is.<br/><br/>Director Paul Anderson has a long history of making films such as these, including his own ""Alien"" homage ""Event Horizon."" He is proficient with creating atmosphere and he keeps things moving along nicely, especially in the second half when the actions starts to kick in, but he lacks fellow ""Alien"" series helmer Ridley Scott's ability to build unnerving suspense, or James Cameron's all-out knock down actions scenes. From the ""Predator"" camp, he's also deficient in John McTiernan's gung-ho machismo.<br/><br/>""Alien vs. Predator"" is not intelligent entertainment. In fact, it's unlikely it will have much of an audience outside the real die hards of each series. It's been 14 years since the last time Predators have been on screen, and seven for Aliens. Still, various different mediums have kept both series alive, and Aliens and Predators have battled before in both novels and comic books for the last decade or so.<br/><br/>It's a fun movie to watch, and there are some unsettling moments. Also, there's one creature in the film that manages to come off sympathetic, or at least as sympathetic as either of these creatures can be. It's a nice, unexpected twist in an otherwise mundane plot.<br/><br/>You'll either like ""Alien vs. Predator"" or you won't. There's not really much middle ground here. Plus, some of the hard-core fans may be turned off by the PG-13 rating, thinking it will be a watered down version. Rest assured though, there's still plenty of blood and gore, but mostly alien blood at that.<br/><br/>While it is fun, the movie may also be a disappointment to those expecting some epic battle between the species. What we have here is an isolated pit fight, not an all out war like the ads seem to suggest. The fights are intense but usually one-on-one, and can be over pretty quickly at times. Still, for those of you who are curious, ""Alien vs. Predator"" is certainly worth hunting down.<br/><br/>Six out of ten stars. A very fun movie to watch with great atmosphere, but it's not an all-out war between species and the human characters are just fodder to get between the different monsters."

","Stupid is the word that comes to mind after watching this movie. A group of explorers find a pyramid under the polar cap in Antartica. The rich guy, Weyland, wants to be the first one there to claim it as his find site. So, he rounds up an expert in ice climbing, Alexa, and an expert in Myan pyramids along with others. You'd think they would get a clue something's wrong when they get there and a tunnel from the surface to the pyramid has magically appeared. But no, they go ahead down the tunnel. So, we lean that the Predators lured the humans there. They have an alien in hibernation who is woken up. It starts producing eggs. Some humans get trapped with the eggs, so the alien breeding has started. The predators have hunted aliens for centuries as a sport. So some of the humans get trapped in the pyramid as aliens and predators battle. So, who survives, well who cares since this was so dumb.<br/><br/>This was pg-13, so there are no good bloody deaths. It's very mild, another problem with the film. It is a far cry from the original Predator and Alien movies.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Bad, one of those movies so bad it may get a cult following and one day be popular, but not yet. If you liked Aliens or Predator, skip this because it ruins the greatness of its predecessors."

"Boba_Fett1138","5","1","4","20 July 2005"," Not only bad as a part of the Alien and Predator franchise but also a bad movie on its own.
","Everything about this movie is extremely average and the movie doesn't feature one thing that hasn't been done before. Its extremely formulaic simple entertainment with a way too simple story and uninteresting characters.<br/><br/>Where did it went wrong? Simple, it went wrong from the moment they hired Paul W.S. Anderson. He hasn't made ONE movie in his career that is interesting, original or simply above average. This movie really is no exception. It has a typical Anderson style, meaning that it's filled with flaws. But Anderson is even worser as a writer, the story he wrote for this movie is incredibly simple and features awful dialog and dull characters.<br/><br/>Anderson's directing is truly the weakest thing of the movie. His directing of the actors feels lacking, with as a result that the actors don't have an awful lot to do in this movie and their performances come across as bad. Even Lance Henriksen's role. Also the directing of the action sequences are seriously lacking. Although some of the action does has its moments, it is badly filmed and horribly edited. Halve of the time I couldn't even exactly tell what was happening.<br/><br/>The characters are completely uninteresting and of some you don't even get to know their names. Why should you even care for the characters in this movie? None of them is likable or easy to relate with. Also what was with the many accents in this movie? It was quite irritating to be honest.<br/><br/>But even worse were some of the sounds that the aliens and predators were making. The predators made the sounds of lions and the aliens that of elephants. It made me seriously laugh when I heard the queen alien trumpet. So thumbs down for the sound department as well.<br/><br/>The movie is not as bad as I make it sound now maybe but it's just that this was a movie with so much potential but somehow Anderson turned it into the most formulaic and average movie possible. I mean when you have to concept of making the aliens fight the predators, then surely there is something better they could had come up with.<br/><br/>The movie is slightly below average because of the extremely simple and uninteresting story and characters. Still the special effects are good and some of the action is enjoyable enough to make this movie still a watchable one.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Inspiration in 20th Century Fox offices must have reached rock bottom for someone to come up with an idea as stupid as melding their two most successful horror franchises into one.<br/><br/>But then, to make matters worse they had to go and hire the worst director in the business: Paul WS Anderson. Why? How desperate were they? In any case, the result is a deadening, plot less disaster, woefully acted and filled with some of the clunkiest special effects this side of a Star Trek episode- remember the Alien's first, majestic appearance in Ridley Scott's original? John Hurt, catching sight of that egg, seeing the slight movement, peering over into it Now, instead of that beautifully maintained suspense, aliens burst out of eggs and fly across rooms in slow-motion, Matrix-style. Must say something about the differences between the cinema of the 1970s and that of today.<br/><br/>Whatever the cinematic significance of the film, it's not really worth discussing: the thing's trash, pure and simple. And when the two stars finally meet, they have an incomprehensible, barely visible scrap-fight in the dark. What an anti-climax."

You avoid a film in the cinema, avoid renting it and generally harbour no desire to see it because of an all consuming barrage of fan-boy bile that you saw on the internet; besides which you think it will deviate wildly from the source material which you have already read. Some SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW.<br/><br/>But then a surprising thing happens. You buy the movie on a whim and watch it with an open mind. You sit through the typical establishing stage of the story and watch the little scenes of power struggle through which who lives and dies is determined very early on. This is all, dare you say, clichéd stuff and you let it wash over in its own harmless way.<br/><br/>The first glimpses of the predators come and go, as do the glimpses of the Alien Eggs. So far, no harm done, after all you have watched Alien Resurrection and been desensitized to the possibility of CG overkill. You reason with yourself that, despite what an alarming array of fan boys think, this guy can make a movie... you cannot... otherwise you would not be on the internet complaining about them, furthermore, you realise that the earlier Alien and Predator movies are coated in sugar coated nostalgia; yes they are good movies, but there is no way something made in 2005 will have exactly the same feel.<br/><br/>The movie steps up a gear and you have your first bloodletting, this time at the expense of the humans, a trend that will continue for the whole film. The first Alien and Predator conflict comes and is a not too drawn out affair, fairly well done given the hype involved. The Predator juves are obviously struggling in this conflict though and the narrative helpfully tells you that this is because of their lack of shoulder cannons. Needless to say, anticipation is drawn from waiting for them to get them back. As with all movies of this ilk, things don't always pan out quite as you had hoped and the conflicts are over a little too quickly. You begin to think the Fan Boys were right in one of their criticisms  the running time is too short, extended version or not<br/><br/>The story quickly gets to the inevitable scene of Predator and Human begrudgingly teaming up (A La Hunters Planet) and critics the US over (see what I did there) throw their arms up in protest guys, despite what you think, this IS loyal to the characters and earlier source material. <br/><br/>Soon you have the familiar big monster scenario, with the Alien Queens size being a major inconsistency, although she is bought to the screen well. There is some clashing, a familiar demise and before you know it there is a nod to the Predator 2 ending and a 'twist' that only the slowest of viewers wouldn't have expected.<br/><br/>But you know what? At no point have you been outraged by what you see, in fact it was rather exciting on occasion. In a no win situation, Anderson walks away with a score draw and an acid dripping trophy albeit something more like a limp hand than an Alien skull. <br/><br/>J"

Under the ice cold surface is a old pyramid filled with aliens fighting a timeless war against the outer space predators, when the humans come between these two it all seems to bad to be true...<br/><br/>Off course when Jason and Freddy from each their classic horror movie had met, two of movie history's greatest monsters had to team up for a blockbuster action adventure, and what we get; is simply a movie focused for a bit younger teenagers to get to see this pure silliness go down. All of the brutality and gore is also gone, so it would get a bigger audience - and by that, the whole cult thing about both of the series is very much gone, especially for fans. As these CGI animated monsters starts fighting, you really don't want to continue watching, because it neither gets any better or worse, it just keeps on it's boring and fabulously silly way.<br/><br/>The acting is horrible, truly horrible watching - and with this put together in the mixer with dialog worse than two crying children this movie is one of 2004's worst. Being such a lame movie already from the kick off, it all reaches the cheesy and top-notch bad movie score as when the black woman has to tram up with one of the monsters - and chooses the predator, it's almost as love appears between the two of them.

","Hey People, Glad to see you all fired up on this movie. Sad to see that there aren't many fans of the 'Alien vs Predator' BOOKS. Compared to the books, this movie is lame... Really lame... The Preds are sedated - I can't see it any other way.<br/><br/>The first two go down like paper dolls into the shredder. Read the books and you will see how the Preds are. They are the BADASSES of our galaxy. The way they move - they are like a samurai that would do a kata eyes closed and still returning to the same position and place he started from. They would hack and dice dozens of buggers before they would go down.<br/><br/>They are the bad asses - they have one path - HONOR. The alternative is death. And they wanted to keep their wretched reputation up - 'my gun is bigger then yours... let's fight' - no remorse, only admiring the brave. The first two aliens were caught off guard - by their standards, unless they died, somebody would kill them.<br/><br/>Aliens are just sport and prey - even humans if they get in the way.<br/><br/>Let me clue you a bit on their national sport (actually they don't do much besides that LOL): it's SLICING AND DICING Aliens. How are they able to find them? Well, they don't... They seed a planet suitable for the Hunt. The Hunt is a special event - maybe not as Christmas, as they are not credit card fans - but it is an event so big that the whole community is thrilled. They send a drone that places the eggs (containing those spider carriers) and the spiders just find hosts and infect them.<br/><br/>If they have time, they would wait until one of the Alien drones shifts hormones and mutates into a Queen. Then they start the Hunt and take on on all the Aliens... and killing about 75% of the local fauna in the process.<br/><br/>Why didn't they stand by the book? Don't care if they had to make 200000000000000000 episodes - I would have bought them; I would have bought them just to give them to my friends.<br/><br/>The movie deserved to be a climax of violence because this is what Preds stand for - violence, but calculated violence... yet violence none the less. Especially when dealing with Kainde Amedha - the Hard Meat. They had their own baptism rituals - the Blooding - the hunting of drones: who survived was fit for the PACK, was Kainde Twei.<br/><br/>Thanks for your kind attention. Hope I didn't ruin the movie for you, but could have been a real masterpiece.<br/><br/>Mihai Feyd Harkonnen - Hail to the C7 Group, Spacing Guild and CHOAM"

Did Anderson realize half way through that maybe he'd actually have to give the Predator a snow balls chance in hell instead of none at all?

","It must have been clear when reading the AVP script that there was no character development and virtually no personality present in this film. How do they get financing for projects with such flaws? Give me their names, I have some bridges to sell. <br/><br/>Films like Alien, Aliens, and to a lesser extent, Predator, have full-blown characters that create real human conflict and evolve as the film progresses. It's not rocket science, particularly with the Alien and Predator series as the characters are very well defined in both the books and in prior films. The female lead is a crucial role and you can see that Ridley Scott and Cameron did not cast a girlie-girl with a chip on her shoulder. They cast Sigourney Weaver who did not make girlie faces during every conflict with the aliens. Sanaa Lathan just isn't believable. Everyone is so goody two shoes. Weyland is usually the evil genius in the books but is woefully nice in this role. Where's the conflict. Whether we take the Ripley character or Machiko Naguchi from the books, we do not find well-adjusted complacent personalities. They both have warrior hearts that are out of sync with their lives and occupations. Conflict with the Aliens exorcises the beast that gnaws at them and fulfills a profound need. That's why they are credible when they start to kick alien ass. Is that so complicated? <br/><br/>Even the Predators remain undeveloped despite massive quantities of exposition endless explanations and the occasional moment within the action. But it is a confused mess to all except for the Predator geeks. Predators are like the Roman soldiers in ""Gladiator"" with a strict code of honor only multiplied many times over. The life of these hyper honorable hunters is what the female lead finds so attractive. She is already one of them before she ever meets them. <br/><br/>I feel that it is not only incompetence but also a fundamental misogyny with many directors that can only pay lip service to a competent and ferocious female role. Ridley Scott does not have problems with strong women or strong men for that matter. When he reads a book or script, he sees the ""essence"" as Marcus Auralius once said. Paul W.S. Anderson is like a monkey playing chess; he knows how to move the pieces but can't understand what he is doing. With all the producers that support his efforts, there must be a gaggle of monkeys roaming Hollywood. What a waste!"

As a film based on a game it's fantastic...as a stand alone movie it lack anything to make it absorbing. The plot is so predictable that I managed to write it down fairly accurately before watching the film.

","This is in no way an exaggeration when I say this. This ""film"" if you can even call it that (considering that it is only 84 minutes and has the worst plot line in history) is laughable at best. Why Paul Anderson thinks he can go on butchering movies like this baffles me. His editing is a joke and the story line is ridiculous. If you are going to make an action movie that is fine, but if you plan on doing this (especially in the realm of Alien and Predator) you have to keep the action up throughout the duration of the film. All of that action that takes place in this travesty of a picture is in the last 30 minutes of the movie. This makes for an unbearably bad beginning with plot buildup that make you want to leave the theater. Then after a cool 10 minutes of action that is dulled and blunted by Anderson's crappy editing for PG-13 viewers, we are left with the most comical climax and resolution in either Alien or Predator series that should leave the makers spinning in their graves (if they are indeed deceased, which they might become after viewing this horrendous film). Do not waste your money seeing this if you are a fan of either the Alien or the Predator movies, it will taint the originality and greatness of these films for the remainder of you mortal life."

","What a worthless piece of crap this movie was. Ruining two great franchises. Woodruf and Gillis make up was horrible, the acting was stale and the effects were crap. For a movie titled Alien Vs. Predator how come there was only one really good (well not good but simi-long, which you can see on the website)fight scene. Anderson's camera direction was sloppy and confusing as well as the editing. <br/><br/>Add up the amount of human's that encountered face huggers to actual aliens? A few more aliens, I guess they just come out of the really bad walls filled with crappy production design. The Predator's suits were to big and bulky which made the predators movements seem very clunky and non-stealth as in the past films. The Aliens mow down all the Predators with in 3 minutes of them meeting, leaving one that has a crush on the lead actress (which her facial expressions match that of a stone bust). <br/><br/>Let me ask you another question, when face-huggers attack a human and an alien is born, why isn't the Alien half Alien/ half human?

","Usually when you have to wait twelve years to get something, a gift per se, you should expect something good. Let's say you are seventeen and you've been asking your parents to get you a pony since you were five, and then they finally do. A month after you get the pretty pony that you've been wishing to have all your life, the old thing croaks. Your parents did something cheap. They bought an inexpensive pony at the end of its life from a farmer that was about to put it down but found capitalistic refuge by selling the horse to your parents. That my friends, is what has happened with 'Alien vs. Predator', one of the most anticipated films over the last few years, and an existential version of one of the greatest science fiction movies never made.<br/><br/>My grandiose disappoint in this film can not be explained without telling the history of the project and what it means to me and how much better it could have been. At the end of Predator 2, you can see an alien skull in the ship deck. In 1990, Dark Horse Comics published a limited series of Aliens vs. Predator. The premise was simple: in a constant search for new species of big game to hunt, a pack of predators have taken to seeding distant worlds with batches of alien eggs, returning to hunt them when the creatures have hatched and matured. On the desert world Ryushi, however, their sport is complicated by a colony of humans, caught in the middle of the bloody battle between two of the deadliest species in the galaxy. As the battle rages, an uneasy alliance develops between a Japanese female named Noguchi and the predator leader, Broken Tusk, as they both face the alien onslaught.<br/><br/>Given, a sort of version happens like this in the movie. The predators used to rule Earth as Gods and taught the Aztecs, Egyptians, Mayans, Cambodians, and everybody else how to build pyramids. They would return every 100 years to have a game hunt against aliens that I suppose they bring down to Earth, incubate inside sacrificing humans, burst out of the chest of the humans and are hunted by the predators. But one time, the predators couldn't take the aliens, and blew up their entire Antarctic kingdom.<br/><br/>The raging battle disposes of every single human in the temple in violent but quick-cutting and gore-free fashions. Of the human characters, not one possesses an ounce of charisma or a line of memorable dialogue. The characters don't have any conversation or arc; they just spew exposition as we tediously wait for the aliens or predators to get to them. Also, there is a non-WASP female who forms an alliance with a predator (no names mentioned) as they take on more aliens in some really ridiculous looking images.<br/><br/>The instant success of the comic thrilled fans of the movies everywhere, and inspired Peter Briggs to write a screenplay based on the comic book series called 'The Hunt: Alien Vs. Predator'. He wrote a gripping 107-page spec script and was able to sell it to 20th Century Fox and was later commissioned for a second draft. He incorporated ideas that the predators were of a samurai-like code and an alien-predator hybrid, which is ineptly placed at the end without any imagination. There is a wild scene in Brigg's script where the predators pick up a bunch of alien eggs and then something nasty happens. The ship is de-powered and the predators drift around weightlessly  and then the aliens attack. One predator shoots at an alien and blows him up, but the acid blood splatters throughout the ship and chews through the hulls and decks. But Paul W.S. Anderson script has none of these enticing and inspired scenes. Seeing how bad the present movie is makes you wonder why they hadn't gone with the fan script.<br/><br/>But that comic book and script adaptation is not all that went on. There were also these awesome toys, which involved some reinvented aliens of different genus, like the dog concoction in 'Alien3'. Despite the earth-bound nature of the film, Anderson doesn't explore these possibilities. There has also been a decade of video games ranging from three generations of game play involving the aliens and predators, but nothing interesting but overdone visual effects have been inspired from that region. And the film is so half-assed in its violence it is sickening. An 'Alien vs. Predator' film should not be rated PG-13. The film has a lot of on-screen death but none of which is scary in the least bit.<br/><br/>Then there is the use of special effects in the film. 'Alien' was scary because you barely ever see the creeping beast for more than a few frames until the end. We are scared of what we don't see, and sometime what we do see. But Anderson seems uninterested in scary his audience, nor really exciting them either. He just wants lots of shots of the predators and aliens doing things.<br/><br/>There is one interesting visual effect in the movie, however. And it is used in a montage exposition of the predators' time on Earth: A great image of hundreds of aliens leaping to the top of a temple with only several predators defending it. That's about it.<br/><br/>Anyway, maybe I should get to the top of the movie. A dozen science experts plus a few faceless cronies are summoned to check out a heat spot in Antarctica, and will be paid for by Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen from 'Aliens'). Involved in this idiotic adventure are Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), an ice climbing expert who stays on board for the safety of everyone else. Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), an Italian archeologist who while reading what he thinks is Egyptian, discovers that the rotation of the thousands-year old temple is in metric time. Could such an educated scientist not know that metric system was invented by Napoleon?<br/><br/>All of the other characters fail to even achieve 'cardboard cut-out', and are relegate to a level below the splendor of effects-driven death and an excuse to showcase the weapons of the predators and aliens. I thought as the movie progressed there were be a connection made between Lance Henriksen's Bishop character, and how he becomes an android in the 'Alien' movies. But nope, he's just another disposable character in this film.<br/><br/>To have to wait twelve years for something that should be spectacular and fun and receive a boring monster mash such as this outdoes disappointment. It is a headache, panache of mishmash and an incumbency of in competencies; it's the worst film of its kind. But if there is anything good that has come out of it, it has inspired me to make a better 'Alien vs. Predator' movie. I shall use only existing material, footage from all six other movies, three generations of video games, hundreds of comic books, Peter Briggs script which will be acted out by alien and predator toys, I shall make a movie that I can at least call better than Paul W.S. Anderson's monstrous assault on the eyes, ears, and taste.<br/><br/>Sources: Description of Peter Brigg's script from David Hughes book The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made."
"crittercat","1","1","4","12 August 2004"," ...bored with all that character development in your Gameboy?
","Like them or not, the 'Alien' franchise fielded four unique films-not all of them good, but each of them with a voice, a feel, a look.<br/><br/>The first was a character-driven haunted house in space, the second was a character- driven action roller-coaster, 'Alien 3' was a tale of loss and sacrifice, the fourth<br/><br/>Okay each one was different. Each had style, panache, character, suspense; each had its own distinct rhythms and tropes. Each defined its own brand of terror, horror, suspense and tension.<br/><br/>'Predator' was a testosterone-fueled snark hunt, a mano a mano exercise in guts and will: no one in that film was innocent; no one truly survived. It was fun.<br/><br/>'Predator 2' was a comic book: not quite believable, not quite straight-laced enough to be a really effective monster movie but, never mind, it had its points.<br/><br/>'Alien vs. Predator' tries to be Well, gosh, I have no idea what it tries to be. It grabs bits and pieces of all the films-a little of the Colonial Marines doing a combat drop, a little of the claustrophobic crawling through the ductwork, a little bit of the collapsing walls of the lead smelting plant in Alien 3 When you watch it-and you will!-you see how many little pieces this Anderson fellow has lifted. The net result is that nothing seems to be really happening, nothing is at stake, people are going to die but, oh well, they died in all the other movies in just this wayand who cares about them anyway, they're just targets.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, AVP's target audience seems to be kids-see? That PG-13 rating wasn't just a compromise, the thing was designed that way-kids whose thumbs have gotten tired of actually having to press those darn button on the Gameboy or X-Box and want someone else to do it. This film brings nothing to the table yet tries to suggest, to hint at, resonances from the Alien universe. The head of the company, played by Lance Henriksen, the 'artificial person' called Bishop from 'Aliens,' is named, Charles Bishop Weyland. Is this the germ of the 'Company' Ripley flies for in 'Alien?' In AVP Mr. Weyland is all human and he wants something--something that goes beyond just opening up that pyramid to see what's therehis goons are armed to the teeth and expecting something hefty to come their way. Alas they're all offed and/or cocooned too quickly for us to learn what they're REALLY doing with all that firepower on an archaeological dig. And we never find out anything! Nothing is revealed.<br/><br/>Oh, yes: The film plays fast and loose with alien biology. What took weeks--or at least a couple of days--to accomplish in terms of the Alien alternation-of-generation (look it up) gestation-egg to hugger to larva to full-blown alien motherhumper-now happens in, no seriously, a matter of minutes!<br/><br/>I probably should stop here. But I have to spoil it for you because this film, rotten as it is, needs spoiling: The chummy alliance between the human survivor and the predator is repulsive. Predators are not nice people. Not these guys. They are awful, Republicans with too many mandibles, and even less of a moral compass than Never mind. The (Capital A) Aliens are animals. They are dumb things that do what they do because they do it! They live to breed. That's it. An alliance between human and Predator here is like the turkey and the Pilgrims ganging up on the ham.<br/><br/>Now I will stop.<br/><br/>No. I won't. Do not see this film-at least don't pay to see it. Sneak in.<br/><br/>Go to a multi- plex, see a good movie, buy a second bag of soggy popcorn, then stroll into this one and see how truly wretched it is."

I understand the need for a relatable human core to this film - that it can't just be Aliens and Predators ripping into each other, as that would simply be no better than a video game on screen. But even with the addition of a badly cast, badly acted human ensemble to this travesty, the dreadful writing and offensively lazy clichés do the job of making the whole film play like a laughable video game any way. Oh, the writing... The dialogue... The needless complexity... I can't. I just can't. There's too much wrong with it, and there's nothing I can add that hundreds of IMDb reviewers haven't said already. Game over, man. Game over. I say we take off, and nuke the film from orbit.

","Humans find themselves in an underground pyramid in Antarctica(designed by the ""first civilization"" at the specifications of an alien warrior race), caught between two warring alien races duking it out for supremacy with walls constantly opening and closing, the labyrinthine chambers making things quite difficult for those unfortunates trying to find a way out. There was a power source picked up by the satellite of a robotics megalomaniac emanating from the pyramid underneath the ice of Antarctica which inspires gazillionaire Weyland(Lance Henriksen) to assemble a team to find a way to make it inside, claiming it as a major discovery certain to achieve renown and fame. What they do not bargain for is to be stuck in the pyramid as the Predator warriors and alien xenomorphs attack each other to the death. Most of the humans are assaulted by face huggers and injected by mouth with xenomorph fetuses(a flaw in the story has the birthing cycle way too fast). Essentially the film is about a human group servicing the threadbare comic book plot as fodder for the Predator and xenomorph aliens. The film had to have human characters to discuss the plot, like an archaeologist and his aid who can interpret hieroglyphics to explain how the pyramid was built and for what reason. Director/writer Paul WS Anderson builds a mythology for the Predator alien warriors and how far they go back. 20th Century Fox sure threw a lot of money at the movie, providing Anderson with a budget for some pretty impressive, elaborate special effects and he does give the audience some legitimate combat scenes between the Predators and the xenomorphs. Where the movie fails is in how the humans are used in the film, and their demises are mostly off screen. Sanaa Lathan does what she can in the heroine role as an expert climber hired by Henriksen(whose millionaire is dying and sucking oxygen from a device)who finds herself choosing sides with a Predator warrior, hoping he will not kill(and possibly even protect)her. Raoul Bova is an archaeologist, Sebastian, with Ewen Bremner as chemist, Miller. Colin Salmon(RESIDENT EVIL)shows up in a minor role as Henriksen's body guard, and the one responsible for getting the crew into their predicament by removing the last gun from a crypt made especially for the Predator warrior. Everyone else in the plot comes and goes when the aliens enter the picture and the pyramid shuts them in. The acid blood of the xenomorphs are used in interesting ways, even as a mark of success when they are killed by their adversaries. You get an alien queen, trapped in a spider-like locking device, getting free thanks to her ""children"" using her acid blood to break the locks. Seeing Lathan running alongside a Predator warrior seems unusual to say the least. Henriksen, while good in his limited time on screen, is cast in a glorified cameo thanks in part to his Bishop role in the ALIEN series. Made for a younger audience, there's minimal graphic violence or course language which might be a no-no for fans of the PREDATOR & ALIEN series. The Predator body armor and weaponry are really cool and seeing them in battle with xenomorphs provide some exciting moments. But, AVP isn't exactly a work of art, but as he always does, Anderson sure makes a good-looking sci-fi movie--this is basically a B-movie, not really all that innovative story-wise, concerned more with special effects and creature fights. It will all come down to what the viewer is looking for. Characters and story, nope. Space ships, aliens, and a imaginative Indiana Jones-style setting, yep."

","Paul Anderson's ""Alien vs Predator"" is one of the most insulting pieces of garbage that I have ever seen. While watching the movie one has to wonder, did the director ever see ""Alien"" or ""Predator""? Almost everything about the movie is wrong. The Script was obviously written on a Napkin in crayon by an 8 year old. The Characters are extremely unlikable and the story is stupid and boring. The Predators remind me of a cross between Super Shredder (from ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2""), and the San Francisco 49ers. As for the Aliens, they look suprisingly good, and even some of the Alien vs Predator fight scenes are cool. But even that can't save this turd. Apparently these aren't the same aliens as in the other movies, because they burst out of your chest within minutes of the eggs being layed. Errors in logic like that are unforgivable, especially when your making a film that all the ground work has been layed for.<br/><br/>Seeing the once great Lance Henricksen in dreck like this makes me sick. Sadly it seems like he just showed up for the Paycheck.<br/><br/>
The movie just goes from bad to worse. Then Paul Anderson takes it one step further and makes the entire audience laugh in disbelief, in one of the most idiotic plot twists in recent memory. Oh, and Lets not forget him turning the Queen Alien into the T-Rex from ""Jurassic Park"". There's really not much more to say other than STAY AWAY. Remember, there's a reason FOX didn't screen this movie for Critics until the last minute. They knew they had the next ""House of the Dead"" in their hands."

","An expedition of archaeologists on Earth discover an Aztec temple hidden under the Antarctic circle, housing a host of Alien creatures. A group of coming-of-age Predators have also come to the temple, as it has long been a training ground for their race. From there on, it's Aliens vs. Predators, with the humans caught in the middle.<br/><br/>This is a fairly hard movie to rate as I can easily say that I was disappointed with the movie as a whole but I thought the action/fight sequences between the Aliens and Predators were stunning. Clever use of slow-motion with bone crushing thuds everywhere as Aliens and Predators recklessly trash the set.<br/><br/>Now that I've proclaimed my love of the action sequences, it's time to say a few things that I don't like. I don't like the fact that it took so long to get into the actual action. I'd say that it takes like 45 minutes at least just to get to the first action sequence. Yeah, from then on in it gets interesting but everything before it was pretty much a snooze-fest. I hated pretty much every single human character shown on screen. I actually prayed for their deaths... quicker would have been better and the lack of violence towards the actual humans also lets this one slide down the scale a bit. Don't get my words mixed up, there is quite a bit of violence in the movie, it's just not gory or bloody.<br/><br/>There's also one thing about this movie that seemed to work well on me and that was the playing field. It seems that the Predators alone have an advantage over the Aliens in one-on-one situations so every time I saw a Predator get slaughtered, something inside of me stopped. I felt weird, I don't know how to explain it but it was a powerful feeling. Kind of like the feeling of a highly obsessive fans' favorite sporting team reaching the final game and getting their asses whooped! I hear a lot of people don't like the plot but it's not that bad and what a lot of people don't understand is that Anderson tries to tie the movie in with the comics, he may not have ended up with a masterpiece but anyone who's been a fan of AvP before the movie should know and respect this. Also, the fact that this movie wasn't even finished by its deadline is another reason why it got so sloppy. I'm not saying it would have made the film any better by giving it some more time though it may have given Anderson and his crew a lil' bit more credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Many loyal fans will be disappointed but hey... unfortunately that happens."

The squad later finds out that the temple is used as Predator hunting grounds and that they've just screwed up bigtime by showing up during the annual hunt. The movie suffers from bad acting (excusing, of course, the great Lance Henrikson), horrible scripting, and the watered-down PG-13 rating the MPAA slapped it with. But a studio has gotta do what a studio has gotta do to maximize profits, I guess. If you're an Alien fan, don't go to see this movie; if you're a Predator fan, don't go to see this movie.

","Well i have seen many films from Paul Anderson and i can clearly see that sequels,it's not his best job.RE is good,RE2 sucks,MK is good,MK2 WTF is that????this film u can say it's a sequel and it....SUCKS!!!by many reasons:<br/><br/>1-Actors and characters:there are no above average actors there...they all suck.no emotion.they don't get terrified like in the others ALIEN and PREDATOR movies,they see all that situation as normal.u see everyday aliens and/or predators walking by the street like dogs,right?.... and most of all u don't ""choose"" a favourite character.....cause u don't like anyone.remember Aliens?Hicks,Hudson,Vasquez,etc....u really like them as character...in this movie,well...in my view,i think they can all die....<br/><br/>2-plot:how many flaws u can see in this movie?a lot. 1st there is only one queen....what in the hell is she doing here?how she could go to LV-426 after being on the deep frozen ice of Antarctica?the predators went back there and brought her to LV-426?!in one word....STUPID!<br/><br/>2nd i think u all know that if the infected being dies,the alien inside dies...well the predator dies,and still,the alien borns....hm...this is not the first time that this flaw happens....the remake of ALIEN 3 u see that mistake too.... oh and of course the rapid generated alien....like in 5 min....yeah right.....<br/><br/>3rd the cgi aliens....i prefer (by far) the rubber suit-alien like in the two 1st alien movies....this gigantic cockroaches (for me is that) don't seem real....and they look smaller and less meaner.....<br/><br/>4th i'm not a predator fan but are this predators sissies or what?i thought they were the bad-asses of universe and in 5 min,2 die and one is infected....they have that stealth camouflage for what?the aliens can still ""see"" them....and the ppl who sees this movie thinks:""well this predators are only good with their shoulder-cannons because without that they suck""...i don't think that the predator-lex alliance isn't real but is not very acceptable....<br/><br/>5th my favourite:the title is Alien Vs Predator,right?well u only see ONE fight,and its about 2 min long and u don't understand it all...its very confusing....cause fights between the main beasts u don't see more....the rest is like a typical teenage movie:ppl screaming and running from the ""bad guys""...the film should be called:lex and friends trapped in the Antarctica pyramid.<br/><br/>6th the bishop factor....let's make math,OK?well even if the 1st alien movie and this movie happens at the same time (which is not true),to ALIENS is 57 years,then to ALIEN 3 is more a few years and u see in the end of that movie the real bishop,human being.he bleeds blood when is attacked. well...how can exist a human bishop now and 150 years later?strange...for me its a BIG cast mistake.......<br/><br/>there more flaws there but i would be here till tomorrow to say all....<br/><br/>AVP- the biggest flop in the ALIEN franchise...and PREDATOR franchise...i think"
"north-julie","6","1","8","15 June 2006"," its bad but its not THAT bad
","Okay. When you see the words 'directed by Paul WS Anderson' attached to the credits of a film you automatically think 'oh sh*t'. However look at his track record more closely and you'll see his films are generally poor but not in a 'worst film ever!' kind of way. Event Horizon was a nifty little sci-fi film with great effects and a great cast while for all its faults Reisdent Evil was fairly entertaining but hampered by dodgy fx. The same kind of thing can be said for AvP.<br/><br/>When a satellite picks up a heat swell on a deserted Antarctic island, company executive Mr Weyland organises a trek to the location to discover whats hidden two thousand feet under the ice. They find an abandoned temple with hints of Egyptian, Aztec and Coambodian (i think) design to it. Inside they discover a breeding ground for Alien parasites that are the meat for a race of extra terrestrials called Predators who turn up every one-hundred years to hunt these vicious black monsters. Needless to say the Predators turn up just as the human team enters the temple and fighting ensues between all three races.<br/><br/>For a film called Alien vs Predator, you'd expect there to be plenty of conflicts between the aforementioned species. Unfortunately we are limited to one basic fight and a couple of ten second long scraps. This is a flaw, and if your feeling annoyed you can have a go at the film for this outrageous dose of false advertising.<br/><br/>Most people know that the Alien series of films began in 1979 with classic Alien, was followed by even bigger classic Aliens, dodgy threequel Alien3 and even dodgier follow up Alien Resurrection. On a whole its one of the greatest film series of all time, a favourite of sci-fi fans and many others. At its heart was Ellen Ripley (absent from this film because her films were set in the future while this is set at present day) a woman who had extraordinary survival skills and eventually managed to wipe out the entire alien species at the cost of her own life.<br/><br/>There are just two Predator films meanwhile. The first starred Austrian Oak Arnold Schwarzennegger and was a superior slice of jungle based combat. The hunter killed Arnies crack commando unit one by one until only Arnie was left and a stunning battle between the two ended the contest. Its follow up Predator 2 was a giant pile of steaming rubbish with Danny Glover being stalked by a Predator on the streets of LA.<br/><br/>As you can there is a lot of history for this film to live up to. Sadly, it only ends up being half decent in attempting to merge the two film series, and the idea of the Predators using the aliens to train themselves is a clever one. The setting of the temple is a poor choice though as its too dark and claustrophobic for any decent confrontations, and strangely Anderson manages to eject any tension from the scenes because it is abundantly clear when the Aliens or Predators are about to attack.<br/><br/>On the acting front everyone is one dimensional, with a handful of forgettable characters pushed to the forefront. Sanaa Lathan (Blades mother in Blade) is pretty enough to lead the cast, displaying a decent amount of ballsy courage and vulnerability but shes no Sigourney Weaver (who played Ellen Ripley). Raoul Bova is the 'seond longest survivor' of the human cast, and thats not me trying to be funny, thats just how he seems to be used in the film. He is an Italian scientist who manages to read an Aztec wall inscription faster than he can probably read Italian to basically explain the plot of the film in a one minute segment. He eventually dies (as does everyone except Lathan) and we promptly forget about him because, well, all we know about him is that he is Italian.<br/><br/>Lance henriksen pops up for a continuity bashing cameo as Weyland. Henriksen played android Bishop in Aliens and Alien3, and also Bishops human creator at the climax to Alien3. How hes here in present day as well as the future is baffling, but what the hell. The fact he dies seems to be ignored as well (if he dies, hows he in Alien3?) Effects wise the film is top notch. The cg aliens are much better than those seen in the last Alien film Alien Resurrection, and the expertly realised Alien Queen (shes runs! and jumps!) adds a good element of something never seen before because the Alien Queen of Aliens simply stood and swung its tail around. Now shes mobile! Music wise the films scores again. It has a brilliant musical score (check out the piece accompanying the alien and predator coming face to face for the first time or when the Predator ship leaves Earth at the end). The sound effects are brilliant as well, so backstage the job has been done.<br/><br/>Its just a shame Anderson messes up the action (the alien/predator opening fight is quite clearly two men in suits bashing each other) and that the characters are forgettable pieces of fluff. He also messes with Alien mythology. The Alien Queen lays eggs that sprout 'facehuggers' that grab onto your face and put an alien embryo inside you. Up to a day later the alien pops out your chest. In AvP the alien pops out of a woman's chest two minutes after its been laid. An annoying error that could have been avoided if the makers had really thought about it.<br/><br/>There are some nice touches (the logo from the Alien 3 poster can be seen on the floor of one of the rooms in the temple) but ultimately there is nothing to get excited about with this film. It doesn't bore you but it doesn't hit you with anything spectacular.<br/><br/>Rent before you buy."

It wasn't boring or dumb like Alien 3, but it really doesn't add anything to the franchise or should I say franchises. The script was consistent, but ""Cube"" movie-like in its intensity.

","They really should've paid more attention to the previously established media involving the Predators and Aliens and the comics because this movie ignores everything that all of the original comics and movies established except for the Predator's Sense of honor in the hunt. In the first two Predator movies it's established that the Predators are attracted to high levels of heat and conflict but this movie takes place in Antarctica for some reason; also in this movie it's stated that the fight between Aliens and Predators has been going on since Egyptian times which contradicts the other movies' timelines, the aliens mature into full grown Xenomorphs in a matter of seconds instead of a matter of hours like in all of the other movies prior to this one, continuity pretty much doesn't exist in this movie, the dialog was horrendous; without all of the humans freaking out this movie could've been like 30 minutes Long, two of the three Predators were incabable of killing their prey, it's painfully obvious when they switch between CGI and animatronics for the Aliens<br/><br/>If you're a fan of cool alien fight scenes this movie has a few which are cool but that's about the only good thing this movie has to offer.

","Well, if Bishop died, it would mean that Alien vs. Predator is not a ""prequel"" to the Alien quartet, since he appeared in Alien 3. However, the end of Alien Resurrection clearly shows that earth is no more, which would mean that AVP, would then have to be a prequel.<br/><br/>One of the many questionable plot lines, that I guess could be answered by altering previous truths and intentions. Apart from that, AVP proves to be somehow the freshest of the sequels (It's sad that W.S. Anderson may have given a better product that James Cameron), though perhaps not the best, while of course, it still suffers from the same basic issues this entire franchise is plagued with.<br/><br/>AVP substitutes a spaceship, a colony, a jail and another spaceship, for an underground pyramid, then follows the exact same overdone Alien franchise blueprint that excels mainly in under delivering.<br/><br/>The Predator's origins on earth involving the aliens was not bad, and it's what really gives this installment some level of edge over the other sequels. The action was pretty much the same with the benefit of more advanced cinematic technologies, and the sequence of this film, in terms of how many people, predators and aliens are involved, dead and alive was not well presented. 5.3/10."

"jcjccaz","2","0","2","23 February 2018"," Always Will Make Money
","Read reviews. What the director does do, and to some extent he said so himself, just make money. He explores scripts, movies or franchise movies if you will, that were already successful or at least in the public consciousness. These movies he does, and this one AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004), all will make money just on their merits alone. Just like if I was to make a King Kong vs Gozilla movie. I would bet you the bank that I would turn a profit. 
By picking an established ""character"" it then becomes how can I make 10 to 15 minutes of suspenseful scenes, albeit not Hitchcockian, and maybe 6 or 7 minutes of action (fighting between the Alien and Predator), so as not to raise the budget to high where the profit will be reduced. And, as in all of his films, almost all has achieved success. He makes movies, his words (and I am paraphrasing), that are not for the critics, this websites reviewers, but to make the majority of the audience happy, thus, having a profit and allowing future investors to allow him to direct because he is a ""profitable"" director, albeit with already proven "" stars"" or ""monsters"" or a universe set up. The directors highest rating for a movie, on rotten tomatoes, I think was 41%. Most of all the other movies were in the 20 to 33% range, yet some of them turned a profit, case and point. When you make movies that appeal to the lowest common denominator intellectually, well, it does a disservice to those with an intellect. But, as usual it's not about making a great, new, provocative movie, it is about (this director at least) making money. Now that's okay but you are making money, as I said before, on an already established ""franchise."" Too be a really great film maker one has to explore their own interior and make that movie or movies that have no previous formula, but only your own creativity. From idea to script to pre-production and so on and so on till the movie, your ""baby"", is completed. Then and only then will you truly be called a film maker.
Until then, money aside, you are part of the assembly line and not the stand alone artist.
Further, the people calling the ""monsters"" classic are way off base. When this movie , AVP: Alien vs Predator (2004) was made it was only 17 years removed from the first one and the creators didn't, at least I my opinion, think is was going to be anything more than one movie, much less a ""universe."" You need at least 25 years, in cars at least, and certain states at that, for something to be a classic.
So simmer with the classic thing.
Also, again the director knew what he had and that's why she (""The main character "") can stand around in the Antarctica without a hat or a coat and have a 118 pound woman survive where (in the original Predator) three guys (Blain, Dillon & Mac) who are taller and in some cases a better athlete (Weathers) than Arnold not come close to surviving. Oh, and they are specially trained for this. But that is the way of Hollywood. Try to shape society and stop the social ills even if the truth be told, that most pilots flying the aircraft's (stats by the government) are 95% male worldwide. 
The movie, as a movie, isn't a on the edge of your seat thriller or a turn away, I'm scared movie. The acting, agian, think budget, because these ""Joes"" are not Gielgud or Olivier. For that matter they are not Bill Duke or Carl Weathers.

Also, the last predator had to catch and kill the alien that jumped out of the guy's stomach toward the end because the girl was too stupid to shoot him in his gut to kill it. She just walked away thinking she'd done a good job after the guy in his HEAD.

AVP Requiem have the same kind of shady lightning and it's even worst in this one than the original. The actors are OK at best and the story is lazy. It looks, smells and feels like a generic scenario for a sci-fi movie who needs to fits two franchises together. Both series are good because of their ambiance ( the deep space in Alien and the tropical jungle kind of survivor feeling of Predator). AVP, in contrast, is in a pyramid they found in Antartica.... Neither Aliens or Predators ever are on Earth, it's Sci-fi, not a new episode of Ancient Aliens.<br/><br/>So yeah, watch it for the kickass battle scenes between predators and aliens ( even if there is few and you mostly see nothing thanks to the great lightning, good job guys).

Here we have a big budget circus act about one dominating factor conquering another. Great production and visual elements are the norm as the premise rushes introduction and cardboard characters discover a pyramid but are really there to be eaten.

Inside they find an altar which they activate. Meanwhile three Predators have landed to collect their trophies.<br/><br/>This is an idea created out of desperation. Both Predator and Alien franchises had run their courses. Somebody came up with the insane idea to marry the two franchises. There is a reason why only Henriksen returned. It should have been an obvious mistake to bring Alien into present day and on Earth. It rips apart the original Alien franchise canon.<br/><br/>If there is any redeeming quality, it is to be found in the movie itself. It is a pretty simple creature feature with 2 different creatures. One must abandon all hopes of the enjoyment from the original franchises. There is no hiding the creatures. They are revealed quickly. Director Paul W.S. Anderson brings along the monsters and produces nothing good. There is no imagination. At least enough money has been spent that the production doesn't look completely cheap. That is all the good I could see here."

","Where do I begin? The plot is obviously told by the characters, but the dialog is so bad that you get bored and disconnected from the movie before the action even begins. But when the action actually does eventually come you totally forget there was a plot to the whole situation. I mean at one point in the movie I took out my slinky and was more entertained by it than the movie. So I waited for either Alien or A predator to enter the scene and was slightly not bored, then they left and I went back to slinky.<br/><br/>But Sanaa Lathan, who played Alexa Woods the experienced guide(or in other words the main character) I am no means a fan of hers but even if you took her out, I wouldn't be able to decide who to put in to fit the script. Maybe Monkeys? It would be more entertaining."

","Man, did they go wrong with this one! Let me count the ways: 1) It's set in the frozen land of Antarctica (like the much better THE THING). 2) Given a stellar cast, why were there no interesting characters? Come on, they couldn't even give Lance Hendrickson a decent role?! 3) Where are the bloody aliens? We go through half the movie before any aliens or predators show up. And when they do show up, their battle is less-than-stellar. Hardly fitting for two races of mortal enemies. 4) There's not one bit of interesting dialogue, no scares, or even thrilling action sequences. Trust me, you'll be bored to tears within the first ten minutes. 5) The special effects leave much to be desired. 6) Don't waste your time, skip over this one and hunt down AVP: REQUIEM."

","*Possible Spoilers!* <br/><br/>Have you ever noticed that the bigger the budgets have gotten for these tiresome Alien movies the worse and more convoluted their story-lines have become? <br/><br/>And, if you, yourself, haven't grown totally sick and tired of the whole rehashing of the Alien story - Well, I certainly have.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but, I now find that this once hideous-looking creature's image has become so familiar that it no longer has the ability to generate any awe or fright, whatsoever. It only looks stupid, almost laughable, with its excessive drooling, its mouthful of projectile teeth, and its watermelon-shaped head that appears to be without any eyes. (Like, how does this creature actually see what it's doing?) <br/><br/>And, speaking about stupid-looking (and, I do mean ""STUPID!"") - When the dread-lock headed predator removed its helmet I know that I was supposed to be aghast with horror at the sight of its intended ugliness - But, when the big moment of unveiling came, I, literally, burst out laughing at this wheezing, pig-faced, prong-toothed bozo. I really did.<br/><br/>And, to add insult to injury here - Wasn't it awfully clever and cute how Pepsi-Cola managed to make its underhanded, little product-plug in this terrible excuse for an Alien movie-sequel? Yep. I thought that it was pretty damn low and completely humorless that a frickin' Pepsi-Cola bottle-cap turned out to be the great, all-important find discovered at an archaeological dig amongst some ancient ruins in Mexico.<br/><br/>And, yeah, it was bad enough that this blasted bottle-cap made one appearance in this movie, but, it actually showed up 3 more times. It was all because the dude who initially uncovered this precious (?) item kept it on himself as some sort of a lucky charm, making certain to pull it out and clutch it possessively whenever the going got rough.<br/><br/>Ho-Hum! <br/><br/>Anyways - I've just about said all that I want to say about this tres disappointing Sci-Fi blunder, except to add that I thought actor Lance Erickson, as the Weyland character, looked like death warmed over. In fact, his ravaged face was 10 times more frightening to behold than either that of the Alien's or the Predator's.<br/><br/>And, finally - Let's face it - The mousy, little Sanaa Lathan, as the heroic ""Lex"" Woods character, certainly turned out to be a mighty poor replacement for the overbearing and aggressive Ripley character who had appeared in the original Alien pictures.<br/><br/>How the hell Woods managed to actually befriend the ferocious Predator creature was truly ridiculous beyond words. By the end of the movie I was half-expecting these 2 bosom-buddies to join hands and go merrily skipping down the set's darkened corridors together, so pleased with themselves in their happy, little bond of brotherly/sisterly love.<br/><br/>All-in-all - It would be an understatement to say that AVP's screenplay could've been a whole lot better - But, with that said, it certainly couldn't have been much worse considering its big-bucks budget and the apparent combined talents of the production team who were there in the driver's seat, making all of the important decisions.<br/><br/>Yep. Give me Godzilla Vs. The Smog-Monster over AVP - Any day - Any day - Any day!"

","This has a good premise at least: why not team up FOX Studios most iconic monsters to do battle, since it had already been done as a comic book, and the end of ""Predator II"" implies they share the same universe? Well, it sounds good, but story is surprisingly stale, with characters who are written as cannon fodder, since we barely get to know them, and aren't really developed. Fine actor Lance Henriksen comes off best, playing the ancestor of the man who would go on to build the android Bishop seen in the far superior ""Aliens"", and who also founded the company that built the Nostromo, which discovered the original Alien. Pity he isn't in the film all the way through...<br/><br/>Plot is thin, though there are some good action sequences, the film feels half-baked, and ultimately leads nowhere."

Then tone down the gore for the teenage crowd.<br/><br/>Voila - Alien vs Predator.<br/><br/>To be fair, it isn't as bad as others have made out. It starts off OK, though none of the characters are all that memorable besides Sanaa Lathan, who proves to be a likable heroine, certainly she makes a better impression than anyone else in the cast.<br/><br/>The effects are impressive, and one of the few reasons to stick with it. There are also some cool nods to the Alien films.<br/><br/>The Aliens prove menacing as always, and the Queen gives us an exciting climax. The Predators, while they have cool weaponry, get a bit short-changed here. Watch this film, and it's difficult to believe any one of these could decimate Arnie's team in the first Predator.<br/><br/>It's actually some time before we see the monsters - we get a neat opener in the extended edition which is an almighty ONE MINUTE longer - and we have to suffer the companion of mostly unmemorable characters. Once the monsters start doing their thing, it's actually quite entertaining...<br/><br/>...except for the fact, that just when it's getting good, it seems over far too quickly.<br/><br/>It has some good moments, and I think it worth a look, just don't get your hopes too high about the chance to see iconic monsters battle."

","I'm not going to delve deep into this, but, if you expect this alien vs predator film to have a good narrative or halfway good acting you're bound to be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film is about a pyramid out in Antarctica(of all places, considering that it is a known fact that predators only hunt in hot places) that is in fact a prison for the aliens, however, the pyramid is discovered by a bunch of archaeologists, who journey out into the Antarctica to discover whats inside, but, they get more then what they bargained for when they get inside. The film is marred to an illogical, stupid, poorly written story that only Paul WS Anderson could have written, and it simply an utterly turgid attempt at bringing admittedly an interesting premise to the screen.Its disappointing, and quite frankly, infuriating how a film with such a simple premise like an alien battling a predator could be so incompetently made, directed and written, any talented director could of at least made this watchable, hell, even the video games this film was inspired by had better story lines.

","I love the Alien and Predator franchises... when I heard they were bringing the AvP series to theaters I was stoked. And then we get this.<br/><br/>I will say I am kind of a stickler for If you are taking an idea straight from another source, be it comics, video games, books or TV. My belief is, stay true to the source material. That is what made the idea popular enough for you to make a movie to begin with.<br/><br/>The Concept of the comics and video games were, futuristic with the Space Marines from the Aliens movie (not the same squad but the soldier) on alien planets. The only real concepts that Paul Anderson took were the humans and Predators working against the Aliens, and that the Predators use the Aliens for hunting.<br/><br/>The Movie is a pseudo-prequel-sequel movie. It's a sequel to the Predator movies (albeit indirectly) and a prequel to the Alien franchise, with the introduction of Charles Bishop Weyland, one half of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the ""Company"" from Alien, and the model for the Bishop android in Aliens and Alien 3.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Antarctica, a far throw from the hot jungles of Central America and the 100+ weather of L.A. Where Weyland makes a remarkable discovery, a huge heat bloom on frozen wasteland. He takes a team of archaeologist along with some personal security (probably ex-military although never mentioned) to find the heat bloom, only to find in a large underground cave a Pyramid. But the pyramid has designs and carving and markings from three separate cultures that never had contact with each other.<br/><br/>Well that's because they were build by the Predators. SEE Aliens DID build the pyramids.... anyway. It turns out the pyramid is a training facility for a certain tier or clan of the Predator species that a right of passage is to hunt and kill Aliens. There are some spoilers after this point. Unfortunately I need them to explain why I did not like this movie.<br/><br/>So brings out a Queen Alien to start making eggs, so that the humans can become hosts for Aliens for the Predators to hunt. The Predators show up. Three of them, one similar to the ones from previous movies (called Scar), another close to him but with huge blade swords on his arms (can't remember his name) and one huge Predator (named Celtic) Well the one I can't remember his name is killed like instantly. Scar disappears, and Celtic goes after the one who killed the first Predator and they have like a huge 5 minute fight. the Battle was really cool, but Celtic is cut down and the Aliens take a huge advantage.<br/><br/>At this point the humans are split up Main Characters together and secondary are lost and going to die soon. They start learning about what's going on by translating the hieroglyphics and decide they need help the last remaining predator.<br/><br/>The fault I have with this movie is. Besides bad acting, a poor sense of location, it is dark a lot in this movie. And the fact that the Predators are built as these bad ass hunters to kill 2 of them in really the first 10 minutes of them actually getting screen time was stupid. That and Paul Anderson doesn't really understand how the Alien species works. To make an Alien you need an egg, which makes a face-hugger, which implants an embryo into a host, which then becomes an Alien. By my count their were about a dozen or so people in that temple... there are a lot more Aliens then just that dozen. And also that 2 Predators are killed by one Alien, and yet 1 Predator can kill 5 or 6, plus the Queen with the lousy help of someone who is pretty much a pacifist. It just seemed very unbalanced.<br/><br/>Truthfully this movie would have worked out a lot better had the plot been Set on some outpost on another world. Where the Predators dropped some eggs and breed Aliens for a hunt, and the Marines were called in to investigate a distress beacon from the outpost. And have a huge 3 way battle royal. And I will have a review for AvP:Requiem the sequel to this movie... and lets just say this was Shakespeare compared to the the sequel."

","How does one even write a review of this movie without trying to commit suicide? Looking back at all of the classic films that came from these two franchises (Predator, Alien & Aliens) it makes me sad to see this abomination of a ""double-sequel"" half-assed for everyone to see. It's out there for the masses to observe. There's no hiding it. If done by someone who actually cared about the source material and the back story of these two franchises, this film could have been something very special and just plain exciting. I don't mean an Academy Award-worthy effort, here. Just common sense and a flair for adventure/sci-fi cinema. It seems Anderson and his whole crew lack both of these skills. The cast that has been assembled, including Sanaa Lathan and Lance Henriksen himself, are all very competent and sci-fi friendly. Also, the special effects are all well done and lovely to behold. The problem lies in the story and execution of the whole affair. The plot seems extremely slight, compared to even the last two Alien movies. Predator 2 is a classic compared to AvP (notwithstanding, P2 is indeed quite a guilty pleasure). Most lovers of sci-fi action and adventure will ask themselves if they saw what they really saw after the movie ends. ""Is that all?"" I really wanted to like and enjoy this flick, but in the end there was no way on earth I could embrace such a corporate, lifeless, thrown-together piece of studio propaganda. If it had been made by someone more competent and the tone had been more suited to the material, I guarantee you it would have at least made double at the box office. It had no legs and disappeared from the landscape shortly after it debuted. What a waste and what an utter disappointment this all turned out to be."

","From the get go with a title like Alien vs Predator, the viewer knows it isn't going to be seeing a classic of the American cinema. Alien vs Predator is one of those movies that you leave your brain at home and just go with it. That's how I went into this movie. Surprisingly, it was better than I was expecting it to be. The plot is passable and the action is entertaining. The acting is of course wooden but i have seen a lot worse. The movie does keep your attention and of course the final battle between the alien and predator keeps your attention though the scenes are a little tough to see. Overall a harmless time waster that is good to watch if you are a fan of either series or there is nothing else on."

","How many situations can you invent as an excuse for wringing very last drop of blood from an audience, or an alien for that matter? This is scraping the barrel really, with a rather flimsy plot to explain why aliens and predators might be brought together.<br/><br/>Watching it the first time, I was mildly entertained and curious to see how things would turn out. There is an element of intrigue, especially if you're familiar with aliens and predators battling Ripley or Arnie. Clearly all the sequels to those originals were flawed, cynical and lazy attempts to prolong the life of an ageing cash cow.<br/><br/>Frankly the only reason I bothered watching this all the way through a second time was Sanaa Lathan, who is one of the more attractive monster bashers and is pleasing to watch, although she fails to get her kit completely off even when splashed with acid blood - shame.<br/><br/>As impressive as the effects are, the story is weak and the acting pretty much non-existent.

","Alien vs. Predator is quite a tough one to review because, while admittedly it lacks plot and has a simple and basic story and average acting, it was still a bit fun to watch. The story is just too simple and doesn't really grab you from the start, it takes a while before you could properly get into the movie. Also, it doesn't delve more into how the war started between the two science-fiction monsters, it only showed you three minutes or so which was a little disappointing. You couldn't care what happened to the characters, as there was absolutely no personality whatsoever and none of them stood out. They could have been sheep for all we know considering that all of them were the same. The direction wasn't really good and neither was the writing however there were some cool action scenes in the movie. The acting was below average and this goes to the entire cast, sometimes they were good and sometimes they weren't. To watch this movie, you'd have to turn your brain on in sleep mode for ninety minutes, as this movie doesn't require you to think at all. It's just a brain numbing, harmless movie that shouldn't be taken seriously.<br/><br/>I have to say that even though I didn't really like this movie, I can't deny I didn't have fun watching it. There were a couple of good fighting scenes with Alien and Predator but there were one or two scenes that were a little silly. I liked the background of the movie, a mysterious pyramid full of traps and Aliens, I thought it added a nice touch to the movie. The acting was just average and it didn't aspire to try and be better but this is a movie that was destined for mediocrity so it's something that you could forgive. Paul W.S Anderson didn't do a terrible job of this movie but at the same time, there's room for improvement. There were parts in the movie that had me bored but there were parts that were just fun and nothing more. This isn't really a thinking movie, it doesn't require you to do anything but have fun and so, if you are going to watch this movie, don't use your brain. If you're a fan of both Alien and Predator movies or you just like a good fiction fight, it's likely you'll enjoy this.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

"Gordon-11","Null","0","1","20 April 2010"," A boring film
","This film is about a group of scientist investigating a mysterious heat-producing underground pyramid, and they find even more mysterious creatures battling inside.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Alien vs Predators"" is laughably bad, with little thrills or suspense to keep viewers interested. There are no sound effects to enhance the atmosphere, and there lighting is so dark which makes it hard to see what is happening. The design of the aliens are ""Terminator"" rip offs, while the predators are ""Alien"" rip offs. I thought ""Alien vs Predators"" was a effects laden blockbuster, but it turned out to be a disappointment."
"LaserPoint","3","0","1","17 April 2010"," Destorys the Predator name
","AVP was properly the better quality film out when compared to it's sequel AVP.R, especially when brought into the subject matter of: story, character development, acting, lighting and special effects, but the Predator design itself was ultra disappointing; and that's an understatement. Anderson introduced us to a breed of short and stubby hunters who resembled almost nothing of the original creature, and don't get me started on the terribly poor faces and the fact that humans and Predators work together to combat the Aliens now? WTF, since when? Having said that, I did enjoy some of the battle sequences, through even then there's no blood to speak of, since the film was restricted to a PG-13 ratting, which is something NOT TO DO in a film that involves freakin' Aliens and Predators battling each other! In closing: both AvP flicks are heavily flawed films with a long list of negatives and only a few positives to speak of. AVP:R slightly holds the advantage due to Wolf, but that isn't saying much since he was basically the only good thing about the movie. In my opinion, Both films deserved the bashing they have and always will receive, and I think most Alien and even Predator fans will agree with me when I say that the concept of crossing with Aliens and Predators should've never happened outside of comic books and video games. I guess you could argue the fact that if done by the right director with the right script and the right team, then it potentially could've been different, but we'll never know that now, unless they make a AVP3, but that wont be taken into consideration for a while yet."

","Did Anderson have any clue when he directed this movie? Did he have any clue what-so-ever about the Alien franchise or about the Predator movies? The answer is no way. The dialogs are just lame, while the character development is zero, nada, zilch! How could they give him the rights to produce and ruin these two monumental legends like Alien and Predator? It would be pointless to start counting the flaws that the movie has when they were presented by all the other disappointed fans. No gore at all? This is what made Alien and Predator be the movies they were; Because of the GORE! Lots of GORE. The predator had to be a mysterious creature alongside the alien, but in this movie, we see so much of both of them that we wonder if we can have the phone number of mister predator... come on. I hope Anderson never ever touches the Directing chair and leaves us alone !"

","i thought this movie was going to be great, i mean come on, the two best sci fi film monsters trying to kill each other while the humans are just.. well, in their way ? it looked great. But then i watched the movie and it was terrible. The action sequences were cool and gore and slime was decent too. But the direction of the film was badly done. There is practically no character development for most of them. And there are many unnecessary kills as well. I got bored from the part they have to get of the temple. These are one of the films which are so rushed, it is like the director is so bored he just wants to finish the thing so quickly. And also... use CGI guys seriously, the predators looked like Indiana Jones action figures painted in dark colors. It does not match with the cool looking aliens with the stiff, fudge like predators who are meant to look cooler than the way they are in the film ! The end scenes are sufficient, but like 20 minutes before that ruins the whole sphere of the film. i am giving this a 2 for the pretty cool actions scenes let down by stiff characters."
"JimmyZappa","5","0","3","21 November 2009"," God no more....
","I skipped through it the first time cause it was boring me but after reading into the Alien stuff recently, I decided to give it another chance. Yeah, doesn't surprise me why I skipped on it the first time. The characters are terrible. I don't know why they elaborated on like 4 different sets of characters, they're all stock, one dimensional, and boring. Not one stands out like Segorney Weaver or Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Plus I dunno why they keep trying to do the whole horror suspense thing with these franchises. I think it only worked with the first Predator but even then it was better when the action kicked in. Aliens and Resurrection also worked better as action films and character studies with a FEW characters rather than a whole town. Like I care about a bunch of hicks and abercrombie and finch wearing kids getting gutted and skinned alive. They even managed to make the Predator and Xenomorphs boring. As cheesy as the first movie was, at least I give them credit for keeping a little bit of my interest intact. I don't know why they gave the directing helm to a couple of guys who only did commercials (they ain't no David Fincher). Or worse yet, the screen writing job to a hack.<br/><br/>The main problem is that they thought they were doing the franchise justice by throwing in some gore and naughty words to seemingly justify giving it an R rating without actually putting some quality work into it. Yea the last film was PG-13 but making guts spill a little and say ""**** you"" a couple of times didn't make this movie any better. The story is so poorly constructed, there's no suspense, there's no excitement, you just want a nuke to fall down and kill everything just so you can see the credits and move on with your life (oh wait, that's what happens). And its barely an hour and 20 minutes, not enough time to tell a compelling story (though thankfully at the same time i'm glad its short)."
"IamLegend_Zanth","5","0","2","28 September 2009"," A lukewarm sci-fi film and a big disappointment to alien and Predator fans
","Sigh................when i saw this movie for the first time, i was blown away, how, how could they possibly screw up a movie as bad as they did. I was speechless, any plot that the movie was supposed to have they threw right out the window. I mean, WHAT the hell were they thinking using the kind of storyline that they did. There was no depth to it, and they simply crammed it in there because they had to. It was pointless, except for explaining why the aliens were hunted. <br/><br/>The first mistake they made was. hiring Paul W.S Andersmuck, sorry, Anderscum, argh, Anderson. He is the director from those, thoughtless, awful, and pointless resident evil movies. That boy has no idea how to make a good sci-fi movies, and focuses WAY to much on the visuals instead of story.<br/><br/>their second mistake was the cast besides Sanaa Lathan (who i thought kicked butt) the rest of the actors were just out of place in the whole thing, saying stupid pointless things, making stupid decisions, and just being complete idiots.<br/><br/>Mistake number three was the predators. Come ON people!!!! They were AWFUL!! compared to the original predators, they were kittens! and......and LOL! HAHAHA!! they were Teenagers! There is NO WAY that the original ones would have given a second thought to having a human ""Side Kick"", or saving its life for that matter. There is a scene in the movie where i thought that they were going to kiss! They lacked the ferocity that they had in the previous movies, and their independence. They were always only on the ""half-alert"", and many times they were ambushed by aliens, and surprised by people! Anderson made them into the prey by the end of the movie! The aliens were tolerable, except that they were brainless a lot of the time. Which clearly insulted the aliens in the first two alien movies. I will give him this though, some of the fight scenes in the movie were pretty well done, and the visuals spectacular. Somebody who has never seen the original Alien and Predator movies may find this movie somewhat entertaining. This movie is not all bad. There is some impressive stuff that has to do with visuals and violence. But that is ALL. To those who have seen the original Alien and Predator movies, I would highly suggest that you stay away from this movie. The storyline, the actions and nature of the predators, and the dialogue is a huge kick in the groin to the other movies. It will insult your intelligence. If you have seen the original movies and liked this one................well...........what the heck, it takes all kinds.<br/><br/>A disappointing, very poorly directed film at the maximum, and a huge bucket of water thrown on the flames of the Alien-Predator legacies.<br/><br/>Ĕ¥Ё Дм ₤ệğəŋđ"

","I had really high hopes for this movie I confess. Big fan of both franchises, and I honestly thought that no wrong could be done. I do not think its nearly as bad as some people do, and if you watch it with the right attitude, there are worse ways to kill an hour and a half.<br/><br/>The biggest issue i take with it is the plot. It seems to be an excuse for the action, rather then make me interested in the outcome, or give a crap about the characters at all. Which could possibly be an unavoidable aspect of the idea to bring them together in the first place. I haven't particularly cared about the human characters in any alien or predator movie since the first one of both. Strike 1.<br/><br/>The second biggest issue (which i think, could be considered the fatal blow) is the fact that it was rated PG-13. Im not too sure why Fox or Anderson felt the need to tone down the violence, but in the case of both franchises, even though the movies gradually went down in quality, you could always be sure of some good blood and guts, but I wasn't even getting that. Even if a movie has a horrendous plot, I can brush that aside for some amusing death scenes. So, strike 2.<br/><br/>It gets walked, basically. If you really want to see some cheese and a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then go for it. I think it was a serviceable film, but all in all I consider it a wasted opportunity. for the next one (number 3) sign on a good director, cast it with whomever, make it in outer space, build some freaking tension, kick up the gore several notches and you may have a winner. These two great franchises do not belong together until you stay true to the roots of both of them."

The set is another strong point of the movie. Paul Anderson couldn't have picked a better area for the movie. Not to mention Anderson does a good job of making the story believable of how the aliens predators and humans are all down there.<br/><br/>Overall I think this movie deserves a ten because of all the reasons i just named like effects, action, and so on.

","Similar to Starship Troopers, you can tone down your IQ for this movie and enjoy it. What the movie does poorly is everything. What it does excellently is that it does everything to the *same degree* of failure.<br/><br/>A lot of terrible movies combine a lot of different ideas that don't flow contiguously. Transformers was an example of a would-be amazing movie that went horribly wrong because only only two actors were competent enough to fulfill their role, and neither had but a few lines and they were in the beginning. They were Shia's friend and his teacher. The movie is such trash that I can't stomach it unless I fast- forward through 90% of the movie, and that just isn't fun.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for movies like Transformers.

","A group of explorers set out on a journey to find a pyramid that is hidden miles below the earth's surface, only to find a raging battle is happening between Aliens and Predators.<br/><br/>When you see all the sequels made from the original Alien and original Predator, a prospect of a meeting in the same film sounded like a fantasy. But low and behold it was achieved in 2004 and was an exciting prospect considering the originals broke minds in 1979 and 1987.<br/><br/>However with the extra sequels made and the products available, they have become a franchise and when watching this Sci-Fi thriller, you will believe this was used to build on the already established brand, and was a product to test ride the ever improving CGI effects.<br/><br/>Die hard fans of the originals will not take too kindly to the cheesy reflection on how the creatures came to be alive and the ongoing battle they have been fighting for hundreds of years. This really puts a negative vibe on the two greatest creations in Sci-Fi history. Here they feel quite ordinary, not to mention a ridiculous turn from one towards the end, he was almost human it was that silly.<br/><br/>The reason Alien and Predator worked in their first appearances was because they were a mystery. Their presence was frightening as they hung around in the darkness without the humans knowing where they were, creating a horrific and very tense innuendo. Here we see the Predator about 10 minutes in, face on coming to earth and so the tone of the film is set and we know pretty much what will happen.<br/><br/>However despite the essence of inevitability, there is a tense and excitement to proceedings. The humans vs the Aliens and Predators are always exciting and the finely directed action sequences will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty predictable throughout but has a great ending. Not to mention the fact you see a finely balanced fight between the two monsters, with an interesting climax. The excitement is excellent as you can never predict which out of the two the superior is. Another sequel Requiem was released in 2007 but with this interesting and open ending, it is best to leave it where it is.<br/><br/>The humans are almost forgettable come the end. It is all about the creatures from other planets with their own lives and rules to live by.<br/><br/>Despite the fact this was made for profit and to show off the tools on the computer screen, it is an entertaining film with some impressive action sequences."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","0","1","6 September 2008"," OK fare
","First off, despite what you've heard, Alien Vs. Predator is not a terrible film. Is it a good film? No. It's just mediocre- about on par with 2003's Freddy Vs. Jason, another monster meets monster flick. In short, it's a B film with A film pedigree, and written at a comic book level- which is where the two species first met. Overall, it's better than the last two Alien film installments, almost as good as the first Predator (but that gets the edge because of Schwarzenegger), and the second Predator film I've not seen- mainly because of the fight scenes between the two titular combatants. It also serves as a prequel to the Alien series, and sequel to the Predator films, and thus bridge between both. The film's B filmness comes through right away, as there is no suspense to buildup to the unveiling of these thoroughly familiar monsters. Having seen the prior films there is no suspense nor terror in the hundredth time an Alien face hugger leaps out at a character, nor the first time one of the toothed vagina faces of the Predators is revealed. The audience is always far ahead of the characters, although this does allow a perverse pleasure of sorts, in knowing they'll die, and just guessing who will be done in by which species. The narrative and characterizations are throwaways, as well, and this film owes as much homage to B films as diverse as 1951'a The Thing From Another World, and 1997's Cube. Like the former the action takes place in frozen wastes (the Antarctic vs. the Arctic) and forces the characters into early unnatural camaraderie, and like the latter there is a maze like structure that traps the protagonists and ensures all but one of the characters' deaths. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (not Paul Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights and Magnolia fame) made his name in films, like Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil, based on computer games and Event Horizon, and it shows, but, again, the action is good enough so that few will care. And, as I said, the film is better than all but the two original franchise films, and James Cameron's Aliens- perhaps the best pure action film ever made. Compared to other films in its genre, where Universal's Frankenstein or Dracula, or Toho's Godzilla meet rival monsters, it holds up, and will hold up. Once the 'purist' fans' ridiculous moaning (reminiscent of those of the Star Trek, Star Wars, and James Bond film series) starts withering away the film will be an easy treat for most younger sci fi fans. The fact is it does not even try to have the depth that the original Alien did, and a lack of pretension can go a long way, especially in genre films- even when much of what is done violates ground rules the earlier films set....Why else would the film's tagline, 'Whoever wins, we lose', be meaningless since the Predators are clearly shown as the good guys- unless, as some bitter critics claimed, that line was actually truth in advertising aimed at its audience? Why else would a ninety minute film have eleven minutes of credits? Why else would the human experts be able to instantly decipher ancient mixed texts, yet not know to haul ass the minute the first non-terrestrial imagery or weapon appears? Why else would the only woman in the expedition be the only survivor? Oh, wait- Political Correctness explains that thin, petite women (especially if babes) like Sigourney Weaver, Jennifer Garner, and others can routinely kick the asses of men and aliens much larger and more dangerous and armed than they are. Then, again, it's Sanaa Lathan, so I can live with that result. Or why else would I, despite the titular combatants, find myself wanting to be her sweater?"

","AVP holds a unique place in my heart because it took a dump on not just one of my favorite 80's movies, but two. I thought it couldn't get much worse after Alien 3 or Alien: Resurrection. However, this movie gave me a whole new perspective.<br/><br/>AVP had just about everything I hate in a movie bad plot, acting, writing, etc., etc., etc. But I'm not even going to write about any of those. I'm not even going to write about how bad this movie massacred the plots of the original two movies. No, I'm going to write about my biggest pet peeve of all in movies the late 90's to 2000's ""action movie woman"" cliché. For that this movie was the epitome.<br/><br/>Let's recap the original Predator and Alien movies. The predator kicks everyone's ass (including a bunch of trained Army Special Forces like Jessie Ventura). Then Arnold, only after the predator voluntarily removes all it's weapons, uses his military training to narrowly kill the predator (and Arnold get's the crap kicked out of him in the process). In the Alien movies, Sigourney Weaver (after getting the crap kicked out of her) manages to kill the alien queen with the use of a massive cargo robot. And the queen still lays its eggs inside Sigourney eventually killing her.<br/><br/>Cutting foreword to the 2004 movie ""Alien vs. Predator."" A female professional ice climber single handedly (with the aid of a shield and spear made out of used alien parts) wipes out everyone. Those aliens didn't even stand a chance. Not only was she able to kick the most feared aliens and predators in the universe's asses without the use of any weapons, but the predator actually teems up with her so she can help protect him. Come on.<br/><br/>I'm not even complaining about equal rights bull. I'm complaining because the ""action movie woman"" cliché completely ruins movies and TV shows. There's this thing called a plot. When that plot fails to surprise you because of crappy cliché's that you can call a mile away it's not much of a plot."

","Let me clear out a fact before I begin. I saw AvP:R first.<br/><br/>Now, after years of fans of the original crossover comics wanting an Alien vs. Predator film to come out, in 2004, Fox gave the task to Paul W. S. Anderson (of Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil fame) to handle the making of this film.<br/><br/>A research group, sent by Weyland Industries goes to Antartica, investigates a strange heat oscillation found underground. In there, they find a pyramid with architecture reminiscent to the Aztecs, Egyptians and Hinduans, all in one single structure. The group finds out that the pyramid kept a live Alien queen to produce eggs, and as a form of human sacrifice, humans would voluntarily be hosts for the aliens so their gods, the Predators, could hunt them down, as a form of sport or ritual.<br/><br/>First of all, Anderson claims he wanted to keep continuity with the original Alien series by casting Lance Henrikssen (Bishop in Aliens and Alien3) as Mr. Weyland, somehow explaining the robots from the future are based on his appearance. But that doesn't really explain why then Ash (Ian Holm), from the original Alien, has nothing similar in appearance to Bishop. That's just some of the big inconsistencies with the original series, the other major one being the fact that the Aliens seem to have already been on Earth all along, making the whole previous Alien films' attempts to stop them from heading here quite useless.<br/><br/>Good stuff, there was. Nice effects, watching the Aliens in full CGI motion and fighting off fully equipped Predators, as well as seeing the Queen bigger and meaner (although this time is made to look like a T-Rex). The music was OK. Not too spectacular. Just average.<br/><br/>The fact that, first, a pyramid is found under Antartica and, second, that all the civilizations have based their architecture in the Predators is quite laughable.<br/><br/>The script does respect the majority of the facts and rules set in both Alien and Predator, but most of the dialog is just terrible. The acting is plain average or below. None of the characters are original neither likable. While most of the clichés from this type of films were actually due to the original Alien, even there was some originality and realism in the characters. In AvP, the whole cast are either scientists or marines with the sole purpose of being killed.<br/><br/>As for the PG-13 rating, well, let's not go there.<br/><br/>The truth is Anderson screwed up. He was so eager in making this ghastly form of prequel, that he didn't take into consideration details from the previous movies, neither correct his ever so present flaws as a filmmaker, these being script, acting and everything else."

","Im 28 years old and have been a huge fan of alien and predator movies. The 1st Predator and Aliens(from Ridley Scott and Cameron) are among my favourite movies of all time. I was a bit let down with predator 2 and alien resurrection and i was hoping this movie could bring a fresh re-start at both franchises.<br/><br/>This movie isn't has bad as people say it is. OK, its not a work of art but still its worth seeing.<br/><br/>I don't think many people understood this movie. People see too many plot holes that really aren't there.<br/><br/>People complain about not being realistic. People complain about the stupidity of a pyramid in the arctic, people complain about a lot of things but this is a sci-fi movie so between aliens that come from eggs and predators that look like crabs why is a pyramid in the arctic so hard to swallow? As some people say, predators are noble fighters and they still show that in this movie. They only attacked the aliens, the humans that had guns and the humans that had THEIR guns.<br/><br/>Predators are creatures that often come to earth to find a worthy human opponent but every 100 years they fight something way better. Thats aliens. Consider fighting aliens like the Predator superbowl or world soccer championship. They do it every 100 years and they build ranks on their warriors with it.<br/><br/>I really don't see a problem with the team up between the main human character and the predator. The predator is a good warrior and Alex is too considering she is only human with no big muscles or guns like arnie, danny glover or any marine from aliens. So she had the predator respect. Thats why he marked her in the end.<br/><br/>Another scene people complain is how the predators in the ship did nothing to help Scar to kill the queen. Of course they didn't. The same way all those predators on the ship in Predator 2 didn't kill Danny Glover after he killed one of them. They are in this game for the challenge. The ones that fail are not worthy warriors. Simple.<br/><br/>And for those complaining about the zoom in on fights making it hard to see anything...watch avp2 and you will beg to have avp1 fight scenes.<br/><br/>And the last complain is about the predators taking the body of the cacooned predator to the ship. People don't understand why they did it and say its was a dumb move from Paul Anderson. Well, i like to think it was curiosity from the predators to see and fight an enemy with the strength of both alien and predator.<br/><br/>The movie could have been better though. A little more gore, more action scenes, no teen rating and a better ending than the predalien thing would make it a really good action film.<br/><br/>After writing my interpretation of this movie i just want to say that i'm not a Paul Anderson fan. I didn't like Mortal Kombat or Resident Evil, but i have to admit that he did a good job with this movie. Not great but still a good job. And it gets even better after seeing one of the worse movies i haver saw (AVP2).<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10."
"Gunmaster45","8","0","1","19 February 2008"," Not as bad as everyone keeps saying.....
","(I don't work for fox and I'm not a crazed freaky fan) I watched this movie with all the warnings of bad acting, bad screenplay, poor script and all of the other stuff still in mind. I find the script rather interesting and think it's a unique way to join the two infamous species. The idea of having the predators breed aliens for right of passage hunting for 1000s of years is certainly creative. And some of the predators presence in history are the writers ways to explain unknown facts in history. Some say the director knew nothing of the movies. This is a lie. The special DVD proves he watched all the alien and predator movies and was a huge fan of it. A lot of work went into this movie that was left unappreciated by haters. Hardly any CGI is used in this movie which brings back the old school ways and adds to the realism and when CGI is used, it is convincing and well done. The fight scenes are full of action with cool choreography. The predators are well designed with improved technology and a lot of cool gadgets. Some say the gadgets are unfaithful to the series because they're different. Predators can get new weapons and technology just like any military on Earth can. And after watching all the alien movies, it can be said that the chest-bursters development is not an exact time, hence why some could burst really early. While the acting is not Oscar-worthy, everyone does a convincing enough job and Lance Henrikson's acting and presence in the film is a nice treat for fans of the Alien series. I can understand why some people hate it. It's unfaithful to the comics and has quite a few plot holes that don't fit with the other movies. But most of them are only obvious when a fan points them out, so no harm done. This movie is still enjoyable to me(a fan of both predator and alien movies) and I'm sure there are more who enjoyed it. A good flick for fans of the movies, or new comers. Forget what you've heard, it's worth a look. A rent is justifiable at least. (I own the unrated edition 2-disc set which makes the PG-13 movie an even more enjoyable blood and guts flick.) This movie is more appreciated if you know how much work went into building the sets, designing the animatronics and simply convincing fox to let the movie be filmed."

","I think that achieving the level of suspense from previous Alien movies was a tall order,simply because you cannot go on repeating the same scenario over and over again.<br/><br/>W.S. Anderson made a brave attempt to do a movie based not so much on the 2 franchises,but on the concept from a comic book instead...he also did make every effort to provide continuity and consistency with other alien and predator movies,but it was difficult to marry the two.<br/><br/>AvP at least has heaps of handcrafted art carved into the movie sets,it has bags of eye-candy not previously seen in any of the original movies - but was ruined by unconvincing characters/acting.<br/><br/>Although considerable screen time was given to character build-up,the viewer doesn't get to bond with either one of them.<br/><br/>The predator from the first movie also possessed hell of a lot more mystique and personality,compared to the ones in AvP.<br/><br/>All in all,Avp it makes for a good comic book to cinema conversion,and it looks very good.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 from me"

","I used to be a real fan of science fictions based on aliens. I used to look forward to the movie ""Alien versus predator"". I could say I had been dying to see that movie. However, my passion for the movie died down soon after I had watched it. The movie that I had been longing for was a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was the first thing to ruin it for me. As it has mentioned from its title, it is obvious that the movie is about combats between aliens and the predators. However, in the movie, it seemed that the human beings are the main characters. There are plenty blood-soaked scenes telling how the explorers are killed by both the aliens and predators, but only a few fighting scenes based on the battle was found throughout the grueling 2 hours.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie was just very unreasonable itself. Particularly the last scene showing how the giant alien killed the predator by stabbing him with its spiky long tail. As the predator inhaled his last breath and died, an enormous spaceship, which has been invisible, revealed itself. Troops of the same species of the predator marched out of it and carried the predator's body back to the spaceship. It is clear that they have been watching the battle, and they did not reinforce their comrade until he is dead. This is ridiculous!<br/><br/>Anyway, there is no doubt that the movie is not a worthwhile one. Therefore, I strongly discourage you from seeing this movie."

","Which is the worst film you have ever seen? To me. "" Alien vs Predator"" is surely next to none.<br/><br/>Firstly,it is the worst because of the poor chemistry of the director, Paul Anderson and his fellow cast. I must dub him the ""film T-Rex"", who had already ""destroyed"" a number of outstanding film series. Besides, the cast is brand-new and fresh. Worst of all, their performance is also extremely disappointing. There is no obvious characterisation for the actors in the film. It is just like watching a puppet drama with revolting background music.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is the worst because of the unreasonable plot and terrible script. Paul tried to develop a complicated plot but was in vain. Besides, Paul failed to show that he is a capable director. Is it possible to have a pyramid buried 2000 feet deep under Antarctica with aliens resting there for millions of years? is it reasonable for the intelligent predators to train their adolescents to be barbaric alien hunters? With the questions above you can imagine how illogical the film is! Finally, it is the worst because of the fighting scenes. Perhaps, Paul tried to make the film tenser and more exciting but i could hardly see any fighting between the aliens and the predators.His directing skills did a lot in spoiling the best part of the film.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, watching the film is a waste of time and money. Why the film can be shown in theatres for two months in Hng Kong remains an unresolved mystery!"

","This movie is absolutely the most funnily stupid entertaining movie i have ever seen. I wish to have a little chat with the writers about this film. They made the Aliens more advanced so it had a little chance against the Predator Species. Against the humans the Aliens have a big chance winning against the humans but if they don't upgrade the Aliens in this film then the movie would be finished in 25 minutes. If you have seen the Predator movies then you would understand that they would never be friends with humans ever and that they wouldn't join forces and do the same things together. Also since when have the Predator Species been able to understand human language and behavior exactly, sure they have a recordable dictionary but they have had to be at over 20 planets in their lifetime. In the end when the Pyramid explodes, it is probably the funniest thing i have ever seen when the Predator and the woman are running in slow mo away from the explosion. And in the end when the Alien jumps out of the predators chest with the Predator Horned Lips what the hell does it mean, that its on both sides now. And i cannot remember a Face Hugger going for that Predators Face. They have changed so much of the Predators advanced equipment it is like a whole new Species. If you are an ""Alien"" Fan, you may like this movie. If you are a ""Predator"" Fan then avoid this movie to the best of your ability. Sometimes Death is a better option than watching a bad movie."

I think that every one who is a true fan of the original Alien or Predator classics had prepared themselves for disappointment the moment they knew there would be AVP. I had! OK, the cheap, worn-out, easily-digestible plot developed as it should have - bunch of scientists (the cast was awful, thank God at least 'Bishop' was there :)), summoned to make the greatest discovery in human history. Oh, I almost forgot! Right off the start, when the guide was hanging down that rope at the Ice Falls and her mobile phone rang (and not only that - she picked it up and started talking while climbing up at the same time with her other hand)... that was ridiculous! <br/><br/>What I was not prepared to see though, was the scene in which the girl and the !predator! became buddies... That was outrageous! Not to mention the weapons he made for her! :D:D:D There were a few times that my jaw dropped quite literally! One of the most absurd moments was when he 'explained' to her that he was going to blast the eggs with his self-destruction mechanism. Or when they were flying out of the tunnel in that sled, or when the predator took off his mask and started making faces... You know, this is no way to see the PREDATOR, man! This is disgrace! I don't know who you are, but you can't do this to the predator! Shame on you, Paul Anderson!!! <br/><br/>I thought that I urgently need to confess to somebody how I felt after seeing this... crap.

But really that's besides the point. As soon as i saw the ad campaigns, which in the UK where ""Who will win?"", I knew that the potential of this film had been wasted. I didn't want a winner or a loser. I wanted a planet-wide pitched battle between the 2 hardest bastard races in the universe with poor humans doing what they could to survive.<br/><br/>But the fact is that even without my interest in these franchises (which has now been destroyed because of this film i might add) the film is just rubbish. I was pondering there for a while to try and do a useful critique of this film but it's impossible. The whole thing hasn't a single redeemable quality in it.<br/><br/>It's a sack of rotten testicles.

What do you get?<br/><br/>A commercial machine bred from a poor, if not laughable script, a few action scenes which unfortunately cost a lot (less cash for the producers, but they had to), a nice preprequel which in turn can breed as many sequels (one in 2007 - oh no!) as a gullible public will fork out.

It's an action movie so it's not supposed to contain very deep philosophical messages. But even action movies have to have some sort of standard.

","I'm a little behind the times, as I just saw this movie recently. I saw the comments of those who have faithfully followed the AvP comics, and read of all the ways that the director and writers fell short. I can understand, as I have been a loyal follower of the Xmen series for a long time now, and when those movies came out I couldn't help but mentally rip the script to shreds. However, I must say that there is a paradox for directors and writers when converting and abridging such a deeply complex series into a two hour movie. I've also seen this with the other series' I've read that were turned into movies. Like Harry Potter and sorts. I think the only director I've seen effectively do a book justice is Peter Jackson with LOTR, and that was largely to do with the fact that, in addition to being a very gifted director, he being given a blank check by New Line (only to be screwed later by them), and making a very long movie so he could fit in most of what Tolkien had originally written. Yet I have had to learn and except that most of the time that movies that are converted from beloved books and comics are not going to be close to what we envision when we read them. I think it is our job as the readers and fans to be patient with the process and not take the movie's shortcoming so personally."

However, ""Alien vs Predator"" is an exercise in mediocrity and worse than ""Alien"" (1979) and ""Predator"" (1987).<br/><br/>This film's main weakness is its story, or more appropriately lack thereof.

Although having said that, I'm not entirely convinced there was a script). The acting is abysmal, although admittedly the script can hardly have done anyone any favours. Certainly Ewen Bremner has fallen a long way from Trainspotting to this complete waste of time. I was genuinely excited when I heard this film was in production: as a concept, the potential was awesome. I don't read comics (more of a book person, myself) but I'm a huge fan of the Alien series (the first two at least) and Predator (we all know Predator 2 was duff). Fortunately, however, after the humiliation of Alien: Resurrection for which I shelled out hard-earned cash to see at the cinema, I was more cautious when this title appeared, and decided I'd have a look at a (possibly...ahem...illegal) screener before wasting my money. Emphasis on FORTUNATELY. As stated above, it's absolutely sickening that anyone involved was paid for this travesty. Particularly Paul Anderson. What a talentless arse.

","AVP: Alien vs. Predator is set in the year 2004 as one of rich industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland's (Lance Henriksen) orbiting satellites picks up a heat bloom under the surface of Antartica where further satellite imaging reveals an ancient pyramid structure buried deep under the ice. Before you can say 'how did it get there' Weyland has assembled a crack team of experts, has sailed out to the location & made their way into the mysterious pyramid. Inside the pyramid it seems to come alive & starts to rearrange itself at regular intervals, meanwhile a bunch of Predators have also entered the pyramid for a bit of sport, no not Weyland & his team but the the newly released alien creatures that provide much more of a challenge...<br/><br/>This American, Canadian, British, German & Czech co-production was written & directed Paul W.S. Anderson I have to say I have little love for AVP: Alien vs. Predator & think it's a pretty crappy film that has potentially destroyed two strong sci-fi/horror franchises all by it's own. The stupid & predictable script is terrible on many, many levels. For a start the human character's are awful, they die far too quickly & the only one who survives has to be the single worst character from a film made during 2004. I wouldn't have minded any other character surviving but her, the very fact she survived meant I didn't like this. Then there's the main reason why I wanted to see this film, the Predators & Aliens themselves. I have to say I was very disappointed again, if the basic story wasn't bad enough the filmmakers have turned the Predators into some sort of good guy while the Aliens are considered the evil ones although the Aliens themselves only do what comes naturally & what it takes for them to survive as a species, I mean they didn't invade the Earth did they? They were put there by the Predators to hunt so in fact I'd say the Predators should have been seen as the bad guy's because they are technologically advanced, free thinking & can make a conscience decision not to randomly kill & potentially wipe out an entire planet by infesting it with Aliens. The way the Predator & that awful woman teamed up at the end to defeat the Aleins was toe curlingly embarrassingly bad & the single worst plot device in any previous Alien or Predator film. To be fair to it the film moves along at a fair pace, it's not too boring & it provides a certain amount of stupid, moronic badly written entertainment but I just thought it was a really lousy film saved only by the presence of the Aliens & Predators themselves.<br/><br/>Director Anderson does alright but I didn't think the film was scary or exciting, it plods along at a decent pace but it's utterly predictable & some of the bits in it are really bad & just lessen both franchises. The first fight between an Alien & predator has great effects but it looks like some sort of horrible wrestling match as the Predator swings the Alien around & slams it into walls, I couldn't quite believe what I was seeing. I hated the ending, I hated the lone surviving human cast member (how was she able to stand in the middle of a literally freezing Antartica at the end wearing just a sweatshirt & not even get the shivers?) & I hated that the Aliens (my personal favourite monster between an Alien & Predator) were treated as something that had to be exterminated just because they existed. The special effects are very good & I loved the opening shot which resembled a silhouette of the Queen alien from Aliens (1986) but in fact turns out to be a satellite, there are other little homages to both sets of films throughout. The gore levels are none existent, this is PG rated kiddie fodder all the way.<br/><br/>With a modest sounding $45,000,000 (by Hollywood blockbuster standards anyway) this is well with good production values & great special effects. Apparently shot in just two & a half months in Prague in the Czech Republic. The whole film is a little too dark for my liking & is a bit dull to watch. The acting was awful especially Sanaa Lathan the female hero who I just thought was terrible in every way.<br/><br/>AVP: Alien vs. Predator is alright if your after some fast moving sci-fi/horror entertainment & don't care about little things like story or character's, those who demand a bit more from their films (even lowbrow sci-fi horror junk) then I suggest you give this turkey a miss. Remember the good times & watch Aliens & the original Predator (1987) again instead. Followed by Alien vs. Predator: Requiem (2007) which judging by it's plot outline sounds even worse than this if that's at all possible."

","I think the title of my comment says it all-- but I'll just fill out the 10-line comment requirement by pointing out that it fulfills the same pretty actors in pretty sets with goofy acting making goofy dialog ""vision"" that the director achieved when he made Resident Evil. Basically, he has been making the same movie with different props and plots-- except that the formula doesn't work with the ""aliens"" or ""predators"" (it didn't even work in the ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse""). As a direct-to-video release I would have given it 5 out of 10 or higher for big-budget production values-- but as a movie theatre experience, it certainly fails (even if it never aimed that high in the first place).<br/><br/>So as much as I enjoyed the special effects (& seeing the ""aliens"" and ""predators""), I have to agree with the other comments which pointed out that the penguin was about the most convincing thing in this movie."

","If I were to summarize it, this movie is categorized best as a relatively moderate to high budget B-movie: Tolerable special effects, 2nd rate storyline, bad acting, little character development, and plot twists that you see coming a mile away. Still, what do you expect from a movie based on a line of action figures, (Yes, I know about Transformers, but at least the makers of that movie had two Saturday morning cartoons to work from as well) and on top of that, directed by a guy who is often mentioned alongside Uwe Boll and Ed Wood as the one of the most inept directors in Hollywood? That being said, most movies in this category are ones that are too pathetic to sit and watch, or so pathetic you watch them and die laughing. This one was at least entertaining to some extent.<br/><br/>There is a lot of plot points borrowed from this movie's wellsprings (Predator and Aliens, both excellent movies!) that fans of those movies will recognize, though there is no indication of any connections in the plot to either of those stories.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as a rental.

"jmbwithcats","3","0","1","19 July 2007"," Only the penguin scored points with me.
","Alien vs Predator, by Paul Anderson ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Event Horizon"", ""Resident Evil"", musical score by Harald Kloser ""Day after Tomorrow"" brings two of the most popular adult science fiction monsters together for the first time, tying together not only our ancient civilizations but there's as well, in a action packed rite of Predator, and mankind.<br/><br/>Satellites pick up a heat bloom 2000 feet below the ice in the Antarctic, and Weyland (Lance Henriksen) through topographical imaging discover it is a pyramid. Weyland Bishop, who is having health concerns, wishes this to be his legacy: to be the first one there. He gathers together a team of the finest in their fields: a scientist (Raoul Bova), a military man (Colin Salmon), mountain climber (Alexa Woods), and archaeologist (Joseph Rye) to pioneer the expedition to the pyramid. What they awaken inside though through their ignorance is a hunt that's been going on for thousands of years, between the predator and the aliens.<br/><br/>The earth has been used by the predators since Egyptian times, where they taught the Pharoah's how to build the first pyramids, and allowed their people to be used as sacrifices for their rite of passage hunts, they were obligated every 100 years.<br/><br/>We see Predator and a woman become allies, in a fight against the aliens. It adds a lot to the story, but also really changes a lot, and so a lot of fans will be angry. Kind of like a lot of fans who were upset while wanting to see another hardcore predator hunt in the deep swamp of part 1 with Arnold Shwarzenegger, got only a predator in LA with Danny Glover. No one could live up to the hype of waiting 7 years for Aliens back on the big screen. and a whopping fourteen years to see Predator reintroduced. That aside, the movie could have been better, should have been better.<br/><br/>The resemblance of the Predator to the Rastafari has never really been questionable, with their dreadlocks, and powerful hunter stature. We also note that the only survivor through this ordeal, is a black woman, which makes this movie subjectively speaking, a black power film. Perhaps that was subconscious, or coincidence, it doesn't matter. I'm not bringing it up to make a race thing out of it, simply to denote similarities between African tribal cultures of Africa, with the Predator motif, and time line of the present film.<br/><br/>Overall I did enjoy the film, though truly felt the last half hour was rushed, don't know why... a lot more could have taken place without getting too long. Many scenes felt blank, a lot of dead air, which led me to find the directing lacking to an extent. Still, a fun movie with nice overtones of loyalty, and honor, which is a trademark of Predator films. A sequel might be in order here. Harald Kloser did a much better job on the music for Day after Tomorrow, this movie seemed to lack memorability in the music, being simply ""action movie music"" Predator stole the show. Well, thank heavens they gave that fluffeh penguin his full cameo scene... he had more frames in the movie then the queen alien. I hope fluffeh penguin has a good agent."
"dyl_brit","1","0","2","11 July 2007"," Why, oh why did they let Anderson loose on this?
","Its a shame that my first comment is going to be a negative one, but this film utterly deserves it..<br/><br/>Even though I (near enough) come from the same Newcastle as Anderson - his actions cannot be defended in this travesty of cinematic events, I don't particularly like or dislike Andersons work, admittedly he has done one corker (Event Horizon) which is a good film!, and I didn't mind Resident Evil either..<br/><br/>Anyway back to the film.. Ever since 1990 when the first ideas of AVP were spawned, fans of the two films eagerly waited with baited breath for 14 years to see this dire, abortion of a film.. I cannot understand why FOX chose Anderson with his track record of being a poor 3rd rate director, to unite two of their most successful films ever.. They should have held out for either John McTiernan (of the original Predator), Ridley Scott (Alien) or James Cameron (Aliens), nevertheless - I thought I would give it a chance - I mean how can you get it wrong? Aliens, Predator together - a sure-fire winner!, but Anderson makes it backfire horribly, the acting is mediocre, the quality of the sets are not too bad as in they don't look like a ""and here's one I made earlier"" Blue Peter job, and the direction is the worst of the worst.. After watching this film I felt that the originals that I had revered for so many years had just been violated and disrespected, - the painstaking effort and image for the films that McTirnan, Scott and Cameron had created lay in tatters, needless to say I was disappointed that I had just wasted 1.5 hours of my life (I could have been scraping barnacles' from the bottom of a boat - it would be more entertaining) I severely doubt that Anderson has even watched the originals - let alone spent time to understand and remember key elements, personally this should never have been made as it has now ruined the series, maybe some credibility could be clawed back by dismissing this effort and appointing one of the above mentioned directors to do the job right..<br/><br/>I don't think that Anderson is all to blame here - directing is just something he's not talented at, and this (the concept of AVP) is just above his level - he prob gave it his best, but he should have politely declined and left it to someone who could have put Aliens and Predator back on the top 100, I believe a fair portion of the blame also lays with FOX for appointing him as director<br/><br/>I don't condone downloading films and piracy (I have nearly 400 DVD films all original - If I like it I buy it and show my support) - but if you really want to see AVP - don't waste your money, borrow it, download it - but don't pay for it..<br/><br/>I really, really hope that the execs at FOX and Anderson read all these comments (all 113 pages of 98% negative comments) and both learn from their mistakes."
"mikeogjr","7","0","1","5 July 2007"," No ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"", but still good movie
","I think many people are unfair toward this movie, I thought it was great. It seems many people here are upset that there wasn't TONS of blood and gore and the whole movie wasn't fighting, which is unfair. It also seems to me that people are upset with the movie over it's rating. I do not believe blood, gore, sex, and high MPAA ratings make good movies. Granted, this movie is no ""Predator"" or ""Aliens"" but it IS in fact a good movie and should be given a chance.<br/><br/>The movie is about three Predators (or Yautja) that go to earth to participate in a ritual hunting rite. They have a temple under the ice in the Antarctic which suddenly activates, thus creating a heat source that was captured by a surveillance satellite owned by the Weyland Corporation (the infamous other half of the Weyland-Yutani Corp from the Aliens series). Thus Mr. Charles Bishop Weyland assembles a team to go to Antarctica to find the temple so he can make his mark in the world. Among the team is the hero, a lady named Alexa Woods who will guide the team down to the temple after the drilling team makes it through the ice.<br/><br/>The Predators keep a Queen Xenomorph on ice and whenever the temple is activated she is thawed out and ready to make eggs. Many people complained about the movie because the two Predators die. One of them dies rather quick and easy while the other puts up one hell of a fight before dying. The reason people were upset with this was because the Predators are suppose to be the ultimate hunter. But come on guys, the Xenomorphs are the ultimate pray as they explained in the movie. To kill a Xenomorph proves yourself worth to carry the mark of a true warrior. So whats so wrong about it being hard to kill a Xenomorph? Another thing that upset people was the gestation period of the chest burster and face huggers. But that as always seems to be a type of inconsistency through out the ""Aliens"" series. Kane's chest burster in Alien seemed to take a bit of time, but Ripley's in Alien 3 seems to take for ever to incubate. I think many people were just upset because the movie didn't follow the comics or the novel EXACTLY, but that as ALWAYS been the case with comic/book-to-movie productions.<br/><br/>Other gripes people had with the movie is that they not only used the smooth headed Xenomorphs (rather then the ones with the ridged head) but that the Predators looked too big and ""line backer"" like. But think about it, the Predator is a pretty damn big race of alien, so why can't some be bulky? Just because the ones in the first two movies weren't bulky doesn't mean there can't be be Predators. It was really their armor that make them look like line backers. And think about it too, in the first two movies they were hunting humans...like nothing to them. IN this movie they are going after the ultimate prey.<br/><br/>Other complaints you may read are about the so-called ""romantic scene"" between Alexa Woods and the Predator, but really there was nothing romantic about it. They had found respect in each other and that was about it. Many people said things like ""humans getting along with Predators? Wouldn't happen, you have to do something BIG to earn a Predator's respect, as seen in Predator 2."" But COME ON people, Alexa Woods KILLS a Xenomorph with the Predator's pike BY HERSELF so why wouldn't he have respect for her? She is a pitiful human and could be killed in an instant by a Predator, and she herself has just killed the ultimate prey. So of course the Predator respected her, thats why she receives the mark of the warrior.<br/><br/>Someone also said, ""a temple under 2000 feet of ice? Yeah right!"" Or something to that effect. But this was explained in the movie, as one man points out that early maps show the continent not completely covered in ice, which means it COULD have been possible for the area to be inhabited at one time.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't the best of course, as most of the cast is so new I had no idea who they were until seeing this movie. I have to admit, they are no Sigourny Weaver's, or Arnold's, or Danny Glover's, or Bill Paxton's, but in my opinion they get the job done well.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot, the Predators were cool, had awesome weapons. This movie isn't so much about dialogue between characters as it's a movie about discovering some of the origins of our past, and our connection to the Xenomorphs and Predators. Please please please please PLEASE give this movie a chance."

It just can't approach the early entries in the Alien or Predator series.<br/><br/>The flaws in this film have been addressed ad nauseum in other user comments.

","What made ""Freddy vs. Jason"" an entertaining, if mindless, movie is that they cut to the chase and in about 90 seconds explained how Freddy and Jason got to the same place. The problem with ""Alien vs. Predator"" is, it takes them about 90 minutes to do the same thing. Sure, there are some nice kills during the 90 minutes -- some woebegone expedition to the Antarctic stumbles upon the Predators and two-thirds of the crew don't make it to the movie's second hour. Some Aliens swing by to take care of most of the rest, and finally we have the sole survivor, Sanaa Lathan, teaming up with a weary Predator to kill the rest of the Aliens, including a Queen Bee Alien who's about the siz of a T-rex. In between there are a few chestburster scene -- you can't have an Alien movie with at least one, and a couple of those hideous-looking Predators taking their masks off (trust me, they wear those masks for a reason). I'm not going to lie, the movie could have been done better. You don't sympathize with ANY of the human characters; with the possible exception of Lathan, they're so dense that you're openly rooting for them to get killed. But there are enough kills that you can sit through it without being bored. And of course, the final scene leave the door open for ""Alien vs. Predator 2."" I give it a 4 out of 10."

","Being a longtime fan of both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" franchise, I'd long been awaiting this project ever since it was first hinted at in ""Predator 2."" But why did they have to give Paul W. S. Anderson the reins to it? A long series of comic books and computer games got the formula right so easily. It's simple. Aliens take over colonized planet. Soldiers are sent in to deal with them and inadvertently run into a clan of Predators, who are there hunting the aliens. Leave it to someone like Anderson to screw up a perfectly good concept. First off, he sets the story on Earth. Then he sets it in the present. The alien's designs are the stupid dinosaur look from ""Alien Resurrection"" which makes no sense and the predators look ridiculous in their pumped-up armor. The movie is also rated PG-13. I mean, you combine two R-rated franchises and get a PG-13 film? What the heck? There isn't a single chest bursting scene in the whole film. Setting the movie in an ancient underground pyramid/maze in the middle of the Artic obviously happened more because Anderson seems to dig that sort of thing then because it made any sort of sense. But if the movie had some awesome creature carnage I could have forgiven all that. The first battle between an alien and a predator is pretty cool and easily the best moment in the film. But Anderson did one thing that completely prevented me from getting any joy from the film. He messed with the mythology. You NEVER mess with the mythology. Apparently the aliens were breed by the predators for hunting reasons. Why? That doesn't make any sense in the context of the series! That's like going back and saying Batman's parents are still alive or something! All the mystery is gone! This movie could have been a fan boy's wet dream ala ""Freddy vs. Jason"" but by giving the project to an ignorant self-indulgent twit, it does nothing but raise the ire of geeks everywhere.

My suggestion for the sequel, which i expect they'll make, would be some very silent and gruesome violence of aliens and predators slaughtering humans and each other, no ridiculously cheesy dialog, affectionate understanding predators, PREDATOR: the word means kill, not work together for common goal and peace and survival, NO!, Predator means your still gonna try to kill even if all of your limbs have been slaughtered, that was the true Predator of the original two and also the aliens of the first 3, exclude the weird genetic touchy feely alien: resurrection, the sequel will achieve success if its epic and horrifyingly not bad or generic but original and based close to its rich and uneasy roots"

If they were angry with humans for taking the weapons, why do they only kill them and not recover those weapons? And the confidence between the girl and the Predator! Come on...

","Everyone who grew up in the 80s remembers these franchises (whether you loved them or not is a different story). I think that at one time or another every kid who saw these movies thought, ""man, it would be cool to put the aliens against a predator."" In fact, there were comic books, video games, etc. about what would happen. Naturally, when I heard they were making this film the child inside me though ""that's gonna be awesome."" However, when I saw it the adult in me (also the b-movie critic in me) said, ""geez that's awful."" It's not that it was poorly made (the special effects were very good), it's just that the story was kind of dumb and it was rather dull.<br/><br/>The plot is that a Weyland Company (the company from the Alien series) satellite finds a heat signature in Anartica and sends a crew to investigate. They know that there's an ancient pyramid buried under the ice, but don't realize that it's an ancient hunting ground for the predators. The predators used the pyramids to hatch aliens (using human hosts, you know, the chest bursters) and hunt the aliens. Essentially, it was a giant game ranch for the intergalactic nimrods. Of course, all hell breaks loose and the crew is either mowed down by the predators or become hosts for more aliens. I won't give away the ending, but will say that it is kind of lame and somewhat predictable.<br/><br/>The acting was alright, as was the direction and special effects. I think that my major criticism is that the whole thing is that their execution of the plot was lacking. All the twists were somewhat predictable and it seems that most of the shock value is decreased because if you've seen the other movies you know what is going to happen. It's not that they didn't try or have some good ideas, but it just wasn't that great of an idea."

In the Blue Corner we have the Preditors a race of hunters that take their work very seriously with high tech weaponry that would make Robocop seem tame.

","As perhaps the most loathed of all Alien and Predator movies combined, AVP has often been the easy target for screwing up both the Alien and Predator movies.<br/><br/>Like Alien Resurrection before it, AVP puts its focus on fun and mindless action scenes and off of logic and a real storyline. In that regard, AVP isn't much more than a silly but fun spin off mostly to the Alien movies. The action in AVP is about what you'd expect out of a movie with aliens and predators in it; action scenes with both that end with results that will have someone complaining.<br/><br/>AVP tries to capture a plot that is supposed to seem good to the audience. But after the last Alien movies I think that we can all agree that the so-called story in AVP almost purposely tries to confuse fans of both movies. If AVP really sets any real winner to the two foreign-to-Earth creatures watch the Predator movies, then watch this followed by the Alien movies. The first few scenes of LV-426 in Alien should tell you who won the ""war"" AVP creates.<br/><br/>AVP sets the audience up with the impression that there will be sequel with the inclusion of the ""Predalien"", the new addition to the Alien/Predator species. After the style of action that AVP contains and the plot it sets forth, you can expect AVP2 to probably be focused on the Predalien giving the predators a run for their money. The prediction: another mindless action movie without much purpose for storytelling.<br/><br/>As for AVP itself, the movie is worth watching, but the storyline it has just begs for a shredding in the Alien movies. Along with that, the Predator fans will face the fact that the serpent-like aliens over-powered the predators. Only a select few will find AVP to be at least enjoyable, and I'm one of them."

"mathw-1","8","0","1","22 December 2005"," soooo close.....but yet...
","Standing on its own merit, and not counting the previous Alien or Predator movies, this film succeeds quite well in a variety of areas. Don't get me wrong, I like the film, and found it entertaining. I especially enjoyed how the plot attempted to weave a bit of human history, such as the extinction of the Mayans, into the Predator mythos. I felt that the actors gave a good performance for the most part.<br/><br/>Yet, like many, I can't help but be stumped by the sudden and surprising complete personality change in Lance Hendrickson's character, Weyland. For the entire series he has been an obsessed megalomaniac with only one goal, capture Aliens to bring to earth for ""The Company"" bioweapon devision. He has gladly sacrificed entire ships of people to get what he wanted....and yet now he's somehow on some quest to save his soul and to make the ""great discovery""? It's a complete personality flop for the character, and I must say that his character being portrayed as having no clue about the Aliens whatsoever, makes absolutely no sense at all.<br/><br/>Likewise, the film has a history, which this particular film seems to fall short of in a sense. Aliens have a gestation period, and true no one has ever stated just how long that is...in the film it was like the Aliens were being born as chest burster's in a matter of a few minutes, whereas in all previous films in the series, it took several hours at least for an alien to mature from the time of implantation to bursting out for the world to see. Sadly, that particular part of the film always comes across as being ""rushed"".<br/><br/>I did find it interesting that they kept true to form on just how deadly the aliens are. The film showed that in spades when the inexperienced Predator youth's were getting caught and sliced and diced up easily by them. Yet...something seems lacking, even for a young Predator going through a right of passage, you would think they would be somewhat better prepared for their foes. The first 2 Predators that go down, seem to have been killed way too easily by the Aliens.<br/><br/>It has never really been shown just how intelligent the Aliens are, but it does seem odd that they have the intelligence to go and free the Alien queen from her prison, by using the acid blood of one of their own...and yet these hunts have supposedly been going on for how long? It doesn't seem to add up, that they would never have attempted to free her previously using the same method.<br/><br/>That being said, I still find it an enjoyable movie to watch. I would even be willing to see a sequel, were it to ever happen. I doubt we will ever see Riply in the series again, but you never know. This particular film is leaps and bound better than either Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection. Honestly, prior to this, the 2nd movie...the one called Aliens, was the last good one in the series to me... Alien Resurrection has some great potential but it falls flat on its face....and comes across as something more comical than frightening.<br/><br/>Alien 3 was a bit better, but not by much. After the huge build up of the romance between Riply and Hicks in Aliens, and the huge story build up between Riply and Newt....killing them both off within the first couple of minutes in the movie makes absolutely no sense to me in Alien 3. It also seems to flop, that one solo alien, from a dog no less....is able to decimate an entire colony of hardened criminals with minimal effort.<br/><br/>If you can ever find it, there is a fan written script floating around the net called ""The Survivors of Aliens"" or something similar. It's well worth a read, and in my honest opinion, would have made a miraculous sequel to Aliens, far better than Alien 3 or Alien Resurrection ever did."

Anderson's penchant for ripping off the terrific Canadian film ""Cube."" He did this in his previous film ""Resident Evil."" I chalked the derivative scene in that film up as homage, but this time the theft is so obvious and on a much larger scale, that I'm shocked litigation isn't pending. It will be interesting if to see if he can make a film that is entirely his own, now that there's nothing left for him to steal from ""Cube."" It's been a long wait for fans of both the ""Predator"" and ""Alien"" series and, for the most part, the end result was worth it.

","I was pretty reluctant to even watch this one, simply because I love both the Alien- and Predator-franchise and didn't want to spoil it for me. After all: I kept reading so many negative reviews that I was surprised not to find AVP in the bottom 100 list on IMDb.<br/><br/>Alien 1 and Aliens both were brilliant films. Totally different from each other, but both great. Alien 3 was not for me and Alien 4...oh well.. lol! Predator 1 was a great Arnie-vehicle, a typical late 80s action-blockbuster with tons of pumped up macho-""actors"", big explosions, shell-casings flying around and a huge body count. Predator 2 was like a rabid version of part one, with both gore and body count increased by a fair margin.<br/><br/>What they all had was blood and gore in amounts ranging from ""adaequate"" (Alien 1) to ""nicely overdone"" (Predator 1+2).<br/><br/>This, AVP can't offer. It's painfully obvious from the first kill that this film was either cut down to or always intended to be a PG-13 show. Hell, they even ""cut"" the famous Predator tag line (you know, the one about ugly people who make out with their mothers).<br/><br/>After a while however, this bothered me less and less. I would've loved to see an R-rated AVP of course. After all: These are the two nastiest killers in recent movie history slugging it out. Lest I forget: We do get to see some nice blood and guts, but the blood is all green (Predator's) or yellow (Aliens'), and the guts/brains also belong to Aliens and/or Predators. But: No trophy-taking/skinned victims, no real chest-burster-scenes, no huge gunshot wounds...<br/><br/>What the movie really lacks is sophisticated production design and a budget. This was obviously shot on a tight budget, and while the FX and sets look good, the lack of money does show. Everything looks quite good, but I couldn't stop thinking that with a bigger budget, everything would've looked a lot better.<br/><br/>Let me conclude with the good stuff: Story is OK (for a movie like this), bringing the two...err..three species together in a relatively elegant and plausible way. Acting is mostly good also and the effects are (as mentioned earlier) pretty good for such a ""cheap"" movie.<br/><br/>The first fight between the two creatures kicks butt, and should satisfy most of the Alien/Predator fans, it did satisfy me anyway.<br/><br/>So, bottom line: Don't be confused by all the negative reviews, this movie isn't all that bad. It's not top-notch action-material either, and I'm positive that with other artist and more money involved, the AVP-idea could be turned into one kick-ass movie."

Then the whole idea of having a crew of 100 more people go find the land, bad! Anderson kills off eighty percent of the cast in the first half hour! The predators kills a whole platoon and alien eggs hatch, catching another platoon which is pretty stupid because in the original Alien it's quite a while for the alien to pop out of Kanes chest. But when our platoon wakes up the alien burst right out for welcome, stupid! And that brings the whole idea later for an alien hatching itself into the predator, what a joke! We have origins of the predators which ruin the characters and the question of how the Queen Alien was chained up for a long decade. Then here comes the Predator and Alien fighting, bad action sequence. Not one bit of good fighting techniques. Aliens head is slashed off, Predators die from Alien acid blood and blah. And Anderson, you were stupid to have the Predator work alongside a human. Anderson you are sure one heck of an idiot. The cast is bad, horrible acting. Boy, Anderson you have killed.

Honestly I am hoping that they are making a Alien vs Predator 2 because the part at the end was like the beginning to a whole new adventure! I loved the part when the Predator cut the alien up and made weapons for the woman. I especially loved the head/claw she wore. My brother thought that the aliens were going to win the war and I thought that the predators were going to win. It turned out that I was right. My other brother saw the movie in theaters and he said that it was awesome! I agree with him 100 percent! Well hope to see another one soon, I can't wait!"

","While showcasing the skills of a predator, and giving the history of why the creatures are among civilization, it also shows their destiny. The movie shows the role humans play in that destiny, and where aliens fit in. I was only disappointed with the ending. I was hoping the special edition would show deleted scenes or more content dealing with the ending. The special effects rival those in the Predator movies, which have become a standard for many movies of this genre. I took my wife to see this movie in the theater and she hadn't seen any of either movie and was thrilled with the action. I expected a dud, because so many reviews had been negative, but this movie just reinforces my theory that you can't expect the experts to provide the opinion you need to go with before seeing a movie."

","Most of the reviews here are accurate and touch on the strengths and weaknesses of the movie. I am not going to give you a blow by blow.<br/><br/>I did not like it. I expected much more. The acting by the ""humans"" was in my opinion, as lame as it gets. I wanted them all implanted by a face hugger so they could spawn Twin Chest Bursters. <br/><br/>The Predators, who are suppose to be such super hunters are cast aside like...well, humans. Pretty laughable. These must have been the ROOKIE Brigade, come to earth to have some fun. The Aliens grow at WARP speed. Inside humans, they mature in a matter of seconds. In other cases, not for hours ;-). Holy inconsistency Batman!<br/><br/>In the sacrificial chamber, 7 eggs pop up and not one shot is fired until the face huggers are, well, hugging a real good time! Laughable. We have guns, lets not use them. Lame.<br/><br/>Here is your spear and shield. Lame....<br/><br/>I also really dislike an actor who can't be understood. The English accent nerd is tough to understand at times. The tough guy guards accomplish almost next to nothing. It is all LAME! <br/><br/>Lame. The whole movie is lame.<br/><br/>I honestly can't believe the idiots who have a franchise concept can ruin it so flagrantly. I only saw the movie once and will not spend another dime on it. I typically will see a good movie more than once and a really good one I will purchase.<br/><br/>This dog deserves to be put down, mercilessly.<br/><br/>Nice sets and a good topic are simply not good enough. This is a typical Hollywood production where the over stuffed suits ruined what could have been a block buster movie for fans. PG-13? Good for you, Hollywood. Hope you enjoy all the NEGATIVE publicity. <br/><br/>I won't bother seeing a sequel (AVP 2?) unit I read the reviews. The only way to stop this type of movie trash is to NOT give them your money. Maybe then, they will listen and make a good film.<br/><br/>If you have not seen the movie, wait to see it on TV. Don't waste your money or time. Also, some of the positive reviews are as lame as the movie. This isn't a kids movie. It isn't suppose to be. Giving it PG-13 to make it so in order to cast a wider money grubbing net is LAME and oh so Hollywood.<br/><br/>Go spend your money on foreign made films. They are so much better than the crap coming out of Hollywood."

","I took the chance and watched this film; mind you I was somewhat apprehensive from all I had read about it. I should know by now not too take too much notice because everyone is different in their views. Like I was with mine and I didn't think Alien V Predator was all that bad. It had pretty good GCI effects and the storyline was sensible which kept me interested. The characters were all fairly decent, and I thought it was a nice touch to have Lance Henriksen cast. I do like him as an actor. <br/><br/>The film starts off with a group of expertise professionals investigating an unknown construction (pyramid) located in Antarctica. The only problem, it's about 200 ft below the surface. The situation becomes quite interesting when the aliens and predators start to appear. As I said, ""not a bad effort"", I give it a 7/10."

Yes it was generic - yes it was a pure chase in the dark by big monsters - but it did give me that ""its behind you"" fear buzz - and if I were a bit younger I would be hiding behind the sofa.

You know what to expect; lots of violence, nasty trap and little story. <br/><br/>Well, I can proudly say that fans of the originals should not be disappointed. The film may be slight on realism (several times the camera cuts away to get the PG-13 rating) but there remains a lot of violence and gore within to prove fans wrong.

OK so the acting is not the best and the plot is sacrificed for fighting but I really enjoyed it! Anderson is faithful to Predator and Alien folklore and he has respected that his audience will be mainly gamers or fans.<br/><br/>Anderson has received a lot of stick for his films but they are always watchable and I will watch AVP again just for the cool fighting and salutory references to previous Alien and Predator films.

","Actually I liked it. I don't know why Andersons Movies are all getting bashed by critics. They are entertaining, they do their job and so did AvP. I never liked Predator that much, but Alien I love since the series started. In this case its not a piece of art (Alien 3) or a comic fantasy (Alien 4) and neither the creepy Thriller (Alien 1) or the Republican Heroic Action Feast (Alien 2). It was just a fun to watch, if you did not mind all the little unlogical elements (Aliens breeding and growing in an incredibly short time for example).<br/><br/>The acting was, well, okay and the FX were great. You never saw the Aliens that close and detailed. So, me as a Fan, I got what I wanted and expected. A little more thrill woulds been not bad, but hey, it entertained me from beginning to end.

"thatwasrudeofme","Null","0","1","12 March 2005"," Not THAT bad
","This movie didn't deserve the slaughtering it got. <br/><br/>There were some genuinely heart pounding action sequences such as the one-on-one fight sequence with the Alien and Predator,the jumping, the diving,punching,scraping,slicing,whipping,throwing,roaring-pure genius and entertainment. And the cleverly shot piece featuring the Predators preparing for a typical day out instilled real excitement and when they first got busy with bodies flying around at will I was shuffling in my seat like a small child with worms. My favourite sequence, the frozen Queen and her return from he chilly enclosure was well shot and allowed for some admiration and joy on seeing the return of our beloved ,with the billowing fires surrounding and the wails from her majesty all adding to a suspense filled and exciting prospect for a downright cool encounter with her galactic buddies. And although it has to be said the dialogue was a little weak it still provided some clever ideas,such as taking the ancient cultures and using them to try and give the involvement of the predators and indeed the movie as a whole some meaning and merit. <br/><br/>Still the main problem was the movies pace and subtlety,there were moments were I felt fear and anticipation but it was ruined by the slow and bland introduction of the creature that I so wanted to jump suddenly from the darkness snarling and writhing around. If the dialogue took a less frantic pace and allowed for stronger character building and more suspense rather than throwing so many aliens and predators in at once that they looked not dissimilar to a Metallica moshpit then the movie could have really held its own against its predecessors.<br/><br/>Yet when the action ensued and out little buddies were scurrying about at will there were some fantastic action sequences,the best of which was when the big girl (the queen) busted her way triumphantly to the top and caused pure havoc similar to her short smash in ""Aliens"". This along with some loose connections to the previous movies allowed me to sit back and relax and enjoy this movie,although I felt it could've been better it still provided action and entertainment and deserved a second viewing which I actually appreciated all the more."
"WarriorAlien","8","0","2","6 March 2005"," An Underrated Movie that Lives Up to the Franchises that Spawned It
","Alien vs. Predator has been given crap by avid fans of both the Alien and Predator franchises ever since Fox gave the go for Paul Anderson to direct it. As bad as people say he is, Anderson is no where down to the level where Uwe Boll is, but that's another story. Although his interpretation of Resident Evil was bad in my eyes, I gave Paul the run of the doubt and sat down to watch AvP the day it came out.<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie kind of reminded me of how Jurassic Park opened, with the main characters being gathered by an old man who's head of a company. However, this isn't any run in the park with the raptors. Underneath a small island off the coast of Antarctica, a pyramid has been discovered.<br/><br/>Lance Henriksen plays Charles Bishop Weyland, the head of Weyland Industries (providing two nods to the Alien series: Henriksen played the android Bishop in the second Alien movie, Aliens, and Weyland-Yutani was the evil company who always wanted their mittens on an Alien), has assembled a group of scientists, oil drillers and mercenaries to stake the claim. Sanaa Lanthan is Alexa Woods, a mountaineer and environmentalist requested to guide the team. Raoul Bova is Sebastian de Rosa, an archaeologist. They and others make their way to the pyramid, where someone, namely the Predators orbiting Earth above, have already tunneled to. From then on, the crap hits the fan.<br/><br/>The pacing in AvP is excellent for a movie of its short length (100 mins). Nothing drags on, and lighting and sound are used to their highest potential. CGI is not overly used, just for some long or fast motion shots where it's required. In other words, almost every shot of the monsters you see is a man in a suit. And good suits at that. Tom Woodruff Jr., the man in the Alien suit since the equally underrated Alien3, plays all the Aliens, specifically Grid, a heavily cut-up Alien with a sadistic edge to it (providing a throwback to the interstellar psychopath of the first Alien movie). Ian Whyte honours the late Kevin Peter Hall, who played the Predator in both Alien movies, as Scar, a young extraterrestrial hunter trying to ascend the ranks of its people.<br/><br/>Overall, AvP does not get the respect it deserves. Fans bash it for not being as scary, but that's not really giving the film credit. The Alien series ran out of scares after Alien3, with the unneeded fourth installment, Alien: Resurrection. The Predator movies provided me with more of a ""Wow"" factor than any fear in particular. With this in mind, Anderson capitalized on the action, proved in a particularly excellent sequence where the pre-scarred Grid takes on one of Scar's hunting buddies. Anderson has made a great movie, which although not as scary as the Alien Quadrilogy, still holds a bright candle up to.<br/><br/>See AvP. It grows on you . . . or at least impregnates you with an Alien fetus. Sorry."

","OK,this franchise had SO MUCH POTENTIAL! Pathetic is what this turned out to be. All the Alien and Predator movies were R, so this SHOULD have been NC-17! Anyway, to start the pathetic story lines and complete disregard for both franchises, I will pick apart the movie piece by piece.<br/><br/>#1. Predators love it when the weather is sweltering. So the setting is in Antartica. Perfect.<br/><br/>#2. Aliens will not attack a host. So the queen does her best to off the impregnated Predator. Right on!<br/><br/>#3. Aliens generally take days if not a week or more to develop once implanted in the host. These take less than 10 minutes. Awesome!<br/><br/>#4. The Predators can tell if someone or something is a host. So they take it aboard their ship. Par for the course.<br/><br/>#5. The queen is kept chained under frozen water to survive for long periods of time. So what do they to ""kill"" her? They chain her under frozen water to a water tower. Now we have an opening for a crappy sequel. A V P 2 h e r e w e c o m e . I c a n ' t w a i t .<br/><br/>#6. It ""explains"" that humans are told to build the pyramids to use for the hunt. No humans live on Antartica, except by PURE chance and the Predators know that. So why on Earth build a pyramid there??? Brilliant.<br/><br/>#7. Weyland Industries travels millions of miles from earth hundreds of years in the future to get some Aliens when there are plenty right here in Antartica? Come on. The modern day setting was a complete waste.<br/><br/>Good points in the movie.<br/><br/>Only 1. The Predator ""teamed"" up with the chick to fight some Aliens because she was able to cap one, and got the Predator's respect. I can see that happening.<br/><br/>All in all, a totally wasted effort that had so much potential, yet was so horribly done. This could have been a movie for the ages, instead it was a big steaming pile."

The Aliens are doing what Aliens do, the Predators are doing what Predators do, and the humans are doing what they normally do in any of these franchises, Dying! That this movie ever got made, is a credit to Paul Anderson's enthusiasm and determination. The studio obviously had a target audience, and I don't think it was entirely made up of fans of the original movies. This movie has much more a feel of the AVP computer games. The age classification compliments this idea. As a HUGE, HUGE, fan of all the original movies, I am happy to welcome Alien Vs Predator into the family. I would like to see a Director's Cut, because knowing Paul Anderson's love for these beasties, there is a lot more footage out there. Anyone who wants Shakespeare, go see Shakespeare.

","It tried to fit too much into too short a timeframe. Didn't allow for much development. Yet it moved along briskly with only a few obvious flaws. The humans died quickly but the predators didn't have many victories either. Two of them bombed out at first encounter and the last was a goner after his first kill. Fortunately for this last one, aliens gestate much slower in a predator than in a human so he was able to rack up a few more scores before his waterloo. I didn't get to count much but it seemed there were more aliens than hosts to create them. And how did big mamma survive the explosion and cave-in? I loved the scene where the alien slithered menacingly up behind a predator, ready for the coup de grace. A flash of movement from the predator and then for a couple of seconds the alien stands transfixed, it's lips making funny little movements. Then it's head falls of and it collapses. OK, so it wasn't original, but still... Overall, it was a watchable movie. Big mamma's down there in the depths somewhere waiting to be discovered... for a sequel? Oh yes, and that middle name of Bishop for the man who played Bishop in two Alien flicks."

Anderson is usually not one of my favorites but he made this enjoyable for many people.

","I have to give Paul W.S. Anderson credit. He can do some pretty incredible things in his movies. Where as Event Horizon was a near gore-fest, Alien Vs. Predator lets you imagine what it might be by not letting you see it, by doing quick cuts. It leaves a lot to the imagination. Thing is, if this is supposed to be the prequel to Alien (as I have read on numerous sites) how does the alien get on to LV426? Still, they might leave that for the sequel (hopefully!). The CGI effects are better than those in Resident Evil but I got the feeling that they were trying to rush the movie to cash in on the two franchises of Alien and Predator. Also, it's too short (101 mins for us brits) and the fights don't last long enough. What there is, it's a quick stab and thats it. Over. Finito. Although, look away now, the final fight is quite awesome but again it's quite short. As soon as it's started, blink and it's over. But, Paul Anderson can take even the worst script and make it a belter (Resident Evil again). Although, the characters don't have enough emotion to them at all. It dosen't seem to want you to like them. On the up side, the Predators weapons are cool enough. The new spinning blade is a novel touch. I just wish that they kept the blade from Predator 2 as well. Now that WAS something. This shoulder cannon has now had a stunning blue shine added to it and has been given some oomph to it. But it isn't that bad problems aside. There is a fair lot in it. But they've compacted it too much and should have given it room to 'breathe'and mature, shall we say."

","The Alien films, as they stand as a whole, are good. Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 are all wonderful films that will stand the test of time. Alien Resurrection is mediocre at best.

I went into it knowing it would be bad, and guess what, I was right.<br/><br/>It's nothing more than an action flick with a few aliens thrown around. It doesn't have the charm from the cast, nor does it provide ANY screams, or even ATTEMPTS to scare it's viewers. Any characters that are even a hint of interesting (Which, there are VERY few) are killed off fairly quickly. When they are killed off, it's rather confusing. With the pyramid shifting and all that junk, it's hard to tell who's still alive and who had been taken.<br/><br/>The basis of the film isn't bad, since the connection was already made in Predator 2. This could have actually been a good film, but in all reality, it could have easily been Predator 3. This is the Predator's film. Even the fights between the two weren't interesting, nor was the whole shifting of the pyramid chaos. It's odd, because, by the movie's standards, they were only in there less than thirty minutes. I've heard there's an uncut, R-Rated, Director's Cut coming out sometime soon, so perhaps this will tie up the loose ends and flesh out these characters a bit more.<br/><br/>Is it worth watching, even if you're an Alien fan?

","This movie is really enjoyable, if you love the pain of watching horrible, horrible movies. Or you are a moron. Or you are a masochist. Or maybe a combination of the above. I can't even begin to explain how horrible this movie is. The filmmakers took two of the coolest movie monsters ever and made them terribly lame. And, the special effects were good, but to keep a PG-13 rating, they couldn't show any good fight scenes. So, the big fight between a predator and an alien was just a confusing blur of foggy-lenses and quick camera moves. It was infuriating, and I'm not even a big fan of either series. Also, the story and script sucked. The plot holes are enormous. Whoever wrote it has never even met a scientist, because the ""scientists"" in the movie are retarded. The dialog is also pathetic. Oh, and the acting is ridiculous. Everything about this movie is wretched. Only see this is you want to laugh really hard at how stupid the filmmakers are. I pray they never make another movie again or, at least, its not released in the US."

","In a search for remnants of ancient civilisations, a group of scientists set off for the frozen lands of Antarctica. There, they are entangled in a fight between two races of extra terrestrial life forms, our favourite gremlinoid aliens from the Alien quadrilogy and the famous Predator from the self-tittled Arnold Schwarzenegger hit film. In a film such as this, direction and scenario are everything. The acting really doesn't have anything to do with it. Focusing on that, Paul Anderson's Alien vs Predator is a good movie. Something you'd probably rip off the net but not definitely something you would pay $30 for. Where it fails is that it presents the aliens as pitiful, slave-creatures and the predators as technology-freaks that cannot survive without their precious arsenal. And the tag line ""whoever wins, we lose""? What's with that?! What does it have to do with the film?! Good direction, good fx, won't pay money for it, thank you."

","OK, first off, no one is going to say AVP is worth an Oscar nod...for anything.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I actually found myself enjoying this movie. Sure, it could have used more gore. Sure, it could have used more suspense (ok, it could have used suspense, period.) On the other hand, can anyone honestly tell me that either franchise has been gory or suspenseful recently? Let's face it, Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection were about as scary as a birthday at McDonald's, and the Predator movies were more about action than suspense.<br/><br/>Hence, AVP is an action movie, not a horror movie. If you want a horror movie, see something else. If you want to see an interesting treatment on the Alien v. Predator theme, see this movie. (I recommend renting it, as owning the movie is not necessary.) <br/><br/>The Plot: Weyland Co. picks up a heat signature in Antarctica, and sends a team of scientists and security guards to check it out. They find a pyramid of unique design, complete with hierogylphs telling the pyramid's story. The team enters the pyramid, accidentally frees the Alien xenomorphs from stasis, and get themselves killed in the process.<br/><br/>That is, those who aren't killed by the Predators...<br/><br/>What I found most interesting about this movie is that it continues the treatment of the Predators we saw in Predator 2: a species of intergalactic, purposeful hunters who possess a code of honor. The Predators are given more dimension in this film, and the xenomorphs look better than they have in their past 2 incarnations.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this movie was the ""alternate beginning"" ""not seen in theaters"" featured on the DVD. It gives nothing to the plot, and does not put any fear into the viewer either. It was left on the cutting-room floor for a good reason."

Man, i wish they would use it more.Do you guys know why they didn't use it as much? Because they should have used it more instead of the spear. I'll admit i like the spear but not as much as the Shirukien. I'm glad they didn't have the cannon at the start. otherwise the hunt would be boring and even shorter.

","First of all if you haven't seen any of the alien or predator movies then you will not have a clue what is going on, so I suggest you watch them. Secondly I really enjoyed this film, as a big Alien and Predator fan my expectations were obviously very high and most of them were fulfilled, just one tiny little thing that i did not like about this movie and that was the lack of fighting between the two, what fighting sequences there were were good CGI or animatronics didn't really matter it entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat. And the ending does allow for a sequel but heres hoping that they realise that it would be a huge mistake to do so.<br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>Probably the best part in the whole film is when there is a full animatronics battle with the two, and there are equal losses on each side, but you you know that there are a lot more aliens and one predator. Things get a lot more interesting after that point in the film.<br/><br/>**SPOILER**<br/><br/>The other part that sort of spoiled it was when the last predator became friends with the last human, it didn't seem right. Thankfully that was towards the end and you didn't have to put up with it anymore, but it did leave you sitting there thinking that you were robbed of something that would have made the film a classic and not another typical Sci-Fi film. The film maker had the opportunity to make a classic film that we would all remember but it has been wasted.<br/><br/>Do not be put off by this review it is a good film so go out and enjoy it I give this film 8 out of 10."

","I really liked this movie. I thought the action scenes were excellent, and that the creatures looked amazing. One thing I hate is when filmmakers overdo it with CGI effects, as well as when you can actually tell the CGI effects from the rest of the film, and, in AVP, all the creatures looked very organic. I also loved the references to the original movies.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Sanaa Lathan rocks in every movie she makes, and makes for a terrific action heroine. Ewen Bremner was very good as the chemical engineer, and you really sympathized with the guy. The rest of the actors were not given much to do, but they did well with the screenplay.<br/><br/>Overall, a fun movie. I give it a 7/10."

","When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was so excited. I love both Alien and Predator characters. It was a great idea to fight both of these Titans against each other.. I have to say I was disappointed with the ending. I loved the technical part, the new updated weapons and costumes. I enjoyed the Predator humor as well as the great special effects. They were true to both the creatures' look and general feel. The ending disappointed me. Granted the human race was saved, for now, from the Alian creatures but why did the Predator that befriended the girl have to die? I grew up with movies like star trek, star wars etc...If you were good, you lived. If you were evil and turned good, you lived.(most of the time) When I figured out that Scar had that alien inside him, it was disappointing. I guess I am thinking like a woman. I guess I am forgetting the basics of the movie. The title is Alien vs. Predator. They were both not human so why should I expect any outcome to be human. The writers were true to their characters. I wonder if they are going to go further with this situation? It should be interesting. I know I will be waiting for more Predators and Aliens..I am partial to the Predator..He was bad ...with a touch of good..just a touch.."

"aeon_static","7","0","1","27 January 2005"," Pretty good.
","Considering what it could have been, Alien vs. Predator turned out to be a pleasant surprise, though dragging a bit at the end. People will complain to you that the film ""sucks"", not because it's a bad movie, but because it doesn't 'feel' EXACTLY like the original films it branches off of.<br/><br/>Put it in this perspective. This isn't a Movie + Movie = Movie situation, in which case I would agree with everyone if it was. This is Movie + Movie = Comic, first and foremost, then Comic = Movie. This is a rough comic translation with of course its own differentiated setting, much like X-Men and all those other comic movies.<br/><br/>That put into proper light, the film does correctly portray the attitudes, touches and visual flares of both the Alien and Predator films. Knowing that AVP isn't trying to be either an Alien or Predator movie, but a look in-between, both creatures keep their character respectively well.<br/><br/>Next, some people say there are plot holes - mainly in the actions that some of the characters and creatures take. I guess I can't reveal spoilers on this thing, so I can't go any deeper with you. But if you really care, listen to the commentary on the DVD, and all of these questions are surprisingly answered with specific clarity.<br/><br/>The acting? Mediocre. What do you expect? People are complaining about the ACTING in a sci-fi action/horror film? How good was the acting in Predator? We enjoyed the originals not because of Oscar-clad acting, but because of the atmosphere they set. If you haven't seen AVP, let me put it this way: the acting is just as good/bad as Independence Day or Terminator 3. If you want something better, don't go after sci-fi action.<br/><br/>This is a solid popcorn film with only a tad less gore then Aliens or Predator. Remember, PG-13 can get away with a lot more these days. If you're doubting picking it up, I'd recommend it. At least rent it first.<br/><br/>Too many people are giving this film a bad rap. It wasn't great, but it was far from horrible, and I found it enjoyable and true to both the comics and the films. I just hope they watch their pacing and don't screw up in the Predalien for the second film.<br/><br/>7/10"

Anyway I said whatever and put it into my DVD player. I liked the whole concept there is a archaeological journey with all these people going to find a ancient pyramid in Antartica. The Predators are making that journey too and they are going to get there weapons. You know the little three laser beam thing that shoots. Then there is event happening with the aliens. The mother alein is laying her eggs in the pyramid. Conflict happens here with the humans and the predators until the aleins get involved and the alein and predators start fighting. There is no gore only quick shots of fake cgi blood. The thing that got me angry was the last human standing became friends with the Predator. The go and hunt the aliens together.

","I did enjoy the plot to this Avp film, I feel the writers did do a good job in tying everything together, my only criticism is that two of the Predators got killed way to early. If anyone has been a fan like I have since Predator came out along with the Aliens vs. Predator comic books then you would agree that it takes a lot more than just one Alien to kill off a Predator. I hope they make a sequel that will put to rest all of the critics that seem to think this movie was a bust. I believe they can and should, immediately!!! According to some there were a lot of pitches for the Alien vs. Predator movie submitted to Fox and I am sure that there had to be at least one that entailed what all of us fans wanted to see, and that was a mass amount of Predators fighting a mass amount of Aliens with minimal human interaction. If fox thinks that they can not accomplish this they are surely mistaken. A movie like this would would blow the top off of all the Alien and Predator movies ever made! However, we are stuck with this AvP from Fox for now and I am pleased with it, but make no mistake about it, if there is not a sequel in the works I along with probably every other Alien and Predator fan will be surely disappointed."

I am a Aliens and Predator fan so, I like the idea of creating more movies. Humans as partners to the Predator, I like that too. Lets see it again. I have ideas but I am sure that the creators have better ideas. Lets see Humans go to the planet where the Predator comes from. How about humans helping them.

That said, the one thing about the movie that surprised me is PG-13 rating. This is an amalgam of two of the greatest sci-fi action/horror series and it was toned way down on the gore and language. However, I don't think that is a necessity of a good movie. The action kept me going and the plot was deep enough of a first segment of a trilogy (which I heard this is). Also, I've heard complaints that the characters weren't developed enough, but those critics obviously didn't realize that the humans are there for only one reason, which is stated simply on the tag line of the movie poster. I'm a huge fan of the PC game in this series, and this movie definitely did it justice. And the ending: my only problem with this movie was that I now have to wait for the sequel!"

","Alien is a modern Sci-Fi / Horror classic. It is as close to a perfect movie you are likely to see within the genre.<br/><br/>Some of the sequels are descent enough in their own right, but benefit from their pedigree.<br/><br/>But this one is devoid of any merit. We are treated to some snap shot edited flash shots designed to bring back memories of greater movies. But this movie is a stinker -- and it knows it.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi. And in order to enjoy good Sci-Fi you have to be able to suspend disbelief. In order to do so, the movie must establish its own logic to operate on. But This movie has no logic.<br/><br/>Lines of dialogs are delivered seemingly coming from nowhere. We are told by an Italian scientist that because the Aztec calendar was based on a decimal system, we can (successfully) assume that the pyramid will reconfigure every 10 minutes. The logic behind this statement is never elaborated. Nor could it, since it defies logic. Any logic.<br/><br/>Later in the movie the heroine exclaims that the serpent creatures must never be allowed to reach the surface. If they do, she maintains, everything will be destroyed. How this knowledge or conviction has come to her is never explained. We can only assume that she, like most of the audience, knows this to be true from having watched the previous movies in the franchise.<br/><br/>AVP is slick and fast -- but is empty and goes nowhere. It is evident that Paul Anderson is more inspired from the AVP games than anything else. This movie would have been more enjoyable with a game console in my hands. At least then I could slap the heroine every time she delivers a silly line."

And this is the problem, the movie would stand alone fine if it was not for the huge weight of expectation that has crushed every alien movie since Aliens, there are visual ques and references to Alien here and there but they serve to remind you of what your missing rather than tying the whole franchise together. (forgive me for concentrating overly on the alien aspect rather than Predator, i was never a fan of the latter and have only watched those movies once or twice when they were on TV)<br/><br/>unfortunately this franchise is a victim of its own success, the 1 st movies were genuine works of genius, from 2 very gifted but very different auteurs, the perfectionists attention to detail and application of Lucas's ""used Universe"" of Scott's Alien stands as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, and when the grandiose kinetic technophile Cameron came on board he wisely shifted the direction of the movie and delivered the only truly satisfying sequel, he made an original work that did not try to be an homage to 1st film.<br/><br/>its a little sad that Alien movies, like star trek movies, have become forgettable multiplex fodder and nothing more, which brings us to AVP i saw it 2 days ago and can barely remember a thing about it, though i do remember thinking ""this isn't that bad"" while i was watching it.<br/><br/>all i can think of to say is if your under 25, or you liked the comics A lot! then this is for you and you won't be disappointed, but if like me your a fan of the original movies then its maybe worth giving this a miss and re-watch the 1st 2 instead, it will make for a far more enjoyable time."

","i am a big fan of the first predator film and the first two alien film so i walked into the cinema with great expectations of these two great creatures battling it out. but when i left i felt horrible like i had just been robbed of my hard earned cash. the first major problem i had with this movie is the fact the action didn't actually start until the movie was half way through. the next major problem i had with this film is that some how the first two predators get killed in about a five minute space by aliens one of which seems to have picked up the predators talent of turning invisible?. the next tragic part of the film is that the only living predator and the female heroine Sanaa Lathan fall in love so the predator saves her life and makes her a weapon from a dead aliens tail and a shield from an aliens head. this film is terrible i would highly recommend staying as far away from this film as possible especially if like me you are a fan of any of the original films. it is also terribly film with the camera shaking about and vast quantity's of darkness on the screen not letting you get a good view of the only good alien vs predator fight of the whole film. also the fact that i has been edited in such away as to lower the rating is a real shame as the film is held back by this terrible choice<br/><br/>NO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!"

","*****SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Many people have given bad reviews and opinions on Alien vs. Predator, but I want to start my review off by not giving a clear answer in mine. I want to look at this film for a moment without giving any personal opinion. I know this is a long review, but bear with me, I make an interesting point.<br/><br/>Alien vs. Predator has been a movie that hardcore fans have been thirsting for now about 13 years. The project in that time has undergone many writers and directors but for some oblivious reason, it has never been made. In that time, eager fans have gotten Comic Books, Novels, Video Games, and even Action Figures based on the meeting of these two iconic monsters. Just when it felt like a motion picture would never happen, the word was released that the Aliens would actually get their chance to fight the Predators sometime in 2004. This was an answered prayer to many people, including myself. But the joy was short lived as many fans later discovered the film's rating was a mere PG-13. However, I kept my anticipation high. After waiting half my life to get my hands on a movie ticket for this film, the day came on August 13th 2004. I have been watching the Alien and Predator films for as long as I can remember, and the expectations for the theatrical release of AVP were very high. I went to see it with a of group eager friends ready to be blown away. Every one in the audience cheered for their favorite, a definite split amongst the opening day crowd. Once the film ended, I was pleased with it and even stayed for the credits. But when I left the theater and did some thinking, I felt a little disappointed. I didn't dislike the movie, but it somehow felt a little empty to me. I saw it a second time, and was convinced that I was satisfied with it. A short while later, I started reading internet reviews on AVP, and discovered that many people disliked it. At first I was resistant to the negativity, but so many bad reviews kinda rubbed off on me. Still, I liked the movie, but I seem to be one of the few who does. Alien vs. Predator has gotten lame reviews and has been trashed by most fans. Only a small majority seem happy with it. Here's where I start to defend the movie and it's creators. <br/><br/>First off, the budget for this movie was pocket change compared to other films in it's genre. This led to more creativity in the making of the film. The story is okay, and nicely ties the two monsters' worlds together. The setting of the film is a lot of fun, but its very constrictive. The movie takes place in an underground pyramid, in Antarctica none the less. There is only so much you can do with a setting like that. The trouble is the fighting can't move from one extreme location to another like Freddy vs. Jason did. But I think the Director(Paul W.S. Anderson) and his crew did a nice job with the restricted setting. Actually, the pyramid is one of the cooler aspects of the movie. It physically shifts around every ten minutes to push the human prey through it. That makes for good screaming and death scenes later. AVP is filmed and lit well, but it's editing is a little too Hollywood for me. <br/><br/>The acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this. I am very delighted to say that Lance Henriksen, who was 'Bishop android' in Aliens and Alien 3, makes a return in AVP as a human Bishop. Lance is extremely underrated and I enjoy his acting a great deal. He was one of the greater characters in the film. Other than him, I am pleased to say that there are no big name stars in the film, this makes the Aliens and Predators the real stars. The musical score is really good and the tone of the whole thing is dark. The movie is dark and the music is dark. Without a doubt the special effects are terrific and they keep the movie from drowning. After all, the film does live up to it's title. You do get to see an Alien and Predator fight more than a few times. The Predators have new weapons and and new tricks up their sleeves. The Aliens are as horrifying as a ever and bring new scares and darkness to the screen. Both characters have great designs, old and new. It is evident here that a lot of love went into creating and filming the two monsters.<br/><br/>The action is great and a lot of fun but it is short-lived. The ending is wickedly amusing due to the Queen Alien's appearance and fight with the surviving Predator. The closing scene hints at a worthy sequel that I hope is a possibility. From beginning to end, the overall tone of the movie remains pretty faithful to the essence of the original films. Two of the movie's downfalls are its PG-13 rating and its hour and a half runtime. Alien vs. Predator has six predecessors with 2 + hours of runtime and R-ratings. But all that is forgivable. Unfortunately the movie sadly falls short with the lack of on-screen violence. The Alien and Predator movies are known for having lots of gore. Like Alien chest bursters ripping through human rib cages. Or Predators skinning and pulling spines out of helpless victims' backs. Good stuff like that, But AVP has none of that. You only get the hint of a death scene, then the camera simply cuts away. You don't get to see anyone die. In my eyes, that is what hurts the film the most. The movie does at times get a little cheesy, but it never ever gets to the point of 'Horrible' that people accuse of it. However I do understand the disappointment that some fans have over the film. <br/><br/>I think this movie was misunderstood from the beginning and although it is not as deep or scary a movie as Alien, Aliens, or Predator, it is still worth watching. For all the people that didn't care for it, I strongly suggest watching it a second time around. This movie is better than it is given credit for. The Aliens fight the Predators, blood is shed, Aliens die, and Predators die. What more do you want from a title like AVP: Alien vs. Predator? Overall AVP is a decent movie and it is a fun addition to the Alien and Predator series."

","Clearly it seems to me this movie is being judged by the present movies alien and predator and I get the feeling most of you think that they're just combining the two monsters because others did it with Freddy vs. Jason. May I remind you that this film is based on the comic books and in the comic books a human female passes the rite of passage and becomes a hunter. That is what this film is based upon. Not Freddy vs. Jason. Obviously you may not have noticed that Mr. Weyland actually is the founder of the Bishop robot model and that his real name is Charles Bishop Weyland. In this film he's a human being, not a robot or android. This is also mentioned in AVP. I like the fact that it's not just an onslaught movie and I'm quite satisfied that they managed to tell so much in such a short length. For a low budget movie I'll give it a rating 4 out of 5<br/><br/>This comment is based on the comment posted by tfrizzell"

","I didn't like the Alien series, I liked pretty much the Predator movies, and of course I loved the Alien Vs Predator video game. I think the idea is great, because these two ""cult"" monsters are seriously the most powerful, evil and effective creatures seen on the screen in these years. The plot is also very well thought and interesting, putting a background on the history of mankind as connected with the one of the Predators. The tagline, as you can discover by yourselves watching the film, is completely misleading: mankind can survive depending by the victory of one party over the other, you can imagine which one has to die :-) The cast is good, thanks also to the able acting of the Italian Raul Bova. 7.5/10"

","I watched the movie and greatly enjoyed it. I am not 13 :-)<br/><br/>much has been made of the plot holes in the movie, but they are not so big.<br/><br/>The rapid gestation of the 'Chest Burster'<br/><br/>This can be dealt with in two ways: The Predators have been using the Aliens for this purpose for some time. The Aliens get characteristics of the host creature. The Predators originally could have used various host creatures to produce the characteristics of a rapid gestation period Chest Burster. Remember the four Alien movies all had creatures from the same batch, so would have had the same gestation period).<br/><br/>The Predators were very technologically advanced, assume that they would have had genetic engineering technology, and could have engineered rapid gestation into the Aliens. This would have suited the Predators for their rituals, and suited the Aliens because it would make them more virulent.<br/><br/>The Alliance between the Predator and Alexa.<br/><br/>Take this in context. The Predators were used to a set number of hosts being implanted (remember the sacrificial chamber), as well as a set number of Predators. The Humans were more numerous, therefore the aliens were in too great a concentration. The last Predator was alone and outnumbered. The 'My Enemy's Enemy is my friend' comment very much applied to him.<br/><br/>Alexa running around in a T-Shirt in the Antarctic cold.<br/><br/>Now I am pretty sure there was a nearby explosion which was melting the ice. This would have provided enough heat for her, For a while at least.<br/><br/>There are shortfalls in the plot, but I'll have to wait until I see the movie in English.

But hey, fanatics can also expect nothing less than perfection with there movie obsessions!<br/><br/>I've read most of the other critics comments on this site and haft to say some of your negative views are valid and some are complete train-spotter mush. Here are a few ones which kept coming up that are...well.....petty and annoying.<br/><br/>1."" Why does the predator make friends with the woman?And whats with the tail sword and head shield! ""<br/><br/>ANS - The predator SURVIVOR does not make buddies with the woman! He listens to her trying to communicate with him first as she then gives him his plasma castor back. This probably in his point of view is an unusual gesture but one he is perhaps beginning to understand. That understanding being that the 'hunt' as it were is now over and now its simply a battle for survival! Afterall the predator is not a suicide machine.The drones attack at this point and luckily the woman manages to impale one.The predator is know doubt impressed by this.A HUMAN killing a drone warrior!?! He then immediately has RESPECT for her kill (well almost kill.The predator finishes the drone off!) and decides to let her live. She has proved herself to him and they seem to share an understanding....a very basic understanding, ones which A PREDATOR would hold very close to him, these being HONOUR, RESPECT, RIVALRY, SURVIVAL etc.The basic warrior codes.On a beneficial side as well he is intelligent enough to know that with her tagging along his own personal chances of living through the 'HUNT WHICH WENT WRONG' may be increased! He will be able to come back with more buddys and turn it into 'THE HUNT WHICH WENT RIGHT'!<br/><br/>As far as the sword and shield thing goes what else could he give her, or would give her? "" HERE YOU ARE.ITS NOT MUCH BUT, HEY..YA NOT HAVING MY DAM PLASMA CASTOR!!!"" (well something like that).<br/><br/>I can not for the life of me understand why a lot of you find this sequence and concept cheesy.It works and is thought out.<br/><br/>In PREDATOR 2 for example at the end Danny Glover is given an old Pirate day pistol as a gift for being the victor in his fight.So this is not a new idea that paul has come up with just to annoy you.He has just extended upon it.(speaking of pred 2.why did it get put down so much?..No arnie?..well no but, still dam good fun)<br/><br/>DO YA RESEARCH BEFORE YOU COMMENT!!!<br/><br/>2."" Doors closing, to many close-ups, carnt make things out etc ""<br/><br/>ANS - I don't see this one.Paul although at times not getting it totally right has gone for claustrophobia in this movie.It's very confined filming up-close and personal.Chaotic! Ridley and Cameroon are the masters but, Anderson's is different.Better than Jean-Paul's weak attempts at action sequences any day!!!<br/><br/>Negatives??? YES the CASTING IS POOR. YES Lance H delivers a poor performance. YES just how does the lead role not even manage a shiver in her t-shirt at the end. YES there are holes in the plot. YES you don't feel anything for the human characters because they don't let them develop....the list does go on BUT, I tell you what when I look at some of the other COMPLETE TRASH thats out there at the moment I think to myself well...you know.<br/><br/>Watching AVP you get to a stage when you don't give a dam about the humans at all. Which I think is in a weird way a good thing? THIS FILM IS ALIENS VS PREDATOR not ALIENS VS THE HUMANS VS THE PREDATOR. The poor casting does help this of course.<br/><br/>AT THE END OF THE DAY THE MONSTERS ARE THE STARS IN THIS.THEY LOOK GREAT. ON PAR WITH THE FIRST TWO FILMS (which is what paul wanted)AND THE CGI IS BLENDED VERY WELL.THE ACTION FRANTIC, FAST AND FULL ON.STOP WHINGING AND UNTIL RIDLEY OR CAMERON MAKE ALIEN 5 (please god...anything) BE HAPPY WITH HORRIBLE CREATURES BEATING HELL OUT OF EACH OTHER!!!!"

","When I entered the theater I expected the worst: my nice little Aliens and Predator universes being dismantled by some sort of commercial sell-out. Er, ... exactly that happened. BUT to my surprise the two monster characters had even enough great aspects to save my evening from being a complete disaster. Right, the dialogues were quite ridiculous far too often. The shape-shifting of the pyramid seemed a very stupid idea to me  why the hell should the predators have invested such an amount of energy, know-how and time in a construction like this? They are supposed to be hunters, not scientists! The alliance with a human being on the other hand is a nice idea if you ask me, as long as the Predator has some good reason to respect the others' fighting capabilities, cause only this way one seems to earn his right to live in their view. So if this human can fight, why shouldn't she be respected?<br/><br/>Another funny idea came to me watching the Predators dressed in their thongs walking antarctic territory: ever heard a Predator sneezing?  Must be a funny sound! Don't catch a cold out there, man! Up to now it was said they prefer REALLY hot summers... But I have to conclude: this movie is really a damn sell-out. Nearly all the elements of tension and atmosphere that made the earlier movies the legends they are today are missing: the facehuggers almost haven't fallen off their hosts' faces when the babies burst out  no incubation at all, compare this to 'Alien 1'! The predators don't behold anymore  they prefer making a mess wherever they pass by. The Aliens' blood that was capable of burning holes in a number of decks (!) on the 'Nostromo' has turned now into some kind of skincare, as our hero is marked by her companion from outer space: she takes no damage, does not even squeak. Things like these disintegrate the great pictures of the two species drawn by others in their superb movies before. And therefore I really dislike this crap!!! The cuts of the battle scenes are often indeed far too quick to recognize anything  you could as well have saved the money for a better script and shown a black screen with some 'uh', 'ouch', 'kaboom' and 'inkelklink'. On the other hand the camera has caught some wonderful scenes: the icebreaker in full moon night, the flare sliding down the unknown tunnel, very atmospheric I can say! So the scenery has been chosen fine (if the predators had had some thermos pants), the historical story is a nice idea I might say, apart from this awfully plump melting of three ancient cultures and their languages even in single inscriptions without the slightest difficulty to read for someone who only knows some parts of the younger civilizations. Again, scenes like these flatten the whole plot (to lowest Hollywood level). If there ever will be a sequel the fans may really expect a reparation for this one!"

","I was really looking forward to this film, having been a fan of both the original series of films. Sadly, it was incredibly disappointing, and I found myself laughing with embarrassment rather than either scared and/or entertained. The plot is incredibly contrived, relies on unnecessary exposition and tries too hard to pander to both fanboys and a new audience and instead ends up satisfying neither. The dialogue is utterly appalling, delivered with no emotion whatsoever, the acting is dire and you really don't care about any of the characters (I can't remember any of the their names).<br/><br/>The utter ridiculousness of it all ends up making it collapse under it's own weight. These people are supposed to be in minus whatever degrees Antarctica and end up running around in little more than a t-shirt and don't even show any hot breath escaping from their mouths or noses. Little details like that do not allow you to suspend your disbelief so it just ends up flat and unrewarding.<br/><br/>The special effects were good however, and this is really the only saving grace of the movie. But Matrix style flo-mo shots of face huggers leaping were a bad call and I burst out laughing at that point. These guys are supposed to be scary and damn *fast*, not suspended in space and rotating around the camera!<br/><br/>This was a dismal, uninspiring film that had neither scares nor shocks and will leave you cold (pun intended)."

The actors are OK some actually manage to act their parts quite well, but the plot, although in a far fetched way is plausible, is poor.

","Thursday the 28th of October, ""AvP"" came out in Holland. As a fan of the original Alien, Aliens and Predator 1 I wanted to see this movie for myself, instead of listening to critics here and there and not go. I believed that maybe it wouldn't be so bad, maybe all those reviewers were wrong.<br/><br/>Well..<br/><br/>It was even worse. I find it absolutely unbelievable how a single man can ruin two perfectly good franchises in one blow. That man is, of course, Paul Anderson. Having seen his previous work, expectations weren't that high, although Alien and Predator in one movie would surely make up for his lack of talent, or so I thought. I honestly hope they never ever let this man near an Alien or Predator movie again.<br/><br/>Right, the plot. Charles Bishop Weyland, played by Lance Henriksen, finds the heat signature of an ancient pyramid under the Antarctic ice. A team is sent out to investigate and of course, once there, all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Lance Henriksen, by the way, is the only one who tries to make the best out of the crap he's got himself involved in. The rest of the (unknown) cast walks around on autopilot. The film seriously lacks a charismatic hero such as Ripley or Major Dutch.<br/><br/>Various errors and goofs are widespread throughout this film. When I got out of the theater, it was about 7 degrees Celsius outside and some of my breath turned into steam. Pretty funny then that if the main character is climbing an ice wall somewhere in the mountains, her breath doesn't turn into steam. Or when they're on an icebreaker, at night, near Antarctica. No steam. Small details maybe and I think the audience this movie targeted probably didn't notice.<br/><br/>That gets me to my next point. Why on God's Green Earth did they make it a PG-13? Two R-rated franchises turned into one PG-13 movie? The ideology behind this makes me sick. Money, that's what Fox are interested in. Drawing as many 12-13 year olds to the theater.<br/><br/>This comment turned out to be one long rant but I can't remember the last time a movie managed to infuriate me like this. Verdict: a 3,5 at best. If Paul Anderson is going to involved with a future Alien or Predator film, don't go and watch it. <br/><br/>After all, would you reward a dog that pees on your carpet?"

I'm happy this is the case because I would feel cheated to spend my hard earned cash on this rubbish. There is little in this movie to praise, most is clichéd tripe. The fights between the aliens and the predators are balanced and Anderson decided not to root for one side and let them win a scrap each so as not to incur the wrath of their respective fans. It's a pity he did not have the same idea in mind when he wrote the poor script that tarnishes (and ignores) previous information from the two franchises. The human element was required, few people would want to watch two hours of film with no speaking characters except maybe the obsessive fanboys, but why use the same old stereotypes we've all seen for years in any Roland Emmerich film? Even Lake Placid had more original characters although still standard horror fare. The predators not having their guns was a simple but effective plot hook but the shifting pyramid was pointless and poorly developed but the most criminal mistakes were the most obvious, the selective acid. One moment the aliens acid blood can melt anything, the next it couldn't dissolve a sugar cube and sometimes it was missing completely. There are many errors which I could list here but they've all been said elsewhere.<br/><br/>To sum up, most people leave the cinema laughing or shaking their heads, not exactly a thumbs up."

The more I think about it the more disappointed I feel about the version that made it to the screen - overblown, underplotted, poorly conceived characters, not one good joke and, worst of all, no chance to enter your high score over the end credits. Come to think of it, where was all the violence? That put Predator 2 up a notch. Seems to me that making a Alien/Predator movie for ze kids is a bit of a busted flush, I mean what's the point? Granted, there's plenty of psychological violence aimed at the audience, some of it intentional, but thats not really good enough. On the up side I'm willing to bet my neighbour's skull that it hasn't inflicted a fatal blow to either series. Alien 4 was worse after all, and the aforementioned Predator 2 didn't exactly stroke the pleasure receptors so to be fair we've been a bit fortunate but lets not do it again anytime soon...unless it's Paul W.S Anderson VS Paul T.

A god awful script and a god awful director you say? Yup, yet again Hollywood destroys the day! Honestly, why oh why do they let brainless idiots write films? Or perhaps more correctly, why do they write films for brainless idiots? Despite their slightly far-out subject matter the Alien and Predator films held a certain amount of integrity, intelligence and maturity. Indeed Aliens and Predator are two of my favourite action films of all time, Alien is a classic tension-filled psychological horror and Alien 3, although it has it's flaws and which I wasn't too keen on at the time of it's release(I think I just wanted to see another Aliens)I have grown to admire it's style and tension. But rather than fuse the ingredients together that made these films great instead we are served with a film minus tension, originality and the slightest shred of intelligence. The storyline to the video games are far superior to this. What a waste of time and money. <br/><br/>I read somewhere that Paul W.S. (Weak Scripts?)

","Paul WS Anderson is possibly the most hated director alive. But he really shouldn't be. Its all about opinion and talent level at the end of the filmic day. ""Soldier"" was not that bad. I can think of dozens of higher rated films that fit comfortably (in my opinion) next to it, Spider Man 2 springs to mind, however i do think its always a little harsh to be that unkind to the guy. However here you are all justified really. It seems amazing how a genuine fan of these two franchises could mess it up so spectacularly. The fights are not very well filmed, the characters are thinner than toe nail clippings and the fact that there's little to no gore means this will never be treated with the same prestigious opinions as Scott's or McTiernan's work.<br/><br/>This really is a bad film in anyone's eyes (whether some parts were mildly enjoyable or not). And a terrific misfire with a capital m. An almost instantly forgettable film experience. Really all you needed was thrilling one on one bitch fights, buckets of gore and slime, stylish direction and a few winking in jokes to the previous films and it would have been serviceable enough. Oh well."
"panasit","Null","0","1","25 October 2004"," Alien vs. Predator vs. Hard to please fans = a few fun monster movie that actually worth your money.
","What should Alien Vs. Predator movie have? Alien Vs. Predator fight scenes? Got it. All the Alien mythology (little alien burst out of the body, queen, eggs, acid blood, etc.?) All there. Predator's mythology (heat-seeking guns, honorable battle, very big knives, cool armor, invisibility, ugly face, etc.)? All there. Those mythology crossing over? (Predators scan to see Alien in the eggs, Predator use Alien skin to mark their bodies, etc.) Tons. So what more can you ask for? Well, there are a couple of things.<br/><br/>I read all the reviews, that's why I try to put in my reviews something most people haven't yet said. First, I'm going to do something very odd by comparing it to the first Kill Bill. Sure, this movie is in the different league considering its genre and director. And you can tell that Tarentino put a lot more thought into Kill Bill than Anderson did into this movie (which is sad since the budget for this movie is obviously a lot more). BUT, the premise are the same. Simple Plot, and the movie carry on using its cleverness to please the audience and make them feel they get their money worth. Every phrase that critics used to praise Kill Bill volume 1 can be use to praise this movie. It packed a lot of cool scenes together. The story in between those cool scenes are a bit tight, but I personally don't think Ridley Scott or James Cameron could have done any better (or at least too much better).<br/><br/>Only two things hurt this movie (yes, only two). The dialogues that are filled with one liners and added-in attitude by actors who seem to think their characters should have; and the set that has a design quality of a cheap amusement park ride (which is the only thing Cameron or Scott could have fixed) The most important thing about any movie is the plot, and despite the fact that the secondary story is just a time wasting link between one cool scene to the next, the overall plot is actually quite impressive and original for this kind of movie. (if you think it's not, just think: there are much worse way for Aliens and Predator to get together) And the special effect is top notch. Better than any other Alien or Predator movie out there for the obvious reason (which most people will agree but will never mentioned because they want to hate the movie). There is absolutely no ""that is so fake"" moment. And that is something. When they got a plot and special effects down, if you are not out to hate the movie, you will at least have a good time.<br/><br/>Taking an overview look, I personally think this movie hurt neither series (actually it kinda helped Predator. the first one was a classic, but if it were to be release today it would be call even stupider than this movie, and the second one was just plain bad). A lot of people are mad that Predators seem weak compare to the Aliens. Well, Aliens spawned 4 movies and Predator only spawned 2 for a reason. Aliens eat, breed, and kill like animals, while Predator have a lot of characteristic that resembles human. Plus, these are young and inexperienced Predators (who still kicks major butt though).<br/><br/>Lastly, Paul WS Anderson. I hate Mortal Kombat and Event, but I think Resident Evil was very fun (jump-kicking the zombie dog scene aside). I think he's a good writer, but seriously need to stop directing. Watching this movie I can feel that he love both series and have a lot of fun making it. If only he had taken time to polish it. Alien Vs. Predator video game was released ages ago. This movie was in no rush to get release. If they thought about it a little more, edited some of the scenes, rewrote some of the dialogue... well, it will be ten times better, but that still won't please the fans who would just rather have Ridley Scott or James Cameron instead. And may be that's why the poor guy didn't bother.<br/><br/>That's a damn shame. Because as unpolished as it is, I enjoyed it and it was worth the time and money to see it in theater. And I will buy the DVD. Just imagine how good it could be if it was polished. 8/10."

","As an avid fan of both the Alien and Predator novel/game franchise I was very keen to see this movie. The movie is good - if you put Aliens and Predator in the same place at the same time...its bound to be cool!<br/><br/>But - it does unfortunately leave you thinking that the film is very unbalanced, timewise. It gives good character insight and a nice build up to what you hope is going to be an all out acid bloodbath (eg the sentry gun scene in Aliens) then suddenly the survivors are at the exit and one quick scrap later...it ends...no real climax to the movie just a rushed and rather disappointing ending.<br/><br/>If you are into the AvP novels then you will appreciate the (loose) merger of two of the best novels to make the plot of this film but sadly it never quite delivers to be the movie we all hoped it would be.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it - but it lacks something...perhaps its the reduced rating to a 15 when it really should have been spruced up a bit and given the 18 rating - the 15 means the gore is slight and the fear of the humans is shortlived...they go in, figure it out, die quickly and usually off-screen and then those left make a run for the exit.<br/><br/>Almost good.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","I went in to this movie determined to ignore all the negative reviews that I had read because I really wanted to enjoy it, but unfortunately I just came out of the cinema disappointed. Before anyone has a go at the fact i'm expressing a negative opinion, i'm not nitpicking, it just wasn't a very good movie, sometimes it happens guys. It wasn't awful but It could have been so much better, on a plus point i thought the sets were amazing the pyramid was really well done although I think the idea of it being a testing ground could have been exploited a lot more. Also the film was shot well it certainly looked good, my main gripe has to be with the appalling script. My main impression when watching the film was that it felt like big chunks were missing, it just jumped from inane dialogue to lame alien encounter to more inane dialogue. I thought that the characters were non existent, they were cardboard cutouts, there was the token guy with a camera with photographs of his kids designed to make us empathise with him, the Italian dude who was totally unfazed by the death of his friend with the glasses, and who just so happened to be able to translate ancient texts and then as soon as we found out the plot got killed!!!! funny that. The sigourney replacement enough said, and who the hell was the blonde dike with the gun she was just there no explanation of why!!! oh well, and poor old Wayland ahhhhh he just wanted to leave his mark!!!! what twaddle. I just didn't care about any of them. Also I know its a movie and i'm supposed to suspend disbelief, but not one person thought that the fact a massive hole opening up over the pyramid overnight inexplicably was cause for concern????? oh well we will just go down anyway and see who's there!!!! please. I think that Mr Anderson should stick to just directing and should leave the script writing alone because I think that this film had all the elements to be really good, and as I said before I thought the directing wasn't bad, but it was let down by a hollow script and lets face it if the script is crap whats the point? 3 out of 10"

My only complaint was that there was not enough of the Alien/Predator fights... Those sequences were really well done and I was left wanting for more!!! The acting, whilst it was not Oscar worthy, was more than adequate for what the movie claimed to be! The special effects were great and it was nice to see the puppet work/animatronics instead of the usual CGI route. It made the creatures, IMHO, more realistic.<br/><br/>And it was far superior to Resident Evil!!!! I can't wait for AVP 2!"
"chris-clark30","Null","0","1","24 October 2004"," AVP: Avoid!
","I have to correct Dee Reid regarding the assertion that AVP ""preserves the essence"" of the alien/predator films by casting no-names...although Alien cast an unknown Sigourney Weaver, fellow nostromo passengers included Tom Skerrit, John Hurt and Ian Holm, all big names in their day who had notched up 20-30 films each before Alien came along. Predator, of course, had a post-Terminator Arnie. <br/><br/>The reason why AVP had a cast of no-namers (not strictly true either, there was a couple of well known British faces) is that the budget was obviously not quite good enough for your Signourneys or Arnies. <br/><br/>In addition, the film did not place ideas over casting or special effects, it was fairly plain to see that all three seem to be missing. The idea behind it was a mishmash of other films, with one interesting concept (that Predators bred Aliens on Antarctica as the ultimate hunt) that unfortunately was not borne out by the other films or indeed by common sense (Antarctica once habitable?!), and of course the lack of special effects seems once again to represent the relatively small budget this film apparently had.<br/><br/>This is certainly a film that has done more damage to the alien and predator lineages than Alien3 and Predator 2 combined."

These movies are claimed to be very bad, down the drain, full of s*** but I enjoy them so hell with them. Maybe they are not the greatest movies ever, but they fulfill their duty: they entertain..<br/><br/>But AvP.. On one side, we have the Alien... One of the most legendary sci-fi plus horror plus thriller movies ever, maybe the best.. Followed by good sequels (yes I liked A4 also). On the other corner there is Predator which starred in two not great but still good movies... Also what was nice about these creatures is that they were mysterious.. No one knew a thing about them.. And ending of Predator 2 was a shock when we suddenly saw the changing theme..<br/><br/>AvP has a lot of these two, which destroys the desire to be shocked.. First of all, the whole basis of the movie can be easily scrapped: Predators coming to Earth, making people worship themselves, build special pyramids and every x thousand years come to earth to hunt? That's Ridiculous!<br/><br/>Ah come on Anderson, nowadays all we have is earth earth earth, hero hero hero, kung fu kung fu kung fu, fantasy fantasy fantasy, comic book adaptations, horror movies that use same color for ghosts and creatures and always remake of a Japanese movie.. They might be good or bad, thats not my point.. My point is: Who watched a decent, enjoyable, good space movie in these last 1-2 years? I can't just remember one that pops out in my mind.. Attack of the Clones is good but not that much of space action, Star Trek Nemesis was not as good as expected but because of being a fan, I respect it.. I don't know.. I can't say any..<br/><br/>OK, here is my scenario: You want a close date? Its 2016, and one of the first space marine ships who are roaming the solar system find an unidentified ship, which is first proof of existence of alien life.. They think its deserted or safe, and board it, but the ship is a ""a lot more realistic"" Predator ship and they also have another kind on board: Aliens..<br/><br/>But what we had was tons of different races of Predators, some fancy but disrespected, stupid aliens, and I couldn't decide should I laugh or cry during last 15 minutes.. I was wondering if those two would share a nice, wet French kiss?<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies I will not defend, it was bad.

Here they're not at all. That's a crime. 2) The Predators should be cool, with their gadgets and armour etc. They're not in AVP! 3) The temple?? Was it based on a rejected idea for ""The Temple of Doom""? It just seemed like a way to split up the group of nobody characters so the monsters could pick them off. 4) The whole point of the film is to see Aliens fighting Predators, so it's pretty disastrous when the AVP fights are pish-poor. They're badly edited and filmed so you can't really see what's happening some of the time. And every single fight is mostly bloodless. Why skimp on the blood? The originals were pretty gruesome and they went down okay. Oh, I forgot. If you've got any gore you can't show it to the kiddie audience that this film is aimed at....... 5) It mucks about with the lore of the franchise. For example the Alien chestbursters should take days to be ""born"". Not 15 minutes.<br/><br/>6) Huge gaping plot holes you could fly the Predator mothership through. Why did they take assualt rifles into what they thought was a deserted temple? Anyone know?

Not once did I ever care what was going to happen next. 8) To make something so bland from 2 of the most imaginative sci-fi franchises ever seemed like an impossible task, but Paul WS Anderson pulled it off, which is an achievement of some sort....<br/><br/>In short, they've taking the idea for what could have been a good ""guilty pleasure"" film and crushed all the life and soul out of it.

"TheNorthernMonkee","2","0","1","21 October 2004"," Abomination
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>People wonder how far particular franchises can go sometimes. With serial killers and monsters being the basis for countless different series, the obvious step appears to be to pit them against each other. In 2003, two of the greatest serial killers were pitted against each other when the immortal Jason Voorhees (varying different actors over the years) and the equally immortal Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) fought to the impossible death. That film was daft but it worked because it did exactly what we expected. ""Freddy Vs Jason"" was a gore fest with bodies everywhere and as a result it worked. The sequel will be awful, but that's a topic for a different time. Anyway, with the success of that crossover, and the success of a particular computer game, there was only going to be a certain amount of time before the Alien from the Alien Trilogy (beginning with Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" in 1979) and the Predator (from the films beginning in 1987) would fight to the death. Sadly unlike the first cross over, this new attempt is an awful film with very little going for it.<br/><br/>Set in the modern day, ""AVP"" tells of a mysterious pyramid discovered deep beneath the Antarctic by Weyland Industries (the same company as in the Alien films). Gathering up a crew of specialists, Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henrikson) travels to the pyramid to investigate. As events unfold however, the team discovers they are not alone as they become unwittingly involved with a war between two rival species.<br/><br/>With some nice tributes to the original films, it's not hard to see that Paul W.S. Anderson (director and one of the writers) has a thorough knowledge of the original films. What is confusing therefore is how Anderson manages to destroy so much of the original stories so quickly.<br/><br/>--------- MAJOR SPOILERS -------<br/><br/>The key problem with this film is just how badly the history books have been rewritten. Telling the story of ancient humans who's language and style reflected a combination of a few major ancient civilisations, the film suggests that the Predators were believed to be Gods, whilst the Aliens were their prey. Whilst slotting in nicely with the Alien Skull in the second Predator film, and also explaining partly the man and his ship in the original Alien film, the notion that both species were on Earth a long time before either featured in their respective stories is an absolute joke. Aside from the history though, Anderson also manages to screw up the different species themselves.<br/><br/>From the second the group of Predators first make their appearance in this film (definately too early on), they look refreshed and modern. This in itself is not a bad thing, but the way they move and act is abysmal. Killing humans with ease, they are useless infront of the aliens. Before the aliens are in the film for even very long, all but one of the Predators is killed off. From this point, if he was then to kill the humans and then the remaining aliens, that'd be tolerable. The problem though is that he makes friends with the human. The Predator goes from being a killing machine to being the Big Friendly Giant! This film gets a rock hard, monster and turns him into a soft big brother for the typical human heroine (who it is worth adding is also awful).<br/><br/>As well as the Predator, the aliens are ruined. Whilst the regular aliens and the facehuggers are up to their usual tricks and stick to their old style (even though the gestation period for an alien is reduced from hours to 30seconds), the Queen is awful. Buried deep beneath the ground in the pyramid the Queen is originally tied up. Eventually however she escapes and we have the enormous showdown. Personally though, I have no memory of her being able to run at great speeds across frozen terrain. Maybe it's just me.<br/><br/>------ END OF MAJOR SPOILERS -------<br/><br/>Aside for all the alterations to the characters, the main problem with this film is that whilst never expecting a decent script or human participation (it's all abysmal by the way), we did expect to be able to see some cool fighting between the two monsters. This felt rushed and badly done. In fact, like the rest of the film, it was awful.<br/><br/>There is little good to come from ""AVP: Alien Vs Predator"". With high hopes for a decent crossover, this film has ruined so many dreams. With a mild certificate the impression is that the film was designed more for children who never saw the originals more than for those die hard fans who would appreciate it most. This is sloppy work from Anderson and company and it should have been done so much better."

I thought the aliens seemed to play second fiddle to much, with much of it centered on the Predators.<br/><br/>Though It has SOME good moments it gets incredibly cheesy and I couldn't help but snigger at how lame it got in the last half an hour.

","A movie like this is difficult to pull off. But, I think they did an excellent job. I only wish there were more fight scenes between predators and aliens. My favorite part of the movie was when the predators are killing the humans and one turns around to realize that his buddy is gone. He looks up, switches to infrared vision, and sees that an alien has grabbed his companion. He doesn't stop to retrieve and prepare his weapons (as the humans still have them). He doesn't hesitate at all. Instead, he immediately drops the human he was preparing to kill and charges the alien -- beginning a brutal melee battle to the death.<br/><br/>The predators and aliens are both strong, fast, confident, patient, extremely stealthy, and very unafraid. Throughout the movie, the predators view the humans as negligible threats. The aliens are their real prey.<br/><br/>The last surviving human does end up teaming up with the last surviving predator, but only because extreme luck allowed her to kill one alien just before the predator kills her.

","If ever there was a film that was never going to add up to the sum of its parts, this is it. Everyone loves Alien and/or Aliens (with which the series should have ended); Predator was a winner and its sequel certainly passed muster. Given that it owns the rights to both, that 20th Century Fox would eventually pit the 20th century's most monstrous sci-fi species together in a face-off was a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Pity the result turned out to have no brains.<br/><br/>Living down to expectations, AvP tumbles into an imagination chasm as soon as it starts. Shamelessly ripping off other movies (Mission: Impossible 2, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters...), it staggers through a string of humdrum action sequences - the exchanges between the ET adversaries being remarkably dull and messy - and highlights what a lazy rip-off it really is by relying on in-jokes to maintain interest levels.<br/><br/>Plot holes are like fishes-in-barrels, but here are a few thoughts... Someone ominously pronounces ""There's nothing in Sector 14!"" - yes there is! There's a bloody great disused whaling station there, the population of which all mysteriously disappeared 100 years ago. But don't think to look into it. For that matter, why do Predators only play this xenomorph paintball game every 100 years, when it's obviously such fun? And when Aliens are wounded, why doesn't their concentrated-acid blood react with water? In Alien it takes the critter several hours to pop out of John Hurt; here they go from facehugger to fledgling in about 10 minutes. Evolution is a obviously great thing - except in movie franchises."

This movie is full of blunders and so many that they are unforgivable.The story was not that bad. could have been massively improvised.This director needs to see the matrix for movie making lessons.I mean if your gonna have a huge story telling part in a action movie then give enough time and action to the viewer to balance the both.And what the hell is with this weak depiction of the predator.2 predator popped off by one alien.and predator making friends with cattle (human). man this director needs some serious creativity lessons.i give him some advice in case he reads this. buddy please watch the aliens,predator and matrix series. In my opinion get this movie as a rental whenever out on DVD but do not go to the theatre's and waste your money. all in all 3.5/10. '"

","Well i just returned after watching the movie and the one thing I'm sure I'll never trust are the critics. The ones criticising the movie I'm sure wouldn't have liked the previous Alien and Predator flicks. For the ones who did like them, this one's a step further. Its a good movie. The stunts are good, visual effects are great and the movie is consistent with all the facts in the Alien and Predator movies. The fight AVP fight sequences are adequate, in fact any more and there would have been too much of them. Sure the predator acts more like a star than a predator towards the end but thats that, no other negatives. I'm sure this movie's gonna go down well with all the Alien and Predator fans. Its a must see for all such fans."

","My mother used to tell me, 'If you can't say anything nice about something Noel  shut the hell up!' I never was able to live up to her high standards!<br/><br/>AVP my friends, is an unmitigated disaster.<br/><br/>If one were to rank the two franchises in order of merit, one would probably end up with the following. ALIENS, ALIEN, PREDATOR, ALIEN 3, PREDATOR 2, ALIEN RESURRECTION, ALIEN 2 (lets see who's alert here  there IS an ALIEN 2, I have a copy!) Now not everyone might agree with this order. I will concede 1 and 2 are interchangeable. AVP however ranks somewhere after PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE! <br/><br/>'Loopy' doesn't cover it. Considering the events are taking place some seven years after Danny Glover escaped without a singe, despite being in the immediate nuclear-powered wake of the departing Predator craft (huh? did they come back during a lull in the ratings period?) surely someone in this admittedly dumbass search party would be thinking 'God these critters look vaguely familiar?' Meanwhile, at the other end of the time-line, would not data-records of the AVP encounter have survived until 3946? the year that Ripley blew deep-space insurance premiums out the window, when she fried the Nostromo, just 57 years before she stepped up in class and nuked LV 426.<br/><br/>Anderson is a tried and tested hack, the guy you call-in when you want a brain-dead popcorn movie in release. I personally resent his being given the opportunity to bury two sci-fi legends. What were the producers thinking? Was ANYONE thinking? Very much on a par with THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICKULE in terms of lacking meaningful scenes as opposed to excessive Dolby destruction, AVP is so damn dark, the viewer needs a light saber to see what the Hell's going-on in places.<br/><br/>So wrapped up in his attempts to link Egyptian, Inca and Cambodian (huh?) pre-history with modern Predator-hype, the audience is left gasping at the plot's unoriginality. Even a cursory glance at the Predator hieroglyphs enables one wannabe stormtrooper-cum-Indiana Jones to regale the audience with the entire Predatorial dynastic history. Sheesh!<br/><br/>Meanwhile Anderson and his mega-financed bunch of third-year film-makers are trying to make up their minds whether in fact they are actually shooting an ORIGINAL movie or simply blending a remake of ALIENS, CUBE, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN, PREDATOR 2 and KRULL to name but five derivative sources. The script is abysmal, the actors lack-luster and completely overshadowed by the digitised mayhem. When your best actor is a guy the wrong side of 60 in the twilight of his career, things are serious! Perhaps Henriksen has plans of his own to clone himself for future sequels. He sure as hell looked so old here I was wondering if he had actually died mid-shoot and they had digitised his last few scenes. VAN HELSING proved better than most, the fallacy of digitisingread my lips guys.it just doesn't work. The only two films have used CGI to virtual perfection are JURASSIC PARK and GLADIATOR. Those pesky aliens running amok up and down the Inca pyramid here made THE SCORPION KING seem like a class-act! <br/><br/>Did Ridley Scott need CGI for ALIEN? James Cameron for ALIENS or John McTiernan for PREDATOR? No, and that is why those films were so damn good. The creatures looked real. They were THERE! But there again, who but an idiot would speak of Anderson in the same breath as those other three meticulous directors  craftsmen not journeymen.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the film could have been a winner in different hands and with some more hands-on casting. Well, toss in a decent script, some intelligence and a bit of sunlight maybe.<br/><br/>The last scene was puerile, illogical, crappily shot and edited and absolutely par for the course given the previous 99 minutes.<br/><br/>To summarise: A disappointing, inept, underwhelming and ultimately insulting episode in the lives of two of our favorite extra-terrestrial soapies."

","An incredible and horrific adventure begins when billionaire industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland gathers an international team of archaeologists, scientists and security experts, led by environmentalist and adventurer Alexa ""Lex"" Woods , to investigate a mysterious ""heat bloom"" emanating from deep under Antarctica. <br/><br/>What they witness 2000 feet below the frozen surface at first excites, and then terrifies them. They discover a pyramid bearing a mixture of Aztec, Egyptian and Cambodian cultures. Inside the pyramid they find a matrix of chambers so technologically advanced that it becomes obvious that an extraterrestrial influence has been at work there for thousands of years. The chamber walls reconfigure unexpectedly, trapping members of the team and cutting them off from their colleagues. <br/><br/>Moving from chamber to chamber, the horrific truth finally reveals itself: Predators have been keeping alive a captive Alien Queen who lays eggs at 100 year intervals. Young Predators warriors are tested by fighting the Alien offspring. The team stumbles into the middle of an incredible rite of passage -- and a war between Aliens and Predators. <br/><br/>The iconic monsters from two of the scariest film franchises ever, battle each other on Earth for the first time on film. 14 years in the making, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" (The movie) has been rumored to have been in production ever since the skull of the Alien Queen appeared in the sequel to ""Predator"", ""Predator 2"". The AvP phenomenon has found it's way into the media, in every shape or form. From Trading Cards, to comics, to video games, and finally, the big screen! But was it worth the wait?<br/><br/>Well first of all, having the ""Alien Legacy"" being my favorite film series, I am a HUGE fan of these movies. I was very happy to learn that this movie was actually happening. I could care less what it was rated. Although gore is a high priority in these films. I was scared that I would be disappointed with this film considering I'm not a huge fan of Paul Anderson.<br/><br/>I would have loved to see Micheal Mann or Brain DePalma take on the franchise. I knew it wouldn't happen.When the news came that it was indeed ""PG-13"", I was disappointed, but honestly, I expected it. I first saw AvP the Sunday after it was released. I loved it! In the very few moments where the two bad-ass sci-fi titans are allowed to do their thing, the films shines. <br/><br/>BIG TIME! The acting is much better than I expected from no-names. The story is simple, yet smart. The film was heavily cut according to... well anyone involved in the filming. The R-Rated and proper version will be released on DVD, so take a breath, it's gonna happen. Although us Alien-nerds will never have the satisfaction of having the ultimate ""Aliens Vs. Predator"", this will have to do. And that's fine by me.<br/><br/>AVP is actually far better than it could have been. For weeks I've been hearing terrible buzz about the film. It is actually better than all that. It's fun to watch and, even when the plot gets really hokey, it's easy enough to laugh it off and prepare for the next epic monster battle. To be honest, to me, it's the definitive ""Vs."" movie. We'll have to wait for the R-rated version. Better than Freddy Vs. Jason and the other Vs. movies. It is a very well done flick and one of my favorites. I would love to see more AvP films in the future with more different types of ""Alien"" species.<br/><br/>***1/2/*****"

","The original Alien (1970's) introduced a Female hero and that worked so well. Now it's taken a step further in 2004 with a Black woman! I'm not black, but I think this step to introduce a black woman as a major heroin to Alien's future (AVP movies) is the right way to go. I was so unhappy when Sigorney Weaver deciding to turn to comedy and abandon the Alien scene, but this new female hero has lots of potential. I think this is good casting. I wanted Bishop to be Bishop not so sick old guy!!!!!!!!!!!!! Problem with AVP - too short, not enough character (non-human)development, poor AVP fight scenes. When you are siding with one of them you need to be able to see how the fight is going... like in boxing. you want to see how it happens and fight with your side. Also, too soppy with the Predator and hero chick relationship near the end. What's the main character's name (the girl)? Isn't predator supposed to be a hard core killer. Yeah OK, i did like that they were allies, but it went a bit too far. Will they have a kiss in the next movie?! I hope Alien wins in the end, otherwise hero chick and predator will have babies! I did love AVP though. Good stuff!"

","I'm a hardcore Alien fan and I merely like Predator. I have never collected the card game or played the PC games, nor read the Alien vs. Predator comics. But any Alien sequel will have me buying a ticket.<br/><br/>So, this is a poorly written thriller with no real thrills for everyone who has seen at least one supposedly scary movie from the past ten years. Unlike ""Freddy vs. Jason"", which turned the limitations and the corniness of a cross-over movie into gold, it tries to achieve moments of true tension and suspense, and it fails. Badly.<br/><br/>One can enjoy the thing on a campy level, of course. And actually, the background information of the relationship between Aliens and Predators is not bad at all. I mean, sure, it doesn't make sense historically (Antarctica has been frozen for a long time, longer than the other Paul Anderson seems to be aware of), but who cares? I'm not sure if we have to credit that idea to the writers of the movie or to those who worked on the Alien vs. Predator universe. Sorry, can't help you there.<br/><br/>It's crap.

The fact that you negative movie critics sit here on the net all day long dissing movies and prying on all the little things that make a movie ""wrong"", such as the size of a weapon or one line which didn't make complete sense with what you thought you knew in the other movies... who gives a s**t. It's a movie... we are supposed to be entertained, and this movie did just that. The movie had more adventure, intense action and a breakthrough in special effects than that of the other mvoies. It stayed true to it's fans with the creatures and the structure of the story and most of all, it was something different.

","What occurs isn't a merger or a union, but a true collision in the worst sense: an accident, a nasty guts-all-over-the-pavement car crash.<br/><br/>Earth, early 2000s. A corporate giant puts together a team for a secret mission to the Arctic, where an ancient pyramid has been detected under the ice. Turns out, it's a rite- of-passage hunting facility for Predators, the main game being the nasty xenomorphs from the Alien saga...<br/><br/>This film and its sorry sequel show that when you point to the moon, an idiot will stare at your finger. It would appear that the people in charge of this and its sorry sequel carefully studied the Aliens and Predator designs and balance-sheets, but failed to watch even a single film of either franchise. How else could you simultaneously undermine both mythologies to such an extent, while producing something so forgettable? It also blindly shrugs aside all the ideas that made its forbears great: it gives away its last survivor in the opening minutes, it forgets to create any real tension or memorable set-pieces and instead stumbles from one half-baked jump-scare to the next... And worst of all, it is ugly to behold.<br/><br/>The Alien saga was visually designed by some of the greatest talents in the industry: Scott, Cameron, Fincher, Jeunet... even the original Predator had at its helm a master of smart action, and its follow-up had worthy moments. AVP is a combination of bland and baffling, with most of the confrontations shown in hastily edited close-ups in near-total darkness, with no sense of composition, rhythm or geography.<br/><br/>The only piece of advice Anderson and his team have taken to heart is that ""less isn't more: more is more"", a maxim James Cameron put to smart use in Aliens. Here they just go for a ""bigger is better"" approach, aided by sometimes sub-par CGI. As a result, not only are proportions all over the map, but the alien queen is the size of a building, face- huggers the size of a small bathtub... <br/><br/>What even keeps this from being enjoyable in a perverse, mocking way, is the terrible sense of waste and missed opportunity. Even one of the obvious outcomes of an alien/predator duel, a hybrid creature, is squandered, and you're left with a big loud ugly lump of a film, with no ideas and certainly no balls, one that bodes ill for both franchises given the obvious lack of respect is has for either. <br/><br/>Do not waste your time or your money on this."

","This beloved Dark Horse comic series has been brought to the big screen.... where it died a horrible death. Elements of both the Aliens and Predator series were combined in the comics to create a tapestry, a story. The movie takes a proton blast to the tapestry and burns it to shreds. If you enjoy any of the two genres separately (4 Alien & 2 Predator movies) skip this one. It is the proverbial Alien chest-burster after the perfect meal. The story revolves around the discovery of a giant structure underneath (way underneath) the Antarctic and the expedition that is formed to go there. Lance Henriksen makes an appearance (no doubt to lure any fans of the Aliens genre to see this lobotomy) as the billionaire Weyland (aka Bishop - its his middle name). Lance's career must be winding down because he agreed to do this movie or the lure of free medicinal marijuana was just too strong to resist (he keeps inhaling the whole movie). I wish we could all get a dose of what Lance was inhaling at the door, as a courtesy. The rest of the movie is a blur. I'm not much of a masochist to want to remember. It involves the main character, Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan) , being peer pressured into going further and further into the hole. The Aliens have now developed a sort of martial arts style, and the Predators seem to have lost more brain cells than Lance. This movie would have been 100 times better without the inclusion of the human element. I would have made a documentary based movie with no subtitles or dialog, just Aliens versus Predators. By the way thank you for not getting rid of the annoying French archaeologist earlier. His character was quite meaningful."

","No offense intended to anyone who enjoyed Alien V Predator, but I have to say I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>Considering the potential to make a battle of epic proportions between two of Fox's greatest extra-terrestrial villains, it was a pretty poor effort.<br/><br/>Sure, the Alien/Predator battle scenes were excellent, however there were simply too few. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for measured amounts of action and plot, but the plot and dialogue were so poor that the film needed the extra Alien/Predator action.<br/><br/>Personally, I would have set the story on far larger scale, included many more battle sequences between the two psychotic ETs, hired a better director and set it in a location with more potential for destruction. Also the film is called ALIEN V PREDATOR and not Alien V Predators and Humans. The tag line was total rubbish : WHOEVER WINS, WE LOSE. No actually, Predator wins and so does the human because the Alien Queen and all her soldiers get an ass-kicking! (Oh but an Alien comes out of the Predator's stomach at the end, but so-what ? Nothing else happens unless Fox make enough money warrant a sequel.)<br/><br/>Totally milking the franchise by Fox.

","Paul Anderson does it again. Here comes another standard, sub-standard movie which is wildly debated on online message boards. Here is my take on the film (contains spoilers).<br/><br/>Alien Vs. Predator is just standard Anderson fare. No spectacular battle scenes or meaningful dialogue here. We do get an incoherent storyline, action scenes filmed by a 5-year old, and almost no character development. Instead of just critiquing and bitching about the film as a whole, which would take way too much time, I thought I would list the positive, if brief, aspects of the movie. <br/><br/>Both the ship that looked like a Queen alien and the actual Queen alien chase scene in the snow were impressive. I enjoyed the Predator's stylish reverse jump slash. My favorite shot by far was the laser shooting from the Predators' ship. Well, that's about it.. .<br/><br/>I seriously wonder if Paul Anderson thinks scenes like the buddy-cop team-up between the lead character and the Predator are good ideas. The shield and crude spear? Or the slo-mo dash which had the audience in stitches?<br/><br/>5/10 (Watch it when it comes out on DVD unedited and pray it gets a 6/10)"

The small in-jokes sprinkled throughout the movie are the only things worth watching and they amount to roughly twelve seconds of viewing time.<br/><br/>Mr. Weyland (a robotics expert whose middle name is Bishop - get it?) assembles a crack team of archaeologists, geologists, miners, and oh, blood thirsty mercenaries, to go after some Incan/Mayan/Cambodian temple buried in the Arctic ice so that he can leave something of importance behind - namely the knowledge that there is an ugly old building in some dark, cold cave. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the filmmakers wasted twenty to thirty minutes of our time trying to give these idiots motivation and character, the protagonists are one dimensional props sent into an unbelievably contrived situation for the express purpose of getting caught in the middle of a cosmic car wreck and so you don't feel the least bit sorry when the crap hits the fan and they all start to get eaten. Of course, the interior of the Predator's house o' fun is so poorly lit that we don't even get the satisfaction of seeing these non-people getting obliterated.<br/><br/>Watching this movie and coming out disappointed is like taking a huge bite out of a turd sandwich and wondering why it didn't taste good."
"dreams_in_dts","Null","0","1","12 September 2004"," A hands-on review (NO SPOILERS)
","(NO SPOILERS) Many people, including myself at one point, have asked how this movie is. If you are an avid sci-fi movie-lover, I'd say this movie is a ""very good"". If, apart from that, you are a Alien and/or Predator movie and/or comic-book freak of the creatures, or even an amateur... it is IMHO just AWESOME. If you are neither, then there is little background to support the small details a fan will look and love right away at, but I think regular action-movie lovers will like it anyway. <br/><br/>Having said that, there are no flaws on the script and the acting is excellent. Except maybe a couple of small ones, everything is very ""beleivable"" and there is very little or no ""stupid humor"" at all, the one most people who are not American usually dislike. <br/><br/>Effects are top of the line, same as the sound production. You cannot tell anything is CGI right away... you just ""assume"" because it cannot be made in reality. But even the gravity is *perfect*. Gravity is a part of CGI animation that IMHO is first shown flawless during a WHOLE movie. Apart from that, nothing looks plastic or ""fake"". These observations regarding the CGI quality are two where even Lucas' movies (Star Wars) fall short... and I am also a fan of those. <br/><br/>Personally, I've seen it twice and own all the 4 Alien DVDs and the 2 Predator DVDs and I've been a fan since Alien (the 1st movie)."
"jlsanchez01","6","0","1","12 September 2004"," A (potentially) decent movie ruined in the editing room.
","(Minor Spoilers)<br/><br/>First of all, I'm a fan of the Alien and Predator franchises. Like most other fans, I liked the firs ALIEN and I loved ALIENS, but I was seriously disappointed by ALIEN 3 and only a little less by ALIEN: RESURRECTION. On the other hand, I almost enjoyed PREDATOR 2 more than the original PREDATOR. I agree that the original is a better movie, though (make of that what you want). Since I liked the first RESIDENT EVIL (haven't seen APOCALYPSE yet), I wasn't as appalled as many when I learned Paul W.S. Anderson was directing. Now that I've seen the movie, I still think he did and okay job, but the end result is kind of a mess because of studio interference (or at least that seems to be the reason according to Anderson).<br/><br/>The first act is probably the worst: I agree that in a movie called ALIEN vs. PREDATOR human characters are not that important, but if we are going to expend about half of the running time with them before our beloved monsters show up and steal the show, they should have tried to flesh out the characters a bit. After all, we see most of the movie from their point of view, right? Sanaa Lathan is not a bad actress, but I'm afraid she suffers from a lack of charisma and tries a little too hard to be a Ripley wannabe. In the first two ALIEN movies, Ripley was not a tough girl who loved extreme sports. She was just a regular woman who had to fight for her life and for other people's lives. In fact, there are moments in both movies when she just can't stand the pressure and briefly breaks down. Alexa Woods (Lathan's character) looks more like the poor man's Lara Croft. Lance Henriksen, on the other hand, is a treat for any Alien fan, and I think they did a good job using his character to tie this movie with the rest of the Alien franchise. Too bad he was just a special guest star, but at least he had more screen time than in ALIEN 3. Of the rest of the cast, the only ones I really liked were Colin Salmon and Ewen Bremmer. Salmon plays more or less his character form RESIDENT EVIL, and once again he dies too soon (not as soon as in RE, though). As for Bremmer, I loved to see Spud from TRAINSPOTTING in this kind of movie. His character may be annoying at times, but overall I had some fun with him. Of the two archaeologists, one was a cardboard cut-out made up to deliver some of the expository dialogue. In other words: Cannon fodder. The other was only slightly more developed: She was Italian and it was hinted that he was attracted to Alexa. Of course, that means he was doomed. The blonde girl with the gun (her only two distinctive features) didn't seem to serve a purpose other than to have more than one woman in the movie. I welcomed her quick demise. There were other anonymous co-stars who bough the farm without anybody caring about them. I wonder why Anderson didn't do what he did in RESIDENT EVIL (killing the supporting cast as soon as possible), but most of them were redundant. Nice to see the medic from RE in the opening scene, though.<br/><br/>The story really kicks off when the fight begins, midway though the movie. It was a shame that two of the three predators died so soon, but at least one of them had a great fight scene that was better than anything seen on ALIEN 3 or RESURRECTION. The remaining alien and his weaponry were still great to watch. I know many didn't like his teaming up with Alexa, but I think it was a nice reference to the comic-book (as well as the distinctive scar made with the acid). Besides: Alexa helped him (the first human in a Predator movie to do so). The plot was more or less respectful with the Alien and Predator lore, except for one obvious problem that many have pointed out: Predators only come to earth on specially hot summers, and AvP is set in freaking Antartica. That said, the pyramid and the idea of the Predators having been considered as gods in the past is fine with me.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie sort of a let down in spite of several good bits are the bi-dimensional characters, the rushed narrative and the PG-13 rating. I hope someday we'll see an R-rated Special Edition on DVD with some deleted scenes restored. Till that day, this is an okay movie, but not the great event we all wish it was."

The film I saw was a pointless and really rather dull franchise cash-in from pointless and really rather dull writer/director Paul Anderson, which wheezes it's way towards the end credits.<br/><br/>Witty, insightful, character-building dialogue is dropped in favour of dry and unconvincing exposition, our heroes work out complex mathematical puzzles in seconds explaining them in over-long, plot intensive, pseudo-scientific jargon. The poor characterisation and weak dialogue is compounded by an uninteresting story, which is muddled and particularly badly plotted.<br/><br/>There's no real challenge for the human cast to take on - nothing to involve the audience. The humans get in the way a lot, stumbling into Alien lairs, walking into the Predators (forgivable since the Predators use their invisibility-cloaking thingy).<br/><br/>The Aliens fight the Predators and vice-versa. And that's about it. The facehuggers, chestbursters and Alien Queens are all here, but the final mix is well below par - the originating films (and in the case of 'Alien' we're going back over 25 years here, people) are far more entertaining than this join-the-dots concoction."

","The enormous commercial success of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" (one of the worst mainstream films of recent memory) made ""Alien vs. Predator"" a cinematic reality. What can you say? The movie is not much when you put it on celluloid. It is a dark and bleak mesh of two ideas that wore their welcomes out long ago. A team of scientists led by Sanaa Lathan and corporate bigwig Lance Henriksen (playing a different role from earlier ""Alien"" pictures) go to Antarctica of all places to drill hundreds of feet beneath the frozen ground to explore a pyramid that time seemingly forgot. Naturally predators built the structure centuries earlier and we get a strange combination of Egyptology and other ancient civilizations. Also predators have been the universe's greatest warriors and they have proven their worth in their field by hunting---you guessed it, the aliens. How are humans involved? They have been used to breed the alien creatures for future hunts. Ridiculous territory does not get helped out by awful cinematography and art direction that is hard to even recognize. The performers are just window-dressing to present the two groups of entities in would-be-frightening form. This is officially the fifth time that an ""Alien"" film has been produced and the third time for the ""Predator"" series. Each series (particularly ""Alien"") started out very strong, but now we are left with a lack of storyline material and thus we have an uninteresting mixture that has no business combining. Probably the worst film for each series. Still a bit better than ""Freddy vs. Jason"", but really what film isn't? 2 stars out of 5."

","I really can't say to much about this wasted opportunity. First of all the studio who obviously didn't have a clue took this from Anderson, much like what happened to his terrible Resident Evil and tried to make it more friendly for the kiddies. How do 6 R-rated films culminate into a PG-13 rated piece of junk? I'm not sure what the studio was thinking but not sure the R rating would have helped it anyways. The story is bland at most, a coming to age for the teenage Predators, fighting their way through the Aliens to become warriors. Here are a few spoilers<br/><br/>*** Spoilers****<br/><br/>There really isn't much to spoil since the plot was so terrible. Fight scenes were crap, the dialogue was laughable. The team up of the Human and Teenage Predator was the silliest thing I've ever seen. I was waiting for her to kiss her new boyfriend. All the Humans should have died, and if we could have seen any of the violence it would have been nice. Tumbling and throwing Aliens around was ridiculous and seemed to me it was geared toward the younger audience. <br/><br/>I paid no money to see it so it was just wasted time for me. It's not all bad, at least there were practical effects used and it wasn't all CGI. The bullet time face huggers were laughable and was an unwise choice for Anderson and his team who thought that up. I hope someone will make this film right one day and a studio will let them..."

","Even approaching the movie with the knowledge that it was not in the class of its predecessors and that it should be viewed in the category of 'guilty pleasure' did not make the experience enjoyable. The fun in the other films comes from the scares brought about by not really knowing what it is that the characters are up against. The thrills and scares unwound slowly and increased steadily after introducing us to interesting characters that lock the audience and our interest into the story. Visually, each film was very different, and even 'Alien: Resurrection' (which, until now, was considered the least significant in the 'Alien' series) had a unique cinematic texture to its appearance. The monsters in both series were creations that, once they stepped from the shadows, were frightening and awe-inspiring. Ridley Scott, Jim Cameron, David Fincher, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and John McTiernan are all genre-breaking directors in their own ways. They created challenging adventures of fear, not just monster movies. Under Anderson's control, 'Aliens Vs Predator' is just another splatter-fest. <br/><br/>Experts of various types are gathered by industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) when his satellites discover a huge Aztec-like pyramid under the ice of Antarctica. One of the experts is Alexa Woods (Sanaa Lathan), a world-class mountain climber. She will be leading the team through the descent. She also seems to have nearly omnipotent powers of exposition and becomes quite the speculative chatterbox whenever something needs to be explained to the audience. Barring the two archaeological characters, whose names I have already forgotten, the other characters are nearly indistinguishable. <br/><br/>The pyramid has been reactivated by a space ship of Predators, who blast a conveniently big hole right through 2000 feet of ice to the front stairs of the place. The humans climb down, set off a booby trap and get lost in the changing maze of the pyramid. The heat that attracted the human satellite was the thawing of the Alien queen that will lay eggs for a brood to impregnate the humans giving the Predators something deadly to hunt. Predator lore says that they only hunt honorably challenging prey, but they don't seem averse to slaughtering a few nearly-helpless humans on the way in, however. The Aliens grow and start killing everything that moves. The Predators show up and kill almost everything that moves. The humans, in dwindling numbers, run away from the monsters. The last survivors (And, no, it's not a real surprise who lives) make nice with the remaining Predator, and they run for the surface as a bomb goes off. There is a final showdown with the Alien queen, and then the Predators leave. <br/><br/>Admittedly, one does not see a movie with 'Vs' in the title and expect that character development will be given foremost consideration. However, character is barely considered to the point that it is almost incidental. The reason that Sigourney Weaver's Ripley was so memorable and enduring was that she never stood out in the first movie as the probable survivor. She exhibited differing levels of doubt, fear and outrage. Even in the sequels, she was the reluctant heroine who had as much chance of getting killed as any other character. Although Arnold Schwarzenegger's Major 'Dutch' Schaeffer was clearly the hero of 'Predator' from the get-go, the rest of his team was allowed to display individuality and personal value to the situation. Each time one fell to their invisible foe, it raised the stakes for the audience and for Arnold's character. Alexa is featured as the strongest character from her very introduction. While it is disturbing when others are dispatched, they are merely bait or cannon fodder whose demise only means that there are fewer players left in the game.<br/><br/>The effects are the only impressive thing here. However, everything else wastes the good visuals. The film is heavy on the expository shots lining up the layout of the pyramid. These Saturday-morning cartoon scene changes pull the audience out of the film each and every time. Anderson's biography on IMDb states that one of his trademarks is 'quick cut editing'. There are a great many quick cuts. There are so many that you can't make out most of the action. There is a flurry of activity in most battle scenes, a brutal final blow and one character or another is left standing. The story then moves to the next plot point. <br/><br/>When it isn't a snow job of strobe editing, it is setting up a 'money shot' of gore. Watch as the facehugger is shot in its sexual organ! See the acid devour someone's skin! Look at the blood drip off of the seemingly invisible blade! If Anderson had paid as much attention to the moments between characters, then these grotesque special effects would be moments of real horror. They are all as empty as Tupperware containers tossed back in the fridge after the leftovers have been served. Even the potentially interesting situation of a Predator becoming infected by an Alien is wasted on a cheap visual for a parting shot that is probably intended to imply a sequel. I wonder if even junior high school fanboys will find enough real fun in this movie to warrant a second chapter.<br/><br/>However, if you are still curious to see this movie, then go bearing a couple of things in mind. Don't ask why an archaeological expedition is armed like a platoon of marines. Don't ask why aliens grow at different rates in different people. Don't ask why an ancient temple buried under Antarctica, loaded with a bizarre combination of dead languages, bloodthirsty aliens and unearthly technological weapons needs to twist like the inside of a Rubix cube in order to be creepy. You are in the misguiding hands of Director Paul W. S. Anderson. Although he professes to be a fan of these horror franchises, he is certainly no fan of suspense or entertainment.<br/><br/>2 out of 10"

Growing up on all versions of both characters...I was just glad to see them rough each other up after all the years of waiting. The effects are fantastic.

","I'm a hardcore Alien/Predator fan, but I couldn't bring myself to wasting money to see this movie in the theatre. Well, I got a free movie ticket in the Predator Special Edition box, so I finally broke down and went to see the movie. I won't summarize the movie or anything, because I'm sure everyone knows by now the plot of this thing.<br/><br/>As for the review....<br/><br/>1. I know there were a million different routes to go, but perhaps this movie's storyline should have followed the AvP: Prey novel, because that story was very well done and exciting.<br/><br/>2. The movie just felt rushed. I appreciate that Paul Andersen tried to build up some kind of character development, but the fact is, Paul Andersen sucks at character development, and the first Alien/Predator fight was so choppy and quick, it was really difficult to watch, difficult in the Blair Witch Project type of way. <br/><br/>3. The music was uninspiring, and Andersen failed to make the 2 most terrifying creatures in the fictional universe not scary at all. The vibe I got from this movie was a fake atmosphere intended to scare little kids, and no other emotions involved. What a stupid cheap popcorn flick.<br/><br/>4. Although I had many complaints, the worst part of this movie for me was the fact that Andersen made the Predators look like little bitches. Now I know they are teens, and should have some variance from the other movies, but they looked really off: their height and stubbornness, facial features and expressions, and most of all, their stupid mannerisms. Maybe it was the fact that Kevin Peter Hall did too good of a job for a guy in a suit, but the predators in this movie don't portray their feelings and thoughts very well. <br/><br/>5. OK, I know Andersen said that he wanted more animatronics and models and puppets, instead of doing CG, but he really was lying. You could totally tell that most of the shots with more than 1 alien were CG, which sucks, and the queen running at the end was ridiculous, it was freakin T-Rex for Christ's sake!<br/><br/>6. And last but not least, the horrible acting and dialogue. Now, I can blame the Fox Execs for making it PG-13 and all the other stuff, but most of the blame should be given to Paul Andersen, because his final products are mediocre at best. I will say, this is his best film, but that isn't saying much considering how bad his other movies are. He ruined this film for me."

Or growling voices. Whatever you would call them, the real ALIENS do not have anything else other then hissing sounds. Where would that sound come from anyway. <br/><br/>And the Predators, now have LION voices? Lame... It was good that it sounded a bit like it in the originals, but it was not really required that they would sound exactly like lions.<br/><br/>And the characters... PLEASE! What a bunch of PC B.S.!<br/><br/>And the story? Written by a 8 year old. Cannot fathom how Hollywood allows this CRAP to be shown on the silver screen.<br/><br/>This is a very poor movie, it holds no flame next to either one of the originals. At this point even ALIEN 4 was better than this one.<br/><br/>They should never have done this, never have such a lame director and story presented to us. <br/><br/>I knew it would be crap the moment I saw the director explaining more or less what the movie was about LONG before it was even finished...<br/><br/>They needed to see if they were aiming at brain dead people or fans... I guess it they went with the easiest choice...<br/><br/>If you like the originals, then stay far away from this one.

","One of the worst movies I've ever seen. What a crapulous, brain-dead, festering hemorrhoid of a movie. If Hollywood had a great big pimple on its face, and you squeezed it, this is the movie that would come out. I'd hate to have to pay the Vaseline budget for this atrocity. Slime city!<br/><br/>Thirty or forty people (who's counting? not even the SFX and stunt people who will be killing them like ducks in a shooting gallery) set off across the Antarctic ice to find some sort of giant Rubik's Cube 2000 feet down. They are led (hah!) by Sanaa Lathan, who everyone ignores. I've seen Raggedy Ann dolls who can act better than Lathan. No 'character' is distinguishable from any other 'character,' except for Lance Henriksen, who looks dead before he's even killed, and a cartoon Scotsman. Boy, was I glad when that sucker was killed. The Rubik's Cube begins to shift around for no purpose other than to split people up. The movie was so dark I seldom had any idea who was doing what to whom ... and I never cared. I'd compare this movie to a video game, but that's an insult to video game writers. I can't believe anybody wrote this film. I mean, actually sat down at a word processor and wrote down the awful, stupid dialogue. I really wonder if a computer program wrote it, from a list of bad lines and cliché situations.<br/><br/>It's a sad commentary on the wretched state of the action film in America today that this waste of celluloid and electricity took in $40M its first weekend. They seem to think we'll go see anything ... and apparently they're right.

"FilmOtaku","2","0","1","25 August 2004"," What made me think this film would actually be worth the time I spent in the theater?
","*Spoilers ahead  like they are going to be any surprise*<br/><br/>I should have known this film would suck as thoroughly as it did, so why was I surprised at how bad it turned out to be? Paul W.S. Anderson outdid himself with 'Alien Vs. Predator', a 101 minute crap-fest that had me struck dumb with its idiocy. The alleged 'story' is that there is an archaeological expedition of a pyramid that is 2,000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. No, its okay  you read that right. A billionaire, played by Lance Henriksen, (oh the irony!) has commissioned a crack team of explorers, archeologists and scientists to 'discover' this pyramid  because we find out after he conveniently starts hacking up a lung that he wants to 'make his mark before he dies.' Luckily, that happens in the near future, along with pretty much every other sap that goes along on this bogus journey. Back to the original 'plot', however  buried deep within this pyramid are the legends of two great movie franchises of the late 1970's and 1980's  the Aliens and the Predators. Little did we know, after sitting through a handful of their respective films, they turn out to have a history together, and it's a little embarrassing, in that the Aliens, thousands of years ago, were basically bred to be the Predators' cannon fodder  they were hunted by these great dread-locked beasts who have masks like Silons, only without the cool red light moving back and forth. The humans become the bait in order for the Aliens to come out and play with them, and they in turn are then hunted by the Predators. <br/><br/>The tagline for this film is 'Whoever wins We lose.' Truer words were never spoken. I found myself, within the first minute of the appearance of the Aliens/Predators not even caring who won or lost  I wanted every human on the screen dead, and I wanted the movie to be over as quickly as possible. There isn't even a point to listing why this film was so crappy, because I somehow don't think that the studio will pay for my carpel tunnel surgery. I would have even been satisfied with some good fight scenes, but the one and a half scenes that actually gave the title of the film any credence were so jumbled and shaky that I was longing for a battle between Gamera and Baragon or something. Japanese guys in rubber suits would have been more satisfying than anything this film had to offer. The only thing that 'saved' this film from getting a tepid three millimeters incline of 'thumbs up' and instead got it a whopping four millimeters was the fact that I got so many laughs out of it. Unfortunately, they were not during the moments that Anderson wanted the audience to laugh, (I think during the ceremonial rite of carrying off one of the fallen Predators while one of the remaining humans that teamed up with it to fight a big Alien looked on (yes, you read that right too) was supposed to elicit a more serious thought than 'At least they could offer to drop her off  they have a spaceship and she has no way to get home.') Because I howled in some spots, the film gets maybe one star as opposed to a half star. MAYBE one star  I'm feeling a little nostalgic for Mystery Science Theater 3000 at this point and am therefore a little softer."
"rachelsfx","3","0","1","26 August 2004"," A Glaring Disappointment for Alien and Predator Fans
","Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat) had to cut a lot of scenes to get a hard PG-13 rating to get the kids in theaters but still scores no where close to the talents of Ridley Scott (Alien), James Cameron (Aliens), or John McTiernan (Predator). No jolts or scares really. Formulaic and no where near as fun as Milla kicking Zombie butt in Resident Evil or as kosher as Mortal Kombat. You might want to wait for the DVD to see the ""real"" movie that probably was a hard R-rating. Won't divulge details but the Predators are dispatched almost as easily as the unwary humans. Alexa Woods attempts to be as bad as Sigourney Weaver yet those are huge shoes to fill. A lack of character development didn't help. Fox should have released the ""real"" movie so us adults would come back for a haunt. I bet they will on DVD so someone will buy it or they will end this promising franchise. -Rach"

I really enjoyed AVP, but I just couldn't help but pointing out this odd 'coincidence.' Other than The X-Files movie there was a relationship between the television series and AVP.

","I writing this review in response to another reviewer who claimed this was an excellent action flick: Sir, you couldn't possibly be any further from the truth. This movie was doomed from the very beginning. First of all the movie takes two of the greatest of Hollywood villains and tries to choose a victor which is extremely hard to do and bound to leave some unsatisfied. Also, they did an excellent job on the costume design in the original predator movies which, sadly, was changed in this movie. In the fight between the aliens and the predators, they had Alexa Woods, played by Sanaa Lathan, fight on the side of the predator. First of all having humans pick a side is questionable, but if you going to do it cast The Rock or Vin Diesel NOT Woods. Also, at the end, Woods is made an 'honorary predator' which is probably the cheesiest scene in the entire movie and maybe on any action movie this year. on a more general level the movie is exceedingly predictable, I could basically map out who was going to die and when after the first 20 mins of the movie. It was supposed to be suspenseful and yet it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat at all. Finally, considering how powerful the villains are, the final battle was very disappointing.<br/><br/>Essentially this movie is a sequence of action scenes with out any logical or rational explanations from one action scene to the next. I gave this movie a 3 and I was being generous."
"boondocksaint20","4","0","1","18 August 2004"," Should have been so much better. One of the biggest letdowns of all time.
","I admit...after seeing the trailer to Aliens vs. Predator (I refuse to call it by that marketing friendly corporate bastardization of a three letter title), I was psyched. It looked like it would really capture that atmosphere of the other films of the series. And though it wasn't the worst movie ever, it sure was one of the most disappointing.<br/><br/>Let me elaborate on what I mean by disappointing...I read many comments on this site that totally bashed the film, which I usually trust to give an accurate representation of how a movie really is. I already let my expectations down to a bare minimum, but still, being a huge fan of the Aliens series, and really liking the two predator movies, and loving the books based on this movie, it was almost impossible not to feel extreme letdown, even when decreasing all hopes for a good movie to the smallest level possible.<br/><br/>Let me start by what is actually good in this movie. The special effects are pretty good. It was really nice to see more old school puppetry and makeup effects, and less CGI (though there is quite a bit of CGI, it's for the most part, pretty good). Also, like most of Anderson's films, what he does well are setting up elaborate sets that in a decent movie (notice I said, 'decent'), it usually really adds to the mood. However, 'decent' is light years from describing this movie. <br/><br/>That's about it for the good parts. Yep, two things. Now onto the bad...<br/><br/>I know the vast majority of posts here go into elaborate raves and rants about this film...and they are mostly right. But still, I feel I need to vent some frustration and add my $0.02. First off, though the scenery is really well done, this surprisingly does not add to the mood at all. Okay, considering the title, I wasn't expecting top notch acting, but from an Aliens or Predator movie, I was expecting a lot more than what I got. The acting was for the most part pretty bad...I mean I consider most of the Aliens movies and the two Predator movies of a higher quality of sci-fi/horror...maybe they aren't the best films, but at least they deliver good performances from their actors, and you can connect with at least one or two of them. This movie doesn't develop any character more than maybe a sentence or two, so we really don't care if any or none of them live. Even Alien Resurrection, my least favorite of the series, had some characters that were either a little bit fleshed out or at least had an interesting personality that made them intriguing. It is that connection that in any horror movie is essential...and it is usually governed by a good script and of course, good actors. I mean horror is supposed to be cheesy, that's a given, but a good movie means having a good story and having good characters...otherwise what's the point? We have about 30 or so stock characters (I swear, I think they just kept recycling a few of the actors in some of the massacre scenes) that we don't give a damn about, and they literally get slaughtered by the dozen. The few that did seem interesting (the girl who played Adele, the gun toting blonde chick was by far the coolest character in the movie, but was barely on screen, as well as Colin Salmon's character...what a waste of talent) are literally thrown into the meat grinder, most of them off screen, of course. So what's the point? I mean, the movie's tiny running time of 87 or so minutes wastes about 75% of the running time just showing scenes where the idiot humans get sent as lambs to the slaughter and are just pointlessly dispatched.<br/><br/>Okay, I know you've heard that rant a million times before if you've read this board..so I will go onto other complaints, but just the major ones, and hopefully ones few others go into. I will admit, the first 40 minutes or so of buildup (that tastefully do not show either species) were pretty good, but it's when the slashing and gutting occur is when the movie falls apart. There just wasn't enough of the Aliens...we got to see a ton of the Predators, but oddly, weren't they primarily supposed to be hunting the Aliens, and not the humans? Here's another thing...it's Antartica in the middle of the night, and we have some actors having jolly old conversations outside in the SUB ZERO WEATHER with no protective head gear nor parka hood and not so much as a shiver...oh and also, the studio couldn't spare the extra bucks to turn the temperature down so we could see maybe their breath in the air? Oh, and don't forget, Predators have infrared eyesight...which I would have thought the cold weather would have masked their body heat, and thus, save for their flash lights (a la Predator 2), it would be impossible for them to see the humans. That drove me crazy the whole time.<br/><br/>The direction is pretty amateurish...I don't disdain Paul Anderson like a lot of ppl do, but I don't admire him either. I think he's a so-so director who has the passion, just not the talent. His other works reflect this...mostly movies that had awesome premises and setups and SHOULD have been awesome, but usually settle for mediocrity (Resident Evil, Event Horizon, and on the lower end, even Soldier). I think his past movies are all entertaining and have their moments, but are not 'Showstoppers' if you know what I mean. <br/><br/>Okay, here is my biggest complaint of the night...the first fight scene between the Predators and the first Alien is without a doubt, THE WORST action sequence I have seen from a big budget movie in my entire life. Honestly, it is so confusing and so ""MTV-ed""...cut in and out of the scene, with short flashes of picture...a claw here, a spear here, teeth and slime there...need I say more? For a movie whose title represents said scene alone would classify this as a complete failure. There are many other scenes where 'cool camera tricks' that were hip maybe 10 years ago are used, and then repeated, and repeated over and over again (i.e. the ubiquitous overhead shots of the infamous 'Sacrificial Chamber Room').<br/><br/>Frustration cannot describe how I feel...thank goodness I had that free pass from my new Predator DVD, paying $7.00 for this crap would have been highway robbery. This is a prime example of a studio cashing in and selling out. Now, I know that Fox gutted this film from Anderson's original cut, and it really shows, and no, I'm not only just talking about the sparse use of gore, but the fact that there were too many scenes that you could tell were ghetto rigged together, to trim down to a kid friendly PG-13. I'll give Anderson the benefit of the doubt that Fox completely cut and ruined his film, but what I won't give him is that his director's cut could possibly be that much better.<br/><br/>I can't believe it, the industry has reached a new low...and I can't believe the movie that us fans of the series have been salivating over for over 10 years...turning front and center towards any nugget of information about some rumor heard from a friend of a friend who knows a guy who works for someone who is the former roommate of some executive at Fox, is really a pretty boring, way too formulaic, non-scary, voided of excitement, thrill lacking crap-fest. Oh and don't get me started with the whole Predator and lone woman running in slow motion as a blazing fireball pursues them. I know there was a camaraderie between humans and Predators in the books, but come on. Cheese has now been given a whole new meaning.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is pretty sorry. No, it's not the worst movie ever, but it gets even lower points for being a complete letdown given the hype and buildup this movie has had going for it for the longest time. Other than a bland timewaster, it has nothing at all, redeemable about it. I never thought I'd say this, but I hope that this truly secured the nails on the coffin to two of the scariest movie monsters of all time. Sadly, corporate greed will resurrect them time and time again.<br/><br/>A very generous 4/10 stars, mostly out of pity."

"endeyequote","2","0","1","17 August 2004"," The Curse of Lowered Expectations...
","There is malignant growth that has been growing and festering within the movie industry and in the minds of movie goers within in recent years. It has a name: lowered expectations. And in a most disturbing way this malignancy has reared its ugly head with the release of Alien Vs. Predator.<br/><br/>Let me preface this argument by saying I am huge fan of the Alien and Predator movies. All of them. Including the ones that many people believe are sub par, like Predator 2, Alien3, and Alien Resurrection. In defense of those I say they are terribly underrated and suffer from the fact that they are very different from the ones that proceeded them. It is the change of style and flavor that irked many viewers, but not the actual quality of the films. Predator 2 being moved into a city setting dissatisfied many people, but taken on its own its still an excellent movie. The same is true for drastic changes in the last two Alien movies. Each film, individually, has its merits and has a place within the series and the mythos.<br/><br/>Back on point, the movie Alien Vs. Predator shamed its predecessors in many ways. But Alien Vs. Predators pitfalls and failings are not what I wish to discuss. Raging debate has ensued on many message boards and sci-fi printings as to whether or not people expected too much of the film. The argument for those who say the movie is passable is a simple one: that the audience expected too much of the film going in. This argument has a gigantic flaw, however. That flaw is called integrity. To those who thought that the movie was a passable entry into the series as long as one lowered their expectations I say this: why should the audience have to lower their standards in order to enjoy a film? Why must we become mindless drones for the movie industry to feed glitz, sex, and explosions too in order to now enjoy a series that was held to a high standard of quality in the sci-fi industry before? Why do we wish to continue to sit back and be fed, to be vulgar, crap, so that the industry can skimp on quality in favor of glamour?<br/><br/>Hollywood and the film industry in general is turning a corner. They are increasingly putting the focus on a marketable product rather than a quality one. This itself, however, doesn't make a lot of sense, because this philosophy has increasingly proved that it ultimately hurts a films ticket sales rather than help. Alien Vs. Predator may have made the number 1 spot this week, but its sales dropped dramatically from Friday to Saturday, which is actually extremely rare. Usually a weekend release does better numbers on Saturday than it does of Friday. It took one day for movie goers to tell people they knew that this movie was not worth seeing. It is likely that next week the movie will drop several, if not many, spots. If, however, the Fox had delivered a quality movie the word of mouth would have led people in greater numbers to attend the film on Saturday. That is the key: word of mouth. That is why Saturday does better than Friday, because many movie goers enjoy going opening weekend, but most want to see what their friends thought first. They wait for the most important review they will ever hear: those of people they know and trust. Not reviews on websites or in the paper, and not from cleverly cut trailers. So in the end the sub par product not only cheapens the theatre experience for movie goers, but hurts the entire industry because virtually every failed movie has an effect. In the time when movies on average cost between 20-150 million to make, every single failed feature impacts the industry to some degree. In the run for the quick buck many in the industry have lost sight of the long term picture. A bad movie affects their pockets for a long time to come. Fewer people see it more than once, fewer people attend in general, and in the end, fewer people by the dvds, and movie stations will pay less to air the film.<br/><br/>The Alien and Predator movies had always strived to be gritty, horrific, and frightening, while throwing a good balance of action. Some pulled this off better than others, but all did an admirable job at doing so. The movies also tried to be as realistic as a scf-fi movie could attempt to be, and to blend in amazing characters in rich well thought out environments. All of this was lacking in Alien Vs. Predator. Now the argument to save the film, as I have said, is a simple one: Why expect so much? And my answer: Why expect less? One should not lament on what could have been and be satisfied with an insufficient product. One should let themselves be annoyed that the industry increasingly insults our intelligence and their own integrity by expecting us to lower our standards of what a movie could be just so we can enjoy it. Remember this: you are PAYING for the movie. You are the customer. If you go to a restaurant and get a crappy meal do you lower your expectations and go back? No you don't, you don't eat there again is what you do. The longer the industry is intent on satisfying their profit margins rather than their customers the longer the movies they release will be less than quality entertainment and the more their profit margins, will ultimately, be hurt. This plague of lower standards is not just applicable for Alien Vs. Predator, and it is not exclusive to the movie industry. It is spreading across the board from television, to music, to literature, and even to news and media coverage. All of the entertainment and news industry is beginning to bare the stench of lowered expectations and those who cater to it. <br/><br/>It is time to stop having to walk into a movie thinking it will be horrible in order for one to enjoy it. Its time to stop watching bad television because 'it's the only thing on', or to accept inadequate news reporting just because its being reported to you by established news agencies. Don't accept what is being given to you. Take a stand. When you see a movie that was horrible, tell your friends. Turn off your TV or at least change the station when you are given a low quality product. Spread the word. The longer we lower our standards for the industry the longer they give us a product that is meant for only those level of standards."

","A piece of advice: Try to see it with an open mind. <br/><br/>Many of the people who hate this film were planning on hating it well before it was released. Paul Anderson did a good job with this one. He has a very engaging visual style which really shined in Event Horizon, lagged in Resident Evil, but shines again here. The pacing is great, as Anderson understands the value of building up suspense and developing the story before truly unleashing the action. The acting in the beginning of the movie is a little rocky, but quickly improves once the plot gets rolling. In my humble opinion, AVP is quite exceptional, and will grow on audiences over time."
"ramibo007","Null","0","1","17 August 2004"," Why it was bad (a little long, but to the point)
","(Warning, Contains Spoilers) I've read many of the reviews that have been posted. I agreed with the majority of the opinions that were said about the movie, but I always thought I had a simpler way of putting everything in perspective.<br/><br/>ALIENS VS PREDATOR ------------------<br/><br/>So this movie needs to combine the awesome things that made the ALIENS franchise successful, and similarly with the PREDATOR (stay true to the franchises).<br/><br/>After watching the PREDATOR films, you get to love his cloaking, espionage/hiding (sneaking abilities), weapons, guns, strength and violence (the ultimate bad guy). In the start of the movie, everything is going good. You get to see their improved vision system, cloaking, espionage, weapons and everything seems to be building. Then... the director just forgets to keep true to the franchise. The predators are walking, in plain view, from hall to hall. No cloaking, no espionage, just plain ... walking... like a cocky wrestler. Why does the director make the Predators hang the people in the beginning of the movie?? Their not skinned and they didn't collect any skulls for trophies, they just hung them; it just seems pointless. Then when the predator actually gets his gun, he uses it once for about 5-10 seconds, and then never again. Then the Predator teams up with a human girl (i'm not mad that the human was a girl, I'm mad because the predator started tag teaming with the human, then on top of that, this human fought RIGHT ALONG SIDE HIM... it wasn't like she was hiding behind him... which would have made more sense... AND THEN... this human isn't in the army, isn't a big buff strong dude... even the other girl in the movie was more conbat experienced than she was... the other girl would have been a better choice... AND AND AND... did you notice that the human was leading the way when she was walking with the predator. So this became ALIENS VS. THE HUMAN AND THE PREDATOR.<br/><br/>Even the Aliens movies had elements that were not truthfully expressed. When you get your face covered by the ""pre""-alien, does it take a long time before it comes off? Why does it squeeze your neck if it isn't being threated??? Why does it take maybe 10 minutes to come off, and then 15 seconds before the alien comes out of your stomach. Can the Alien really stay frozen for over 100 years?? Where the eggs also frozen in the sacrificial chambers??<br/><br/>When you think of the battle of an alien and a predator... you think... a battle between 2 of the scariest, strongest species ever known to man. When a predator is about to kill you, and then walks away, would you ever say ""don't turn your back on me!""???????? Then... when the alien and predator is fighting... you would think that the predator would first be cloaked. Then... he would have his gun to shoot out. Then... he has his weapons. Then, he has his un-matched strength. Then it comes down to his blades and armor, vs the aliens tail and teeth. How could the director make the first predator die to his first alien encounter. Similarly with the second predator. And then not allow the third predator to honestly win a battle with the alien. Instead he loses to an alien (even while having the help from the girl... who by the way... uses the arnold line: ""you one ugly mother f.."" which completely ruined the movie). And on top of that... has an ALIEN come out of him (and I remember the scene when the ""pre""-alien was supposed to go on the predators face, but... why did it take the predator 10 minutes to be knocked out, then revived from the ""pre""-alien, and then the alien didn't come out of his body until another hour.????<br/><br/>This was a PRO ALIENS movie. It wasn't even close to 50/50. More like 90/10 ... maybe even 100/0.<br/><br/>I think i've said too much... so i guess i'll just leave it at that... everyone understands what I'm trying to say... and so... i'll just leave it at that.<br/><br/>P.S. If there is a part 2, I hope that they change directors, and that the new one watches both ALIENS and PREDATOR movies. Arnold was the biggest guy in Hollywood... the girl in ALIENS was a highly ranked soldier... and both of them wouldn't have led the way with Predator. Once this movie put Predator and the human on the same level, it ruined the whole point of the movie.<br/><br/>Peace Rami."

","Saw this opening night. Loved the original Alien movies, liked the idea of the Predators. Knew we were in trouble when the main female character is introduced answering a cell phone while hanging on Mt. Everest...and no steam comes from her mouth. She's on the side of an ice wall on the highest mountain on earth...and her breath doesn't show up. It was downhill from there. Literally. Set in a buried ancient temple in Antarctica, the filmmakers didn't bother to make the sound stage the thing was filmed on cold enough to see the actors' breath. Doesn't matter how much snow you have, how big your parka is...it's clear that it's NOT really cold. Loses whatever ""realism"" the film has.<br/><br/>It gets worse. I won't spoil it for you, suffice to say the main female character is a LAME EXCUSE for a Ripley ripoff. Her partnership with the remaining Predator (when he fashions a weapon and shield from an Alien skull for her, you will think...""how the hell did she know where to put her hands"") smacks of Beauty and the Beast (I swear that the first time she walks by him, the camera catches him saying ""Damn, baby!"") and all I could think of at the end was ""Tale as old as time...""<br/><br/>Add the fact that the only likable character is killed off too quickly, that the ""heroine"" ends up alone, wearing only a t-shirt and jeans IN Antarctica, the lame camera-work, the bad use of two of sci-fi's best villains, a pathetic ""chariots of the gods"" basis for pyramids,...<br/><br/>I started quoting from MST3K's treatment of EEGAH halfway through the film.

","I have to say off the bat I've never sat down and watched all the Alien or Predator movies all the way through and don't know them inside out like many people do. There's my disclaimer.<br/><br/>Summary: A wealthy business owner finds a heat spot in Antartica and assembles a ""Crack"" team to go check it out and make his mark in history. Once there they find a pyramid built by three ancient civilizations. They are then joined by three predators set to prove themselves against the aliens that are spawned in the pyramid. Yada Yada Yada, whoever wins, we lose....<br/><br/>I will say that this movie could have been a whole lot better had a few things been different (not that any movie would be better with some changes) 1) PG-13 to R: the fights could have been better and shown more graphically 2) Focus less on the humans and lets see what the movie title says.<br/><br/>3) Cut down on some of the cheesiness characterization and portrayal of the scientists<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. But it could have been better. It's tough because it fades away in the likes of Bourne Supremacy, Collateral, I, Robot, The Manchurian Candidate, and some other movies. If this were almost any other summer this movie could be tops. For a fun factor I would say 7 of 10...Don't expect a lot though."
"Darkknight575","1","0","2","16 August 2004"," A Real Shame
","I've been an avid fan of Predator and Alien for a very long time. The comics are wonderfully written and the first two films for each creature were done with respect to those creatures. I was even fortunate enough to read the amazing screenplay for Alien vs Predator by Peter Briggs back in 1991. Unfortunately the new film by hack director Paul W. S. Anderson is not only a bad movie, but an insult to the fans of the series, the intelligence of the general movie going public, and a poor rendition that is a slap in the face to the creators of both creatures. Like Terminator 3, Batman & Robin, Catwoman, and others, the film was made with no other intention than to rob the fans of their money by throwing together a quick and poorly conceived movie. This is evident by three MAJOR things. ONE; the PG-13 rating. This was done to get more people in the seats. Plain and simple. TWO; the producers and the studio purposefully refused to hold a press release for the film to avoid bad reviews by film critics on opening weekend. This was done because of the extremely poor response by test audiences held by the studio. Not to mention they knew how bad there film was. And THIRD; the poorly written screenplay of the film. Paul W. S. Anderson's screenplay has non existent character development, terrible dialog, and the plot which has way too many holes in it. The whole movie seemed rushed. Not to mention the fact that Anderson's other written works are also extremely poor. Let's not even get into directing. The tempo of the film which is entirely too quick, not pausing even for a minute to create any kind of suspense or character, is one of many problems by a very untalented individual. <br/><br/>One nice thing is seeing many people outraged by this so called film. The sad thing is that many fans will see the film. They'll dish out there money to the studio reassuring them that fans will pay to see anything with there favorite characters. (I'm also a victim of this unfortunately by seeing this film). What's worse is that some people are actually defending the film. Reading the comments on this site I've found myself severely disappointed with some of the positive responses. It's a sad day when people argue about a movie they LIKE and try to explain why it's a good movie. What many people don't realize is that just because you like a film doesn't make it a good movie. I like many movies that are bad. I also don't like some films that are good. But too many people are trying to defend Alien vs. Predator because they liked it, they like the creatures, they like the action. But if you remove the creatures and replace them with new ones, I hate to tell you this, but this movie would not be as well received. Some people would have liked it anyway, but that's beside the point. This movie is simply BAD!!!!! <br/><br/>Plain and simple I'm very angry with this film and you should be too. It's not very intelligent. The ending is ridiculous. (SPOILER) Are we to believe that an Alien Predator hybrid is going to survive on a Predator mothership. Give me a break. (END SPOILER!) That's really weak. The plot has too many holes, the dialog is flat, and the action doesn't fit with what we've learned from previous Alien and Predator movies and books. Aliens should not survive being thrown through solid stone. At least not damaged in any way. Also, Predators do not rely solely on their guns. They are well equipped to handle any situation. Besides, what kind of trial would it be if all they had to do was shoot all the Aliens. Pretty sad if you ask me. <br/><br/>Now many people are going to call me an art film snob or something lame or uninspired like that. Well my response to you is get some intelligence. If you like the first Predator and the first two Alien movies, you should expect a certain level of quality from this one. Where's the big battle between these two classic characters? How come there's no evidence of any kind of sacrifice from the supposed 1904 trial? Notice how the only bodies have egyptian or ceremonial clothes in the pyramid. Who was used to be impregnated in the year 1904? Was it the ones wearing those old clothes? That makes no sense. And why would the Predators go to so much trouble to lure people to the pyramid when it would only reveal their existence to the now more technologically advanced human race? If you think the only people who know of this are the ones who died there, you're crazy.<br/><br/>I could go on forever, but I won't. There's so much wrong with this film that was made supposedly by a fan of both series there's simply not enough room. And what a fan he is. It was nice of him to change the look of the Predators and deviate from some of the basic characteristics of both creatures. I said it before, this film is a major insult to everyone. I feel angry, and more than anything, I feel stupider having seen it. Let your voices be heard people. Cry out in disgust and let them know the crime they've committed. For those who hate the film, way to go. For those who argue it's a good film, shame on you. Admit you like it, that's bad enough, but don't try to call an onion an apple. You make yourself look foolish in the process."

","Leave your brain at home, otherwise one will not enjoy this at all. One word sums it up -> Comical.....in 2 ways i) plays like a comicbook ii) acting and script actually unintendedly comical at times and script was very very cheesy.<br/><br/>Remember the 'clip' on the net -> ""Face-off? That's about as best as it gets. The acting was wooden, except perhaps for the main dame, but even she could not get out of a cheesy, clichéd and bad script.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the Alien and Predator series of movies, this one did not strive to engender any feeling for the characters at all, to the point I was just watching one scene after another without being 'carried' or wanting to care what happens to the characters. The only actor to at least have some funny lines (and intended to be so ), was ""out"" already halfway thru the movie.<br/><br/>It was also a bad sign in the preview where you can hear laughter (from quite a few) during some embarrassingly cheesy scenes from about the 1 hr mark onwards into the movie..........I won't say what they are here.<br/><br/>Overall for me, it was 'interesting' given that it's the first A vs P film, but taking a step back, reflecting or even switching on your brain at any time during the movie........this is not a very good film at all. If Ultraman movies had this sort of resources and technology, it could probably have been a better job."
"ukspinner","2","0","1","16 August 2004"," Paul W.S. Anderson - NEVER direct AGAIN!
","Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil - alright, i'll swallow those pills because of the material those films are based on. Those movies feel like video games for a reason, but to take a beloved franchise like Alien and a fanboy favourite in Predator and throw them into this re-hashed, stereotypical and predictable film is something that really upsets me. <br/><br/>I'm now amazed looking back on the Quicktime.com production featurettes that show Anderson, cast and crew fluffing this movie and promising to stay true to what the previous franchises had accomplished. Touting that the claustrophobia and darkness of (especcially) the first two Alien installments would once again grip the audience in AVP is now officially recognized as bullsh*t. Anderson and co. even managed to make the once seemingly invincible Predator come off as second rate by killing two of the hunters off early in the film. Granted, the Predator's game of hunting this time is more challenging than running down clueless humans in a jungle, but c'mon - this is a hunting GAME designed by the Predator race - i didn't expect two of them to be wasted so quickly and easily as they were in AVP.<br/><br/>The human characters were all stereotypes with their actions and mannerisms completely predictable. we've seen the formula COUNTLESS times before - (especcially in B-rate HBO late-night movies.) Again, the lead female, Alexa Wood, slashes through the Aliens and runs side by side with the Predator like its a days work. She slays multiple Aliens and contributes to the death of the Queen - something every other human in the Alien franchise had a weeee bit of trouble with. <br/><br/>Anderson made a by-the-book expensive sci-fi video game flick better suited on the rental shelf next to Starship Troopers 2. Go ahead and play through the quicktime featurettes and listen to the director spew self-gratifying trash out of his mouth. I surely hope this marks the end of both franchises - at least for a long long time until someone worthy can resurrect either or mantle."

","First of all I PAID to see this movie which was my first mistake. I went in with low expectations since it was rated PG-13. Unfortunately my expectations weren't low enough. This movie was horrible. The title was misleading as there wasn't much of a battle at all between Alien and Predator. It seemed mostly to focus on a bunch of lackluster characters running around in a maze spouting off cheesy one liners. If the movies point was to disappoint Alien and Predator fans, then they succeeded. Predator resembled a Power Ranger enemy (Lord Zed) and the queen Alien was overgrown and awkward looking. The Predator space ship so resembled something out of Star Wars that I was actually waiting for Darth Vader to pop out and claim that he was their father. I won't even comment on what the Aliens babies reminded me of. Even with that, the worst part was the ""friendship"" that formed between Predator and the female lead. It was cheesy and boring. My recommendation is if you really want to see this movie, wait for it to come out on video. That way you have the option of turning it off without feeling like you wasted your money."

And the best of all, a heroine that runs around killing aliens with a makeshift spear and shield made out of alien body parts. And somehow she never gets burned while she's skewering these things like lamb kabobs and they're flailing about spewing acid everywhere. Apparently if the Colonial Space Marines in Aliens had ditched their weapons and explosives and done the spear and shield thing they would have kicked a lot more ass. People in my theater were actually laughing out loud, rolling their eyes and yelling, ""gimme a break"", at the screen during most scenes. <br/><br/>Why the producers couldn't have just used the excellent story from the original Dark Horse comic, ""Alien vs. Predator"", I have no idea.

"axlroseisgod","1","0","2","15 August 2004"," Silly Vs. Disappointing
","Like most people who took the time to see this film, I am a fan of the 2 Predator movies and the first two Alien movies. They were all solid sci-fi action movies that entertained and sometimes scared. This project has the potential to be great. Sadly, it wasn't.<br/><br/>Last year's Freddy VS. Jason was a match-up movie that got it right: it stayed true to the mythology of both movies, found a solid reason for the battle, and offered up some great fight scenes. AVP does none of this. Writer/Director Paul W.S. Anderson plays dice with both franchises, changing everything from the Predator's signature infra-red vision to the incubation time of the Aliens. AVP's biggest weakness is the cast. The Predator movies had big name stars (Arnold Schwarzengger, Danny Glover) to carry them, while the Alien movies had great casts who made the experience seem shockingly real. AVP has a cast of no names led by Lance Henriksen. Lance is a good actor, and it's good to see him in the franchise, but even he can't save the film.<br/><br/>I expected much, much better from Paul Anderson. His directorial debut, Shopping, was a great movie and he has proven over the years that he can make both decent horror movies (Event Horizon, Resident Evil) and satisfying action movies (Soldier, Mortal Kombat). This movie is somewhere between action and horror, and neither one is done right. The scary moments aren't that scary and the action moments aren't that great. Don't even get me started on the ending. Anderson's direction isn't technically bad, but his writing is atrocious. If Anderson had been forced to collaborate with people who were more knowledgeable about both franchises, it would have been a much better movie. It isn't fair to place all of the blame on Anderson, however. Anderson does much better when he's allowed to make an R rated movie, but greedy Fox executives demanded a PG-13 film because more people can legally buy tickets to it. The irony of this: If these 13 year-olds haven't seen the R rated films that the franchise is based on, why would they see AVP? This film needed to be R. New Line understood that when they made FVJ. You can't make a violent film without violence.<br/><br/>AVP won't entertain fans of either franchise, because it contradicts established lore in both of them. Casual viewers will bored as well, by the bad acting, bad dialogue, and the silly ending (which I won't give away).<br/><br/>Final rating: 0 stars out of 5.<br/><br/>This is a major disappointment."
"alastormaster86","4","0","1","15 August 2004"," This movie wasn't as bad as people are complaining about, but it definitely could've been better.
","I saw this movie and I was so nervous walking into the theaters because of all the bad vibe and comments that critics and audiences are saying. When the movie ended, I thought the movie wasn't that bad. Some explanation:<br/><br/>First of all you need to read and like the original AVP comics that came out about 14 years ago because they explain very well on explaining the culture of the predators. These guys are shown as very noble and honorable creatures, despite the fact that they can do horrible things to humans, but that's only if they get in the way or if they're worthy of hunting. So if you're a fan of the comics, chances are that you may like this movie. So in short, this movie is a lot more influenced on the comics rather than the movies. The lead actress was way more influenced by a certain character in the first 4 issues of the AVP comics, and less on Ripley. I just can't believe so many people have missed out over these 14 years.<br/><br/>The only things I really didn't like in the movie was that a lot of character development material from the AVP movie novel were not shown in the movie. I don't know why. And also, some of the acting and dialogue were a little cheesy at times but bearable. And I'll admit that the predator's face didn't look as cool as the one in the first Predator movie. And as a true fan, they should've added some more human blood and gore in the movie. The book was pretty gory.<br/><br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>I remember hearing complaints that it's a really dumb idea for having Lex team up with the predator. Well that's because the she saved the Predator's life by giving him the shoulder cannon to blast the Aliens crawling on the walls. And there were more complaints on the part when the predator marked her as respect. Well it wouldn't look good for an honorable creature to kill the person who helped kill the queen. Again, this movie was hugely influenced on the comics."

","If you've seen the originals (Aliens and Predator), then by comparison this is pure unadulterated crap. By paying to see this movie, you encourage Hollywood to keep churning out watered down, second rate, crap. No Aliens vs. Predators movie should have a rating less than R, nor should it be as undeveloped as this one. Like so many movies today, Aliens vs. Predators is just going through the motions, without adding anything note worthy or remarkable to the industry. I understand Samuel Taylor Cooleridge's willing suspension of disbelief, but this movie is just unbelievable. One line in the movie says, ""ah, it's starting to make sense..."" but I assure you, the movie never develops linearly enough for the situation to make sense to any of the characters. The movie is just over 1 and a half hours--no time for proper development, unless the script is air tight (this one is assuredly not). Perhaps I am being overly negative, and dismissing an important demographic audience...if you are 13 years of age, or younger (or have a 13 year old mentality), by all means see this film.

"Jeyl","1","0","3","15 August 2004"," The easily bamboozled Predators
","Spoiler alert<br/><br/>Lets see. We have three predators, six aliens, and about forty or so humans. The result? Only ONE human survivor. I guess the Tag line ""Who ever wins, we loose"" Gave away a little too much, because neither the Aliens or the Predators win. Since I don't want to spend too much time talking about how much I despise this film, I'm going to go over some fun FACTS about the Alien and Predator franchises that were either changed, or completely ignored in this movie.<br/><br/>1. Aliens life cycle. It took probably two to three days for the Alien in the first film to develop into a mature Alien after Kane got face hugged. Here, it takes about five minutes. That's like having a new born baby grow up to be a thirty year old man in about thirty minutes. James Cameron ran into this situation when he was editing Aliens. There was a scene with Ripley finding Burke cacooned and him begging Ripley to kill him. Cameron cut that out because the timing compared to the first film was wrong. Paul W.S. Anderson however, puts a lot of those scenes in.<br/><br/>2. Predators. Probably the biggest complaint I have. The Predators in this film have been down graded to dumb, unintelligent, overly bulky, easily surprised, mass-murdering hooligans. They don't kill humans for hunting purposes anymore. They kill humans just for the sake of killing them. If a predator sees a human who is obviously not a threat, is seriously injured, unarmed, and is literally standing still, the predator kills him. Why is that? There was no sport in that. That's like seeing a deer hunter spotting a deer sleeping, killing it, and leaving it's body. Nobody would do that. And don't get me started on the whole mythology thing. Having Predators come to earth thousands of years ago, and teaching us all that we know today really ruins their dangerous nature. Just seeing Predators exposing themselves to human society just makes them look dumb. The Predators I know wouldn't reveal themselves to the creatures they were hunting like that. Oh, Did I mention that the predators in this movie are easily to kill, fool, and surprise?<br/><br/>3. Aliens. Again on the Mythology. We're supposed to believe that Aliens have been on Earth for as long as humans have existed. That ruins everything. I've always believed from the movies I've watched that if one Alien got on earth, it's over. One Alien. Yet we see thousands of Aliens attacking predators on Earth in a flashback. Great. Now the Alien is not as mysterious in the way we liked it. Now we don't have to worry about Aliens being a threat on earth anymore. I guess the infested human Colony from ALIENS is just unrealistic now. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE SET THIS MOVIE ON EARTH! <br/><br/>4. The characters. Every human, Predator, and Alien in this story suffers from the Ensign Red Shirt of death curse. Any human that comes into contact with our main character Lex, dies. And heres the kicker, every character in the whole movie is a lot more interesting and likable then Lex is. The movie tries to have some development with the other characters like having them say that they have kids they want to get back to, but 2 minutes later, they get killed off. Oh, well. I think we're supposed to be happy with just Lex. Heres what makes her character funny. She's supposed to keep everyone in her team alive, yet by the end of the movie, she's the only THING that survived. I'm betting that will look great on her job resume. <br/><br/>This, to me, is just another Alien movie where the director wants to make it his own thing regardless of what's been established. Of all the things I hated about this movie, there is still one thing that pains me the most. What are new comers gonna think of the Alien movies after they watch AVP first? Boring is what they're gonna think. This movie established that the aliens are these fast, ninja like killing machines. I guess when they want to see the same thing in ALIEN, they'll end up disappointed, which is sad. <br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson, Congratulations. You've killed two birds with one stone. That's a hard thing to do."

","I'm an advocate of doing things right. If you're going to half ass it then just don't do it at all. And Fox really just half-assed this movie. Starting with hiring one of the worst directors out there, some no talented actors and actresses, and not giving a damn about two decent franchises.<br/><br/>I mean this isn't Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th here. Those franchises were garbage and New Line knew it so it was easy for that studio to keep the low standard by getting a hack director and crappy actors. The Aliens and Predator franchises actually were decent and had some respect so I have no idea why Fox treated them like they were on the Jason/Freddy level.<br/><br/>AvP failed on every damn level and that's hard to do with a typical summer popcorn movie. I honestly could have lived with the sub-par acting, story and dialogue if the action had lived up to the billing. But somehow the movie even managed to f**k that up. What the hell is up with all the close-ups, crappy editing and shaky camera work? You can barely make out what's going on half the time that I honestly stopped caring. Does ANYONE know how to edit a simple action scene anymore? First Bourne Supremacy, now this s**t. <br/><br/>And the Predators themselves are so freakin slow and not at all Predator-like. They can't fight at all in this movie and the Aliens own their asses. Yeah they're supposed to be young Predators (a lame cop-out to make them half-assed) but aren't these creatures supposed to be bred as stealthy, intelligent, killing machines? Since when are they all fat and pudgy lumbering around like Robocop? They actually get out-classed by a human woman. And don't get me started on the human/Predator team-up. Did they forget Predators make trophies of the humans? I (and a lot of the audience) sneered at the screen when they were running together in slo-mo. It was the single-most dumbest thing they could have done to The Predator mythos and took my feeling of dislike to downright hatred of this flick. I could type a novel of things wrong with this movie so I'll just stop here.<br/><br/>No matter how many lame references of the Alien franchise they try to throw in there to please the fans (Lance Henriksen comes to mind) the execution of this movie was straight up garbage. It appeals to 10-15 year olds and that's probably why they lowered the rating. So here's a middle finger to Fox for taking what could have been a jumpstart for both franchises to just another cheap piece of s**t movie made for a quick buck."
"Thirtysilver","Null","0","1","15 August 2004"," What Did You Expect From Paul Anderson?
","Motivated by competitive greed, a pioneer in robotics (Henriksen) assembles experts for an archaeological expedition in Antarctica. As the scientist had hoped, his team is the first to arrive. But the next team has come from outer space to kick ass, take names, and awaken the egg-producing Xenomorph queen. Violence ensues.<br/><br/>If you've been looking forward to this film in the hopes that it will be a major cinematic triumph, don't bother going to see it. Rent Alien and Predator and enjoy yourself at home. This movie is sleek, dark, and only distantly related to the films which spawned the titular characters. The problem here is that the man behind this film, unlike Ridley Scott, is a Brit who does not understand the unique American mindset behind these horror franchises. He seems to want to create something sterile, isolated, and claustrophobic. All of the carnal grit of the Predator films is gone, and all of the swarming, insectile menace of the Aliens has been boiled down to simple brooding and growling. What fights there are between the monsters are badly shot and badly lit. You can't tell who's hitting whom, who's growling, who's brooding; it's as if you're watching the fight while bouncing on a pogo stick and having a grand mal seizure. Anderson wants the creatures to be scary simply because they are on the screen. It doesn't work. There's nothing scary about this movie. The Predators are shot like big, lumbering brutes, while the Xenomorphs just look like robots. There really is some bad marionetting in this film. The dialog consists of vague declarative phrases: ""Get out,"" ""Run,"" ""No, don't."" There's not much for the characters to talk about in this film anyway; everything and everyone is set-dressing. The characters are vacuous and stupid. Even Lance, with his tiny part as a feeble old man, can't save the tepid script or galvanize the rest of the cast. The plot is rushed, its few key points barely trifled over. The movie ends with a nice little twist, but the audience is still left with questions like: How is she going to get out of Antarctica? And: Really? That's it? That said, I did enjoy this film. Yes I did. I didn't go in expecting an intellectual masterpiece. I wasn't hoping for scintillating dialog. I just wanted to see asses kicked and names taken. If you can lower your expectations to, say, Jurassic Park 3 level, you will find the grain of entertainment this film can provide. AVP gets 2 1/2 out of 5."
"tyler_durden1317","3","0","2","15 August 2004"," Whoever Wins, We (the audience) Lose
","I like so many others walking into this movie hoping beyond hope that the PG-13 rating wouldn't have an effect on this film. However, once again I was let down by money grubbing executives. Was this an extremely bad movie...no, was it a good movie, not by any means. I wasn't looking for a good plot or an epic movie out of this, just what was promised by the tagline. I don't want to ruin it, but by the end, the movie has us on one of the creatures sides and if ""it"" wins, humans win. On top of that, I couldn't tell if this movie was supposed to be a sci-fi/horror/adventure or a feel good love story. People who have seen it know what I'm talking about, yes that incredibly cheesy scene between the female lead character and one of the Predators.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating did take away that certain something to this movie. The other films had a dark, scary, hopeless feel to them, this one did not. It did a good job of trying to fit in as much gore as it could given the restrictions it was under. But watching deaths through Predator vision and splatters of blood in the snow doesn't contribute to the mood as much as seeing just a little more of the deaths would have. Expect a lot of quick cuts and poor editing as well.<br/><br/>Like other people have said as well, they do not establish any of the characters real well. You have no connection to hardly any of them. To be honest, the only person I really wanted to survive this was Ewen Bremner and that's only because I think he's cool. But then again this movie isn't supposed to be about the humans, but in all actuality...it really is.<br/><br/>If you absolutely must see this film, then do so. If you can wait until they HOPEFULLY will release an unrated directors cut on DVD, please do. The PG-13 rating and no advanced preview screenings was a direct attempt to take as much money as they could in the opening weekend to cover the cost of this disappointing film. I do not blame Anderson for all of its faults, I put most of the blame right on the studio heads of Fox for this."
"atomicmystieboy","1","0","2","14 August 2004"," Horrible, horrible dreck
","Paul Anderson, what are you thinking? This director capably handled the excellent, niche-market sci-fi horror movie _Event Horizon_. He's apparently forgotten everything he learned making that film.<br/><br/>_Alien vs. Predator_ is the coolest stuff out of both series' movies combined into one short film and ruined. You've got Bishop and the facehuggers from the second and third _Aliens_, the weapons and nuke from _Predator_, and the following from the _AVP_ computer game and comic series.<br/><br/>However, it's ruined.<br/><br/>The acting is poor, the events are cliché, the development is non-existent, the startling moments are cheap, the movie connections are ruined.<br/><br/>For example, face huggers now implant a chest-burster in mere minutes, and less than an hour later you're up and about for a whole thirty seconds before the chest burster comes out. I seem to recall Kane lying in a coma for a couple of days, before waking up and being ravenously hungry, all before his little present was exposed.<br/><br/>Also, aren't the Predators somewhat capable fighters? The aliens may be quick, but in no circumstance should they be able to rip up on the Predators like they do in this film. The Predators seem to be no better at fighting aliens than the ice-climate expert who seemingly becomes a Predator's apprentice.<br/><br/>That brings up another point--Predator/human bonding? Ha! It seems like Anderson thinks anyone, even if they're a different life form, can get along, so long as they demonstrate some form of good will (enacted with the prisoner/guard's guns analogy).<br/><br/>This movie is a farce of and a disgrace to some of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Put simply, you should watch the first three _Alien_ and the two _Predator_ movies, play the video game, and call it a day. You'll get a better experience than this tripe direct by Anderson, who apparently didn't follow those necessary steps.<br/><br/>0 stars out of 5"
"dudeman5685","Null","0","1","14 August 2004"," Heavily influenced by H.P. Lovecraft
","The more I watched this movie, the more I realized that the screenwriters must have be familiar with Lovecraft's novel ""At the Mountains of Madness"" in which an expedition to Antartica finds a million year old temple in which primitive humans worshiped aliens as gods. The flashback to primitive Earth, the pictoglyphs detailing the ""Cthulu"" even the lay out of the temple reminds me of the one described in ""Lost City"" <br/><br/>I'm not complaining. I was surprised, even delighted, to see Lovecraftian themes in a big budget picture for once. Some may not like the fact that it had to show up in the Aliens/Predator franchise, but Lovecrafts name doesn't have very much box office draw. (They made a Mountains of Madness film in '95. No one cared.) <br/><br/>Other than that there is little I can say. (SPOILER) Towards the end the only survivor, a female, makes a kind of pact with the Predators. This might seem odd, but when you think about it, that is the most rational conclusion: the Predators are smarter than the Aliens, have the ability to reason, while the Aliens are more like insects, they do what their natural instincts and hive mentality tell them. After all it is the Predators that have weapons, build ships, wear clothes... Furthermore if the Predators win, what happens? A dozen or so people get knocked off every hundred years. If the Aliens win we have a global holocaust. The ending may seem a little corny, kinda Anne Rice but for Predators instead of vampires, but its really the only plausible way a human could survive this situation. (END SPOILER)<br/><br/>This is a good movie if you take it for what it is. Great visuals and FX, a few explosions, action and suspense. But they should really recognize Lovecrafts influence."
"missionpossible","Null","0","1","14 August 2004"," Much anticipated movie exceeds expectations (moderate spoilers)
","I come into every movie I watch with a contextual bias. For instance, I always expect action movies to have bad dialogue and plot, but great special effects. Comic book movies are probably down there with action movies as well, although some have recently done very well in breaking the stereotype with such comic book films as the X-Men and Spider-Man films. However, I wasn't expecting much from this movie simply because it was a comic book VERSUS movie, which really hasn't been done much, if at all. I also came in with a strong knowledge of the Predators, having own most of the Predator comics and both the movies. I don't care much for the Aliens, but I have seen all four movies. I also own most of the Alien vs Predator comic books and I own all of the Alien vs Predator computer games. So, as you can tell, I've been waiting for this movie for quite some time. So, on with the review... The plot I knew already from the trailers and looking online, but I enjoyed how they brought the Predators, Aliens, and Humans together. <br/><br/>In the comic books, the Predators seed a planet (Ryushi) with Aliens and hunt them that way and then the Humans just wind up getting involved via distress calls and whatnot. In the second game, it was a little more interesting having it take place on a planet (LV-1201) where the Aliens already exist and Predators regularly hunt the Aliens there and the Humans come later to exploit the Aliens however possible. The movie has the Predators involved in an ancient Human civilization on Earth (for a change) where they have a massive temple in which Predator warriors train with Aliens, this continues to the present day where a group of Humans get caught in the middle. The major difference of the movie's plot to the comics and games are that Colonial Marines are no longer representing the Humans. And I have to say that is a relief because I HATE the Colonial Marines, they're loud mouthed show offs that just got in the way of the point of the story - to see the Aliens and Predators duke it out. And by eliminating the Marines, the movie has the non-military Humans treated as easy prey for the Predators and gestation material for the Aliens which sets the battlefield for the stars of the movie. <br/><br/>The special effects were done very well, especially considering that CGI was used sparingly - merely a supplement to the massive amount of model and costume work used (or so ""The Making of AVP"" claims). There was unfortunately only one real fight shown between one predator and one alien. It was well done, but some of the camera work was too jumpy to really see the action and it was done with a predator that appeared too bulky, making running and standing up a bit laughable. The alien shots were done much better due in part to a simpler design compared to predators and the fact that most of the shots were probably done with models and CGI. The acting was good, especially for a comic book versus movie. There were little, if any, cheesy one-liners. One of the one-liners was even a tribute to an unfinished one-liner in Predator. As far as the look of the Predators, I liked all of the masks except for one which had some flashy features where the mouth is and that just made it ugly. A new Smart Disk was introduced and the double blade wrist gauntlet also seemed to be modified for Alien combat by having an extended length. The plasma caster, net gun, spear, and self-destruct console also graced the screen. I also don't think that the Predators died too quickly, like many believe. In fact, only one died too quickly and that was only because he was caught off guard while cloaked - so it was to be expected. The other death wasn't quick at all - it was after a long one-on-one fight scene which showed how tough the Alien was in the fight. <br/><br/>The lack of plasma caster use has been complained about which is ridiculous. If you've ever played the game you know that plasma casters vs aliens are unfairly tipped in the favor of the predators and that is just a dishonorable kill in the eyes of a predator. So, the sparing use of it in the movie was perfect and the one-time use of it was excellent because it was used in combat against several aliens at once in a situation that was quite dire. Alien fans would be a little unnerved with the relatively short gestation time for the chestbursters and the speedy creation of a mini alien hive - although it was done slightly within reason. The presence of the Alien Queen was very instrumental and led to an awesome battlescene on open terrain. The only other time an Alien Queen was battled was between Lt. Ripley in a loader in a cramped cargo bay.<br/><br/>The PG-13 rating has been argued by many people, but after seeing the movie there really weren't many scenes that could've been more graphic to make it rated R. And anything gorier would've made it resemble the first movie, Alien, which was not what this movie was going for. The running time of about 100 min is to be expected because Paul Anderson's films are always around this time it is standard for the genre.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to say it was an excellent film because it followed through very nicely with the comic books and games. And for one of the first comic book versus movies it destroyed the subversive stereotypes that exist in that genre. It'll probably never be hailed as a classic because of all the close-minded individuals out there, but for those that are die hard fans of Predators and Alien vs Predator, they'd probably enjoy this movie thoroughly. Rating: 9.5/10"
"oshram-3","7","0","1","14 August 2004"," A pretty good blending of two similar franchises
","It was an old idea, marrying two franchises that aren't producing and trying to stir up some life in them. Granted, it had been done before; Predators have been fighting Aliens for more than ten years in the comics. But this pairing made a lot of sense; both franchises started as semi-horror films (Predator, despite a grotesque amount of machismo, is essentially a horror film at its core) and graduated on to a sequel that was far more action than horror. So both franchises were a blend of the two elements, and since both dealt with creepy xenomorphs that treat us as prey, it only made sense to shove them together.<br/><br/>AVP spends a fair amount of its abbreviated run time  87 minutes, including the credits  trying to prove its geek cred. There are numerous references dropped to Aliens, in particular (still a fan fetish fave) and they go through a fair amount of effort to show respect and knowledge of the movies that made this one possible. And then, wisely, they shuck all that out the window and just give us, essentially, a good old-fashioned shoot 'em up.<br/><br/>Stuck in more for continuity's sake than anything else is Lance Henriksen, playing Charles Bishop Weyland (are you really trying to insinuate they would build an android three hundred years later that looked like the founder of the company? Come on), who serves as the plot motivator for this whole little shindig. The film follows a fairly standard formula; establish suitable creepiness in an unusual place, give us just enough character to make us care about at least a few of the people, and then drop them in a pit full of creepy crawlies and see who makes it out.<br/><br/>What differentiates this film from the zillion others like it (The Thing, Ghosts of Mars, etc.) is that we sci-fi geeks have an avid interest in the two warring sides because we've sat through the twelve or so hours of prequels (more if you've seen them all on DVD) that set up this film. In a way, for sci-fi geeks, this is like that old comic book where the Hulk finally fights Superman and you get to see who's stronger. And therein lies the whole thrill. <br/><br/>The writers do give us a smidgen of people to care about; chief among them are Sebastian (Raoul Bova) and Alexa (smartly played by Sanaa Lathan), whom we follow through most of the film; there are other characters, some even played by people you would recognize (one of the lesser hoods from Snatch; and one of my favorite not-yet discovered actors, Colin Salmon), but you've seen enough of these movies to know who's going to make it to the final reel and who's not by the time you're fifteen minutes into the story.<br/><br/>Where AVP succeeds is in the way it spools itself out. There's a lot of time devoted to building tension, but it pays off nicely, even if it ignores all previously established continuity (and I say, go ahead. It's not like you're adapting the works of, say, J.R.R. Tolkien and you need to be precise or anything); all of the time exploring the creepy alien pyramid is well done (it's in the trailer, I'm spoiling nothing), and when the A's finally do get it on with the P's, the action is delivered in short, sharp bursts, the way it should be; no lengthy CGI battles, no utterly unbelievable sixty-foot jumps, just a couple of ugly butts slamming each other around.<br/><br/>They do follow some of the conventions of both movies, but not slavishly, and I found that a nice homage. One thing I have always liked about the Alien films is their strong female heroine (even if it is always Ripley, or a derivation), and I was pleased to see that continue here; Alexa is cool, confident, capable, but very human.<br/><br/>The movie speeds along at a decent pace, and is overall enjoyable as a summer flick and a sci-fi action yarn until the hideously predictable ending. You sort of know where it's going the second you see the Queen alien (may God damn James Cameron for that retarded 'innovation' to the Alien race), and you can see the ending choreographed a mile away. Which is a shame, because other than that, AVP is a pretty good film that achieves both its goals; one, to be digestible summer action fare, and two, to blend two similar film franchises into one, yet be respectful and dedicated to the conventions of both of them. Anyone who has read  or written  crossover fanfic knows this is not always easy to do, and the AVP folk succeeded marvelously on that score.<br/><br/>Is it worth going to see? Depends on how much you like horror/action bug hunts. Of this type of film, this is a pretty good one. There are better ways to spend your $7 at the cineplex as summer is winding down, but there are far worse ones as well."

"thefranchise_86","Null","0","1","13 August 2004"," Whoever Watches this Movie... Loses...
","First, I will post a review without spoilers for those interested in the movie without wishing to know the details of the story (or lack thereof). I am an avid fan of both the Predator and Alien movie franchises, possibly with the exception of Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>Paul W.S. Anderson, in my personal opinion, has been unsuccessful to recreate movies that have spawned from video games, namely Resident Evil and now AVP. AVP, while at first having a half way decent storyline and popular sci-fi horror characters, had a lot of potential to be a good movie. Instead, the movie is filled with numerous plot holes which remained unanswered; the more you think about the movie and the back-story, the more you realize that the concept of the movie is absolutely absurd. The basic idea associated with the reasons for the Aliens and Predators being on Earth in the first place is sound, but the back-story defies logic. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes Swiss cheese, with numerous holes in it that detract from the otherwise original concept. The special effects are not even enough to salvage the movie, and they were top of the line. Anderson relied too much on creating an action packed movie like he did with Resident Evil at the expense of the more graphic images associated with both Resident Evil, Alien, and Predator, as well as the important element of horror. Even as an avid fan of both movie series, neither character was enough save me from wanting my money back.<br/><br/>I advise you to not waste the money and instead invest in something remotely entertaining. The section of my review below contains SPOILERS, so DO NOT READ IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>First off, the plot development was horrible. The fact that 3 separate cultures, the Aztecs, Cambodians, and Egyptians, all coexisting in Antarctica prior to the first pyramids in any culture being created makes no sense. Apparently, the Predators were Gods worshiped by the people with the people serving as hosts to the Aliens to spawn a hunting game for the Predators; thus, a Right of Passage for the new coming generation was its purpose. Every 100 years, a captive Alien Queen is revived (no explanation as to where the Predators obtained a queen from or even how they managed to enslave it considering that Alien drones killed 2 predators with relative ease in the early portion of the movie) with the use of some sort of energy source like plugging a cord into an electrical socket (again, no mention as to where or how such a power source could work). By reviving the queen, she would spawn eggs which would lead to the sacrificial chamber to spawn Alien drones. OK, I do not see anything major wrong at this point, but the plot quickly deteriorates. Upon entrance to the temple, the human expedition team sets the whole situation into motion when they remove 3 predator shoulder cannons from within the temple much like a booby trap. Presumably, the predators were to have gotten the cannons to hunt their prey. Here is a hole, for if the predator survived, how would shoulder cannons miraculously find their way back into the temple every 100 years? It is not like the predator could just waltz back into the temple and return the cannon as the temple would be infested with aliens.<br/><br/>The main character, Alexa, quickly becomes the only remaining human survivor, and she ""befriends"" the remaining predator after his two counterparts are slain easily by aliens. She becomes an Ellen Ripley ""Rip-Off"" as she is portrayed to be a badass who uses a dead alien's body parts as weapons. In the climax of the movie, she takes on the Queen with the predator and does more damage than Ripley in a mechanized suit could do.<br/><br/>I am sorry, but this was ridiculous; a climber of mountains and trail guide turning into a full-blown Alien Queen ass-kicker is like saying she was tougher than Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny Glover, all of the marines from the movies, the predators, and even Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>Not to say I enjoy gore, but the cutting of scenes just prior to deaths of some humans left a lot to the imagination. It became vague as one could not understand how the victim was slain due to the skipping around of the camera. More human gore, not a lot, would have helped contribute to the overall effect of the movie instead of leaving the aliens and predators to duke it out.<br/><br/>I am sure there is much more wrong with the flick, for you do not even need to think about it to realize how poorly put together the movie was. Anderson is a poor director who should not partake in the movie industry, even if he was just a coffee errand boy. He cannot properly assemble a good story, and even when it is done, the plot holes and flaws in the layout (as well as relying on special effects to make a movie) do not form a good end product. I seriously hope he does not consider making more movies in the future, because his past attempts have only succeeded in elevating my blood pressure and pulse, not due to an action packed thrill ride, but simply out of aggravation. A better ending would have been having Anderson sitting with a sack full of money pointing at the audience and laughing for supporting this piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, and please take my advice to heart; do not let yourself fall victim to its empty promises. A better tagline would have been: ""Whoever sees this movie... Loses..."" And you know what, it would be accurate."
"frw823","1","0","2","14 August 2004"," It's simple PG-13 sellout movie instead of hardcore R movie
","This movie sucks. And yes, the main reason that it sucks is the PG-13 rating. All of the Alien movies are rated R and so are both of the Predator movies; and they still made a sh#tload of money, especially the Alien series. This has to be one of the biggest cinematic sellouts of all time. It's just so sad that the studios are only interested in making the MOST money that they possibly can, and are willing to compromise any aspect of any movie to achieve that very goal. If AVP was rated R, it still would make millions of dollars, but the studio just couldn't resist making the extra bucks that come from a PG-13 movie. It's just too bad that what could have been such a great movie turned into a big corporate piece of sh@t."

I STRESS BAD I was laughing so bad my stomach hurt. This movie would seem cool to someone who has never seen any predator or alien movies. Since I've seen all of them... the movie is a complete joke! Visual effects are very nice. Nice battle scenes but the movie portrays the predators as baffoons....if you see it you will know what I mean...compared to predator 1&2. Aliens look and move good...queen is awesome! Acting is horrible... end of story. I think the biggest flaw to this movie and biggest mistake was giving Paul W.S. Anderson total control. He single handedly destroyed both franchises. There are literally no moments of suspense before someone dies and I felt no sympathy for any of the characters...the movie would of been better if all the humans died and there was an hour of fighting between predators and aliens! This movie is the BIGGEST disappointment I have ever experienced in theaters! FOX GET GOOD DIRECTORS TO DIRECT BIG MOVIES!"

","Wow. I have been a die hard fan of the Predator and Alien franchise since the mid 80s. Well, I just died. This is one of the most pathetic attempts at cinema since ""House of the Dead"". The dialogue is terrible, the fights(both of them) are like a WWE match, and what's worse--they take everything established in the original movies and toss it right out the window. <br/><br/>One thing I will give this movie is the Aliens look better than ever. However, on the other hand the Predators look worse than ever. The Predator suits in this movie are something I would expect to see at a theme park. This movie is just depressing to any fan of the series. This one doesn't even stack up to last summer's ""Freddy VS Jason""--a far superior film in every aspect.

","Let me break this movie down honestly. I'm NOT one of those stupid critics who are all into those overly dramatic movies. And I'm not also one of those critical geeky fans. I'm just a guy who likes movies for ""guys who like movies"". I'm a big fan of the Predator and Alien franchises (especially Aliens and Predator part 1).<br/><br/>This movie is obviously going to expect comparison to the other alien and predator movies. With that said, Alien Vs. Predator is an ""alright"" movie, but they could have done soo much more. I thought the storyline was awesome and creative, and the 'Weyland' connection to the Aliens movies was a nice touch, but there just seemed to be something missing. I prefer the main character/hero in an action movie like Alien Vs. Predator to be a guy because lets face it, who can take more of a punch from an enormous creature like an Alien or Predator, a man or a woman?, Arnold or Sigorny? Paul WS Anderson has a habit of making a chick the main character(Ex:Resident Evil 1 & 2). But he is a good storyteller and knows good scenery.<br/><br/>But like i said, the movie was pretty good/ 'alright', but the filmmakers could have done soo much more. I realize the humans werent trained commandos, but rather (most of them were)scientists, but i thought they could have made more of an impact because they had the right guns and equipment. And if you haven't seen the movie yet,***minor spoilers*** don't expect the predators to be a hugee unstoppable force because they were in a small, closed area without their laser cannons (for most of the movie) and werent in a massive jungle where they could easily hunt their prey. They were going head to head, a little hand to hand combat with the aliens. And i thought they put up a pretty decent fight. They also shouldn't have killed off Colin Salmon character (he was the team commander from Resident Evil) so easily. He seemed like a trained soldier. <br/><br/>I was kind of hoping they would have Arnold make a cameo or at least mention his character name and how he survived the Predator years earlier. But i liked how Paul Anderson stayed loyal to the Alien movies. In Alien part 1, the Weyland Company set Ripley's crew on the alien planet for a reason. The company knew all about the aliens and what they could do. Now, we know how they knew. But it could have been a little better. I missed the commando team aspect and thought the filmmakers could have done more with it. It's too bad they chose to go the PG-13 route instead of R (considering all of the other Alien and Predator movies were R). Can't wait for that Unrated/R Rated Alien Vs. Predator DVD."

","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>I saw this last night at midnight. I've only seen Aliens and the first Predator. My buddies wanted to go, and I figured ""it looks lame, but OK"". I went in expecting it to be a cheesy scifi/horror/action movie, and for the first half of the movie, it met my expectations. Cool special effects, decent action scenes, and then, about halfway through or so, it changed.<br/><br/>I'd been giggling at some of the absurdities throughout, mostly to myself, but when the Predator gives Alexa (was that her name? I don't remember) the Alien head as a shield and his tail on a stick as a spear, i started laughing out loud. And I wasn't alone. However, the funniest scene was next as the ""slow motion running"" scene with the Predator and Alexa running in silhouette. Somehow, it became a buddy movie. And wtf was with the ending, with the head Predator giving her the spear thing? She's still stranded in Antarctica, jackass, how 'bout giving her a lift back to civilization?<br/><br/>Anyways, seriously, the movie just became laughable, almost a parody of the earlier movies. It was just silly. Like I said, I thought the action sequences were alright, nothing special. I did like the move the Predator made on the Mother Alien at the end though.<br/><br/>One thing that should have been a warning, look at the stars. I'm not saying you need stars to make a good movie, but that's basically the name of the game in summer blockbusters. No Sigourney, Arnold, Glover, Rider, Hurt, Holm, not even a Paul Reiser. When the biggest stars you have is Spud from Trainspotting and Cicero from Gladiator, then you're hurting.

I saw this movie and i did not find one single part confusing, if you had payed attention in the other predator movies it would make a lot more sense. Predators live by honor, the reason he didn't just snap Arnold's neck in the first movie is because he see's that he is a formidable opponent and wanted to face him in a hand to hand combat. When Danny Glover kills the predator in the second film the rest of them gather around him but let him live, and the leader gives him a trophy...it's all HONOR. That's why Alexa teams up with the predator in this movie, she kills an alien, and gives the predator his shoulder cannon. The movie also blatantly explains why the aliens and predators are in the temple...The Predators built the temple and used humans to breed the aliens, so that way the predators could hunt the aliens and gain their honor. Also Alexa teaming up with the predator is from the comic books which is where the idea of Aliens vs Predator originated.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>My only minor complaint with this film is that it is too short, and in that time they spend so much time developing the characters but don't give them any real developing dialogue, then once they get into the action a lot of them get killed, and then a few more get picked off shortly there-after. And the obvious disappointment that one alien manages to kill two predators in a way-too-short battle.

","Disappointing. The music sucked. The mix sucked. The acting by the Predators paled in comparison to the first. I never cared about any of the characters (the actors did a decent job, it was the writing that sucked), and thus felt they were disposed of in the movie so effortlessly. The action felt subdued, and part of that is probably the oh so popular style of covering action these days, with close ups on fists, faces, limbs and such and fast cutting. Done tastefully that can work, but to make that the meat and potatoes of an action scene seems to really take away the impact of a fight. The other helping hand in making the action subdued was the PG-13 rating. What a stupid idea. Let's take two of the greatest sci-fi action films of all time, have the main characters meet for a face off unlike any other, and dumb it down and make it PG-13? Bad call. Seriously bad call."

A predator little human girl love fest should be enough to send up red flags for anyone who is a fan of the series, having a human help a predator on the hunt??? as honorable hunters that the predators are supposed to be wouldn't he get executed for being weak due to letting a human women help him fight aliens so he could achieve a higher rank in his clan? Not to mention the like 3 water towers that are seen at the abandoned whaling station in Antarctica???water towers???in Antarctica??? And why is alien blood corrosive to everything the predator has except the hand-held knife and staff? why didn't they make all of their stuff like the wristblades out of the same metal? Oh and i had to laugh at the alien head/shield lex uses that somehow has no acid blood in it to take off her arm.

"ShimmySnail","3","0","1","14 August 2004"," for hard core Alien or Predator fans only
","As a fan, I had to see it, but I think it was the worst of the seven Alien/Predator films.  It's not so much those two put together as a combination of Jurassic Park and Stargate.  It borrows so much of the premise and plot points from those two movies.  The dialogue is atrocious, the scenes are completely cliche, put together from other action films in the last few years.  The sound is probably the worst, lots of cheap ""gotcha"" sounds designed to make you jump out of your seat for no reason, like something as loud as a gunshot going off when someone lights an emergency flare in the darkness, and because of that it's the first film I'd say is ruined by watching it on the big screen.  It would be hard to overblow the sound on a television.<br/><br/>All of this could be forgiven, of course, if the scenes of fighting between the aliens and the predators were enough.  They're the best part, they ARE definitely very cool, but there's not a whole lot of them considering the movie's title.  The predators spend a lot of time slaughtering humans at first, which makes no sense considering they built a gigantic temple in humans were supposed to breed aliens for them to hunt.  Humans are bait, not prey.<br/><br/>The film contradicts a lot of what we learn about aliens in the first few alien movies.  It takes place in 2004, and yet in Aliens the humans claim they've never come across anything like the aliens in several hundred catalogued worlds.  Also the founder of the android company, played by Lance Henriksen, is depicted, and the inside elbow to the audience is that in the future, all the androids were made to look like him, the company's founder, yet they only looked like him AFTER they looked like the Ian Holm android in Alien, so HE would presumably be one modeled after the founder.  It's consistency errors like this which can turn off die hard fans.  There are others completely within the realm of this film which may turn off fans who don't care about that, like the idea of pre-Egyptian humans basing their calendar's zero year on Jesus' birth thousands of years in their future, and Aztecs having a base 10 (metric) timekeeping system but using modern base 60 (standard) seconds and minutes, and I'm not sure an experienced mountaineer (the team leader) would rely on a cheap watch compass right at the south pole.  It would be best if the movie just refused to try and come up with a detailed explanation for most of that.<br/><br/>The characters aren't that likable, even Lance Henriksen this time, and he's the only brand name actor in the thing.  See it for your Alien/Predator fix, but not for full price."

"edgefilm2001","1","0","2","13 August 2004"," ""Cool"" and ""Stupid"" at the same time?
","Well, yes...it certainly is.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS MOST LIKELY**<br/><br/>To Josh, the first review poster, I think you hit the nail on the head, but I'm going to greatly elaborate.<br/><br/>I just saw the midnight showing of AVP minutes ago. I have been a fan of both films series' for some time, Predator and Alien are both brilliant films and Aliens is very close to brilliant. Predator, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection are garbage in comparison and AVP is just a notch above Alien: Resurrection. <br/><br/>While it was extremely ""cool"" to see the Alien and the Predator duke it out, so to speak, on the silver screen, the level of ""stupidity"" that purveyed each frame of this film greatly outweighed that thrill. <br/><br/>Now, Paul W. S. Anderson, has never made a good movie in his life. However, several of his films are riddled with good intentions gone horribly wrong. ""Resident Evil"" and ""Event Horizon"" are two good examples of this. You can tell he's trying but it just doesn't pan out. Having seen the interviews with Anderson, he reminds me of myself when I wrote my own version of AVP roughly ten years ago. It wasn't great, but it was a lot better than this crap. However, he has such an enthusiasm for the subject that it would strike confidence into anyone working with him that he's doing the job properly. In fact he evoked a saying that I remember uttering years before the new AVP was even announced: ""I've always wanted to make a film with an Alien in it."" Well, what I always said was: ""I won't be happy until I've made a film with an Alien in it."" Hopefully, this hasn't utterly ruined my chances. <br/><br/>**OK, SPOILERS Definitely AFTER THIS, I SWEAR**<br/><br/>But I digress, on to the matter of the film itself. The direction is sloppy and basic at best. Continuity is all over the place and their is little that is interesting about the coverage or editing choices. The only aesthetic elements that are interesting are the Production Design homages to previous films: The dipping bird in the opening as seen in the original ALIEN, the sparkling nature of the sets evoking the opening of ALIENS. <br/><br/>NERDAGE (skip if you don't know much or care about the AVP universe):<br/><br/>The Matrix-esque effects sequences of facehuggers leaping through mid-air at incredible slow motion, are completely uncalled for and pointless. They are a pathetic attempt to thrust the genre into the new era. Also, the borrowing of the Aliens and facehuggers from ALIEN 4 is a terrible choice. The scuttling of the facehuggers prior to launching themselves from the egg completely takes away from the frightening aspect of their speed. The point is that they DON'T give you a warning. The leap BEFORE you can discern what the hell is going on. BEFORE ""Trainspotting's"" Spud (Ewen Bremner) is able to shoot one in mid-air while cocooned to the hive wall. Give me a break.<br/><br/>Also, since when did an Alien gestate in five minutes? OK, given what we know from the previous films, the only time we've seen an incubation from beginning to end is in the first ALIEN: total elapsed time? 25 hours including the hour he was up and about. The only other was Ripley's gestation of a queen in ALIEN 3 and that was several days. I don't believe its right to convolute something we know simply to fit the idea around the story you've made up for it. As much as I sound like an AVP version of a Trekkie, when you lay out ground rules, you structure your story around them. Then again, that's just good screen writing. Thus, in a sequel, you have ground rules already laid out and you can take liberties in certain areas (as yet unexplained history, for example), but others are unmalleable (is that a word?).<br/><br/>In ALIENS we hear a conversation between Bishop and Ripley that goes as follows:<br/><br/>BISHOP: ""The acid blood oxidizes after the creature's death completely neutralizing.""<br/><br/>RIPLEY: ""That's very interesting Bishop but that doesn't really get us anywhere, does it?""<br/><br/>I'm willing to allow that the final Predator was able to us a recently severed Alien finger to burn a symbol into his helmet and himself, however, after roughly twenty minutes, the same finger would no longer be producing volatile acid. How, in god's name then, does the predator use it to burn a symbol into Sanaa's cheek. We know just how fast it neutralizes after being exposed to oxygen because we saw it happen in ALIEN. No more than a minute or two. <br/><br/>One last note: the Queen Alien dies from drowning!? Hypothermia!? You get my point.<br/><br/>VISUAL EFFECTS:<br/><br/>As far as the creature effects go, the Aliens were...beautiful. Aside from the design, they moved perfectly and Anderson's choice for animatronics and guys in suits over full CGI was a great choice. For some reason, once the Predator took its helmet off though, the mandibles seemed fake to me. The Predator head effects were less convincing than the ones in P1 and P2. Then again, that could be simply the film stock used in this was much clearer and flaws were obvious. <br/><br/>CAST:<br/><br/>The cast were primarily ineffectual. Sanaa Lathan did the basic job as the unwitting heroine, but she lacked any kind of spark to make her a memorable character. Lance Henriksen, although an interesting casting choice, was also as deadpan as the rest. I can't really say much more about this because nothing stood out about the cast to me. The performances ranged from bad to mediocre at best and it was obvious that this film was not about the characters but about the combat.<br/><br/>What do we know about these people? Nothing. Sanaa's character, for example, we find out that she is adventurous and responsible. She also either has an intense fear of the dark, or, more likely, a huge complex about being alone: hence her huge mood shift once all her fellow humans die off around her. She goes from strong, stoic, wooden and responsible to cowering, weepy and jumpy. <br/><br/>There is a moment between Ewen Bremner and some guy with a scarred up face about their children, and Ewen can't shut up about them at the beginning, giving some half-hearted attempt at audience sympathy for these poor, unwitting souls. However, it is so transparent as a trick that it evokes no emotional response whatsoever.<br/><br/>Enough about the ineffectual acting.<br/><br/>SCRIPT<br/><br/>Now, as much as the studio would have you believe, Paul Anderson is not 100% responsible for this script. In fact, he's probably about 10% responsible, noting the other name on the credit: Shane Salerno. He is a fairly prominent shadow writer in Hollywood. He's not a ghost writer, he does get some credit, but this is the guy responsible for the meat of Armageddon and SHAFT, where others will assume responsibility. Seeing how bad the script is, I don't blame him for allowing the studios to credit Anderson with a ""Written and Directed by"" tag. Anyway, it's BS. <br/><br/>Regardless, there are some interesting homages, some might say rip-offs from the original Dark Horse AVP comic (the chained up Queen, the marking of the female main character by the Predator, the idea of Predators infesting and hunting on planets for initiation rights, etc.). However, outside of that, everything is mundane and predictable. <br/><br/>The new gadgets the Predators wield are just rehashes of old ones. Nothing special. Frankly, I prefer the disc (Predator 2) to these crappy multi-bladed things. It seems that these fledgling Predators were on a budget. They were also given the crappy versions of the nets as well.<br/><br/>Disregarding the lowest common denominator dialogue, the horrible formulaic structure, the convoluted situations and the hackneyed and rehashed ending, the script also suffers from one more huge downfall: length. The film is 87 minutes long. It feels like the 2nd act was condensed into five minutes and we skip straight to the climax. We have a twenty minute or so set-up, then we are exploring the pyramid for another fifteen minutes while the Predators approach. Then everyone days in no more than a ten minute time span, and then Sanaa Lathan teams up with the last surviving Predator to result in a drawn out finale action sequence that really offers no thrill except for one move the Predator makes against the Queen, which, while predictable, did make me smile.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION:<br/><br/>Most people might find a few of the sequences fun at times but this 87 minute shlock-fest is simultaneously too long and too short. It is its own paradox. There was such potential in this film and it was absolutely destroyed by everyone involved with this particular production except for the animatronic artists and the guy in the Alien suit. <br/><br/>This film makes almost no effort to come close to the quality of its source material. I will say it was slightly better than Alien 4 and only because of the simple combination of the two creatures occupying the same cinematic space. Its design department was also slightly better. Alien 4's atmosphere was interesting, but completely inappropriate. That's another story though.<br/><br/>If you are a casual audience member and don't really care about quality, renting this might be fun. Multiple viewings are not recommended. If you are a fan of either franchise, however, in any way, avoid this like the plague. It will crush you. Also, if you know the slightest thing about making films, avoid this in the same anti-plague-like manor.<br/><br/>0/10"

","Here I was, not expecting very much from this film. All I wanted was to see some awesome action from one of the most formidable warriors ever created on the big screen. The PREDATOR! The Predator's are supposed to be warriors, hard nosed, skilled in combat. Aliens are also very dangerous. Their acidic blood, agility, and sharp tails are lethal. Unlike Predators, they are basically insects, carrying no kind of technology and use instinct as their primary way to survive. Now don't get me wrong. I didn't expect the Aliens to come across as pussies. However, I never thought in a million years that the Predators would be portrayed as such. Three Predators kill a handful of humans and only two face huggers, two Aliens, and a recently born Alien straight from the stomach. The female lead kills more Aliens then the first two Predators combined. How can this be?!!!!!!! I didn't ask for much from this film. Just to see the Predators fight and kill Aliens in the tradition that the comic books and every other rendition had done in the past was all I asked for. The stupid characters, the horrible dialog, that was expected from this writer/director. But to reduce the Predators to being such wussies with only two or three cool moves by the lot of Predators in the film was a waste of time and money. Even the Aliens come across poorly. I could find only two moments in the film where I was actually enjoying the film. They lasted a combined 2 minutes. Not worth this film. Sorry, but Alien Resurrection has more creativity and story, and that movie was garbage. Who would have thought that somebody could simply ruin two classic great characters so easily? Hate to say it, but I'm pretty pissed off after waiting so long just to get a crap movie where the writer/director obviously didn't do his homework. Fan or no fan, this guy's a hack! Save your money and get the Predator SE or the first two Alien movies."
"Skiingman2004-1","7","0","1","12 August 2004"," I totally agree! It sucked!
","I really think that this movie was complete garbage, i went to an advanced screening thinking that i will once again be terrified and thrilled, and it was such a waste of celluloid! First of NOT rated R. Big mistake, once i heard that, i felt like i was punched in the face, two not having John McTiernan direct it. Big mistake (James Cameron would have been another great choice). I really was disappointed once the humans and predator unite. that is bull****. I grew up with predators hunting humans down for sport. Then they unite??? what the hell is up with that? it got 0/10 on my review. and one last thing. it was 1hr 27min. the movie flew by before i could understand what horse s**t plot it has. they should never have in come out, erase all film, and have John McTiernan and James Cameron direct a new AVP, which is detail, and make it much much better!"

","Avoid this movie, please! I can't give a full review on a movie like this, so I'll try.<br/><br/>I did like one thing of the movie, the story. A group of archeologists head to Alaska to locate an underground Aztec Temple. But they soon find out that someone, or something, has already been there.<br/><br/>But, the story becomes too fast too soon. First of all, there are WAY too many characters, and in about a half hour, almost everyone dies. Then a character teams up with a Predator (who might have KILLED most of her friends) and fights of the aliens.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Alien Vs. Predator is that it's PG-13. You don't see any gory deaths, they say the F-word once, and, sadly to say, it just doesn't seem as fun as it would if it was R. I'm telling the director now: Show The Director's Cut NOW! <br/><br/>This movie seems way to short, unlike Freddy Vs. Jason where the movie pans out and gives a better performance. Terrible ending; it's just another reason to spawn even lamer sequels.<br/><br/>Final Word: Alien Vs. Predator (PG-13) gets *1/2 Stars. 'Nuff Said ~ BAT"

","As a fan of the Alien,and Predator series I've been waiting for this film for forever.And all though it didn't become the next Alien/Aliens/Predator its a great popcorn film. We get some very fun action scenes,and great characters,all though some are not developed well enough.Chuck Weyland is my favorite you feel sorry for him. The battles between our title characters are great.The Predators,and Aliens have never looked finer. And Anderson is clearly having fun making this movie,only this time he didn't screw with the audience,like his earlier sucky movies.It makes up for a lot of the crap hes done. Alien Vs Predator though not a great film,is a fun one,and is worth the price of admission. 3/4"
"msdss","1","0","2","13 August 2004"," Butchered.... *SPOILERS*
","Yeah, so you think its going to be a bunch of predators and a bunch of aliens whoopin each others asses... well its not.... its 3 predators.... and you don't see them or the aliens until after the first hour of humans walking around this temple confused and lost with pointless dialogue and this ""I'm going to touch stuff that I don't know what it does yet"" frame of mind...<br/><br/>when the 3 predators finally show up.. your thinking YES... carnage is coming... the reason I came to see this movie.... well... I'm sorry... the first predator dies instantly to an alien... the 2nd puts about about a 20 second fight before dying to another alien... then after that awe inspiring 21 seconds of alien vs predator action, it goes back to the humans being lost and stupid again for an additional 20 minutes... then you are rewarded with another 20 seconds, where it shows the remaining predator kill an alien... but its not the uber fight you think its going to be... it takes all of .5 seconds for him to slice through the head with ninja like reflexes... im glad at least one of the predators wasn't a total weakling right????? RIGHT????<br/><br/>NO WAIT!! I know you didn't want one to be really powerful...so don't worry... the last surviving human, a lady that is way too gungho about being a guide in ice wasteland BEFRIENDS the last surviving predator... it would seem that predators are nice guys after all.... he cuts off an aliens head and tail and gives them to her... tail for a spear, and head to fit over her entire left arm for some sort of shield...... I'm GLAD THEIR F****** BLOOD Isn't ACID YOU F****** MORONS... Oh yeah... Did I mention the blood is only acid when they need to show how scary the aliens are... If your actually going to fight one you don't have to worry about it... Also, the aliens acid blood apparently has a different effect on different types of materials... for instance, when the predator gets hit with the acid, his body armor is instantly corroded... when the female star's sweater gets hit, its no big deal... soo mental note... wear cashmere when battling any aliens...<br/><br/>Anyway... You think once the human and the predator team up, and you think it couldn't possibly get any worse, you can FINALLY see some AVP action??? Well, no, sorry boys and girls... the predator just starts his little arm bomb and throws it on the ground and him and girl run to safety together... Wow, that was easy huh... Why bother spawning hundreds of aliens to battle if your entire crew is full of losers who can't fight, and your just going to nuke the entire site anyway... bleh...<br/><br/>but its not over yet! no!!!! they aren't butchering this movie bad enough.... they need to have this <insert 5 pages of swearing> love scene between the predator and the girl?? WHAT IN GODS NAME? I fully expected them to light candles, put on some barry white, and start making out on the spot...*sigh* ...But thats not all! The queen alien shows up, after this huge atomic blast goes off ... <br/><br/>I'm glad that after setting off a blast of this size, at around 2000 feet below the ice... that this stupid queen alien thats for some reason 5x the size it was in aliens, can somehow survive when the entire area was vaporized, and climb up a 2000 foot vertical cliff... argh....<br/><br/>I can't tell you what happens after this... because I walked out at this point... Yes... I walked out of a FREE movie... It was the premiere... and I walked out of it... I wanted my free ticket back to go hopefully give myself enough paper cuts that I could commit suicide right there at the box office..."
"jrat6200","3","0","1","13 August 2004"," Not what I expected...BUT
","Paul Anderson's vision of a movie does not go hand-in-hand with originality of an idea. Mortal Kombat was pretty good (hated the PG-13 rating though). Resident Evil was just okay (rated R but just didn't have the feel). Now, we get Aliens Vs. Predator. Ever since watching the Alien and Predator films from the 80s and 90s, I was expecting something like this. Also reading the Dark Horse comics of these two rival foes was exciting. But, this movie did not live up to the standards of the previous films or the comics. I admit though, some elements did take place, but couldn't make up for the movie as a whole. So, what do we get? A simmered down version of our two favorites slapped with a PG-13?!! Fox should be ashamed. The movie had a cheap, rushed feel to it. Both franchises weren't done justice. Where are the marines? What happened to the fight on the other planet? This movie needed more time and possibly another director (James Cameron or Ridley Scott perhaps).<br/><br/>I'm not going to comment on the acting that much because this isn't a movie where dialog is superior to anything else in the movie. The two that really stood out were Sanaa Lathan and Big Boss Hogg Lance Henriksen (still going!!). Sanaa has strong standings to become a great actress. I wish her success in the future. Some of the dialog in the movie was laughably cheesy and unnecessary. Raoul Bova did alright too, but the rest of the cast was just there for the Alien and Predator killing satisfaction.<br/><br/>The CG effects in the movie were good and didn't throw the movie off at all. As a matter of fact, CG and some of the fight sequences saved the movie from being a big disgrace to the fans. The predator cloaking was great, and their weapons look more updated from the previous two predator movies. The editing was horrible though. Every time an Alien or one of the predators kill the scene was cut, and I mean CUT!! For those who haven't seen the movie, you will understand why a R rating needed to take place. A fight scene that took place in a chamber, between a predator and an alien, was badly edited. The camera was too shaky, and the lighting was displaced. Also, the slow motion BS is annoying. Besides the flaws, some satisfaction came out of the sequences.<br/><br/>Important: The predator should have been portrayed as being more agile and versatile in combat. The aliens should never get the upper hand unless the predator is outnumbered or wounded (READ THE DARK HORSE COMICS OR WATCH THE PREVIOUS MOVIES!!).<br/><br/>Overall, this is soaked down to just a decent popcorn flick. I hope that the dvd will acquire a R rating and add more valuable scenes to the movie. The theatrical version just doesn't cut. I wanted to see this more than Spider-Man!! Paul Anderson and company (FOX!! AARGH!!) let me down and also losing respect from me. Hope the sequel takes another turn (also possibly another director) and gives the fans a movie that we deserve.<br/><br/>Final Judgement: **/****"
"SirFerdinandSD666","3","0","1","13 August 2004"," An Insult to longtime fans everywhere
",">>>>>***SPOILERS GALORE----I JUST SAW THE MOVIE*****<<<<<<br/><br/>After just watching the movie...I have this to say.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the Alien series, and a pretty big fan of Predator. For an indicator of how long I have been a fan of the series, I will tell you first off that I saw Aliens when it came out on video tape in the late 80s and saw Alien 3 in theaters, I obviously saw Alien after its mid-70's release, and it scared me like few movies have ever been able to do since. I saw Predator later, and very much regard it as a good movie, in that it told a well thought-out story, had excellent characters, and an original plot, not to mention a great villain.<br/><br/>I believe a making a good movie means telling a good story, and telling it well. This movie has neither a good story, or, as it seems, a good story teller. What made Alien and Aliens stand out as excellent movies was the fact that Ridley Scott and James Cameron are superb story tellers, which means they make movies that resonate with the audience. The characters in the movie(AVP) are, at best, instantly forgettable, and the dialogue is stupid, unoriginal, and gives no indication any of the characters have a personality. Anderson makes a very feeble attempt to get you to care a little about Lex and Sebastian by giving them each(and a few other characters) painfully boring monologues about ""My dad died on a mountain, blah blah here, clichÃ© line here, meaningless dribble there"", and letting them have(a few) more than 4 lines to read. What happened to good movies with memorable characters, good plot, and good dialogue? Are those times past us now? Since when does a single monologue pass as character development?<br/><br/>I have no idea of the names of any of the other characters whatsoever, except Charles Bishop Weyland. Which brings me to that point. Lance's character was horribly dry, unemotional, and when he dies, I didn't care, or even notice really. Not only that, the movie tells you nothing of his character, except you assume he is rich beyond all comprehension, and he does something with robots. Which to me, seems like just a passing, muttered excuse to have Lance Hendrickson in the movie. There is nothing even remotely clever about his wasted role, and no discernible relation to Bishop the android is made, only assumed, and definitely not explored or even attempted to explore. It also completely disregards the fact that in Alien 3, the man claimed he was the designer of the Bishop android...so...it just makes no sense, and it just kind of tries to spoon feed you that for some reason, this is the real creator, and not the guy in Alien 3, and doesn't ever even try to tell you why its right.<br/><br/>There are many many many wasted scenes, but one that particularly comes to mind is the sacrificial chamber scene. The scientists seemed to already know they were in danger when the eggs arose, although they should not have had any clue whatsoever about what the eggs were. They showed no curiosity, and immediately drew weapons, then were easily facehugged, and quickly spawned aliens, faster than in any earlier Alien film, literally within minutes of being impregnated there was an embryo bursting from the victims chest...which begs the question, why the hell would you bring weapons to a remote location in Antarctica, and not bring exploration or excavation equipment of any kind? I don't think automatic rifles(with laser sights) and 45 cal. automatic pistols are common equipment for an archaeological expedition. Makes no sense...and some of you may end up accusing me of nitpicking, and you're damn right, I expected a brilliant movie to rank with the works of James Cameron, Ridley Scott and John McTiernan because that's what was promised, and yes those movies are what I judge this one by. There was not a single scene in any of those movies that was blatantly unexplained, or was not logical in terms of the story. There was so very much that was illogical and wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>As for the Predators...of the three, two were brutally slaughtered very quickly, it seemed as if they had no chance at all. The Predator in the original movie was a fast, agile hunter that used clever tactics and stealth to quickly bring down an entire special forces unit, one at a time, in the heavy jungles of South America, by hand, alone. There were 3 of them in this movie, and it seems that the single predator in the first movie could have killed, not only all of the people in this movie by itself, but all three of the Predators in this movie by itself. These predators were slow, easily sneaked up upon, and had no seeming idea of what was going on, but just seemed to kill because that's what they felt like doing...or...something. In the original Predator, it was coming AFTER Arnold and his team, and there wasn't anything they could do about it. In this movie, the Predators just kinda...well...acted like guys in suits. The Original Predator could leap 20 feet in the air from tree to tree, these could kinda wobble around and run kinda. The Original Predator was like a ghost, these were just dead. And things just went from cheesy to outright goofy when Lex and the 'hero' Predator(who, without hesitation, murdered about 4 people a few minutes earlier) became friends and teamed up against the Queen...I thought they might even kiss at one point. And they even had a slo-mo running from danger scene reminiscent of...any movie where a big dude and his hot chick co-star triumphantly defeat whatever it was they're supposed to defeat, and are running from an inevitable explosion.<br/><br/>I basically take this movie as an insult, a spit in the face, of all serious fans like myself. The end is obviously open for a sequel...I say, bring back Ridley Scott or James Cameron for the love of all that is holy...because they are the only ones that could save this franchise now. I only wish they could have had a triumphant end, and not silly garbage like this.<br/><br/>RIP"

","A Film like AVP has a lot to live up to... I believe AVP did so. It was meant to be a popcorn movie,If you except this you will enjoy the film and it fulfilled its purpose. True we don't get much character development,and we are plunged into Weyland's Antartic adventure within the first fifteen minutes.The characters when given time,are very good,ala Chuck Weyland,Lex,Sebastian,Miller,and of course Scar the Predator.We care for them.But that is only a select few characters listed above ^^^The plot is okay,An expedition crew,goes to find an Anicent Pyarmid,and gets caught up in the Alien/Predator war.We really only want to see the Predators,and Aliens fight til all hell breaks lose,and we see it.We do get some great battle sequences,and the Predators,and Aliens have never looked finer. We get a decent film,when viewing I didn't care about the PG-13 rating,or the fact Paul WS Anderson was behind the directors chair,I was having a fun time. By no means is AVP the next Alien/Aliens/Predator,but it is a fun film in its own right nonetheless <br/><br/>I give it a 3/4"
"dr_foreman","5","0","1","13 August 2004"," and you were expecting a masterpiece?
","Ah! So stupid, yet so sweeeet. Alien vs. Predator is ever-so-slightly better than I expected, though I wasn't expecting much. I enjoyed the film's pseudo-Aztec sets and cool creature action, though as I expected, the thinly drawn human characters pale beside the awesome monsters.<br/><br/>Much-reviled director Paul W.S. Anderson acquits himself pretty well here. He wisely shies away from CGI, relying instead on robotics and other mechanical special effects. (Apparently, 70% of the SFX are physical-cool!) He also paces the film pretty well, using the first hour to build up audience anticipation of the final rumble. I'm glad that this unfolds like a proper horror movie and doesn't start with all-out action. The fights, when we finally get them, are pretty exciting, although Anderson employs too much fast cutting and murky photography-the twin plagues of the modern action film.<br/><br/>What really lets the side down is the aforementioned human cast, which pretty much stinks to a man (and woman). Henriksen's magnetic, gravelly voiced presence adds weight and class to an otherwise unknown and talentless group of actors. I've heard positive comparisons between Sanaa Lathan's heroine Alexa Woods and Sigourney Weaver's classic character of Ellen Ripley, but since Ripley is both tougher and better acted, I can't say that I agree. Lathan is merely competent-nothing more-and she only looks good because she's playing against a cast of silly ethnic stereotypes.<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about the setting, which is quite atmospheric but also very familiar and conservative. I'm tired of watching Aliens stalk people through claustrophobic corridors; when are they going to cut loose in a city or jungle? That said, the arctic scenes are great, and I loved the abandoned town. I wish it featured more heavily in the action.<br/><br/>I note that most Internet reviewers are already gunning for this movie in a big way. Not really a shocker; science fiction fanboys are notoriously hard to please. I, for one, anticipated a total bomb, and was pleased to discover a two-and-a-half star guilty pleasure. Frankly, I always thought the whole concept of cramming Aliens and Predators into one movie was stupid. The Aliens belong to the world of Gothic horror, whereas the Predators were spawned in the action-adventure world of Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Alien films are legitimate movie classics (minus number four), and the Predator films are silly (though enjoyable) action movies. It's a weird mix, and a sign that both franchises are desperately ailing (actually, Predator never was a franchise!). I certainly didn't anticipate that any movie based on such a gimmicky clash of 'titans' would be better than this; by all rights, it should've been worse. <br/><br/>* SPOILERS BELOW * <br/><br/>One final, quick note-isn't it just beautiful when one Alien houses two Predators? Naturally, I was rooting for the Aliens all along; they're like lions or tigers, while the Predators are the British guys with big hunting rifles. Who's got more natural skills? The Aliens. Without their technology to hide behind, the Predators have got nothing'. Heh heh heh. That's the secret reason why I liked the movie, folks...Aliens kick butt!"
"HarryWarden","2","0","4","12 August 2004"," A slap in the face to two brilliant franchises.
","Let's get one thing straight: I've been a life-long fan of both franchises. The first two 'Alien' installments remain two of my all-time favorite films. They're what turned me onto the horror genre. Hell, I even dug 'Alien 3' and 'Resurrection'...warts n' all. And I worship and adore BOTH 'Predator' movies. I know these six films inside and out. I know the name of every single character. I can quote every line of dialogue.<br/><br/>I read all the 'AvP' comic books. I played all the 'AvP' video games. This was a match made in fanboy heaven...and I wanted to see a big-screen adaptation more than anything. I waited impatiently for over a decade...and it took Paul Anderson only 100 minutes to destroy everything.<br/><br/>This movie does not feel like an 'Alien' or 'Predator' film. It feels like 'Jurassic Park IV' with the title creatures in place of the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The characters? Not a memorable one in the whole lot. Lex is one of the most generic and dull heroines to stumble through a feature film...and surprisingly, the supporting cast displays even less energy. Even Lance Henriksen - our one ray of sunshine - isn't in the film long.<br/><br/>There isn't a single good or fresh idea in the script. The whole pyramid/training-ground concept sounded good...until Anderson started crafting his own mythology around it. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that it's stupid beyond words.<br/><br/>The fights between the beasts are so badly shot and edited, I didn't care for one solitary second. It didn't stir up one bit of emotion in my inner-fanboy. And the creatures look HORRIBLE. The Aliens seemed okay...but the Predators are absolutely wretched. They look like goofy WWF wrestlers and in no way resemble or act like what we saw in the other films. It's really hard not to chuckle whenever they appear on screen.<br/><br/>I won't even get into the continuity errors, and just plain bad ideas, that saturate this film. Let's just say, that it lived up to all my fears...and created some new ones.<br/><br/>Paul Anderson has not made a movie for the fans. He's taken a beloved franchise, stripped it of it's soul, and marketed it to 10-year-old boys. I've liked many of his films and I've been defending him for years. I was even excited when he was announced as director, while most people groaned. But all the naysayers were right.<br/><br/>Out of all my brutal movie disappointments, this easily ranks #1."
