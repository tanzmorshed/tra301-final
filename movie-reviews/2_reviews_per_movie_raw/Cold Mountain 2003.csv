","Anthony Minghela's (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.<br/><br/>The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.<br/><br/>The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.<br/><br/>Ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.<br/><br/>The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.<br/><br/>Very highly recommended."

","'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.<br/><br/>Then again, calling Cold Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br/><br/>Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern ""lawman,"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of Northern aggression,"" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br/><br/>Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether."

","Anthony Mingheller's astounding film cleverly sweeps the audience into the horrors of war at its beginning.  He then introduces his two principle characters who would gradually move the audience into their world wrought by war and hardship. We watch as the characters begin to unravel their internal tortures and their need to subdue their isolation to face their regrets and hope for the future.  This is an absolutely fabulous movie that portrays the stunning performances of its stellar cast of actors and the overwhelming raw landscapes that are kept in sync with their events and moods.  Observe the stages of emotional changes in the characters. So amazingly and magnificently captured at different camera angles, from scene to scene against the cold, mountainous countryside!<br/><br/>This film isn't throwing off longwinded dialogue and lengthy physical encounters between Jude Law's Inman and Nicole Kidman's Ada to reveal the meeting of two souls searching for a meaningful existence.  Yep, it's that brief and silent stare of Inman as he confronts the graciously low-keyed, prim and proper Ada that explicitly puts their sensory awareness of each other so powerfully on screen.  As the events flow, I was completely mesmerized by the Inman character watching him transcend to his sense of isolation and his developing disillusion with his world. On the other hand, I couldn't take my eyes off the immaculately well-bred and gorgeous Ada as she succumbs into a scrawny hapless damsel in complete distress.  It's fascinating to watch the couple adapt to situations beyond their control and to study the emotional and behavioral attitudes of two human beings altering at such opposing magnitude as a result of one war.  Observe how the once popular Inman slips into desolation in the battlefield, becoming even more tormented from his world as he meets up with some very strange characters. Will he ever find solace with these characters, or with Ada at the end? Will Ada, while feeling alienated from her new abode, at the beginning of the film and with the death of her father, be able to battle her insecurity to become spiritually enlightened and physically capable with the help of her new acquaintances?  Is she able to embraces what the farmland has to offer her? And will Inman be capable of escaping what the gruesome battlefield has come to mean to him?  This film lays out an enormous ground for the examination of the effects a war on different individuals.<br/><br/>The film continues to remind the audience that Ada and Inman are bound together by their haunting memories of one another.  That, indeed, is beautifully captured by the expressions on Law and Kidman's faces. The symbolisms, throughout the film, are plentiful and brilliantly ascribed, allowing the audience to join the dots to the destinies of the couple. Even crows, clearly suggesting doom and destruction, never fail to demonstrate the dark instincts that trouble a man's soul. And those women Inman meets in his journey seem to trigger the expectation of the audience to see him drawing closer to the woman he loves and to home.  Even these characters, encountered by Inman, provide a picture of how different people react to the war. But will war ultimately bring peace and safety to its protagonists? This film is a masterpiece that will provide much food for thought.<br/><br/>Renee Zwellweger is phenomenal in her boisterously loud 'Ruby' role. She brings another aspect of the American woman that's so different in breeding from Kidman's Ada.  Both are educated in their different cultural way of life.  What can Ada learn from Ruby, the frontier woman who sees the 'hands and knees' toiling as the only way of survival in her community? Zwellweger provides the comic relief that's much needed for this powerfully intense film.  She's superb in her role as the beacon of strength and hope for injecting a meaningful existence of living. Unlike the soldiers or the hypocritical Home Guard authorities that use guns to destroy their enemies, Ruby uses her hands-on skills to beat the odds of survival. It's uncannily delightful to watch her interacting with Kidman's character. She, Law and Kidman are definitely worthy of being recipients of the Oscar statuettes. They exhibit their superb non-stop performing talents in this film with their onscreen appearances. The Q&A session with Brendon Gleeson (who plays Ruby's father), has prompted me to want to go see this movie again - to watch closely how the strength of the film's womenfolk can make a difference to the human beings' survival instincts.  I want to study again how hellish wars are for destroying and crippling, not only the physical, but the mental aspects of the masculine race.  And Gleeson does drive home an interesting question: When these mountain folks `volunteer' to fight a war, how come they should be penalized as deserters if they were to decide to opt out of it?<br/><br/>This film is a MUST-SEE. It's beautifully crafted, assembled, and absolutely mesmerizing in all aspects of filmmaking techniques and style. The music score and soundtracks are so appropriate locked into the events and the moods of the characters. And the film's title? It does project its allegorical appeal.<br/><br/>A+"
"keechelus","Null","46","60","23 November 2004"," Not A Love Story
","(Minor spoilers in this post)<br/><br/>Cold Mountain's greatest flaw may have been its wrong-headed promotion as a great one-on-one love story. It is more a revelation of people, place and time.<br/><br/>We avoided the theatrical release, because of the Law-Kidman romance that was promised (just another date movie...), then I read the Charles Frazier book. Oh. Think again.<br/><br/>The film is nearly true to the novel. If anything, Minghella felt compelled to make more of Ada and Inman's budding romance before the war. ""I-I don't know you"" is spoken several times in voiced letters and at the end in the film. In the novel, they didn't know each other at all: three awkward meetings and one fumbled kiss.<br/><br/>But, as happens in real life, Inman and Ada felt something was possible ... then their worlds were overturned. Minghella is true to Frazier in the bulk of the story.<br/><br/>Ada is a photo that Inman carries, but she really represents HOME: Cold Mountain, his real love. A return to sanity from the insanity of mass murder.<br/><br/>Inman is a photo that Ada keeps. He is a glimpse into the rural life she began to appreciate after her unhappy girlhood in the crinolines and parasols of Charleston. Her scholarly father was her one true friend. His early death left her completely alone, neither fish nor fowl.<br/><br/>Until kindly Sally Swanger (Kathy Baker) sends Ruby Thewes (Renée Z) over to kill that floggin' rooster, and shows her how to survive.<br/><br/>Maybe that's what disappoints many formula love-story critics. Law and Kidman are apart for nearly the entire film. Ruby and Ada get that place a-workin' -- just enough to last the winters at first, but functioning. Ada doesn't pine for Inman; in her letters she is caring, then as times get worse, she is very strong: ""If you are fighting, stop fighting. If you are marching, stop marching. Come home. Come home to Cold Mountain. That is my request.""<br/><br/>Another frequent complaint is that Cold Mountain is ""episodic"". Yeah, it is. That's the structure of the novel. Inman's desperate journey is another retelling of Homer's Odyssey - and that was THE love story of the ages, more than Romeo and Juliet.<br/><br/>This is a story of the War Between The States, but one that looks beyond the the glory and horror of Gettysburg, Antietam and Manassas. This ain't ""Gods and Generals"" ... this is about a few ordinary people in an obscure corner of America. Inman's journey is a way of revealing how that war's evil claws reached the most innocent folks. And turned a few of them unspeakably cruel.<br/><br/>Perhaps Frazier and Minghella did not intend to remind us, but their story was echoed in 1990's Bosnia; and too many other places today.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain: the Frazier novel curled all my toes with its poetry, suspense and aching love of the mountains. Minghella earns two of my thumbs and a few toes for getting it on film.<br/><br/>10/10 for the book; 8.5/10 for the movie."

","This movie moved me more than I was expecting, and I was fully prepared to cry. The acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. They didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it's in the top five. The story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing what line came next. A heart-wrenching story about humanity and war. In fact, this movie was so strongly real that it was barely noticeable it took place in the 19th century. It seemed to apply to all times."
"sol-","Null","68","97","8 December 2004"," My brief review of the film
","A strongly acted and always interesting portrait of the hardships that came with the American Civil War, not only for soldiers but for those who did not fight too. The times are portrayed well, with sets and costumes that cannot be faulted. What can be flawed in the film however is the central romance, which is without much spark or realism. But all the action surrounding the romance is great, with some good-natured humorous touches, wonderful supporting characters and the perfect picture overall of life during the American Civil War. The cast is superb, with Zellweger in particular undergoing a superb transformation from her typical roles. The film is generally well written and well directed by Minghella, so that in spite of a lackluster romance, the film is still a captivating and entertaining watch."

","Cold Mountain is directed by Anthony Minghella who also adapts to screenplay from Charles Frazier's novel of the same name. It stars Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger, Eileen Atkins, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ray Winstone and Natalie Portman.Music is scored by Gabriel Yared and cinematography by John Seale. Plot finds Law as W.P. Inman, a wounded deserter from the Confederate army who is trying to make his way back to North Carolina to rekindle a fledgling romance with Ada Monroe (Kidman). <br/><br/>This is Minghella's world and the American Civil War movie gets a double shot in the arm as Cold Mountain not only deals in the home front, but also in the perilous life of the soldier. Add into the mix a fire cracker of an opening, a central romance and an array of expertly drawn characters, and it's safe to say that Minghella's film is not only epic in production, but also in story telling. In essence the film is about love, friendships and learning to cope under the most trying of circumstances, but the director doesn't paint it with a sentimental brush. As the three strands of the narrative play out, tone is often gritty, intense, sorrowful even, with Minghella cribbing from the Anthony Mann Western book by having the stunning landscapes form part of the characters emotional world. <br/><br/>Come back to me, come back to me <br/><br/>Story is strong, even if the key romance is soft; since it's told mostly in flash backs, but those flash backs are threaded into the main seam of Ada's life on the home front and Inman's perilous odyssey. She, befriended by hard working, dirty handed, Ruby Thewes (Zellewegger excellent); who also provides the only moments of levity within, he, meeting up with a number of interesting characters, both good and bad. This of course makes the film episodic, but in this instance it's a good thing, mainly because characters are so utterly compelling. Hoffman as a less than honourable priest and Portman as a young woman out in a wood cabin, alone with her sick baby, they stand out. But there's also the Home Guard attached enforcers led by blood thirsty Teague (Winstone) and a potent thread involving Ruby's fiddle playing father, Stobrod (Gleeson as usual a considerable screen presence). <br/><br/>On the technical front it's hard to find fault, it's a tip top production. Romania's mountains, rolling hills and forests form the backdrop to most of the action, with John Seale's Academy Award nominated photography neatly passing for a rugged North Carolina. While the costumes, set design and Yared's score also add impetus to the feel of the time. There's some minor itches, such as fluctuating accents and the delicacy of the romance lacking the passion to drive such a journey by Inman on, but they are not flaws. Such is the strength of Minghella's story telling ability, Cold Mountain still comes out as great cinema. A film that can stay in your mind for days after viewing it. Bleak yet subtle, savage yet tender, a different sort of Civil war movie. Amen to that. 9/10"

","In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near to the period of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health reasons. Ada meets the also shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see Ada in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. I liked this film a lot. Having names such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications to the Oscar, this movie does not disappoint. My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, which show what happens with Sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'"
"Poseidon-3","Null","99","152","5 January 2004"," Worth watching even if ""brought to you by Mattel.""
","There are a couple of things wrong with this episodic, rather sweeping film, but not enough to destroy it. Fortunately, the good outweighs the bad enough to make it worthwhile viewing. Law plays a shy, but thoughtful young man in Cold Mountain, NC. When the local minister's daughter (Kidman) moves to town, he is immediately taken with her and they share a few very brief, very stifled moments (including an impromptu kiss) before he leaves to fight in the Civil War. (An opening battle scene is so intense that the impact of it literally tears the clothes off one participant!) As they each experience great change, disappointment and destruction, it is their longing for each other that keeps them going. He can't wait to get back to her and she can't wait for him to come back. As Law treks across the southeastern coast, he comes upon a wide variety of opponents and allies. These are all played with great skill by a terrific gallery of solid, semi-name actors (Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, Atkins, etc......) Meanwhile, Kidman faces the end of her gentle existence and almost existence itself until a scrappy, brassy local girl steps in to rescue her. Zellweger plays this feisty, mouthy girl, using every ounce of her acting prowess. The pair must fend off an opportunistic home guardsman played by a slimy Winstone. The film lurches forward with the all-important reunion moment dangling in front of the viewers like a carrot on a stick. It is solely due to the acting talent and intense chemistry of the stars and not the sketchy, spotty script that this moment carries any dramatic weight at all. Somehow, Law and Kidman manage the impossible, which is to create a romance and desire for one another that is never properly developed on the screen. They are forced to create everything through their expressions and body language and do just that. As good as they are, they are almost completely overtaken by the surprisingly wondrous and intriguing work of Zellweger. Her welcome dash of vinegar and bluntness is a perfect counterpoint for the dewy and sensitive lovers. Also, of particular note is another surprise - the downright striking job that Portman does as a lonely widow and mother. She outdoes herself in this brief role. As a matter of fact, nearly every performance in the film is excellent. The one exception is the horribly anachronistic and inexplicable presence of the peroxide blonde henchman to Winstone. His punk-rock, eyelinered look and shopping-mall line delivery remove the viewer from the already tenuous time period whenever he's on screen. (And is it ever stated why someone his age isn't IN the war??) That's one other problem. There is very little period feel to this film. It always seems like the actors are playing with clothes they found at Western Costume with their make up done by Ben Nye. Kidman's hair, while lovely, is absolutely ridiculous. It distracts from and detracts from scenes very often. Ditto her make up. One key scene near the end is a close up and her heavy mascara and shadow grey/purple eyeshadow (masterfully applied by those Hollywood wizards) turn what should have been an agonizing emotional moment into ""Barbie Does the Civil War"". Zellweger does better in the make-up department, though her chemically-whitened teeth do not go very far in suggesting her character's background. Her deliberately tousled hair is also a problem at times, but nowhere near the level of Kidman's. These are quibbles in light of the bigger problem which is an overriding predictability. Even to one who has never read the book, there is no doubt as to the ending of the film. There is very little room for surprise and what there is of that is telegraphed again and again. So the audience is left watching a 2-1/2 hour film with a foregone conclusion. (And this sometimes meandering work was originally FIVE hours long!) The amount of footage left on the cutting room floor makes for some uncomfortable continuity (such as when a character is tortured and watches 3 family members slaughtered and is next seen smilingly dancing a Christmas jig!) Nevertheless, the romance and beauty of the film still delivers and there is no doubt that Kidman is a MOVIE STAR. She glows and glistens and has every accommodation made to her. Even her old riding coat looks runway perfect. Law is achingly beautiful in the early scenes, but delivers a sincere, dedicated performance in spite of his physical features (which are all but buried as it wears on.)"
"Doylenf","Null","48","70","7 July 2004"," Stunning photography, fine performances but flawed script and mixed results...
","There are so many good things to praise in COLD MOUNTAIN that it pains me to say that staying with it to the very end is sometimes difficult because it drags in spots and some of the story-telling techniques are awkwardly staged.<br/><br/>Nothing but kudos for the casting. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are in top form--with Law hiding his good looks most of the time under beard, stubble or mud. Renee Zellweger makes us understand why she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as the tough but tender-hearted Ruby. Cinematography and background score are tops.<br/><br/>By the time the two lovers have been reunited for the finale, much has happened in the way of showing how war brutalizes men. Anthony Minghella doesn't flinch from showing the harsh realities of battle and then switching to scenes of pastoral splendor on the home front. <br/><br/>It's a film in which all the ingredients are put together with exceptional craftsmanship. So much so, that you wish the script had been a little stronger to make the two hours and thirty-four minutes more absorbing. Unfortunately, it tends to take too long to tell a tale that lacks the power of holding interest once it gets past the midway point.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, anyone interested in the Civil War period will find this a meticulous work as far as costumes, settings and use of folk music is concerned. <br/><br/>But be warned: This bittersweet romance at times is downright depressing and the gritty war scenes (and the brutality of certain Yankee soldiers) are about as graphic as such battle scenes usually get. The overall feeling is one of awe that so much has been accomplished and yet there is something unsatisfying about the tale itself."

","Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts and<br/><br/>pines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel.<br/><br/>Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fading<br/><br/>Confederacy. All other times, he's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as he does his Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where he has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is gol-durn heck, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals.<br/><br/>And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure.<br/><br/>I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff. But it's only about 15 minutes of this 150-minute dog."
"dbarnes-6","7","53","96","30 July 2004"," This movie works, but it is no ""Gone With The Wind""
","This movie worked for me because I see this movie as an exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind.' Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger,) shows up to save the day. Sort of, in a round about way. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. <br/><br/>There are only two things I didn't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I couldn't see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law), and Ada, (Nicole Kidman,) as being strong enough for Inman to desert to get back to her. Inman said he only had written to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. I must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.<br/><br/>I thought all the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework on the part. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than I thought it was. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. Kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact I chose her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better. <br/><br/>I liked the scene with the Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the 'Home Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance."
"aaronsaft","1","40","72","16 January 2004"," Why I thought Cold Mountain was just plain bad.
","I could forgive the fact that the movie was shot in Romania (the time and place are a crucial part of the novel full of character and qualified film staff, but remained an untapped resource for the movie).  I could forgive that foreign actors were used as leads, presumably for their names, while there are perfectly qualified American, or better yet southern actors available (there was an Australian, an Englishman, a couple Irishmen, and a whole bunch of Romanians; Oh and one great young southern actor, Ethan Suplee with a relatively inconsequential part.).  I could forgive the geographical mistakes (if you are in Petersburg, VA start walking south or west or better yet uphill and you will get to Avery County, NC, but you will never see the ocean).  I could forgive the lack of true development of a villain or evil (several were suggested, the weakest of which was there for the finale).  I could forgive Phillip Seymore Hoffman's British southern fusion accent (Not nearly as bad as Nichole Kidman's or Jude Law's sad attempts at southerners...sad and inconsistent), or Rene Zellweger's comic book interpretation of her comic relief character (she was occasionally amusing after all).  I could forgive the soundtrack for leading me by the nose though every pivotal scene like some kind of emotional laugh track (not the bluegrass, the bluegrass was great).  I could forgive Natalie Portman for anything (because she is supremely attractive).  I could forgive a lot of things, but I'm not gonna.  It was just bad.  The acting. The interpretation of the story.  Character development.  The sexual tension. The release of said tension.  This is Hollywood hubris at it's best.  To be fair everyone worked very hard, and with a different script and a different director this cast could have made one of the greatest movies ever (I have a deep respect for so many actors involved in this movie), and Cold Mountain is a nice vehicle (most of the nice parts of the movie were where Minghella left the book alone), but it just didn't happen.  Donald Sutherland was very good along with James Gammon and Giovanni Ribisi.  Romania was pretty. Cold Mountain however, was just plain bad."

","I had to write a review for this film after I saw it last night and read some of the comments of people trying to classify the displeasure of this film go down to wfmitchell's post)). I don't fit any any of those classification. The other classification that needs to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it was not good. I found the film to be booring and forced. My wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law.<br/><br/>Speaking of Law, it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much.<br/><br/>As far as the movie, it took a long time for it to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in it's ending. What was interesting, is that I did not know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife ""this isn't going to be another English Patient is it?"" It absolutely was.<br/><br/>As far as the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply ""dumb"". It was forced, it was unbelievable, it was silly and it was dumb. (After the battle I looked at my wife and asked ""was that just dumb?"" to which she vigorously nodded her head).<br/><br/>The only bright point in the film was the performance of Zellweger. The role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walk, her mannerisms and esp. her little quips (my favorite: ""If you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other""), she was able to create an almost cartoon-like character who did her job extremely well.<br/><br/>I simply did not like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it (or the English Patient for that matter). I suspect you could categorize them in one category: 1) Soap opera fans"

","Critics are falling over themselves within the Weinstein's Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based.  Minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this ""civil-war love story"".  Are they kidding?  After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate. Who cares?  Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day.  Rarely has a performance screamed of ""look at me, I'm acting"" smugness.  Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin.  Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become obscure.  Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time.

And with a cast of amazing supporting actors, including the likes of Phillip Seymor Hoffman and Giovanni Rabissi. How could anyone not love this movie? Simple, it was sold to you. You were not expected to buy it or believe. It was a bad soap opera on wheels rolling into a ravine. True, this movie had its moments.

There was not a single redeeming quality about the plot of this movie. It started out depressing, got more depressing, looked up for 1 day in movie time, then it got REALLY depressing. Living in the South, I've heard stories all my life about how terrible things were back then, about how there was no real government for a long time there, and there were constant murders and lynchings surrounding the war.

","My mother told me that I would probably not like ""Cold Mountain"", because the love story in it, the romantic part would be too big for a male audience. But I have nothing against a nice romantic part, as long as it does not get corny or is filled up with bad clichés. ""Cold Mountain"" does not.<br/><br/>The focus of this movie is war. Every scene seems to be connected with the civil war and like ""Saving Private Ryan"" showed us the cruel nature or World War II, ""Cold Mountain"" shows the cruel nature of any war, led by human fate and desire.<br/><br/>The battle scene at the beginning makes ourselves think: why should anyone go voluntary to war? Jude Law's character refuses to go and he deserts. Now, it is like the Greek story of Odysseus. He needs to go through a strange scenery and country and of course the military is hunting him because of his desertion.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we see Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger back home at the plantation. This part could become a true cliché, but it does not, because the audience needs a refuge of the war. It is quit peacefull, until the war strikes there, too. But in fact, the civil war did not elide any part of the country or any person at all. Everyone gets tortured, psychically or physically. Or both like the Jude Law character.<br/><br/>I liked ""Cold Mountain"" because of its universal message about war. What is war? This movie does not say yes or no to one party, it just shows the nature of war and how it horrors. No way out.<br/><br/>Another positive point was the work of the director of photography, John Seale. He gives them all an epic touch. Director and writer Anthony Minghella did nothing wrong and I found it almost surprising that ""Cold Mountain"", a movie with no Best Picture nomination at the annual Academy Awards is in fact such an essential war movie that contains without any doubts to the best of his genre.<br/><br/>The actors are also very well. Law, Kidman, Zellweger and Ray Winstone. They are all great and there is no negative comment for them.<br/><br/>Finally, ""Cold Mountain"" does of course use a good-and-bad scheme, but the realistic environment and the refusing of an happy-ending make it to a very fine production."

","I was really excited about seeing ""Cold Mountain"". Alas, like most movies I'm really excited about seeing, it was a letdown! Were it not for that miraculous invention called a DVD, I think I would've put my head through the monitor, I was so bored!<br/><br/>I closely watched Kidman and Law when they meet because their characters are supposedly ""destined"" for each other. Yet Law's face showed anything but dumb-struck love, while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we don't get it, cornball banjos mark her every entrance), and so over the top, it was all I could do not to laugh! Ironically, her performance serves to highlight just how stiff-as-a-board the leads are.<br/><br/>Ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. More perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as Ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for Negroes (as they're politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for all of Ruby's practicality, when she dispatches Ada's ""evil"" rooster, that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens!<br/><br/>By the time her beloved finally returns, Ada doesn't need him or anyone else -- which is the big joke! Indeed, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her real intimacy is with Ruby, who has turned Ada into an Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, as they left Inman behind?<br/><br/>I doubt that Minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an anti-Bush movie. Inman tells us he is ""like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie"", and Ada's father says ""I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument"". These ""observations"" are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the South's economy, the reasons for the War were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was ""a lie"" (in fact, most in the rank-and-file were indifferent to it). For filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious.<br/><br/>Structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are miscast, and have zero chemistry! The script is little more than half-baked dialog, and an egregious bunch of clichés and banalities. ""Small moments like a bag of diamonds?"" Ugh!"

It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect, too, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. There was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek. Are we to believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used them. Tweezers, too; I mean, what's with those eyebrows? She looked absolutely mean!<br/><br/>The love story was implausible. She only went over to the guy because someone told her that he had said he thought she was cute. So, she goes over to tease him, then flirts with him a couple more times, and suddenly this is a love on a par with Odysseus and Penelope?

","Cold Mountain alternates between the stories of Nicole Kidman, waiting at home for her sweetheart to return from the civil war, and Jude Law, her sweetheart trying to find his way back to her. For conflict we have a rather nasty band of home guard who race around killing deserters... But Jude Law is a deserter... oh no! Run, Jude, run!<br/><br/>Another period tragedy masquerading as romance adapted from a famous novel by Anthony Minghella. This time its a sweethearts separated by the civil war ""tell me a tale"" story. The plot is Mills and Boone / Midday Melodrama, but so exquisitely filmed with such an exquisite soundtrack that we hardly notice. It maintains a sombre tone throughout, and goes for tears almost non-stop.<br/><br/>I've pinned down the fatal flaw with the film. I felt that Kidman and Law had zero chemistry: that the film worked, but when the two finally met up, it felt wrong, like they were two separate satellites, individually fine, but there was nothing between them. Its built into the structure of the movie. The two hardly know each other before he goes off to war: they kiss, she gives him a photo and speaks in a poor southern accent, and that's it. Then they spend the entire movie not sharing the screen. They have their completely separate story-lines: him at war, and then journeying back to her; her at home waiting for him. So by the time they finally meet, we have gotten to know them both as independent from each other - and somehow this fits. Which is why it seems wrong once they're together. And there's the fact that Kidman is an ICE QUEEN!<br/><br/>She's becoming increasingly cold and distant - and looking more and more like Vivien Leigh. If she's not careful, she may just end up like Vivien. Her career is in danger of disappearing if she doesn't come back down to earth, experience the real world and real people again.<br/><br/>For a female protagonist in this film we needed somebody who the audience could associate with, imprint themselves on - instead we have someone with only relevance to her insulated celluloid world than to us, the audience. She's like a porcelain doll: elegant, but nothing to do with reality.<br/><br/>Zellweger is a definite scene-stealing highlight. A unique, vibrant character - almost a broad character, but not a 2D character.<br/><br/>5/10. Everything about its look is 10/10 stuff. Superb cinematography, great performances from Jude Law, albeit iffy southern accents right the way through, and despite the fact that I did not like Kidman at all in this, I enjoyed it, but its flawed, to my mind, by the lack of a chemistry, and Nicole Kidman's unwelcoming, mannered persona."

I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said Minghella had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie-going public to give them a great film.

I will never be taken in by a Minghella project again. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the praise Hollywood heaps upon his head. It must be that no one in Hollywood reads anymore. This movie bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego must know no bounds, and if he didn't like the book, then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone.

Much too old for the part, she lapses between Australian twang and Southern drawl to basically nil effect. We simply don't care about Ada as portrayed by the now familiar Kidman twitches. <br/><br/>Renee Zellweger makes amends for Kidman stealing the Oscar that should have been hers for Chicago by stealing Kidman's film from under her. Its not much of an achievement, given that La Kidman seems to be asleep for most of the film.<br/><br/>Amongst the mugging supporting cast, Giovanni Ribisi stands out, incomprehensibly decked out as Theda Bara with a beard.<br/><br/>It may go on to triumph at the Oscars, but that will be small consolation to people suckered into seeing a sterile, boring film."

","Loosely based on Homer's 'Odyssey', 'Cold Mountain' tells the story of the final days of the American Civil War, and one man's struggle to get home. Unfortunately, it's also a world where the heroes, even when supposedly starving, have 21st century muscles, and the heroines all have 21st century teeth. More than that, they have 21st century values as well: I'm not saying that all southerners were slave-owning bigots, but the film establishes very early on where it's coming from, where the hero shows, in the very first scene, what was surely very unusual courtesy from a southerner to a black man, while shortly afterwards the heroine declares her happiness to be away from slaves, though without specifying the nature of her objection. Which means, of course, that the film offers no insights into how white people, viewed as having the highest moral character in their own community, could have fought a war ultimately for the purpose of the right to enslave others. Meanwhile, the various foes who stand in the path of a happy ending are all depicted as evil and venal, in contrast to the nobility and modernity of the sympathetic characters.

","American cinema was once very much enamoured of the Civil War. The silent era produced the world's first blockbuster with Birth of a Nation. Then the classic era gave us its crowning achievement in Gone with the Wind. But since then Civil War pictures have been few and far between. That period has to some extent fallen out of favour as a cultural touchstone, and there has of course been widespread condemnation of the overt racism of the former movie and the general of-its-timeness of the latter. Now, with a more realistic approach towards the horrors of conflict and oddly enough a British rather than American production, we finally have another great Civil War epic for our times in Cold Mountain.<br/><br/>Adapted from the popular novel by Charles Frazier, Cold Mountain is an epic that is made vast through its succinct storytelling. The background to the romance between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman is communicated to us with pure images and mere fragments of dialogue. The characters and where they came from is rarely stated overtly, and it seems more natural that way, as if we're watching life pass by before us. In keeping with this director Anthony Minghella (who also adapted the screenplay) often keeps his camera high and distant, although he's not afraid to put us right within the action at times, allowing the liveliness of a character's performance to push the camera away or their calmness to draw it in. His wide-open shots show off the landscape at its finest (Romania often standing in for North Carolina, but this doesn't matter; it looks wonderful), showing off the changeless beauty which surrounds the misery and bloodshed.<br/><br/>The cast of Cold Mountain gives us some fine examples of non-American actors playing Americans, not that you would know for how well Nicole Kidman and Jude Law master the dialect. That lilting Southern States accent rarely sounds very serious to an outsider, but Jude Law manages to bring a strong dignity to the part of Inman. Irishman Brendan Gleeson is excellent as always, and his authentic fiddle-playing is a bonus. Best of the bona fide Americans is Renee Zellwegger. She's massively theatrical, but she gives us just the sort of larger-than-life supporting character the movie needs. She plays the role with life and likability, and she is deep and genuine when it's needed too.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain is, above all things, a powerful romance. There's a sweeping, Odyssey feel to Inman's journey, and a burning idealism to the love story that some might regard as old-fashioned despite the movie's modern take upon warfare. And funnily enough those earlier movies – Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind – weren't overly romantic tales. Cold Mountain is, in a way, more achingly human; a beautiful picture, full of the balance between great evil and great kindness. It's a worthy and far less flawed successor to those Civil War epics of past generations, and it's a real shame it never got quite the reception it deserved."

","""Cold Mountain"" is a grand old-style, satisfyingly catch-you-up-in-the-sweep-of-emotions/resistance-is-futile Hollywood epic, whose primary difference from ""Gone With the Wind"" is that the actresses get to flash some tasteful T & A and use a four-letter word more vulgar than ""damn"" about manure.  <br/><br/>Perforce it can only be a hurried ""scenes from"" the engrossing novel which puts Penelope and Odysseus amidst the Civil War where author Charles Frazier added irony to Homer as Ada/Penelope first has to (metaphorically) learn to weave as she keeps suitors and other dangers at bay and Inman/Odysseus is not a hero but barely survives as a deserter to face parallel trials on the way home.  <br/><br/>The book at least includes a map so readers can trace Inman's lengthy Odyssey, but the movie unfortunately opts out of that 1940's-style even as it follows other conventions of the genre, particularly as seen through John Seale's beautiful cinematography from the fog of war to the fog of snow. <br/><br/>
While producers Miramax are technically not a major studio, their casting is part of what puts this in the grand Hollywood tradition. <br/><br/>
Even under dirt and mussed hair, Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the mostly stunningly beautiful human beings on the planet --and it's a pretty safe bet that they'll be entered in MTV's ""Best Film Kiss of 2003""--yet they almost don't stand out amidst an attractive cameo cast with the likes of Natalie Portman, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi, Charlie Hunnam, with Ray Winstone as the villain, etc.  It was almost startling to see Eileen Atkins's mountain woman as the first non-pretty or handsome character actor. Renée Zellweger gets to chew the scenery as an over-the-top Ma Kettle, but her comic relief is enjoyable. <br/><br/>While the complex production design, from battles to farms to log cabins, creates whole environments, ""Ada""'s wardrobes must be pretty huge to fit all those beautiful dresses; it was only in the last days of poverty of the war that she actually had to repeat wearing one.  <br/><br/>A good deal of the credit for the irresistibility of the movie is the music, especially T. Bone Burnett's Americana and Jack White's Americana-sounding selections, and I would have preferred even more of those and a bit less of Gabriel Yared's score. Allison Krauss's singing is especially evocative in enveloping the audience in the mood and themes, in ""The Scarlet Tide"" and closing with Sting's ""You Will Be My Ain True Love"", which is a shoo-in for an Oscar nom. <br/><br/>There was a credited dialect coach, but I found the Southern accents bland. And none of the quibbles really matter."

","Cold mountain is a film that addresses big issues like romance, friendship and the harsh effects of war. It shows these things in a very open and raw way. The film's best thing that it has going for it is the excellent performances by the A list cast. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and she turns in a great performance as Ada. Jude Law also stars as Ada's love interest, even though he rarely shares the screen with Kidman, the majority of the film focuses on them living apart longing to see one another again. And that journey to return to each other is really what makes the romance great here. We also have Renee Zellweger. This is the performance that earned her an academy award. Zellweger is wonderful here, she plays a very blunt, country girl that helps out Ada with the farm. The movie's best acted moments are by Zellweger. She truly makes the viewer feel the raw emotion in her performance. The script is very well written. I love how it isn't melodramatic but it still manages to create emotion. Seeing these characters and the tragic events they go through will make you care deeply for them. But it isn't just that they go through junk, it's how they survive and the connections they have in one another. That's really what Cold Mountain is all about. It's about connections with people and learning how to keep going. 8/10. I recommend this one!"

","Another tiresome bore from Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on these big bloated super-productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes.<br/><br/>The story centers on Inman (a somnambulent Jude Law), who goes off to the Civil War having just barely started a sort-of romance with Nicole Kidman, a Preacher's Daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town.  The story cuts back and forth between Inman's trials and tribulations at war (which is, guess what boys and girls? HELL!!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations back at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring).  Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get it back into shape after Kidman's saintly Daddy dies of Inconvenient Character Disease.  Zellwegger acts all squinty and bossy in that Granny Clampett kind of way, dispensing enough Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of Touched By An Angel.<br/><br/>This film is, quite simply, excruciating.

","In 1860s North Carolina, the daughter of a recently-deceased Reverend awaits a handsome carpenter's return from war, unaware that he was wounded after several violent battles with the Yankees and deserted his troop; meanwhile, with no means of support, she takes in a female ranch-hand to help transpose her bedraggled farm. Director Anthony Minghella, who also adapted the screenplay from Charles Frazier's book, shows a masterly tableaux feel for wartime savagery, and his openings moments of battle are vivid, acrid, and powerful. The unconsummated love story between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law doesn't work as well, mainly due to the past-and-present story structure but also because of the casting, which fails to come off. Kidman seems too womanly for this role--too alert and capable and grown-up--so it doesn't quite wash (in the dramatic sense) for her to be pining after a young man after just one goodbye kiss (and why did she pick him in the first place? we've already been told she could have any man she wanted); Law, who overdoes his performance with too much emphasis on his haunted stare, is a really odd choice to play a Southern American left alienated by wartime; Oscar winner Renée Zellweger comes into the picture at just the right time and, though her accent doesn't completely convince, she gives the proceedings a little spirit. Minghella treats this scenario with great care, and he triumphs with small, individual scenes (such as the slaves hiding in the cornfield with their basket of eggs, the rotting corncobs on the stalk, the drift of the first winter snow), but he loses his way intermittently (mostly with the extraneous story threads, such as the one with the preacher about to kill a slave because ""she's got my bastard in her belly!""). The howlers in the script are not gingerly trotted out--the whole film, with its pluses and minuses, is unashamedly forthright and unsubtle.

","Cold Mountain is seriously over-rated and over-blown. It would be improved by losing an hour, and from this viewer's standpoint, by losing the entire 2-1/2 hours. It is s l o w, utterly predictable and irritating. Neither Nicole Kidman nor Jude Law make convincing Southerners and, though she won an Academy Award for her role, Renee Zellweger is less believable than either of them. For obvious reasons, Cold Mountain reminded me of Gone with the Wind, another Civil War story that seemed to this movie-goer to last longer than the war itself. Though the earlier movie belonged to the romantic fiction category and this one pretends to be more realistic, they are alike in seeking to capture (as does Tolstoy's War and Peace) history through the stories of fictional characters. Tolstoy, of course, produced a truly great novel which no film maker has yet brought successfully to the screen. In its time, Gone with the Wind was an extremely successful movie from a box office standpoint and won many awards which, in this reviewer's opinion, were totally undeserved. It was based on a very bad though quite popular novel. As a novel, Cold Mountain is better than Gone with the Wind though that isn't saying much. As a movie, it also won more awards than it deserved but it fell short of the success the makers hoped for and may have expected. Gone with the Wind is proof of the adage that no one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American people. Cold Mountain is less dramatic proof of the same adage. It didn't make its producers rich but it didn't exactly make them poor either. Crimes against art often pay very well."

To begin with Nicole Kidman's heavy makeup in the beginning of the movie would probably have had her branded as a prostitute in those days. Also, she was miscast and her acting was terrible. Jude Law tried, but again he along with the rest of the (mis)cast never evoked any emotion in me. Rene Zelweiger's acting was convincing, but reminiscent of Granny Clampett in the Beverly Hillbillies. The characters were one dimensional and even Natalie Portman's scene did little to arouse any emotion in me. Donald Sutherland was the best actor in the movie and he was gone during the first half hour!! The script was terrible and laden with clichés from the characters to the dialogue. Even when Inman and Ada meet again, a scene that shouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, it left me cold, as did his death at the end. I just didn't care because these characters and actors never invited me into their world. If you want to see a movie with good acting and a realistic view of the Civil War stick to Glory or Gone with the Wind. Don't waste your time on this sterile tale."

","Are you seriously kidding me? This movie got Oscar nominated for what? After watching this I thought someone was pulling my leg. Lets start off with some facts. This is a civil war movie filmed in Europe. Totally inexcusable. The location was enough to make this movie doomed. But no instead we get a LONG drawn out movie where Jude Law ""Inman"" dies at the end after watching him live through every sort of situation imaginable he gets into a talking duel with Cold Mountains ""Billy the Kid"" and slowly dies. Come on! How cliche is this? Not only was the end of the movie pathetic it was anti climatic. What a waste of an opportunity. You had all the makings of a good movie and all the necessary characters early on, instead the script calls to kill everyone off slowly throughout the movie. The art of good script writing is dead. To many movies like this. Yes war is bad and people die, why not show us the smart ones who live through it and how they did it.<br/><br/>Now lets not get me wrong Jude Law does a good job trying to be southern but I can't get over he is from England! The producer of this movie needs his head examined filming a Civil War movie in Europe with an English lead actor. Nichole Kidman does a good job but she just remains way to clean compared to the supporting cast and it stands out, she looks out of place even when they try to ""dirty"" her. Things like this and the completely depressing pathetic ending not to mention the overly long movie run time make this just not a very good film.<br/><br/>Movies with bad endings are always easy to spot. They never get much public support. The reason is simple people DO NOT like to be depressed. That is why I was so hesitant about Cold Mountain. I kept hearing Oscar Nomination but no big push by the public for it. Some things never change. Maybe one day these producers and directors will learn that people really do enjoy good, smart movies about redemption, hope and happiness. Not sappy tragedies. There is a reason Shakespeare is only brought up in literature class and Cold Mountain was named ""Cold Mountain"". Sometimes its obvious, what a waste of time."

","""Cold Mountain"" (2003) tries to be The Odyssey told during the Civil War - the story of a man on his way home to his eternal love and all the obstacles and tribulations he faces. There a lot to admire in CM - Anthony Minghella sure knows how to make a good-looking film with great views and impressive cinematography. This and his previous films, ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" are the good examples of his craft. The war scene in the beginning of the film is powerful and violent but I could not help thinking of the opening scene of 'Saving Private Ryan' which had set the standards for all following war films for shooting the super violent and realistic combat scenes. I did not read the book, so I can not comment on what parts were left out but the love story between Inman (Law) and Ada (Kidman) did not touch me very much. I am not sure if it has to do with the story itself or with the performances of two main characters but they were overshadowed by the supporting characters played by Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, and Giovanni Ribisi. Some of them had only few minutes of screen time but their characters are interesting and alive. Renee Zellweger received all possible awards last year for her turn as Ruby, funny looking but strong, energetic and independent woman who had helped the helpless and lonely Ada to manage her farm after her father died. I liked the character but I was not too impressed by Zellweger's performance. I think she had overplayed and made Ruby too grotesque. I've seen four Oscar nominated performances from last year and at least two were much better than Renee Zellweger.<br/><br/>There is a very frank love scene between Law and Kidman in the end. It is the well made scene but too beautiful considering that two lovers went through the nightmares of war, starvation, disease, and the lack of any decent conditions.

","This is my first comment on an IMDb page. Interesting idea. I suppose it is possible to be a ""spoiler"" for a three yr old film, so be warned. In fact I won't rent or see a film without knowing beforehand if the plot and acting are plausible. There is nothing particularly surprising or startling about film plot twits because most of them are taken from previous works or are a contrivance that contradicts logic. My purpose in reading literature and viewing movies is to see if authors and directors can extract accurate lessons from reality or history and apply them in a rational yet artistic ways as a means of teaching life lessons, reflecting in some believable way the ironies of fate.<br/><br/>Mr. Minghella and his Editor cut this film up quite badly and left a lot of speculation hanging in mid air. Yes I'm going to have to read the novel to find what the author intended.<br/><br/>The scene of the attack by Teague and Home Guard on the Swangers left me baffled. What all these location people, dialecticians, stunt men, historians and advisers don't know about North Carolinians could fill another book. Perhaps it is unwise to contradict a determined director when he has a specific story in mind.<br/><br/>Five known enemies on horseback do not openly approach a mountain home occupied by three men (southern boys are men at 12yrs in that time), all armed and probably very well armed with ""souvenir"" battlefield pickups of the period. They boys would have brought home their muskets at the very least. Teague's marauders would have had to attack by stealth at night to gain sway over the Swanger household and even they they would have lost one or two men. An open approach in daylight would have ended their careers as ""guardsmen"", with perhaps one or two wounded and soon dispatched. That entire scene is nonsensical in the way it played out and spoiled the movie for me from that point on. Imagine four guns hidden and barricaded against five in the open. Wow! What a short film that was.<br/><br/>The final denouement at Cold Mountain with the death of Inman was equally disappointing. This is a silly ending that says Inman learned nothing with all his battle experience and in fact forgot the lessons learned in dealing with Teague a few moments before. In fact this is exactly the kind of false moral that ideologues frequently inject into fiction, making it non-believable. When you chase down a man on horseback you need not catch up right away, especially tracking in snow. Let him tire out a while. Firstly you pick up Teague's repeating Spencer rifle, not a revolver with only one or two shots left. Then get into a position to shoot the horse out from under the fleeing murderer. Then wound him from long range repeatedly. Then leave him to freeze. Nature is your ally in this case. Mingella's notion that you negotiate with a ruthless torturer and try to convince him to go home peacefully after committing mass murder is plainly idiotic. This story should have had a happy ending with good triumphant over evil.<br/><br/>In fact it is standard repetitive nauseating practice for screen writers to engage in amateur psychological (crackpot Freudian) speculation that war ruins men and violence even in the name of freedom and decency is inherently evil. Experience and history teaches us differently yet the beat goes on.<br/><br/>I think a masterful film with much more authentic sensibilities could have been made from this material. Imagine having to construct a town in Romania. What was that about? There are no unspoiled wilderness scenes in the south? I lived for several years in Kentucky and Tennessee. Georgia and Alabama as well. I have hunted and hiked over the Smokies and traveled across both states extensively. There are hundreds of thousands of unspoiled acres of land and many very authentic ancient villages, cabins and farms scattered all over the South. Civil War reenactors abound all over the South. Men who would gladly volunteer to help make an authentic film.<br/><br/>Many of these kinds of logistical location decisions, such as travel to Romania to ""rent the army"", are made as much for travel and vacation opportunities and social opportunities as much as budget considerations.<br/><br/>Well, that's all I have to say about this until I read the original novel and find out what the author really had in mind.<br/><br/>Will"

","The movie amazingly displays the time period of the Civil War, showing the great scene of the giant explosion that started the Battle of Crater in part of Siege of Petersburg as the opening scene into the movie. Just with this horrific scene of the war, it brought me the feelings of terror and the visions of the war that I could never imagine. It got me absorbed into the movie quickly. Throughout the movie, it provided us the hardships that the main characters, as well as the people that lived through the war, had to survive in. The film not only conveyed one perspective during these terrifying times, it showed us a woman's point of view and what they had endured when the men had to live for war. Additionally, the film portrayed the scenes of the war very well with appropriate attire and choice of music. The director, Anthony Minghella gave the realities of the battles that men were forced to face, for instance, some of the Yankee soldiers were treated brutality. Nevertheless, this film is originally on two lovers (Inman and Ada) that longed for another and hoped to reunite since the Civil War brought them apart.It's a tragic story that both Ada and Inman only have memories of each other to rely on. Also, in the film there were symbols displayed to foreshadow the outcomes of the couples. It was very interesting to connect the dots and predict the outcomes, which I was not expecting. <br/><br/>Briefly, the movie overall was excellent. Not only did it showed the battles that one could not imagine except to those who experienced war. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman both played their character very well. Law portrayed as Inman, a young man that was very considerate and shy that lived in Cold Mountain (NC) while Kidman was Ada that was forced to mature as her father died. This movie had made a great impact on me and I would highly recommend this, however, to those who are very emotional be prepare to cry."

","Actually I had major doubts about watching this movie, but when I saw the trailer, I though that it was going to be awesome. Unfortunately the trailer contained ALL the best scenes from this extremely long movie! I wasn't aware of that & naively thought, the movie could offer me something more.<br/><br/>What I totally hated is that there was ONLY ONE battle scene in the movie!!! The one which was going on for something like 5 minutes & was shown in the trailer! Yep, no more battle scenes for the entire 2 & half hour movie about the civil war! What the hell? Is Miramax in such bad financial state? Couldn't it have afforded battle scenes or what?<br/><br/>Apparently most of the money was spent on the actors' salaries. Yeah, money well spent, since most actors in this movie couldn't do the most important thing - portray credible characters! Yeah, they were all wonderful at moaning, whining, crying & expressing different emotions. But did they manage to make us viewers believe that depicted characters could have existed in real? NO! The acting was very emotional in the beginning & got simply pathetic by the end of the flick. The only one, who's done her job well was Renee Zellweger!!! Her acting was awesome & it was the ONLY thing I enjoyed about Cold Mountain!!!<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book, which I haven't read, so maybe I ain't gonna be very fair. But to me the story seemed to be quite sappy. It featured some goofs & stupid plot lines. It would be OK, if the actors were able to play believably, but they couldn't & all the flaws became evident to the viewers.<br/><br/>Maybe the direction is to be blamed on such far-fetched performance. The movie focuses too much on emotions, but it sometimes doesn't make sense. Apparently, the idea was to show the misery of civil citizens, who suffered the terrible consequences of war. The director failed to do this. The main character is running through the woods & swamps occasionally coming across some civil personages, who are mostly weird & don't meet sympathy from viewers.<br/><br/>To sum up, the flick appeared a far-fetched, pathetic,unpatriotic, cheap anti-war crap to me. And if to be honest, I felt some compassion towards the characters in the beginning, but by the end of it I could care less, because of terrible direction & over-acting. The movie has some clear anti-war trend, but it seems ludicrous, cause the war itself wasn't even shown well enough .<br/><br/>According to the trailer, it was gonna be an uplifting patriotic film with vivid breathtaking battle scenes. In real, it sucked. I got punk'd. But I guess, it was my fault. I should have read the book at first.<br/><br/>P.S.: Harvey what Oscar award are you talking about?

Nicole Kidman's southern belle is just too glamorous for the Civil War (the South went through hard times and then LOST, remember?).  Jude Law is okay. But the worst performance easily is Renee Zellweger's.  She wasn't believable for 5 seconds as the mountain girl who helps Nicole.  Even the ever-reliable Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a preacher whose role is such a cliche in the film that I wanted to walk out of the theatre, I really did. The whole ""Marry Me, Marry Me"" thing that was shown in the theatrical trailer was so fake!  Aaargh!  It's too late to get my money back!<br/><br/>The worst part is, Renee Zellweger is a very talented actress, but she is completely unconvincing here.  Yet she's the odds-on favorite for this year's Best Supporting Actress award.  If she wins, this will be the film she's remembered for!  Aaargh!  I truly hope this film gets the same ""shut out"" treatment that the awful ""Gangs of New York"" got last year.

The cynicism of this type of film-making, throwing in as many sops to the Oscar voters as possible (a bit of 'hard-hitting' cruelty to lend a spurious air of seriousness, a Philip Seymour Hoffman 'character' role, etc), shows sheer contempt for the audience.

I can't blame the director for the ending, that's the author's contrivance, but that's what it is, utterly predictable, hokey and contrived.

"elinmagdalena","4","4","6","5 September 2010"," Fails structure wise.
","The decision to tell this story in flashbacks for much of its beginning does not work to it's advantage as a film. Since I have not read the book, I am not sure how the author structured it to begin with. But flashbacks are always tricky to work with, it has to be done in the right way. Patricularly in films you have to set up the story and characters before you begin throwing flashbacks at the audience.<br/><br/>That's my major complaint about ""Cold Mountian"". We get thrown into a love story without first knowing the people it involves, so why should we care? There are some good scenes scattered here and there, and it's a beautiful film to watch; wonderful landscapes, detailed, pretty clothes and attractive people. And the war is portrayed in a respectful manner I guess. Yet, I cannot feel anything for the main characters. It's not that I'm not moved by some scenes, but it's never about their love, it's more about the circumstances of war, and the more interesting character of Ruby.<br/><br/>It moves way to quickly, especially in the beginning, for the mood and the care to set in. It feels like a whole 30 minutes or more is missing from the setup. I'm sure the story works better in the book, but it does not hold together as a film. It gets boring as soon as it stops portraying war and goes for the main love story. Might have been better as a mini series.<br/><br/>In short: A love story seldom works if you don't care about the lovers. And ""Cold Mountian"" does not give their lovers a chance."
"velene","Null","4","6","14 February 2009"," a masterpiece in my eyes
","Many people have their share of disagreements with the film, and I perfectly understand that Cold Mountain is one of those films which is bound to divide viewers in their opinions simply because; of the familiar cast, the historical backgrounds and proportions, and the whole grandeur in which the whole film is played on.<br/><br/>For me however, one of gems that this film offers is a gritty humbleness for which it deals with the issue. On one hand, the film, with its bevy of Southern accents, farming days and use of the American Civil War as its background, could have easily strayed far away from the development of its characters and their emotional turmoil. However, it kept true to the heart of its characters. What I love about this film is that each and every single scene is pivotal to its characters or plot. Each landscape, each dialogue, to me meant something, and that kept me hooked onto the film IN SPITE of its pace (which some might call slow).<br/><br/>Given that, the performances that the ensemble of actors gave was the best I've seen in awhile. The accents were believable, but what was remarkable was the soulfulness of each and every one of them. For a while in the beginning of the film Nicole Kidman's acting was very familiar to her delivery in films like Moulin Rouge, Australia, Fur where she relies a lot on artifice. But gradually, as her character became a recluse I must say she gave an extremely impressive performance and it's a pity she did not get an Oscar nomination for this. For the actors that did; Renee Zellweger aced a character that could easily have been one-dimensional but which she tackled with a lot of emotional depth and genuine empathy, which made Ruby one of the best things about the film. Jude Law gives a very poignant and thoughtful performance that really juxtaposes against most of the other males on display here. I appreciate his emotional dilemma and the brutality with which he tackles the character with sometimes, which makes Inman a character with his own flaws.<br/><br/>The string of familiar faces who adorn various points in the film e.g. Natalie Portman and Cillian Murphy kind of made this film more universal for me. It seemed like a project that did not set out just for awards, and divide-and-conquer film mogul wars, but something which all the actors really empathised with.<br/><br/>Cinematography was brilliant. The one thing that may hamper the film is how subjective it all really is. Initially, I thought that the film could have dealt more with Ada's loss in the end. After pondering about it though, I decided to come up with this theory- the moments with which she spent away from Inman was already spent reconciling with her loss through Ruby, etc. Her goodbye was already in the works, just like the many days she spent obsessing over the image in the well and considering its various outcomes. Such that her final meeting was really reconciling possibility with reality.<br/><br/>This is a highly meaningful film, if anything."
"jackjack-2","2","4","6","1 October 2005"," mostly fiction, historically inaccurate
","One would think that the setting of this movie was in Kansas with Quantrills Raiders and the Jayhawkers, not North Carolina. This movie is full of brutal atrocities that never happened in North Carolina and to some extent not during the Civil War.<br/><br/>For example is the rogue Southern militia rounding up deserters and punishing all they believed helped them. Deserters were not executed by the militia as depicted in this movie. They were turned over to the nearest Souther Army units and then sent back to their units where they were court martialed and executed as example in their own units.<br/><br/>Another example was the incursion of a Union patrol into the North Carolina mountains in 1864. That did not happen but members of this patrol attempt to rape a widow with a baby. Never happened. One of the atrocities that didn't occur during the Civil War was rape. The entire scene was unreal. A patrol might scavenge for food but the soldiers would have most respectful to the woman, particularly since she had a baby. They would have been solicitous of her welfare.<br/><br/>And then when the widow escapes from the soldiers, she finds a rifle that did not exist in the Civil War and shoots a naked soldier running for his life in the back. Pure nonsense.<br/><br/>Then the Southern deserter has the horses of the Union patrol available to ride to his destination but instead of using the horses he continues walking across the mountains. Could he be that stupid? Nicole Kidman was completely miscast in this movie like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Even her costumes are too well tailored for a mountain girl.And her acting left a lot to be desired. Renee Zelwigger fit her part perfectly which was that of a homely mountain girl.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie didn't bother with the facts. It was much more interested in titillating its viewers with sex and violence and any success it had was in doing that."

","I have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since I've seen it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I have long forgotten the main story line - the relationship between Kidman and Law, that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me. I cried for about two hours straight after wards. <br/><br/>It had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. I was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am glad I watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. <br/><br/>The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that I'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least). <br/><br/>I recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield."
"armintamzarian-1","10","4","6","24 January 2005"," ""Cold Mountain"" - A Technical Review
","Adapted from the Charles Frazier novel, and a poignant study of love prevailing over distance, time, and war, Cold Mountain (2003 Miramax Films) tears a romance asunder by means of the Civil War.<br/><br/>Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) and his beautiful and loving daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) move from Charlotte to the community of Cold Mountain, North Carolina just before the War Between the States. Ada subsequently meets and falls in love with Inman (Jude Law), a local laborer and soon-to-be Confederate soldier. Inman is sent to the front lines as his relationship with Ada is only beginning, and, soon after their relocation, Reverend Monroe passes away, leaving Ada to care for herself. Much to the dismay of her neighbors, Ada is unable to take care of both herself and the Monroe's property. When it seems as if the situation could not worsen, Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) arrives and restores the Monroe estate and Ada. Inman meanwhile escapes from a military hospital, deserting his country and its cause, to return to Ada, to whom he has been writing and from whom he has been receiving letters. The movie relates Inman's journey home and also chronicles the difficulties that both Ada and Cold Mountain experience in the absence of all of its able-bodied men.<br/><br/>Virtually every aspect of Cold Mountain is effective in contributing to the movie's success as a whole. Casting is excellent. Each actor fits his or her role quite well  there are very few times in the movie that the audience is reminded that this is a production by professional storytellers. Scenery is unquestionably one of Cold Mountain's fortes; sweeping panoramic shots of picturesque landscapes characterize the movie's cinematographic establishment of setting. Along the same lines, the movie's setting (both time and location) compliments the central theme of romance exceptionally. Cold Mountain's use of Civil War-era Appalachia for a backdrop plays on the nostalgia of the audience perfectly. The tempo of the movie is another of its strengths. At no point is the viewer bored  constant plot twists abound and new characters appear often, yet the observer commands a comprehensive understanding of the tale at all times. To top it off, Cold Mountain successfully utilizes an oft-ignored component of cinema: music. The musical score does its job modestly, enhancing the different elements of the film, but it rises to the task when called upon.<br/><br/>First-rate casting, outstanding cinematic work, and a plot that is both captivating and moving provide for an extraordinary movie. Cold Mountain relates a saga of romance and undying love while exploiting the historic sentiments of its viewers."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Bulwer-Lytton is often parodied for his long, tortuous sentences. But he was more influential in inventing a specific form of the novel, a usually lowbrow form in its modern incarnations. This form is based on the journey of a man to reunite with his love, someone who he has only slightly seen but was ""fated"" to love. Usually there is a class disparity. The passion is enhanced by the stress of uncomfortable world events which test both lovers. The woman is placed in situations where she discovers nature and the man has a grueling, episodic journey. The episodes in the Lytton originals were based on the esoteric philosophy of the time and included at least one Magus and one siren.<br/><br/>Mark Twain ""Americanized"" this form in ""Huck Finn,"" where the sex was removed and replaced with something more abstract. I mention this because Philip Seymour Hoffman's character is so clearly based on the actor from Huck Finn. It is the only well situated work -- acting that knows what it is and where it came from -- in this film.<br/><br/>George Lucas took a cinematic form of Twain's model as colored by westerns and placed it in a mystical context. I bring this up because our goat lady is so clearly derived from Yoda. It is so different from Hoffman's self-awareness it jar-jars.<br/><br/>One of the two sirens in this case is Natalie Portman -- also from ""Star Wars"" -- whose acting lessons are beginning to take. But we have yet a third directorial stance: more direct and straight. It almost seems that each actor was able to decide what their movie was to be like.<br/><br/>Lytton's form, or Twain's or Lucas' can work if there is a constancy, if there is a continuous spinning of the threads that make the fabric of the world we will momentarily inhabit. Minghella's interest is elsewhere, in a mistaken trust in the power of characters. He would have failed by himself, but we can blame all this on the Harry Cohen of the day: Harvey Weinstein. He's not the _most_ barbaric mind in Hollywood, but probably the most powerful barbarian there. His blunt interest in chasing the Oscars is what shows, and why he screwed around so much with the narrative and directorial stance.<br/><br/>Fortunately, no one died for this misadventure, but the now intelligent Ms Kidman is surely hurt as she is forced to redo her ""Far and Away"" faces.<br/><br/>Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3 -- has some interesting elements"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","9","6","11","23 January 2007"," You know it's an epic when...
","... it spans across 2½ hours, stars a wide-ranging montage of Hollywood stars, features unspeakably picturesque shots, evokes dramatic comparisons of 'Gone with the Wind Redux' and, more than anything, scored over seven Oscar nods with the Academy. 'Cold Mountain' boasts of all of the aforementioned accolades, although it is not usually hailed by critics or fans, possibly because this swelly dramatic Civial War set-up means treading down a road we've all been down before.<br/><br/>Although there is perhaps not much novelty in Anthony Minghella's long epic, the end result is much better than it ought to be. Two things I feel compelled to put forth about this film: 1, how curiously low my expectations were seeing the underwhelming preview and a less-than-favourite cast of mine  only to be completely floored by a fantastic film and 2) how it is perhaps the only film I felt an urge to rewind and rewatch immediately after the end credits had started rolling. Now, I have many favourite films, but none have evoked this particular desire and as the cynic I am, I never thought I'd experience an overwhelming thing like that. This speaks volumes for me.<br/><br/>The very core of 'Cold Mountain' is how absence makes the heart grow fonder. We see how awkward fleeting moments between the quiet, reserved Inman (Jude Law) and the rich preacher's daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) turn into something quite profound and layered when the former is called to fight against the yankees in the Civil War. Through narrative letters, Ada communicates her longing and love for the soldier who finally decides to desert and head home to Cold Mountain to see her, not really knowing her but being swept away in the idea of his lover. While Inman embarks on a Homeric odyssey of varying degrees of humanity and desperation, Ada is at a loss as how to run a farm at home.<br/><br/>You will be pressed to find a film that more strongly illustrates the dehumanizing effects of war on individuals and communities, even though it is a popular theme in movies. The difference between 'Cold Mountain' and heavy classics such as 'The Deep Hunter', 'Apocalypse Now' and more is that here we find a sweet core of love, and the story is infinitely brighter because of it. The screen is awash with dramatic lushly green hills, rivers, mountains and picturesque cottages and cabin logs filtered through almost unspeakably beautiful cinematography that fleets across the world with apt tracking shots. The costumework is equally impressive, capturing the bruised grace of the era as well as the gritty tragedies of war.<br/><br/>As far as cast is concerned, I was skeptic to see Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Nicole Kidman in the same picture and expected polarised under- and over-acting. I was mostly wrong, for Nicole Kidman gives the best performance in her career as Ada Monroe with pure raw, intense emotional transparency. Jude Law, by contrast, is horribly wooden and botches through emotional scenes. Natalie Portman is not in the film for long, so there is no harm done. Every remaining actor is thankfully heartwrenching and apt in their respective roles, including a bold Renee Zellwegger as the unsinkakle hands-on-hips labourer who comes to help Ada with her decaying farm. She rightfully won an Academy Award for her performance.<br/><br/>'Cold Mountain' is a perfect narrative with a brilliantly and patiently unfolding story, as is Minghella's style. Its only flaw, as I see it, is its inherently Oscar-baiting nature. But then again, it's a Hollywood epic about the civil war so it is presumably difficult not to fall into this trap. All I know is that it is so intense and touching that it fully trumps any film I have seen for the past months.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","In the months before the civil war, Ada Monroe moves to Cold Mountain, North Carolina with her father and meets Inman briefly before he goes to war. They fall for each other in this brief period and she writes to him constantly.  Injured in a major attack he receives a letter from her that her father is dead and she needs him to return.  He steals away from the hospital despite risk of being shot as a deserter.  At Cold Mountain, Ada gets the help of Ruby Thewes to run her farm and try to get by without a man.<br/><br/>The trailer had failed to grab me and the mixed reviews hadn't exactly got me rushing into my local cinema, however a wet and cold morning helped me decide that it was a better bet than the January sales!  The film opens well with a great battle sequence that leads to flashbacks to show how Ada and Inman's romance began.  At this point the film stutters because the brief interaction between the two was not strong enough to get me totally behind Inman's quest to return to her.  If the whole film had relied on this then it would have been a problem - however it manages to keep moving as a story of the impact of war rather than a love story.<br/><br/>The two strands of this tale work well as separates and the film seems to know this and doesn't labour the romance too much during the body of the film, preferring instead to let the stories work in their own right. Towards the end the film relies heavily on the audience caring about Ada and Inman, however this just about manages to work because I cared about them as individuals even if their love was something that hadn't been made real to me.<br/><br/>The cast risk mockery with them having to all do accents that don't come naturally to them.  Law is very strong and he holds the attention as our eyes on the story.  Kidman is very good but she doesn't physically change as her emotional change would require.  Zellweger was a bit full on for my tastes but her character does help liven up her side of the story. Sutherland is good and the support cast of characters met alone the road includes Winstone, Gleeson, Hoffman, Ribisi and Portman - each of who does more than simply make an `oh look it's ..' appearance.<br/><br/>Overall this was not as strong as it could have been because the film can't manage to develop a convincing enough bond between Inman and Ada.  Without this parts of the story stutter but what works regardless is Inman's journey though a country torn apart by war and Ada's struggle of women of the time left behind by the men who went off to die."

","I went into this film thinking I wasn't going to like it, but hoping to be surprised, but this, much like the film, ended up being bleak and hopeless. But don't get me wrong, Minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion.  The acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, even though Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film.  The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot.<br/><br/>However, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to Minghella and his adaptation.  The film is so utterly bleak it makes for what I consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film I didn't have the time to emotionally invest, or hadn't recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. Overall the ""Cold Mountain"" almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film, as all I remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters."

Both sides had concrete and heart-felt convictions to the last man.

Read a book, people!<br/><br/>Hollywood's obsession with antichristian themes is annoyingly prevailant these days, but here we have a blatant case of malicious slander against anything related to church, even though the moral influences of christians in general played an enormous role in America's growth and stability, and particularly in Abe Lincoln's resolve to follow moral issues rather than political ones in fighting the Civil War, to the ongoing benefit of African-Americans and the United States overall.

The movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one. However, I found the message to be a bad one: not surprising these days in Hollywood. In this story, ""Inman"" (Jude Law) deserts the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He's also getting disillusioned with war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars??!)<br/><br/>Yet, in this film of course, all of that is perfectly acceptable. Then again, what Liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the U.S. military?? To add to their left-wing slant, they portray a vigilante-like posse going after deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. Well, in the world of films, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good.....and only Liberals would portray deserters as heroes."

","I do not know the novel. So, the admiration for the work of Anthony Mingella is high. Not only for the option for Romania for few scenes, but for a seductive, admirable film, an inspired love story and a moving war story. All is fascinating in the case of Cold Mountain. The outdoors, the performances for each character,, the humor and, sure, especially, Renee Zellweger. Short, a beautiful film. And little more because it escapes from the cage of sentimentalism, using a sentimental story for a large and precise perspective about a special world."

","Bloodiest. Chick. Flick. Ever. This movie is quite good. Book is better, but of course, when isn't it? Could watch this movie over and over again. Great bonus points from my girlfriend for that. I really don't mind, though. What guy doesn't love a good war flick, right? Additionally, however, this movie gives a guy a chance to look at emotions, very raw, and not feel like he's less of man because of it. Emotions, especially in their rawest state, are what make life worth living. And this movie allows that. And you can always plead that you just enjoy the blood and guts if you want to later... Rocky, Shawshank Redemption, Unforgiven, Mystic River, Man on Fire... All of these movies do the same thing that Cold Mountain does: explore all the raw emotion in life, simplify all the complexities of life, and allow the viewer to brush it off as just enjoying a good flick."
"eastbergholt2002","8","4","7","11 February 2007"," Good Movie: Variable Acting
","I watched Cold Mountain and the English Patient again this weekend. The former is a Civil War melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he barely knows. Both films were lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella who does an exceptional job. Although, Cold Mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.<br/><br/>Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had Kristin Scott Thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after one kiss. As an actress Kidman has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and Law's love interest. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. Kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. Michele Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement.<br/><br/>Renee Zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent movie in the Odysseus role, but played his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London/Southern villain.<br/><br/>During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. However if you watch BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill everyone is articulate. Maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment."
"dierregi","4","4","7","17 November 2006"," Depressing tale in frozen scenario
","Much has been said about the implausibility of the romance between the Jude Law and the Nicole Kidman characters, but personally I do not find their idealistic passion unbelievable. Actually, the fact that they barely know each other adds to the credibility of their long-term, long-distance relationship. Love at first sight does occur, and mad passion usually burns in the early stages of a relationship, when one does not know the other well. Then you have mystery fueled by desire, hope and expectations.<br/><br/>Therefore I do not object to Inman and Ada passion. What I object to, is the fact that Ada is quite too old to be taken seriously as a passionate virgin. When Kidman played this part she was 36, which is more the age for a mature spinster. Besides, Jude Law is five years younger than Kidman and it does show. Basically, I wonder why the part of Ada did not go to a younger actress. Kidman looks fantastic for her age and she is a beautiful woman, but this part called for a girl. Portman, who has a supporting role, would have been perfect for the lead.<br/><br/>Another thing I object to is the artificiality of the whole set-up. This movie is corny sentimental while trying to sell itself as a great tragedy. Each situation is blatantly staged for maximum cheap thrills; from the opening battle, carefully shot so as to generate horror and disgust and to convey the idea that war is unreasonable, to the sadistic torturing and killing of Ada's neighbor family, to the obligatory sex scene between the two leads, artfully shot, so as to show parts of their tonic bodies floating in honey-colored light.<br/><br/>Minghella is pressing hard to make us reach for the handkerchiefs, but his Ada is no Scarlet O'Hara, and the final result is gloomy and depressing rather than heartbreaking. The movie sits stills in its frozen scenario, the only warmth coming from Renee Zelwegger, who deservedly got an Oscar for her performance."

","''Cold Mountain'' is a very dramatic movie, that goes through the days of the American Civil War. With a cast full of celebrities like Jude Law,Nicole Kidman,Renée Zellweger,Philip Seymour Hoffman,Natalie Portman among others, this film was adapted, because it is a novel by Charles Frazier. A nice thing I discovered, was that this movie was mostly filmed in Romania! ( Count Dracula's land)<br/><br/>Inman is a Confederate soldier thatis in love with Ada. But Inman needs to go to a war, and Ada, a city girl who moved to a farm recently, will wait for him. Ada needs the help of Ruby, a country girl, to make the farm function. Showing many difficulties of the war and the pain of many characters, I think this is a very depressing movie,specially because W. P. Inman really existed."
"tfn65125","10","4","7","29 October 2005"," Superb & haunting. One for the collection...
","Having seen this film again on DVD I can say that I enjoyed the film even more than I did at the cinema. It is atmospheric, beautifully filmed (in a beautiful part of the world) and combines a war film with a love story, with other elements thrown in. It is also important in illustrating just how grim the American Civil War was, at the front or on the 'home front'. Although Rene Zellweger won the most acclaim, I actually think Jude Law steals the acting with his portrayal of a thoroughly honourable 'southern boy' soldier torn between his desire to do his duty to his state and his love (Nicole Kidman). Where light relief is needed the brilliant and versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman provides it as 'the Reverend', not to mention Brendan Gleeson as the musician father to Rene's character - though it is never over-done. On the darker side Ray Winstone and his extremely sinister albino side-kick (Charlie Hunnam) provide the menace. Together with a superb soundtrack I would rate this as a timeless classic to be enjoyed in DVD collections for many years to come."

","This movie was good because of how it portrayed the Civil War, it wasn't boring at all. But I love it because of the way the actors portrayed their characters. Renee Zellweger was by far the star of the movie, stealing the show. Even though she is a supporting role, she plays Ruby so well, and she makes Ruby seem so real. Renee takes Ruby to so many different places in the movie. She makes Ruby a fighter at times, such as when she is kicking her father or swearing at him;and she is not afraid to make Ruby seem bossy, like when she is telling Ada all the farm chores that need to be done. She is not afraid to make Ruby seem ignorant, like when she does not understand why Ada cannot do all of the things she can. Not afraid to make her seem frightened, like when they rescue Sally; and Renee was not afraid to show Ruby's soft side, to break down all of the toughness surrounding her, such as when she starts to cry during the sequence when she tells Ada that she has ""big plans for that farm"" after Inman comes because she is afraid she is going to be made to leave; or when she starts to become emotional during her ""cloud over the land"" monologue. Renee had only played a suicidal woman, a thriller role, and several comedy roles before, and I think that this role is her most versatile and complex role yet. This is proved, since Renee won an Oscar for best supporting actress for ""Cold Mountain"" in the role of Ruby Thewes. She also pulled off a Southern accent perfectly. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law also did very well in their roles, and made their characters seem real. I don't think Nicole and Jude had that great of chemistry between them (maybe because of the age difference, Nicole=38, Jude=33)but they managed to make that seem not too apparent. This is a great film for someone looking to learn more about times of the Civil War, or for someone that just wants a good romance/action/drama/adventure flick. 10/10! :)"

This is a very good film, tragic and sad, about people with clear hearts and Can you believe in a woman who's waiting for someone she never knew well, met him only several times - but knew that something were between them that will never let her forget him - believe in her waiting for him for years? All the letters she wrote , they were for him and for herself , to help her hold on and to not lose faith. And can you believe in a man who tries to get to her to her for only one day, or maybe less, and the day which may never really come? And the way the story ended is the only one possible. Inman could kill the man who shot him in he end, even without talking to him ,and Ada could give up, find herself someone else or merely get insane, but they two have met - through the horror of war , despite people's meanness - they've met and had the happiest moments in their lives, those moments which never last forever."

","I just saw the DVD and loved it. In particular, I thought the director and Jude and Nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a film. I thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie; it managed to make it believable that Inman and Ada would walk/wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship. I thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one, but this one is it for me! Jude and Nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together."
"benc7ca","8","4","7","7 July 2004"," A Whiter Shade of Pale
","Anyone of colour in this movie is relegated to `walk-on, walk-off' or `drop dead and stay that way' roles.  Even `Gone With the Wind' managed to convey less on-screen apartheid.  This is a movie about white people and white peoples' preoccupations in a war being fought essentially over the rights of black people.  So where are they? We understand in a phrase or two that Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) owns slaves; she uses their unseen presence as an excuse to talk with Inman (Jude Law).  Then, much later, in a toss-off sentence, we understand that she freed them. How very liberal. In the beginning, all the men are happy that they got their war.  But what are they fighting for?  Later, Inman walk away from `a cause he no longer believes in', but what was that cause?  I believe that the purpose of this vagueness is to keep audience sympathy with the main characters who are fighting  this war to preserve states rights and to OWN SLAVES. A braver film maker would have conveyed these paradoxes, not been afraid of them. <br/><br/>The life of non-slave owning rural whites (and let us remember that they were the majority of the Southern population) is portrayed realistically as one of semi-literacy and hard-labour,  punctuated by  fervent and musical religious expression. The scenery is beautiful, Nicole is beautiful, Jude is beautiful (even when he's ugly).  Their relationship, founded on a few glances and even fewer words, lasts an Odyssey of time and travel.  Frankly, I believed it.  The privileged upbringing of Ada, alluded to by her dress and deportment and later on by her incompetence at anything practical, would have predisposed her to this very passionate, frustrating attachment. The type of fiction she would have read (we hear her reading `Wuthering Heights' aloud to Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) is all about intense, thwarted passion.  But Ms. Kidman is a superstar and has arrived at that place where all I can see is Nicole Kidman and not the character she wishes to portray. Ms.Zellweger finally convinces me that she can act and steals every scene in which she appears.  Jude Law is soon to arrive at that superstar category where he can only be `Jude Law', but thank God, he isn't there yet. He's wonderful.<br/><br/>The opening battle sequence is justifiably famous and will be the new benchmark for period war filming.<br/><br/>Let me mention the music in this movie which is a true highlight.  Powerful, evocative and, for anyone who isn't familiar with Sacred Harp (Fasola), a revelation.<br/><br/>The book( and I urge everyone to read it) was a wonderful read BUT the movie is not the book.  Judge the movie as a separate, independent work.  I have no patience with people who cry `But the book was so different'.  Of course the book is different; it's a different medium. If anyone is at all interested in the period, I would suggest they read `The Civil War Diaries of Mary Chestnut', a work of non-fiction written by someone who was there and at the very top of the social heap. Her take on the slavery question is very interesting."

","Romance tales are not my cup of tea, but sometimes we do what we have to and go see them anyway. My wife had read the novel and wanted to see the film, so I went along for the Civil War scenes.<br/><br/>I am a Civil War buff. I have tromped around on battlefields, visited Lincoln sites and toured museums. I've read most of the best of what is out there to be read on the subject, and I have to say, Anothnoy Minghella admirably captured the battle scenes depicting the slaughter in the ""crater"" portion of the battle of Cold Harbor. He also displayed a deft touch with the more subtle concept that by 1864, the Confederate army were becoming increasingly disenchanted at the idea that they could win the war.Consequently, many did simply head for home, hoping that there was still a home to get to when they got there. Those are the two things Minghella did very well. That's where he earned most of the five points on the IMDb scale that I gave this film.<br/><br/>Beyond that, this movie seemed to take days to tell a story that can be summed up in three sentences. Inman (Jude Law) is fed up with the war and wants to go hone and consummate his love for Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On the way he encounters hardships, acts of courage, acts of cowardice and the like while Ada battles with the help of some unlikely allies to keep from dying herself. Finally Inman gets home, makes to love Ada, and then he dies.<br/><br/>Jude Law turned in a credible performance as the soldiers' soldier, Inman. Renee Zellweger was entertaining as Ada's friend and companion (lover?) Ruby Thewes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman turned in a nice performance as the cad, Rev. Veasey. Otherwise the performances were certainly not horrible; the cast was solid and portrayed the broad brush characters they were given to portray with reliable predictability. As for Nicole Kidman, I never for a moment believed that she was on the brink of starvation after her father (portrayed with a kind of bemused indifference by Donald Suterland) died. People on the brink of starvation are not perfectly groomed with meticulously combed hair, fluorescent white teeth and not a callous on her hands. I suppose it's not her fault that that the director and make-up people were unable to suppress her natural beauty, but she never looked to be suffering from anything more than mild discomfort. As is often the case with ""Hollywood"" productions, the people are just a little too pretty to be believed.<br/><br/>The whole purpose of the movie seemed to be to get to the torrid love scene between Inman and Ada, followed hard by his death. I hope the journey was worth it for Inman; it certainly wasn't for me."

","I am from NC and was intrigued when I first heard of this movie. First, because it was based on a novel by a first time author. How amazing to score such a huge first success on your rookie novel. It also interested me that much of the story is set in Cold Mountain, which is an area near Asheville, NC (only a few hours from here). The other item that got my attention is that part of the story is based on true accounts of a member of Charles Frasier's family that did desert during the war and walked many miles home.<br/><br/>With all that said - I finally watched the movie not knowing much else what to expect. Needless to say, it has a horribly tragic ending. I'm not sure I saw that coming. There are some very raunchy scenes that rightly have this as an 'R' rating - notably the scene where the women trap Inman and his buddy and turn the deserters in. I also found the role of the corrupt preacher very offensive - but when does Hollywood every portray clergy in a positive light, so no surprise there.<br/><br/>But the love story is very haunting and you can't help but be drawn into a love so strong that a man would go to the lengths he does to be reunited with Ada. Zellweger's performance deserves all the accolades she received.<br/><br/>I think my final analysis is that the movie is a very raw depiction of human nature - both the worst and the best of it."

","This movie is one of those that was built up just a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I did like it - but it was 2 and a half hours and some of it just didn't seem to flow as well as I thought it would.<br/><br/>The whole thing was touching and lovely, if a slight boring. To me other films that I have enjoyed (I won't list since this is about Cold Mountain, nothing else) which involved the characters falling in love and beating the odds have found two actors who have a lot of on-screen chemistry. So much that you just want to leap off of your chair and grab them and bang their heads together and you even get butterflies of frustration when things don't go that way.<br/><br/>But, Jude Law (Inman) and Nicole Kidman (Ada) just didn't give me that feeling. They're characters were too rushed it seemed and when 'that' kiss happened it was too predictable and too cheesy for a film with such a bitter under taste of death and depression.<br/><br/>The film picked up, though, I thought when Renée Zellweger was introduced as the charming Ruby Thewes. Her character had a lot of depth but you weren't bored to tears by her past but instead were intrigued into why she was the way she seemed but at the same time you just enjoyed her on-screen time. And also when Phillip Seymour Hoffman took up the role as the priest with his roving eye and the love for that saw I had to admit, I thought the film was getting good.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, Ray Winstone, Emily Deschanel, Kathy Backer and Brendan Gleeson all took up the other roles in the film, however short, and in their own ways added some sort of attributes to it. In my opinion if it had just been a love saga without other characters we could look at, I would have been bored to tears (And I actually like those kinds of films.) And though the film was supposed to be focused on Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's characters love, I'm afraid to say that all my attention was on Renée Zellwegers characters development with Georgia and how their relationship would work. Screen chemistry is a must for me and if I can't see any then it's not worth the £15.99 I paid for it.<br/><br/>There were good bits in this film though, some acting (Not Jude Law's best attempt, though it has to be said he didn't have many lines), the scenery, the battle sequences and the fact we went back and forth for a while which kept my attention. What didn't keep my attention was the fact they could have told the story in 2 hours instead of boring me with other sequences that didn't need to be there.<br/><br/>The ending was predictable although it was raved about being ""very shocking and unexpected."" I felt sorry, almost, for Jude Law. He had around a page worth of lines and didn't even get a hero's ending as the poor bugger went and died. Quiet pathetically in my opinion, please don't let him die in other films. (He just can't act) I'd give it a 7/10 - and thats because I loved the Ruby character."
"kennyevans","8","3","5","5 March 2007"," Solid Acting-An Excellent Portrayal of mid 19th Century America
","I really enjoyed this film. It was about time Anthony Minghella had the success he so justly deserves after making some fairly good films throughout his career, most notably Truly Madly Deeply and the English Patient. Strange though that a thoroughly English director should take on a staunchly American subject and then also fill the main roles with a host of Non American actors. I can't vouch for the authenticity of accents, but the main characters did a fantastic job. I loved Winstone, you could even smell him, such was his menacing presence. Natalie Portman also did a great job in what was only a fleeting role in the film.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were brutal and I think well researched and recreated based on my knowledge of the American Civil War. It really plunged you into the horror and chaos of warfare in that era with muck and bullets abound.<br/><br/>The central story of Law and Kidmans character was strange in that it was based entirely on voice overs and the odd look or sigh from the characters. Apart from a brief period at both the start and the end of the film, the two just spent the time longing and it's clear that their love for each other is what helped them through their individual struggles as Law recovers from serious war injuries and Kidman tries to cope with running a farm on her own.<br/><br/>What I thought was also good about this film was the sense of suspense and empathy for the characters, built up through some excellent development. I genuinely thought Minghella might kill off any character at any given time and I was not certain that the plot would converge as it would normally. The shock shootings of Zelweggers father and the retarded musician were among the many twists and turns that kept the audience unsure of the outcome. However the plot did converge as you would expect but even then Minghella handled the reunion with 'real world' strategy and we don't see the pair running together in slow motion into an obvious camera flying around them, embrace. Instead we see what would have been more probable at the time and the period. A very conservative reunion with the bed scenes saved for later and executed very tastefully.<br/><br/>I loved the way the whole vibe of 19th century America was portrayed and it was the setting that really embedded the characters as much as anything. The hardship, the realities, everything was masterfully put together. Right down to the fantastic costumes, it was a winner for me. Zelwegger did steal the show and I couldn't help but think how rugged and weathered she looked. Either good make up, or she was hitting the drink during production! A tragic yet happy ending and for me a great film."
"extravaluejotter","4","3","5","5 September 2006"," Misery Lesson
","One of the astounding things about ""Cold Mountain"" is How Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellwegger's characters manage to keep their eyebrows in such good shape. Through famine and war, these two women maintain the most finely drawn eyebrows in movie history.<br/><br/>It says a lot that I was able to notice Kidman's and Zellwegger's eyebrows with all the tragedy, action and pathos being chucked at me. To be honest, most of it washed over me, leaving me to ponder such questions as ""Why does Jack White sound like a whiny brat on his albums when he sings very well in this movie?"" and ""Did the producers of 'My Name is Earl' cast Ethan Suplee because of his role in this film?""<br/><br/>Anthony Minghella has written and directed a hybrid of the classic Hollywood epic and the classic anti-war movie. In my mind, this fails to work because there is so little hope expressed. Inman's journey from Petersburg to his home at Cold Mountain is almost entirely depressing. He has to slog through pretty much every extreme of human cruelty on his way back to Ada, who is hardly having the time of her life at home. The film's only tiny victory is that Ada ends up with a loyal band of friends and family at the end. It's that perfect, trite, white middle-class ending, perched on the peak of a Golgotha of suffering, that made me give this film such a low score. <br/><br/>This movie would have been so much worse with a less talented cast. However, it could have been so much better with a more original script."

A wounded soldier begins his journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his love. Their love is pure, idyllic. The whole journey is also fabulous, he gets in amazing situations encountering evil and good. Meanwhile his love meets her own problems at home in the lean and dire days of the war.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. I won't comment it in detail, I am sure others did, anyway the names and nominations speak for themselves. The scenes filmed in Romania near Brasov are beautiful, although I'm sure there are differences between the Carpatians and the Appalacian Mountains. The costumes and make-ups are good, the filmmakers even manage to make the audience forget about the fact that Kidman and Zellweger are film stars. <br/><br/>This is not the usual romance story. Violent sometimes naturalistic scenes are mixed with romantic scenes. There are people, loving romantic movies, who consider it too violent at some places, others consider it too romantic. I consider it a film worth to watch, a film above the majority."

","Minghella's cold mountain is a visually stunning and dramatically great film in adapting the famous Frazier novel. There are few films that one can say covered the task of adapting a novel into a screenplay and doing it well. I can say this about this film. The story is a bout a couple that is drawn apart because the man (Law) must go fight for the south in the civil war. The woman is left in ""Cold Mountain"" with no family and little friends. Nicole Kidman gives a solid performance as the woman while Jude Law was great as the man. THe film is well-acted for the most part. Most of the supporting actors are memorable in their short parts (especially Sutherland, P.S. Hoffman, and Giovani Ribisi). The film has a beautiful score and cinematography, the highlights for me. The story is good, although moving at a pretty slow pace, it is done well. Not one I can watch over and over, but enjoyed it a lot the first time"

"teejayniles2345","10","3","5","9 March 2005"," Well worth renting - - a war movie with a heart
","My wife and I enjoyed this studio adaptation of a superior recent novel and highly recommend it to film buffs. Not everyone rates it a ""10"" but it achieves a number of commendable priorities. It conveys the rage, gore, and horror of battlefield combat with its mass confusion (not being conveyed in the present-day coverage of the Iraqi Insurgent War and Afghanistan Taliban- al Qaeda battles); also, it highlights the ambiguity of ""Support the Troops"" when their place is so desperately needed back at the homes of their loved ones. I know that purists might object about the accents of the multi-national cast. It is, however, a treat to hear the talented actress Renee Zellweger have a go at the most rambunctious and endearing character of the entire film. The film's score and end credit music are quite excellent and demonstrate something of the character of that period of U.S. culture. The director and art-scenery department also have produced a landmark depiction, meant to update some of the cultural ""imaging"" done in the classic GONE_WITH_THE_WIND. It is a great 21st Century historical epic, well grounded by the novelist Charles Frazier, who also consulted in the making of the film itself."

","I've now watched Cold Mountain twice in 24 hours. I have to say, this is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. When the film first came out, I wasn't at all tempted to view the movie. It appeared to be dull and depressing. I happened to receive the novel as a gift, and recently finished reading it. I was absolutely enchanted with the book. I've never really been impressed with movie adaptations of books. This novel was so brilliant, I felt an urge to see the visual adaptation. My oh my, I'm glad I've seen it! <br/><br/>The acting was absolutely superb. The whole cast gave believable performances that totally envelopes you with emotion. My favorite character was Inman. He didn't say much, but his body language and facial expressions spoke a thousand words. I also think the chemistry between him and Ada closely represented what was written in the book. They only kissed once before Inman went to war, so some may think it's unreasonable for them to cling to their love through three or four years of separation. We're talking about the 1860's people...sex before marriage was uncalled for. A kiss meant so much more than it does nowadays! The cinematography was stunning. Who knew that Romania was so beautiful? According to the director's commentary, scenes jump from S. Carolina, to Virgina, and then to Romainia. The transitions were seamless, and you had no idea the filming was done on two different continents. You could also understand why Inman was so drawn to Cold Mountain. Not only was it Ada, but the locale was mesmerizing. The music was entertaining and poignant. Stobrod's fiddle changed his life forever, which in turn brought him together with his daughter he neglected for so many years. The music not only affected the characters emotionally, but the viewer as well.<br/><br/>What more can I say? I am absolutely shocked. I had no idea I'd be so in love with this film. I'm an indie film type of gal, but I'm ecstatic I gave this big budget Hollywood film a chance!"

","Very enjoyable film about a southerner who gleefully goes off to battle only to find it wasn't the grand adventure he had envisioned. Sick of the carnage he takes the long road home, experiencing many rough knocks as he does. The picture bounces back and forth from 1861 to 1863 showing us the man before and after his soldiering experience. Primarily we see his relationship with a woman as it gets a rocky start and gradually forms into something permanent. Many fine performances in the movie made it memorable; I particularly liked the interplay between Ruby and Ada.

I also loved the way Mingella showed the realism in the war scenes. This movie should have won more Golden Globes than it did. Especially more that Lord of the Rings! Which I personally thought sucked. But I don't think that Cold Mountain got enough respect as it should have. Nicole, Jude, Renee, and everyone else in the movie did a wonderful job!

That's reason to pause and ponder.<br/><br/>It's an intriguing tale, very bloody at times, and it's not hard to see where it's going, but its obviousness does not deter. It has its requisite 'stacked deck' and it's not hard to see where the final comeuppance there is going to be either.<br/><br/>But in movies such as this such comeuppance is not without its price. This might be a love story, but it's also a tragic love story, and so even the scenes the audience long for must be tainted with sorrow.<br/><br/>Alison Krauss sings a couple of tunes for the soundtrack, one of which is composed by G Sumner.<br/><br/>Kidman is hardly my favourite actress or personality yet she shines here. Although she doesn't have all the classic features, Seale knew how to grasp what she has. If anyone stands out above their colleagues it is Renee who deservedly won an Oscar for her performance. But they're all good. And Law is an excellent counterpoint. And there are so many good anti-war quips in this bloody drama it's not funny.<br/><br/>Watch for a punk rocker singing hillbilly tunes.<br/><br/>Well made and infinitely more sympathetic than The English Patient from which it seems to derive theme and substance, but is it a keeper?

"Buddy-51","Null","4","8","25 July 2004"," boring, meandering soap opera
","Based on the best-selling novel by Charles Frazier, Anthony Minghella's `Cold Mountain' is, like his earlier snooze-fest, `The English Patient,' one of those highbrow historical romances that only a Motion Picture Academy member could love.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play Inman and Ada, two Southerners whose budding romance is cut short when he goes off to fight in the Civil War.  Though the two `lovers' barely know one another, she spends years pining away for him, while he, eventually, deserts the battlefield in order to get back to her.  When her minister father dies unexpectedly, Ada, who has hitherto led a very sheltered life, is forced to fend for herself on the land he left her.  Eventually joining her in that endeavor is a feisty young woman named Ruby, played with a whole host of annoying, self-conscious mannerisms by the usually reliable Renee Zellweger.<br/><br/>In ambiance and plot, `Cold Mountain' feels an awful lot like a warmed over `Gone With the Wind,' right down to the Southern-belle-forced-to-demean-herself-to-survive scenario.   The difference is that the two main characters in `Cold Mountain' are completely uninteresting as people and thoroughly unconvincing as lovers.  In a film in which the driving force is supposed to be obsessive passion, it's odd that the romance is laid out in such lukewarm and sketchy terms.  It's hard to believe that a young man would risk execution for treason trying to get back to a woman he barely knows  and it's even harder for the audience to work up much personal stake in the outcome.   Ada is like a magnet drawing Inman to her, but, for the life of us, we can't figure out the attraction.  Law does reasonably well as a sort of anti-hero version of Odysseus, but Kidman fails to score as a charisma-challenged Penelope  or Scarlett O'Hara, if you prefer. <br/><br/>Another problem with `Cold Mountain' is that it overdoses on Southern-fried cornpone and backwater moonshine.  Every time Inman or Ada turn a corner, they seem to be confronted by yet another `colorful' Southern character  be it a fornicating preacher, a clan of promiscuous hillbillies, a fiddler-playing, ne'er-do-well daddy, or even the over-the-top Ruby herself, whose way with a folksy aphorism, after some initial appeal, eventually ends up setting the teeth on edge.  The film is a strangely schizophrenic one in that, while the lead characters are underdeveloped to the point of blandness, the secondary characters are overdrawn to the point of buffoonery.  The film, after awhile, begins to resemble the casting call for an out-of-town revival of Tennessee Williams.  <br/><br/>There are a few good things about `Cold Mountain.'  It doesn't shy away from some of the more brutal aspects of war and it deals head-on with the struggles the Southerners had to undergo being on the losing side. Moreover, some of the vistas are attractive.  But, apart from a few effective moments, `Cold Mountain,' is little more than a boring, meandering, high-toned soap opera, just the kind of movie that makes Academy members sit up and take notice come nomination time (the film garnered seven nominations and one win  for Zellweger's performance).  The rest of us are more likely to just curl up and go to sleep instead."
"butrnip2","1","4","8","13 January 2004"," Should be ""Boring Mountain""
","Come on folks, give me a break.  This movie is about as interesting as<br/><br/>watching a nose bleed.  Minghella fails miserably.  Why can't we use<br/><br/>American actors for a subject matter only a true American can fully<br/><br/>understand and connect with. Like Mel Gibson in ""We Were Soldiers"",<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman and Jude Law not credible.  Additionally if I had to watch<br/><br/>Rene Zellwegger overact with that rediculously contrived character for<br/><br/>one more scene I thought I'd puke!  Everyone constantly trying to out<br/><br/>act each other in every scene (absent Jude Law). There were also way too<br/><br/>many big name cameos and well known faces; it became so distracting.<br/><br/>Probably the best way to get Saddaam Hussein to begin confessing would<br/><br/>be to tie him up and force him to watch this movie over and over again. <br/><br/>Oh, addtionally it was so obvious that the movie was not filmed in the<br/><br/>U.S..

"Gandalf35","1","6","14","28 August 2004"," Civil War accurately portrayed?
","This movie was filled with tiresome clichés dressed up as an historical portrait of the South.<br/><br/>To begin with it buys into the fallacy that the Civil War was primarily about slavery when it only became about that in the history books after the Union forces won. Some glaring historical facts support this such as the fact that Lincoln did not ""free the slaves"" until at least two years into the war and then he only freed the Southern slaves. Ulysses Grant - general of the Union forces - had slaves during the war whereas General Lee did not.<br/><br/>In the South blacks fought alongside the whites. Whereas in the North they had their own segregated regiment - ""eulogized"" in the movie ""Glory"" with Matthew Broderick - as the union men did not want to fight alongside ""darkies"".<br/><br/>The people of New York rioted and killed blacks after Lincoln's emancipation decree - somewhat accurately portrayed in the movie ""The Gangs of New York.""<br/><br/>All these facts fly in the face of the ""death to all abolitionists"" line in the movie Cold Mountain - when in fact there were many abolitionist organizations in the South. These facts fly in the face of the seeming ignorance people in the movie have as to the battle cry of the South when one says ""last time I checked the south was a direction"". As if someone in the South - who voted overwhelmingly for succession - would not understand that the war was about the independence of states and their rights. They fought against the tyranny of the North to force their will on other states simply because they had more guns. <br/><br/>Like most I am glad slavery died but let us not pretend that this was nobly achieved as the central cause behind the American Civil War - or more accurately The War of Northern Aggression."
"mrvirgo","1","6","14","22 January 2004"," Boring and Improbable
","There were too coincidences used to push the plot along; the movie was too long; the actors were clearly ""acting""; not one of the three principal actors made me forget that they were mouthing memorized lines; and the silliest and most improbable event was a minister's daughter having out-of-wedlock sex in the 1860's.  It just would never have happened in real life given the values of the era.  When will these Hollywood movie writers get a clue that some of the audience has a historical perspective? A movie has to be more than a vehicle for the politically correct ideology they wish to foist on the viewer."
"CubsandCulture","10","2","3","26 August 2018"," Old Fashioned Romance, Powerful Allegory, and Sublime Craftsmanship
","2003 was a great year for cinema and Cold Mountain towers over the the other offerings on every level. The surface layer of the film is a lush emotional romance about a a Southern Belle waiting for her Johnny Red to come back to her. Law and Kidman both are really good in their roles. Law especially gives a striking performance. I think the screenplay does a really good job handling the brief nature of the initial romantic scenes. And it is smart enough to have the characters acknowledge this aspect. It is like a updated version of Gone With The Wind.<br/><br/>But below the surface the story is a combination of a Christian morality play around Charity and a reworking of the odyssey. What I mean is Inman symbolically dies at the beginning of the film, wonders around the afterlife, crosses the river Styx, all to get back to heaven (Cold Mountain) etc. All the various colorful characters he meets, played wonderfully by a great cast, track with both a Christian concept and something from Greek mythology. I.e. The Hillbilly family are the sirens and lust. Inman (INRI) has messiah imagery attached to him, at one point he is weighed down with the sins of others, and it all adds up to an extremely powerful allegory. This is most apparently in the Sara (Portman) sequence where Inman cannot offer to take her to Cold Mountain with him because she was, to say the least, uncharitable towards a union soldier. It is all emotionally gripping stuff.<br/><br/>The cinematic craftsmanship of the film is top notch. The scope the colors in this film is extremely wide and the photography allows you to get lost in the story. The same is true for the other technical departments. The music is sublime.<br/><br/>Two quick notes: Ruby is easily the most entertaining part of this film and at least Zellweger got recognized finally by the Oscars.<br/><br/>Second: The film isn't about the civil war, the setting was selected mainly for its color and the practical aspects of a civil war (brother vs brother, friend/foe speak the same language) and because of Gone With the Wind. I don't have any idea how realistic the opening battle is but in terms of dealing with the Confederacy, despite not being really about that, this film treats it among the best I have ever seen. The Confederate cause isn't whitewashed, at least twice slavery was blatantly stated to be the confederate cause. More to the point, the home guard (allegorically the devil) is the primary source of antagonism in the film and that's the most visible part Confederacy. One can wonder if the using any war as a mere backdrop is OK for a film but here the film at least gets the main historical points across better than things like God and General."
"WubsTheFadger","8","2","3","10 March 2018"," Cold Mountain
","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, the film delivers a story that is profoundly powerful and heartbreaking. It shows us the needlessness of The Civil War and how it destroyed innocence and purity. The film shows us the drive and power of love and how it can overcome the greatest of odds. The ending is powerful and touching in so many ways.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. Jude Law delivers a stunning performance as a man who overcomes the greatest of odds. Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger also perform very well. Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Charlie Hunnam, Jack White, and Cillian Murphy all add so much to the story and the devastation of the Civil War. Natalie Portman's performance really hit home for me. She plays a woman who has lost everything and just wants hope. She is broken and torn. Her performance was stunning.<br/><br/>The pacing is a little slow, but I was completely engaged throughout the entire movie. The runtime is a little overlong.<br/><br/>Pros: Powerful and heartbreaking story, touching ending, amazing acting, Jude Law's performance, Natalie Portman and her powerful acting, and a great message about loss, love, and war<br/><br/>Cons: Some slow pacing and an overlong runtime<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8.4"
"mymtproject","10","2","3","29 November 2016"," A very good time period movie
","Most Civil War movies have a tendency to overly dramatize the war scenes and ignore the day-to-day struggle of the common people caught in the middle. Not so with Cold Mountain, a movie that explores the individual lives of a preacher's daughter, her farm hand and her lover as their world spins out of control.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger delivers a tremendous performance, while Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are strong in their roles as well. This is a movie about memory and destiny. The conclusion will leave you with conflicting emotions but there's satisfaction from a story well told.<br/><br/>I hope that producers learn from COLD MOUNTAIN and start making more era dramas that give you a connection with the characters and their times, as opposed to overly glorifying battlefield scenes. The lone battle scene in COLD MOUNTAIN was the battle of ""The Crater"" during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. It is done with attention to the facts and illustrates the battle in all it's goriness. You felt like you were right there in the thick of the smoke, dirt and blood.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie explores how the people of the 1860's coped with the savagery of their existence, how some remained in tune with their humanity and others devolved to murderous animals. <br/><br/>Just an excellent movie all the way around. I've seen it twice and will watch it again!"

Passion, in every form is portrayed throughout this film and I have been left in complete awe at how touching this film is. Heartache and desperation is also portrayed and if you have a soft spot for romance this will anchor that and really hit a nerve (in the best possible way). Slow starting perhaps for some, but after the first hour I was completely hooked, as the film ended I was left in awe and admiration for not only the storyline but the wonderful performance by ALL actors involved in this film as well as the beautiful choice of music to go alongside each chapter of the film. It's a must see and I can't recommend it enough."
"lhansen14","9","2","3","18 April 2013"," A Must See!
","First, I have to say that I fell in love with Cold Mountain from the moment the movie started. The power of Inman and Ada's relationship is apparent from the moment the two meet and their powerful connection does not fade the entire film. What is so captivating is that Inman and Ada only have a few encounters before Inman if forced to leave and fight in the Civil War. But those moments are enough and subsequently change them both forever. <br/><br/>While Inman and Ada are separated by war, each face hardships of their own. The movie focuses a lot on the effects of war on those fighting as well as those left behind. It specifically focuses on how war can affect two people in love that want nothing more than to be reunited. After being wounded in battle, Inman finds himself removed from the battlefield, but he is still not free to return to Cold Mountain, where Ada is. Inman is now a deserter and is in almost as much danger as if he had remained on the battlefield. Inman continues to fight for his life as he tries to make it back to Ada, encountering several interesting people along the way. All Inman has left are the memories of Ada and a single picture. <br/><br/>Unaware of what is going on with Inman, Ada faces struggles of her own in Cold Mountain. Her father dies, her house is falling apart, she barely has enough food or money to survive, and the town is destitute because of the war. Ada receives help from Ruby, sent to help by one of Ada's neighbors. Ruby knows how to work the farm Ada has let fall apart and is not shy about ordering Ada around. Ruby acts as a much needed comic relief to the otherwise intense and emotional parts of the film. Although the journey was not easy, Inman finally makes it back to Ada (what you wait for the entire movie!) but the couple soon faces tragedy and Ada is once again left alone. <br/><br/>I was very impressed overall by the film. The setting, scenery, and costumes all work perfectly together and are not overdone. I also really liked that the film did not feel like a Civil War movie, even though the War was a major component. The focus is more on the development of the main characters and the difficulties they face as well as the unbreakable romance between Inman and Ada. <br/><br/>Cold Mountain is a must see!!"
"manendra-lodhi","10","2","3","29 July 2012"," A brilliant display of emotions in war time with a different angle
","The film starts with the voice of Nicole kidman as ADA and the voice alone promised a lot. And to start with the complete movie I say a very nicely written screenplay and some very fine performances that I had recently seen. There were some moments in the starting when I felt sleepy but as the story progressed it started to show that it is a promising film. A girl saw a boy and both felt in love secretly with each. This might not be a new formula but was well made into a completely nice movie. The girl has to wait for the boy to return from the war. How the relationship got so close is the only part where something more had to be explored but nevertheless after that the movie picked up its pace and didn't made me feel like a time waste. Jude law is always good no doubt but I had never seen Nicole kidman performing so nicely. A completely new side had been explored in the movie regarding what a girl would do when she is waiting for someone in a war time. Many movies related to war been made and there are only a few who touch a completely different aspect and this movie made me remember of The Pianist. The things going on in the girl's life while waiting for her man were good. Another aspect was a number of twists at all times. The way they pictured the difficulties on his way home were very nice. Also when Ruby got in the movie everything seemed much smarter and interesting. She rightfully got the academy award for the best supportive role.<br/><br/>VERDICT: ""A must watch film."""
"bkoganbing","8","2","3","23 July 2012"," Invested with nobility
","Anthony Minghella knew something of the Civil War in locating his story in North Carolina. Of all the states that seceded to form the Confederacy, North Carolina may have been the most reluctant. It's Governor Zebulon Vance who is mentioned in the story dragged his feet in giving help to the Confederate government and its citizens save for the east where the plantations were never really embraced the Southern cause. Jude Law's attitude about fighting for a rich man to own slaves was not at all uncommon in North Carolina.<br/><br/>Which after a well staged recreation of the siege at Petersburg which when the north blew up the Confederate defenses by tunneling under and mining them with explosives did not have the desired result, Law decides he's sick of war and just quits to go back to his sweetheart Nicole Kidman on Cold Mountain. In the meantime Nicole is having her own problems just keeping body, soul, and property together on the small family farm. So the film proceeds along two tracks of Law's journey and Kidman's problems.<br/><br/>The stronger track for me is clearly Kidman and her problems. Renee Zellweger won a Best Supporting Actress Award for playing a young white trash woman who Kidman takes on for just board and feed to help with the farm. Without her help the farm's survival would be problematic although she has to put up with some pithy observation as well. Zellweger invests this simple character with so many dimensions her performance even without the Oscar capping it is her personal best. Kidman while not to the plantation manor born being the daughter of minister Donald Sutherland also is not used to manual farm labor. She grows in character as the film progresses.<br/><br/>As for Law and Kidman as well he has to worry about the Home guard, a self appointed group of militia taking over because official government machinery has broken down. Probably before the war they were slave catchers, now they hunt deserters and those who aid and abet them. Giovanni Ribisi also scores well as a young man in the home guard who declined to serve at places like Petersburg. Ribisi is some piece of work.<br/><br/>Besides Zellweger's Oscar, Cold Mountain was deservedly nominated for a flock of other Oscars. It's a marvelous look at the decline of the Confederacy, a cause that simply would not die quietly. In its own way the survivors are invested with the same kind of nobility that the Gone With The Wind cast was."
"supernova_painkiller","9","2","3","15 April 2011"," i really loved it, despite the main couple in the beginning...
","Don't misunderstand me, I liked the acting, but I thought that relationship between Inman and Ada was so sudden, unexplored and poorly developed that I could understand anyone who'd give up in the first 20 min of film (although I disapprove this). <br/><br/>But anyone that did not it, had surely (like myself) a wonderful surprise. While separated, Inman and Ada are such powerful characters. Unfortunately they just work as a couple at the very ending of the movie, when there's not much left.<br/><br/>I like Jude Law very much, but I think (like many people do) that he finds hard sometimes to flee the stereotype that he's got over the years (it happens when you watch Alfie and thinks - Oh no, he is playing ""Jude Law""* again), but in this movie he stood still and cried out loud ""Yes I can!"" ""I can be someone else, I have talent"". Yes, he does, and moreover playing a difficult character which gives you no clue of his heart and behavior, and you see that the actor have to build it up from nothing, he did. And could give us his own mark (believe he has one, he just needs to show it more times). Well-deserved nomination. Two lines he said that I won't forget: ""I marry you, I marry you, I marry you"" and (when Ada asks him to turn his back so she could undress and he so decided and sweetly says...) ""No, I will not"". Oh I almost forgot the scene when he gets shot, coughing blood (to die), was so well-done!<br/><br/>Kidman (who I don't like) did a good job, her character was more interesting when alone or in company of a great Zewegger, which she spent most part of the movie. But I still think that she could do some more. I see her in the movie and think ""only if she had done more about acting she could have been convincing"", her role was a real good and easy one, she threw away a great opportunity.<br/><br/>René was superb. Althoug in the beginning I thought ""she is far-fetched"", but along the movie be she knew how to, covertly, do it right. I don't much to say, for it is impeccable.<br/><br/>What as good surprise I had with Portman, Jack White, Philip and the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>This movie, amongst The Talented Ripley, made me feel very interested about Minghella's work, the next to be seen (by me) is the English patient. The photography was amazing, how could it not receive a nomination? (that's why I think that the Academy is a crap) Well directed, well acted, good screenplay, although it was confused at first...<br/><br/>So, I truly recommend this one, but be patient and watch it until the end, and not just give up at the first half hour. Give it a chance, it will give you a sweet surprise.<br/><br/>* When I say ""playing Jude Law again"" I do not mean the person ('cause, obviously, I don't know him), I mean the actor."

","Cold Mountain is an incredible movie. One of the best of 2003. It is second on my top 10 list of the year. The acting and the writing is excellent. The editing of the first 40 minutes is brilliantly done. The way Inman is flashing back to his meetings with Ada. Ada also recalling some moments with Inman. You really believe in the passion this couple has for if not each other for the idea of it when the their world is falling apart. The scene Jude Law has with Eileen Atkins is incredibly moving and deeply felt. Renee Zellweger is great in the role of Ruby. She is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Any scene with Sally is extremely well done. Kidman also gives an excellent perforamnce. She really inhabits the character and here ""there will be a reckoning"" kine is nailed. Cold Mountain has the best gun fight probably since High Noon. The action in the movie is consistently raw and shocking. The most underrated movie of the 2000's."
"Danusha_Goska","5","2","3","19 July 2007"," War-Unleashed Sadism, and a Brilliant Jude Law
","""Cold Mountain""'s leads are two of the most beautiful stars of all time: Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. In addition to being peacocks, their love lives are tabloid staples.<br/><br/>It is set in the South during the Civil War, a time we inevitably associate with one of the epic romances of all time, ""Gone with the Wind."" Given the leads and the setting, not to mention the movie posters and the cover of the DVD box, you may come to this movie expecting an epic romance.<br/><br/>What I'll remember from this movie, though, are the literally gut-churning scenes of war-unleashed sadism, carnage, and torture.<br/><br/>I love Kathy Baker; she is an angelic presence in this film. And she is tortured on camera. It's a brief scene, but I wish I had never seen it.<br/><br/>There's one scene of war atrocity after another: a beautiful and defenseless young mother menaced by Yankee soldiers who mean to rape her, steal her food, and murder her baby; a vicious albino (Albinos get such a bad rap; Hollywood should be ashamed) dancing on a board crushing a woman's neck, while her loved ones are shot in front of her eyes; soldiers blowing up other soldiers and then being trapped in the crater they created; a man attempting to murder the slave he impregnated.<br/><br/>I'm willing to watch disturbing material if it comes together to educate me, move me, make me a better person...that didn't happen here. I was just cringing, holding my gut, waiting for the next unbearable scene.<br/><br/>That's because ""Cold Mountain"" is episodic. Characters appear, speak high falutin', literary sounding monologues, and then disappear, often after being killed in some horribly diabolical way.<br/><br/>These various characters' stories don't intertwine, or lead up to a climax where they all come together.<br/><br/>You have to admire the very high production values of ""Cold Mountain."" It is beautiful to look at, but not in any new way. It's probably hard not to photograph snow covered mountains beautifully. I won't see snow covered mountains in a new way after watching ""Cold Mountain."" The cast is out of this world, and, in a way, that, combined with the film's episodicity and its off putting scenes of torture, took away from the film's impact, for me. Oh, look, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman! Oh, look, there's Natalie Portman! I half expected Charles Lane to make an appearance.<br/><br/>I hope I can forget the torture scenes, and remember Jude Law's magnificent performance. He is just so, so good here: he is as believable as a taciturn, All American, homespun, working man of great integrity as Gary Cooper was as ""Sargeant York."" Law's performance deserves to have had a much more coherent movie around it."

","In my opinion, this is a very touching story. Inman's life was full of frustrations after he met Ada. Many people sacrificed themselves to save more people. And in the story end, Inman departed from the world forever. Just because want to save Ada, his lover. Does everybody can sacrifice for their lovers? Maybe some of the people will just say""Of course!"", but when they are in danger, they'll first run away! Also, some will say""Let me think about this question!"" They are not very sure about it. However, Inman does. He can put his lovers and his life in the same place.This is a very precious sentiment. P.S. I like Nicole Kidman a lot. She's very beautiful and graceful."

","As I look out on today's popular movies, it's hard to find some that have a good plot that balances out well with the action sequences. The problem with movies like Dead Mans chest, is that they try to incorporate too much action sequences, and leave behind an tangled mess of a plot. Cold Mountain seems to hit the jackpot. It can keep people who are just interested in the sex or violence in it, as well as captivating those who like intimate plots and a beautiful storyline. Cold Mountain seems to have all the right aspects. Cold Mountain does have it's weaker moments, but they are stronger than most movies highest. What appears to be a weakness to me, is that Nicole Kidman, who is always looking beautiful, doesn't change with the environment she is put in. She always looks perfect and like her make-up has just been done. Even when she does labor, her cheeks are still as rosy as they always were, her lipstick just as red and every hair in place. But overall, Cold Mountain is a passionate love story that hits higher on the charts than most."

I hope they make more movies like this in the future. You know before i watched this movie, had no idea about anything on the Civil War. Didn't know what treason, or the pain and agony that everyone went through. So i would just like to say that i got an educational and exiting lesson on history. There is so much drama and excitement in this movie. Also, the romance and tragedy blended to where it was depressing and joyous at the same time."

","Liking Jude Law has been elevated to the level of national pastime among my demographic. The last few movies I've seen him in, he was in his clever fop mode, and I started losing sight of why. In this movie, he was different. Spectacularly different. I never watched this movie when it came out, because I thought it was going to be sappy. It was not. The reason is Jude Law and his fierce, raw performance as the soldier dude who leaves the confederate army after coming back from the brink of death from a gunshot. He leaves to walk a thousand miles through a war zone, avoiding the home guard who want to put him back in the army. The reason he walks is Nicole Kidman, the awkward and beautiful belle he left back home in Cold Mountain, was being harassed by locals and starved by the war. She wrote him a letter telling him she needed him back.<br/><br/>It's rare when two actors can make love at first sight work on screen. These do.<br/><br/>Another reason I didn't watch it was that I have an irrational dislike for Renee Zellwegger and she got so much attention for her role, which I thought would be too precious. It was a little precious, but also was hilarious. In this very dark movie, which had me crying a bunch of times, it was a welcome bit of levity.<br/><br/>I'm glad I watched it finally. Wouldn't want to do it again soon, because of the wrenching sadness. In the ethos of this movie, there are more than two sides in a war, and none of them are good. The victims are the soldiers, the civilians, and everyone affected by the changed rules of war. ""Hey, there's a war on,"" is an excuse for a lot of sick injustice, and that doesn't ever seem to change."
"bunigirl","9","2","3","3 June 2006"," cold mountain
","Anthony Mingella has captured the reality and feeling during the civil war. Although i have never read the book, i enjoyed watching the film. It made me think from the characters point of view and what it would have felt like for them,and what they would have felt.<br/><br/>An effect which really caught my eye was how the first hour of the film was set in flashback. The dramatic change from violence in battle scenes to peace and tranquility back in cold moutain had an amazing effect on me and really caught my eye. It's as if Inman (jude law) is fighting on and on then thinking back on how life was before the war and each flashback holds more regret that Inman had signed up for the war in the first place.<br/><br/>One thing that isn't so good about this film is that it drags on in places and is really a bit to long. People don't want to sit and watch a film for 2 and a half hour straight. As a 14 year old, i am not one to sit and concentrate on a certain subject for as long as 2 and a half hours. After about an hour and a half i begin to get bored and cold mountain is a film that needs full concentration right the way through.<br/><br/>When ruby (renee zellweger) is entered into the film, it all of a sudden becomes more interesting and exciting. She manages to keep the film on a top level as she is entertaining. With renee zellweger, cold mountain would be slightly boring and highly stereotypical. I am a huge fan of renee and believe cold mountain is one of the best pieces of work she has done. Well done renee!!!!!!! Nicole Kidman plays the part of Ada very well. She is consistent through out and her acting typically fits her costume. Despite this, the chemistry between her and Inman (jude law) could have been much stronger. It seems a bit unreal that somebody would wait for four years to see the person they don't even know and only saw a few times and kissed once.<br/><br/>Overall i think this film has been wonderfully casted and directed. Despite all of the bad things i have pointed out on this review, it is expected to be mistakes in a film on this subject. It was on of the most critical moments in American history. If somebody gave you the book of cold mountain and said "" Read this book and make a film on it. "" Would you be able to make a film anywhere near the quality that Anthony Mingella has produced? It was a big ask for him and therefore i believe he has done a fantastic job."
"jordanbeaver","4","2","3","17 May 2006"," Barely Watchable for the first 30min
","This film could have been a much more reasonable 2 hours in duration, if only they had made the decision to sum up the boring first 30 minutes into a 2 minute narrative.<br/><br/>Until Zellweger appeared, I was ready to gouge my eyes out. The first clue that this was going to be a rough 154 minutes was when our main characters opened their mouths for the first time. Wow, you'd think that if you're going to shoot your film in Eastern Europe, throwing an Australian and an Englishman into your lead roles is pushing it too far. Those were, hands down, the worst attempts at southern accents I've ever heard. I really like Law and Kidman, but they just couldn't pull off 19th century Southern if they were sitting on a front porch fanning themselves while eating pecan pie and listening to a conversation about the rising costs of negros.<br/><br/>Zellweger's characterizations were great. She was a little to impolite to be a southerner, but the overall spirit she got right.<br/><br/>Hoffman's brief stint in the film was wonderful and I was ready to rate this film a 9, until he was killed off. It's too bad Hoffman doesn't weigh 40lbs less, he would make a fabulous Inman.<br/><br/>Portman provided an impeccable performance, but again, for too short a period.<br/><br/>At one point Inman mentions that it's a long way to the Blue Ridge.. unfortunately for him, he wasn't actually going to the Blue Ridge since Cold Mountain is mentioned to be in Haywood County. During the Civil War, Haywood County was much larger than present day Haywood County, but still didn't encompass any of the Blue Ridge. Of course, this may explain why the movie was so long.. Jude never stopped to ask for directions.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie just gave me a very hollow feeling. Hollow actors in the lead roles, hollow story with holes at the edges, and a hollow love story that ended in horribly done movie-kisses that looked like two large goldfish trying to swim around in too small a tank.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 9 or 10 if only they had cut it down to just the secondary characters, which were exceedingly watchable."

","This is definitely one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It had some bad critics but I don't see, why. It's about a strong love that keeps a person alive for more than 3 years. And they know both, why they want to live - to see each other again. It's told with such intensity and it speaks right to your heart. All the time, you wish that they see each other again, you feel what Inman has to endure while he wanders through the woods. The actors are brilliant: Nicole Kidman as Ada, she embodies all the things - Ada's inability to cope with the situation that Inman is gone, the situation after her Dad is dead (she doesn't know how to cook or how to lead a farm); but also Jude Law: he plays the silent Inman so well, the one who never says much, so there are many things left unsaid. Renée Zellweger even received an Oscar for her performance of the farmer girl Ruby who helps Ada to get along. I think she really deserved it. Great movie! Watch it!"

The dialog of the movie is well thought and poetic and the acting is brilliant. This movie carries high morality values. It challenges lovers who are far from each other that distance is not an excuse to cheat on your loved one. We see this through the main two characters lovers Nicole kidman and Jude Law who are presented with the opportunities to compromise, to give in to comfort zones but remain outstanding even though those that we expect high morality values from are compromising.<br/><br/>This movies really shows what loves is all about Patience , Sacrifice. I strongly recommend it if you have a distance relationship and finding it challenging to remain faithful this is the movie for you to watch."
"igmu","8","2","3","18 January 2006"," Definitely worth a look.
","I haven't seen this film for about a year, but something brought it to mind. I decided to browse the comments here and am most surprised, especially by some of the negative ones.<br/><br/>Two of the most laughable are that a) Jude Law's acting performance was very wooden and b) there are two many non-American actors in the film.<br/><br/>a) Jude Law IS one of the most wooden actors ever, and in my view is normally dreadful in all that he does. However, in this film his character, Inman, is one of the most dull individuals ever realised on film, and Law is ideally cast as the shy, boring, monosyllabic carpenter. He fitted the role perfectly.<br/><br/>b) What the critics who moan about the use of non-American actors forget is that the USA is a land of immigrants, and that the likelihood of people speaking with a not quite perfect 'southern' accent was very high in the melting pot of the 19th century. Granted, I don't suppose that there were too many Australian immigrants ;), but that shouldn't be held against Ms Kidman who does a fine job with most parts that she takes on.<br/><br/>The film itself? It is not the greatest thing since sliced bread that some people believe, neither is it the boring rubbish described by others. I found it an engrossing story that, although episodic, held my attention for the whole two and a half hours. The story was well told and visually it looked good; the only reservation I have is that of the character played by Ray Winstone, which grated somewhat.<br/><br/>Overall, well worth seeing. 8/10."
"jpschapira","8","2","3","24 September 2005"," Two Words: Anthony Minghella
","I want to talk about Anthony Minghella, a British director, and his influence and impact on American cinema. He is one of the most awarded directors of our time, and has done films that will be classics years from now or already are (now I know that I must see ""The English Patient""). But personally, it took one screening of ""Cold Mountain"" so I could realize all his qualities as a director. <br/><br/>First of all; perfect management of the actors. Jude Law is the finest example for this, if we explain that his two Oscar nominations as an actor were earned for his work in two of Minghella's pieces. Once in an interview, the director said: ""When I saw Jude Law, I didn't feel he was right for the role. I liked him, but he wasn't what I was looking for. But then, when I pictured Dickie, I couldn't imagine any face but his, so I called him"". And he was right, and Law's performance was great; so was Matt Damon's, and the portrayals of the whole cast. You'll never be disappointed in terms of cast when you watch an Anthony Minghella film. <br/><br/>This is why the man has no problem in getting the best people on the industry, if only for a few minutes appearance. I'm surprised this cast didn't even get nominated for Best Ensemble in the SAG Awards. In the course of the story, we get to meet lots of wonderful characters, played sometimes for two minutes by names like Jena Malone, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi; and larger parts by names like Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone (are you reading these names?), where Gleeson clearly stands out. <br/><br/>Continuing with actors, what I most enjoyed was when Law's character meets the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, and Nicole Kidman's meets Renée Zellweger's respectively. I enjoyed it because it was amazing to see the scenes changing and watching stars of the caliber of Law and Kidman, each of them on their own, alongside the other two, not big stars, but actors I respect and like more watching on screen. I compared the talents because Hoffman is, well, a master in acting. <br/><br/>And topic apart, Zellweger had made clear since ""Jerry Maguire"" that she urged for a deserved Oscar. Although she should have won it one or two years ago, her award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes is more than well earned. A lot of power as always; in her words, in her looks, in her way of standingShe's so confident about what she does and that makes her perfect. At last! <br/><br/>Then I can't forget the main stars. I don't really respect Nicole Kidman, but I pretend to accept her because she is considered an excellent actress by a ninety percent of the people. I can realize she changes a lot between performances. Changes everything, but forgets some very important details I will explain when I write about another of her movies; because her performance here is good, and helps the picture a lot. One thing I'll say; I keep on examining her beauty in all of her films, and I'll tell a friend of mine, again: She's not more beautiful than Katie Holmes. <br/><br/>I didn't mention before, but I thought it was understood: this is Jude Law's best performance. Every part of his performance is understood too; this was a challenge (a big one) for the actor. I'd like to compare it with Adrien Brody's in ""The Pianist"". When a character suffers the changes these both characters suffer, it needs to be expressed by the actor. Brody, I've said before, seemed inexpressive in his film, with all the beard and hair in his ruined moment. With the same beard and a lot of hair, Law excels in showing he's ruined, this becomes noticeable in the way he introduces himself to people, the way he talks to them; and that's the strength and brilliance in Law's work here.<br/><br/>From the way Law talks, we go to the screenplay, adapted by Mighella from a novel, as he did in some of his previous works. There are no hero intentions in this tale, no false words, no impossible love story. Everything is close to reality, which makes the piece a lot more powerful. In one scene, when an old lady is helping Inman (Law), she asks him: ""Why are you going to Cold Mountain?"", and he answers, almost crying: ""To find a womanAnd I barely even know her"". It's all very convincing; every moment. <br/><br/>Going back to the main point; in the sceneries, the breathtaking war scenes and everything achieved by Minghella, show the committed director he is, and how he deserved and Oscar nod with this feature. He carried on a story that talks not just about love, but about several life aspects; and a very powerful work in every sense. With a constant melancholic tone, directed by Nicole Kidman's voice, that, even in the ending, talks about good positive things, but the music and the environment of the movie makes us think negative. I believe that's something terrifying but somehow fantastic at the same time."
"lethaloption","8","2","3","17 July 2005"," Lack of relationship building early in film.
","One of the most notable criticisms is the lack of relationship building between Inman and Ada in the beginning of the film. Having not read the novel, is there a deeper explanation? I do believe that in the 1860's relationship development was much shallower than what we perceive to be necessary today (depending on how you look at it). In the film the characters seem like genuine good people. The interaction between these two early in the film certainly doesn't warrant almost getting yourself killed everyday to 'get back to her.' Maybe it's that 'in love' vibe that people get when they first flip out over someone - and it just never wore off? That seemed like the only thing that didn't make much sense about the story line."

","I hesitated to see Cold Mountain. I figured it for a heroic tragedy from an officially sanctioned Southron viewpoint in the vein of Gone With the Wind. But to my pleasant surprise Cold Mountain was very different anti-heroic and anti-war to the point that I'm surprised top see that the Bush administration allowed it in the theatres. Perhaps Cheney left no instructions.<br/><br/>Cold Wind is an ant's eye view of the Civil War's impact on the Carolina Highlanders, an everyday in the life of story of the frightening last days of the Confederacy. The Highland lads have been dragged off to fight for slaves they did not have. Many included Inman (Jude Law) have become disillusioned and have deserted the Lost Cause.

Wooed by an offensive, murderous member of the home guard, Ada is content to live off the generosity of neighbors who have little to spare. There is only hope for Inman's return; no word has been heard; postal service has deteriorated from sporadic to non-existent. Outside of die-hards in the Home-Guard freed from service at the front, most locals are praying for the cause to be lost and the end of the war.<br/><br/>Enter roughneck Ruby (Eileen Aikens) who forces Ada off her pedestal into the real world of living off the sweat of the brow and brings the farm back to productivity. Ruby came from a family dysfunctional even for its times and despite her hatred of her Pa, she saves him from capture by the Home Guard. Ruby says of the men who planned the war being lost that ""They go out into a thunderstorm; stand there till they're drenched and all they can say is 'Sh - - it's raining.'""<br/><br/>Inman's Homeward Odyssey is laden with traps: sirens, the home guard and yankee raiders.<br/><br/>Will Ada and Inman survive the tempest?

","I thought this was a beautiful and strong story with excellent performances by the entire cast. In one instance I thought believability was stretched for the sake of a dramatic moment, but forgivable for the otherwise flawless film that this is. <br/><br/>Renee Zellweger delivers what I think is her best performance. Kidman is stunning as the belle who has to learn to manage on her own. Her frustration at her upbringing which has made her a ""refined lady"" but almost useless in the harsh times the war brings comes across and really helps the viewer see her as a whole person. She easily have been a very flat character only serving to move along the plot for the others (unfortunately many female so-called leads are written that way)--but is not. <br/><br/>This film is able to pull many different emotions as the characters struggle. Since historical epics are coming around like TROY and now KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, this one is great as a short epic of the ending of the Civil War for many of the same reasons the Odyssey was of the Trojan War."
"Wonderkind","8","2","3","21 May 2005"," Minghella and his mountain
","Anthony Minghella, perhaps not a genius, but a storyteller. This film is a visual feast, the cinematography is in parts, breathtaking. Each camera angle adds to the simple message, this is not a story about the American Civil War, this is a story about love. Any person who is after realism will be sorely disappointed. Despite the constant historical references, Jude Law escaping and wandering back to Ada is something that in essence, is part of the theme of love, the theme of the beauty in love. Of course most instances are highly improbable and sometimes laughable e.g. that he can stray across a woman herding goats and be lifted by an old woman to be nurtured back to life, but what we must understand is that in film, nothing is realistic. Nothing is real. Accept that and I believe this film is incredible. So it may be designed to pull on the heartstrings, but what is cinema for if not for evoking emotion? Cold Mountain is not a masterpiece but is still a piece of art. Grudgingly, I'll accept some lines are cheesy, out of place, ridiculous, but isn't that what you want from a love story? Perhaps I am just a romantic but I found this gripping, not didn't find it long and boring, but then I enjoyed The English Patient. I'd say, definitely, this is worth watching."

The others characters are good, but i think in this movie the supporting roles are more brilliant than the leading roles for Jude Law and Nicole Kidman Natalie Portman Its Great!!!, At the same time the Renée's father make a great performance too. I cant understand why the movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the Best Picture Category, actually it was better than Master & Commander, with more places, better cinematography...I don't know.

"jack_attack69","8","2","3","4 December 2004"," Solid leads enhanced by an outstanding supporting cast.
","As Nicole Kidman walks across the screen towards Jude Law, the question remains; where is the chemistry? As solid and thoughtful both actors portray Ada and Inman individually, together their love just doesn't seem believable. Law's limited expression doesn't benefit his character's myriad of emotions, and Kidman, though slightly more realistic, conveys, at best, a weak and fragile woman lost in depression. Despite these few faults, both the leads create the tone and mood of the film to be one of despair and depression, amidst all of the feelings of love.<br/><br/>What makes Cold Mountain special is the supporting cast. Natalie Portman enrichens the screen as the wife of a soldier. While delivering her script with raw austerity, she also enhances Law's presence with her compassionate and understanding person, despite the turmoil surrounding her. Giovanni Ribisi also shines in his role, offering a believable and realistic role in the time of war.<br/><br/>But it is here that Renee Zellweger shines. The minute Ruby appears to Ada, the movie changes it's monotony and depression to one with depth and even excitement. The way Zellweger shapes Ruby's personality towards her surroundings is a stark portrayal of strong women during war. Her Oscar is only a testament to one of the most captivating and intelligent performances of the 21st Century, rivalled only by Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Cold Mountain depicts the solid leads enhanced by one of the greatest supporting cast ever to be assembled in a movie."
"pintofsmooth","9","2","3","19 October 2004"," Epic film-making of the highest caliber
","As the dust clears and the rumor mills are finally silenced, it is time to acknowledge Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain in a separate light from the tiresome and repeated scandals that surrounded its production. The film finally surfaces on both sides of the Atlantic conveniently in time for Oscar consideration, and the nods of recognition from the Academy must surely follow will be richly deserved. This is a wonderful movie, executed to perfection in both performance and direction and a fine example of epic film-making of the highest caliber.<br/><br/>The narrative tells the story of a man known simply as Inman, played by Jude Law, who deserts his position at the front of the American Civil War in order to return to Nicole Kidman's Ada, his true love who stayed behind. The story splits its concern between the two characters as Inman continues his odyssey across war torn America and Ada undergoes a transformation of her own. Both Law and Kidman are excellent in their roles but the real revelation here is Renee Zellweger, whose performance breathes new life into the movie whenever it shows signs of flagging.<br/><br/>It is a good job that the central figures do perform to the highest of their ability because the film is so packed with talent, any weak showing would be quickly overshadowed. It is hard to recall in recent times a movie that employs so many actors at the top of their game, even when playing cameo roles. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and especially Natalie Portman all threaten to steal the scenes they share with a bewildered but single minded Inman.<br/><br/>Complaints are few and minor, with the only major misjudgment occurring in an ill conceived and distastefully executed whore house scene. Some viewers may also find it hard to empathise with a romantic pairing that is given so little screen time to develop, and it is true that Inman and Ada develop very strong feelings in a short space of time. It is as Inman's hand that the explanation for this is found though as he clutches a photograph of Ada throughout. When war changes the world perspective around him, one image and one glimpse is all the motivation he needs.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain is a riveting film that remains brutally true to its source material, and though this does make for a rather relentlessly bleak experience, it is refreshing to witness a director fully in control of his craft. Minghella has produced one of the best films of the year, an achievement that deserves to be assessed apart from its accompanying gossip."

Nevertheless, the rest of the people can find it not such a great - here and there the author goes too far, and constant changes of rhythm get the audience out of their groove. In some scenes, the film amazes with its style and exility, but in the others it bores hell a lot!

To me this movie was excellent in all departments: terrific acting, epic cinematography and set design, and above all else a meaningful story. <br/><br/>As director Anthony Minghella says on the DVD commentary track, this movie is about the virus of violence, how violence is spread like a disease-the innocent have violent acts committed against them and in turn become violent themselves-. Moving away from violence toward what makes life worth living(love)is the journey that Inman is on.<br/><br/>Cudos to all involved, as well as to Charles Frazier for penning the novel that was the basis for the film.<br/><br/>In closing, a movie that deserves much more credit and praise then it has received; well-worth watching."

Nicole Kidman does not have the appearance of a sympathetic character and tried too hard in her role. Despite Ms. Kidman's performance, the movie and the rest of the actors were wonderful. I would definitely watch this movie again. This movie is more of a romance mixed in with occasional action. The one really bad part of the movie is that the role of the bad guys is deeply overplayed and too predictable. The movie would have been better if these bad guys made hardly any appearances until the end. I don't know if the position of these bad guys is historically accurate, but it did not seem very believable."

","'Cold Mountain' is a big studio epic, and a good one for a change. All elements of a successful creation of this kind are in place - a good historic theme, super-stars casting, good cinema (much was filmed in location in Romania) , and a message that is beyond the plot, and makes the film worth watching. The message is about the vanity of war, the conflict between love and man's brutality, the will of the human beings to love and survive despite the wish of their leaders to push them to war one against the other. It's an actual theme today as well, unfortunately.<br/><br/>What the viewer gets is a good cinema treatment, a superb war scene at the beginning of the film setting the background and providing Law's character motivation for the rest of the movie, and very good acting from Renée Zellweger. I was slightly disappointed by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. Each of them was good, but not at their best, and they never showed up the radiant chemistry of a true great love story as they should have. A full world of good supporting characters and solid cinematography re-create the world of the American civil war in a fresh way, despite the many other memorable film stories inspired by those times. <br/><br/>It's what you expect. Nothing less, maybe a bit more. 8 our of 10 on my personal scale."

The story is very touching. It kind of brought me back to ""Gone With The Wind"". Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are absolutely amazing in the film. Their love scene was one of the most romantic scenes that I've witnessed in a while. I would highly recommend this film. Though it does drag on a little more than I wanted.

","Cold mountain is definitely a must see movie. Set during the civil war, we see a love story between Ada and Inman. (Great cast, by the way... Kidman played a beautiful Ada and Law.. a sensitive Inman.) We also see how the lovers were separated by the war, how the war destroyed Inman's spirit and the only thing that kept him alive was his desire to get back to Ada. Ada in the meantime, had to grow up the hard way after her father died. Then enter Rene Zellweger's character, Ruby. I must admit without Ruby's character in the movie, it (the movie) would've been rather boring.<br/><br/>Ladies .... prepare a box of tissues for the ending !

"rainking_es","8","2","3","5 August 2004"," The look of Nicole Kidman...
","I didn't watch The English Patient, so I can't talk about it; but I did watch Talented Mr. Ripley and it seemed to me that Minghella  an elegant filmmaker, sober and perfectionist, and an excellent actors director. Now, Cold Mountain corroborates all those qualities. He's adapted to the big screen a classic love story set in USA's Civil War, where a refining girl (Nicole Kidman) has to  face up to poverty and to the absence of her beloved one (Jude Law), who's gone to fight in the War. The movie has two main lines: Kidman's character's evolution from a well educated and respectable girl to a farmer; and the oddyssey of Jude Law to come back to her from the battlefield.<br/><br/>Ok, the story is nothing extraordinary, there're plenty of movies in the same line (starting by that icon called Gone With The Wind); but there's only one Anthony Minghella. He looks after every detail, he lavish care every sequence, every shot. Photography is just spectacular, and so are the locations. Wardrobe and soundtrack are just nice. <br/><br/>Since Cold Mountain is based on a novel (just like Talented Ripley -and English Patient I guess-), the narrative style is rather literary, with a voice over and such well cared dialogues. Maybe Anthony Minghella's biggest defect is that he takes pleasure in every scene, in every view, in every look, and that makes his movies a little too long, and a little slow sometimes. He seems to be incapable of making a 90 minutes movie.<br/><br/>
As for the cast, well, this is the very strong point of Cold Mountain. Nicole Kidman shines so bright, and she demonstrates that her talent seems to have no limits (maybe it's nothing to do with it, but since she divorced Tom Cruise she has incredible grown as an actress, so much so that she's become the best actress from his generation). Also her beauty is remarkable, she's more beautiful now than when she was 25 or 30. No doubt she's the most memorable thing in Cold Mountain. I'm not much of a Jude Law's fan, I think he's quite unexpressive, and without many registers, but maybe a more histrionic actor wouldn't have fit the character. I don't know much about american accents, but it seems to me that Mrs. Zellweger makes a good job imitating an accent that's not her natural one (and she takes charge of the funny points in CM -that's something she sure knows how to do-). There's also an impressive team of supporting actors: Donald Sutherland, Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymour Hoffman ... a top quality cast. <br/><br/>One of the best Hollywood pictures from 2003. A wise way of spending the money from the Studios.<br/><br/>My rate: 8/10"
"5dawgz","9","2","3","31 July 2004"," A rare film where the movie is better if you've read the book ...
","Rarely is a movie improved by having read the book. Usually, whatever they do with the movie will be a disappointment if you loved the book. I love the book ""Cold Mountain"" and have read it at least 4 times. I think that it speaks to the horror of war, the wickedness of which the human species is capable, and the futility of the bloodshed better than any other book I've read. <br/><br/>I think the movie captures those feelings very well indeed. I hope I am quoting this correctly (but I'm close, anyway) -- when Inman says that he is like any other fool ""going off to war with a lie and a flag"" ... well, yeah. A lie and a flag. That IS what war is, for the most part. The battle scenes at the beginning of the film, according to those who have been witness to real battles in war, are as good or better than any battle scenes ever filmed.<br/><br/>The story is, of necessity, simplified for the purposes of the film and that's where it helped to have read the book. My husband and I were able to mentally fill in ""missing pieces."" I found that among my friends who saw the movie, those who did not first read the book thought it was okay, but didn't love it, whereas those of us who had first read the book, really LOVED the movie.<br/><br/>I also felt the casting was exceptional and that Renee Zellweger well deserved her Oscar. When I realized that she had been cast as Ruby, I was highly dubious ... but she made it work. Jude Law, who is not usually cast as a leading man, gives a super performance, for which he has received surprisingly little recognition. <br/><br/>Finally, if you love classic ""old timey"" country music, the score for this film is beautiful. As is the cinematography.<br/><br/>This is not an upbeat movie, but it wasn't an upbeat book, either. The adaptation is deeply faithful to the author's intent. It's definitely worth watching ... maybe more than once. But also, perhaps it would be worthwhile to read the book first. Great book. Fine adaptation."

","This was one of the best movies I have seen in several years. It is number one on my list of all time favorite films over some of my past favorites such as Titanic and An Officer and a Gentlemen. The love story was so believable because of the harsh realities during times of brutal war. Nicole Kidman, Jude Law and Renee Zellweger were perfect for their parts. The movie had a good balance of drama, romance and a bit of humor. My husband even liked it and he is not too into love stories. The scenery in parts of this movie was spectacular. Jude Law did an amazing job of acting. He should have won that Oscar. This movie does have some harsh war scenes so if you are too squeamish this movie may not be one of your favorites. If you can get past that, it is one of the best love stories I have ever seen."

","Well, i expected, for all the hype and Oscar nominations, an epic Civil war drama (& something with the ""magnitude"" of the ""English Patient"" given the same director). This film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't.  It's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone.<br/><br/>Anyway i thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about Jude Law, he was all right, also.  It seems Rene Z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited, feisty downhome woman with much aplomb.  Also for me it was good to see actress, Kathy Baker...someone's who's talent needs to be more recognized/acknowledged.<br/><br/>This film is worth seeing this -- i'm can't articulate why really, but maybe because it is a slice of Americana."

","Judging from the plethora of comments I've seen in the message board, there are lots of folks that loved and hated this movie. I could not have hated it, and not because I am located in the south.<br/><br/>I think that Nicole Kidman and Jude Law were perfect for these roles. The romance that the previews promised turned into a longing that I felt with every bit of the woman I am, but it didn't really disappoint me that it wasn't exactly as much a romance as I felt I was led to believe. I hadn't seen or read much about the movie before I saw it, and I'm glad. It was mostly a big surprise all around.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger may just be the actress that stole the movie, but then I think she does that with every movie she appears in. I'll say she was an addition that kept it from becoming morose, for sure. Thankfully she added a bit of wit, whimsy, down home country feelings, which are very much a part of any southern home. Her brutally honest presence in Ada's life gave a feeling of security, even when she was being sarcastic which is often. *smile*<br/><br/>The war scenes were difficult to watch and seeing the desperate men that did their best to return home only to be shot down by the home guard hurt... because even though I understand their need to encourage loyalty to the confederacy, surely they had to realize that it was quite fruitless to kill that which you needed so badly - able bodied men! I cannot understand this part of history - meaning, I do not see what benefit it gave the confederacy, and may very well have been one of the reasons the south lost that war so pitifully. So many men deserted that were shot rather than rehabilitated.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought Donald Sutherland was wonderful in his brief role, and think he always lends a classy air to any movie. The ending was bittersweet... the waiting, looking and watching, hoping and praying they both did ended differently than I'd thought it would. <br/><br/>I would buy this one and recommend it to anyone. Whether you like it or not is up to you, but I loved it and so did my husband."

","I have been waiting for the release of Cold Mountain for more than a year, and eagerly attended the first showing on opening day.  My interest was based upon the Civil War theme and my respect for Minghella, Law, Kidman and Zelwegger.  My expectations were largely met, but there were aspects of the film that came up just a little short.<br/><br/>What was great about Cold Mountain?  As Ruby (Zelwegger) would say, Number one-  the cinematography.  The initial battle scenes were astonishingly realistic and inspiring.  I have not seen such splendid reenactment since Glory (a favorite film).  Number two- the authentic costumes and set design. Number three- Jude Law's perfectly understated characterization of a war-weary Inman.  Number four- Renee Zelwegger's delightful portrayal of Ruby.  Number five- Nicole Kidman's beauty and grace.<br/><br/>All of these splendid facets made this a superior film.  There are a few small details that detracted from its greatness, and here's my short list: number one- the location shooting in Romania works 70% of the time, but the extremely high, sheer-faced and snow-capped mountains are not typical of North Carolina.  number two- the instant attraction of Inman to Ada is part of the plot but needed to be developed just a little more to make the separation more meaningful to the viewer.  number three- being no prude, I have no real objection to nude scenes but they seemed unnecessary in this Victorian-era romance.  Leigh and Gable didn't need to flash breasts and buttocks to make it clear they were about to have intercourse when Rhett swept Scarlett up the staircase in GWTW.  number four- what's with all the animal mutilation? people have to eat but for goodness sake, there's a bull sawed into pieces, a rooster head yanked off and a cute little goat's neck is slashed.  PETA members, be warned. number five (and last)- Civil War history buffs know that the vast majority of casualties at 'the crater' caused at Petersburg were African Americans but this is not evident in the opening battle scene.<br/><br/>Overall, Cold Mountain was a terrific dramatic film and certainly deserves the accolades it has received.  I cast an early set of votes for upcoming Oscars as follows:  Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay, Direction, Costume."

However, this Civil War story of romance in the midst of conflict, feels empty as soon as it ends. This film doesn't stay in one's memory for a lot longer than its 155 minutes of projection.<br/><br/>Inman and Ada love affair is a bit a bit far fetched. Not only do they come from different backgrounds, but they don't appear to have anything in common. In the South of before the Civil War, with its class distinctions, Ada and Inman wouldn't have had a chance, let alone, have the long distance love affair that seems to hold the narrative.<br/><br/>The other problem the film has is the many fake Southern accents, which is understandable when an international cast has been assembled to recreate the same Southerners that wouldn't probably understand what they're talking about. <br/><br/>After all is said and done,  Ada only gets to keep Inman's image in the tintype picture he gives her, and as another Southern heroine, Scarlet O'Hara, she will survive the tragedy and come out ahead of the game."

Nicole offers another outstanding performance along with Jude Law and Renée Zellweger in capturing the idealistic love of passion and commitment. Implicit in this movie is the insanity of war and its demeaning and cruel outcomes, particularly on women.

The movie has its share of structural problems, and may be a little longer than seems necessary, but it rarely lost my attention. I would not place this in the top echelon of end-of-the-year motion pictures, but it's certainly a successful adaptation, features numerous memorable performances (mostly by the supporting players), and is worth a post-holiday expenditure of time and money. One thing that cannot be denied is the effectiveness of the film's look. This is a gorgeous film to watch, with deserved credit given to cinematographer John Seale."

","Inman, a soldier fighting in the Confederate army is trying to get home and reunite with his loved one, Ada. Ada is left to manage Black Cove Farm all alone after the death of her father and she has no idea what to do. Seeing Ada so lonely, Sally Swanger sends a local girl named Ruby to help Ada out with the farm. Inman goes through a dangerous and violent journey westward but had to retrace his steps when he was handed over to the Home Guard by Junior. Inman ends up meeting a nice slave who feeds him as well as provide clothing and help him draw out a map of what lies ahead. As Inman continues to wander, he meets many other people along the way who aid him on his journey. Inman soon arrives at Black Cove Farm and finds the sight of Cold Mountain. The next day he finds Ada hunting turkeys and they spend the next few days together at the Cherokee village, discussing their feelings, past experiences, and their plans for the future. Inman decides to walk north to surrender to the Federalists because the war was going to end soon. <br/><br/>This movie really touched my heart because Inman had to go through such tough obstacles to get back to his loved one and through this we can see what people during the Civil War had to go through. The movie really absorbs the audience into the lives of the people who were away at war and those who were left behind, trying to desperately get rid of such horrible repercussions."

However, I watched the film which subject was a man who was a another fear which was different fro other normal war film.<br/><br/>In man makes enemies of everyone but Ada and quite a few people. I trembled to think how it would end. I think most people will watch this film as Inman and Ada side, so you will afraid of enemies you can't see. <br/><br/>In addition, I was impressed by pure romance between Ada and Inman. Their eyes which gaze at each other are enthusiastic but sad. I felt this is the true love. Also, friendship between Ada and Ruby is energetic and gives a power for us. I felt strength of women."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","6","1","1","11 March 2016"," Too many flashbacks early on; too long
","This is a film that I should like very much. It's about the Civil War...a topic of interest to me. It begins with the Battle Of The Crater, which I have visited and find fascinating. It has Jude Law at what I felt was his peak.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film is a mess...at least in the first third. It is, perhaps, the best example of the overuse of flashbacks that I have ever seen. It makes the plot confusing for the first third of the film. This film could have been done in normal progression, or with limited flashbacks, and it would have been much better. The director needs a lobotomy! Fortunately, once into the middle of the picture, the flashbacks end and it's a rather straight...but long...story (154 minutes). Honestly, the film could have been a 2 hour film without losing anything of substance.<br/><br/>Jude Law is excellent here as the Confederate soldier who deserts the war after being seriously injured in the Battle Of The Crater. In my view, this is Law's best performance in film.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman...well, to be frank, I just don't connect with her acting. There were times here that I thought she was fairly good, but there were other times I found her performance shallow. Here she plays the young Charleston woman who moves to Cold Mountain and falls in love with Jude Law.<br/><br/>There's been some criticism of Renée Zellweger's acting here as a young sorta backwoods-type woman who helps Nicole Kidman on her farm after her father (a minister) dies. In the first few scenes when Zellweger sort of storms onto the scene, I do think the performance was almost comic-bookish, but over time she seems to calm down and bring some depth to the character.<br/><br/>Kathy Baker is excellent as an older woman of Cold Mountain who befriends Nicole Kidman. Her character pays dearly for her sons' going AWOL from the Confederate army.<br/><br/>Brendan Gleeson is interesting as Zellweger's father.<br/><br/>I was not impressed at all with Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as an immoral minister.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Donald Sutherland as a minister, although his role is short-lived.<br/><br/>I watched this film twice, and had negative feelings about it both times. I'd say that unless the Civil War is of particular interest, pass it by."
"erikahermanson","8","1","1","3 January 2016"," Summary of movie and review
","The movie was a romantic film that captured a love story as two people split up because of the Civil War. The movie shows both the relaxing parts of the war, the intense battle fields, the families struggling at home, and women's roles during the Civil War. In the beginning of the movie Inman the soldier who will soon go off to war and Ada, the daughter of a Charleston preacher man who has recently moved to Cold Mountain meet and instantly have a connection. The film then follows Inman as he struggles the difficulties of war so that he can return home to Ada, and Ada as she struggles to maintain the life she once knew after her father passes identifies key points of the Civil War. The movie shows gruesome scenes that show how the war ended up affecting many people's lives. The movie details how soldiers treated women and families and indicates the death and rape of many of the women and children. The movie also captures the age differences in the war and showed that many young men were off to fight the war. During the movie Inman and a few other men are captured and this shows that different soldiers would do anything they needed to try and win the war. Overall, the movie captured different aspects of the war pretty well. Although some of the terms or ideas used in the movie had not yet been used during the time period, the movie did a good job showcasing the important details and ideas of the Civil War that are educational and important for the audience to know. While detailing the Civil War the movie also described a love story that captured the audience and made them want to watch until the end."
"jamesphilippy","8","1","1","3 January 2016"," W.P. Inman is forced to leave his lover, Ada, to fight in the Civil War. Witnessing war's atrocities, Inman begins a trek across the war-torn South to return to Ada.
","This movie expertly illustrates a different point of view than most are likely used to. Politics are largely neglected in this film, as opposed to the exclusively political conflicts depicted in Lincoln and other such films documenting the Civil War Era. Instead,the struggles and tribulations of an average confederate soldier brings the atrocities of the war, and its impact on the entire south into context for viewers. Viewers are able to, in a very emotional way, experience the horror of battle, as well as the effect on all walks of life in the south. <br/><br/>The film details several battles between the Union and Confederate forces, all of which are barbaric bloody brawls. It brings to light the desperation of the soldiers to survive, as well as the near-fervor for their own cause. The way in which southern soldiers were shown to fight reflects the honor and the warrior mentality that the south had at the time, which bolstered its efforts against the Union. Historical accuracy seems rather evident. <br/><br/>Conflict existed all across the South during this time period, and it seems accurate that there would be Union Soldiers desperate enough to raid entire towns, steal livestock and supplies, and terrorize locals, seeking food. A mother is encountered by Inman, who misses her husband enough that she would lie with him to recall her husband's presence. It is safe to assume that the husband was also drawn away by the war. The conflict affects every person in the country, and this film makes the situation heartfelt, and as evidently volatile and conflict-ridden as it must have been to actually experience it. <br/><br/>The choice to steer clear of political dealings, and focus solely on the domestic effects and tolls that the war took, serves this film well, and it engages viewers, as well as drawing them into the time period. One can truly learn about the war, as well as the time period from watching this film."
"unitythroughterror","8","1","1","25 June 2014"," A flawed film indeed
","It's good for what it is, but Cold Mountain eradicates a lot of things that made Charles Frazier's novel more grounded. There is barely any attention paid to the slavery and atrocities that made the South so hell-like for those unfortunate to be born and sold into slavery. Inman is never shown to be remorseful except once (""I don't want to fight for a cause I don't believe in"") but there is nothing more shown for that. He is portrayed as a pretty vapid, shallow mystery man of few words and even fewer perceptive thoughts. This works, and it makes his heroism all the better because of its stark contrast to his otherwise nondescript character. Renee Zellweger does a fine job as Ruby, and really is the heart and soul of this film. Nicole Kidman is excellent as always, although almost too otherworldly as a presence to be perceived as a riches-to-rags girl from the city. It makes her a joy to watch, though. Charlie Hunnam really steals the show with the few scenes he's in as a reinvention of Birch, this time around named Bosie, an albino with a hobby of inflicting serious pain on unlucky victims. Ray Winstone is effective as Teague, although he always plays sleazy, sneaky villains so this is no exception. The battle scenes and violent moments in the film are the most effective parts of the film. They really draw you in, and although are nowhere near as graphic or realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan (indeed, I would have appreciated more gore for realism's sake, people get gunned down and they have no wounds or blood sometimes) the drama is truly jarring as we see humanity at its very worst (boys and men being killed in the blink of an eye, stepped on, and crushed). The torture of Sally Swanger (Kathy Baker) is also an effective look at the brutality of the home guard, these scenes really work because the violence - although lacking in realism at times - is still well played in terms of shaking you up and reminding you times are grim. All in all, the emotional scenes are beautiful (if not a little hammy), the supernatural elements effective, the battle scenes excellent, the photography beautiful, and the performances more or less right on target. It's one of those trendy ""epic violent movies"" of 2003, which seemed like a real hot year for violent, fast-paced epic movies. Check it out, but don't expect a masterpiece of modern cinema. But it definitely hits the mark in a way that few filmmakers can do."
"cnycitylady","7","1","1","2 April 2013"," Cold Romance, Warm Story
","Cold Mountain is a love story set during the Civil War. Now this movie doesn't move you to tears, it doesn't make you yearn for great romances but it doesn't quite leave you empty either; and that is because it was carried all the way home by one shell-shocking performance.<br/><br/>The story is rather trite but not so boring that you refuse to view it to the end. The character's earn your sympathy and friendship but you don't really know what you want to happen, because you are unsure of what to root for. The love story may be a great one, but the casting and the acting takes away from it. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman have absolutely no chemistry and every scene where they are supposed to make love to each other just comes across as forced and awkward. The jewel of this movie is Renee Zellweger; She steals every scene she is in and almost without effort becomes all that you are interested in, in the movie. Her accent is flawless, and her emotional breakdowns and highs are what keep you tethered to your seat.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, who is usually the star of her films, falls flat here. She plays sorority belle gone farm girl with a beau in the war, but she conveys almost no genuine emotion. Yes she looks as beautiful as ever but you cannot help but feel that should the role have gone to someone more suited to it that the part could have been great. Jude Law was okay, he looked the part but again, with Kidman as his love interest you don't really find him too believable.<br/><br/>All in all Zellweger really saves the film. She knocked it right out of the park and truly deserved that Oscar awarded to her. All of the small parts played out by big names (such as Natalie Portman who makes an appearance) are really cool to pick out while watching it, and watching Jude Law interact with them on his journey home is thought provoking with how true and harsh it all must have been. 6.8/10"
"Wuchakk","9","1","1","12 January 2011"," Civil War Odyssey
","A Confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) deserts in late 1864 to return to the mountains of western North Carolina and his one true love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey while Ada has her own problems to deal with: death, grief, the ruthless ""home guard,"" starvation/poverty, and a house & farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until the practical Ruby (Renée Zellweger) comes along.<br/><br/>Based on the 1997 novel by Charles Frazier, ""Cold Mountain"" (2003) involves two stories that ultimately intertwine and is reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey. In light of Inman's journey home, the film is episodic but, thankfully, never loses its sense of cohesion. The story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the South on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. Every person Inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or sullied because of the war.<br/><br/>For example, in the case of the family in the large cabin the husband's friendliness is dubious. All the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. Is it any wonder that the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex? As for a couple scenes of overt sexuality, the book & film are contrasting drunken carnal lust with intimate committed love.These scenes are adult-oriented, so be forewarned. I should add that the ""kitchen table woman"" is actress Melora Walters, who played George Costanza's date in ""The Hamptons"" episode of Seinfeld. Meanwhile Natalie Portman shows up for another key sequence.<br/><br/>Then there's the immoral & looney ""Reverend"" Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may tempt some to view the film as ""anti-Christian,"" but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. Not to mention likable, but shakey religionists like Veasey exist in real life.<br/><br/>Not everyone can handle ""Cold Mountain"" because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are commendably counterbalanced by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music. ""Cold Mountain"" is an all-around well-made motion picture that cuts the fat out of the book for a more effective story.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes, and was shot mostly in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania, but with some scenes done in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"

There were only a few romantic scenes but not as I much as I anticipated. There are actually a few good battle scenes from the Civil War here.<br/><br/>This is about the lives of a reverend daughter and a Confederate soldier and how they must cope without each other as he's away at war.<br/><br/>The acting is special.

They didn't give him many lines...is there a reason for that? Generally, he's a pretty good actor. She's so elegant, his character is so country bumpkin. It makes one wonder what they see in each other.<br/><br/>Romance between two such was only successful in Lady Chatterly's Lover.<br/><br/>I think the dislike comes about because the movie is too long.

"grahamsj3","8","1","1","8 July 2004"," Over-hyped
","This film is NOTHING like the previews, which sucked me in believing I was going to see a war/romance flick. There's very little war in it. After 55+ years, I should learn to ignore previews! This film is mostly about an improbably sappy romance between Jude Law's character and Nicole Kidman's character. They barely know each other yet profess eternal love, etc. Law goes off to fight on the Confederate side of the Civil War, leaving poor Kidman to wait for him. Then Kidman's father, well portrayed by Donald Sutherland, dies, leaving poor Nicole all alone and unprepared to run the family farm. Law is seriously wounded, but in true hero fashion, DESERTS the army and begins the journey home to his squeeze. Meanwhile, Renee Zellweger's character shows up to help Nicole Kidman with the farm. The contrast between the two characters is very sharp and interesting. This film is OK but I sure would like to know what all the fuss was about. It's good, but not THAT good. I don't understand all the Academy Award nominations. I saw no glaring errors in the film and the historical part (that little bit of war that they showed) was pretty accurate with regards their treatment of the ""Battle of the Crater"". I gave this film a 6 and that's what it deserves. It is good but definitely not great."

","In my mind the best movie of 2003. Yes, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" was a wonderful movie, ""Cold Mountain"" was everything I want to see in a movie. It had a beautiful romance that came at the very beginning of the Civil War. The most romantic part of the movie is that they fight to hang onto, some hope that the other is not dead or wed another.<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" shows what war will do to people. There are scenes in the movie that will make you laugh, cry and even realize that even in the darkest of ages, even in the most desolate of times there is some hope that people can hold onto. <br/><br/>For those people who have read the book it maintains the true essence of Charles Frazier's masterpiece. It shows the beauty of the South and the terrifying events that changed America forever. <br/><br/>Inman's struggle is a version of the ""Odyssey"". Inman's eternal struggle will make you reach for your tissues. When he tells yells ""I'm done, I am done fighting."" It makes you fall in love with him ten times over. He has struggled to leave the war, but it seems that the war is only at his doorstep. <br/><br/>Thank you Anthony Minghella for making movies such as this. Thank you for maintaining the classical way of film making. <br/><br/>Cold Mountain gets a 10."
"jelleybeans","10","1","1","27 June 2004"," Stunning film!
","This movie is set for release to DVD/VHS on Tuesday, June 29th. I work for a major chain video store and I'm able to view movies prior to release in order to make recommendations to customers. I missed this in the theaters but just finished watching it on DVD a second time!<br/><br/>I watched it TWICE in two days because I wanted to catch what I may have missed the first time. The scenery is gorgeous, the major battle scene is epic and despite what an earlier comment states, the love story is totally believable. <br/><br/>Yes, the two principals, Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law) only share a few words and glances but the spark is ignited before Inman marches off to war with the rest of the able-bodied young men of Cold Mountain. The thought of the possibilities of that love is what carries Ada and Inman through the most difficult times in their separate lives. It's a dream, a hope that some day things will be better if they are ever reunited and that together, there is a future even though the war and the resultant circumstances have changed them both forever.<br/><br/>Ada writes to Inman constantly although he actually only receives three of her letters but they are most precious to him and he reads and re-reads them every chance he gets to help keep him sane in insane times. He never writes her back although he composes his own letters in his head (heard in voice-overs) because he feels that the war has changed him too much and he is not the same as when he left her. He is injured and recuperating in a hospital when he is outside one day to enjoy the sun and he decides to go back to her (one of her letters pleads with him to stop whatever he is doing and just ""Come back to me. Come back to me."") He simply starts walking even though soldiers are warned to stay on the hospital grounds. <br/><br/>Inman's adventures as he makes his way back to Ada and Cold Mountain are strongly reminiscent of Homer's ""Odyssey"", complete with a long time away from home due to a war hundreds of miles from home, suitors angling for Ada/Penelope's hand and land, Sirens and a person who takes care of Inman/Odysseus in a hut in the wilderness.<br/><br/>A separate disc is PACKED with Special Features that only added to my enjoyment of the DVD, including a segment/special called ""The Words and Music of Cold Mountain"". In this special, director Anthony Minghella is interviewed about the process of bring the movie to life, Sting reads part of a chapter of the book (yes, it was a BOOK before it was a movie) and Jack White (who plays ""Georgia"" in the film) performs some of the lonesome bluegrass music heard in the film.<br/><br/>The acting is superb; Renee Zellweger more than deserves her Supporting Actress Golden Globe and Oscar and it's too bad Nicole Kidman while nominated for a Golden Globe was overlooked at the Oscars. (Charlize Theron won both for ""Monster"".) Jude Law is excellent, too. I much preferred his performance over Sean Penn in ""Mystic River"" (Oscar) and Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" (Golden Globe).<br/><br/>All told a great movie. I highly recommend it."
"hbomb7","10","1","1","18 May 2004"," Human characters, Zelwegger's accent
","This contains a few spoilers of relatively minor plot points. The thing that struck me most about this remarkable film was its intense humanity. It's been several months since I've seen it, but I recall vividly the power of being sucked into these characters' physical and emotional hardships. It was the kind of power that had me asking myself ""could I love that strongly, or obsessively?"" ""Would I be able to stand battle that ferocious?"" I could lie with Natalie Portman's Sarah and feel her anguish and loneliness. I could kneel in the dirt with Nicole Kidman's Ada and feel her helplessness. I could imagine the terror with Sally Swanger as her sons and husband were murdered before her eyes. In short, the actors were so adept at portraying the characters that I could imagine being any one of them, which made the film highly affective, indeed.<br/><br/>By the way, one other commenter said that Renee Zelwegger is a Brit and, considering this, did a fine job with her accent. Actually, she is from Texas and I was happy that she had a chance to return to her southern roots (although the accent was greatly exaggerated for her character Ruby) after portraying the British Bridget Jones a couple times."

","Any war brings disasters to any nation or territory. American civil war was not an exception of these calamities, and in my opinion, this is what the director Anthony Minghella wanted to emphasize in this drama starred by young Jude Law and backed by Nicole Kidman and always efficient Renée Zellweger. The plot is about the love of a young couple, W.P. Inman (Law) and Ada Monroe, (N. Kidman). The first one had to go to the civil war where he was able to fight effectively and even saved the lives of some of his fellows. War was finished and he escaped from the hospital where he was recovering himself. At this point he had to overcome several serious difficulties in his way back home, he made it and found a situation of abuse by a group of gangs in his site. The couple finally decided to marry and start a new life, but the gangs once again frustrated this desire. The film is a good combination of suffering and love."
"katydid4819","8","1","1","17 April 2004"," 'Mountain' Stands Tall
","Despite the reviews of this movie and its lack of major Oscar recognition, I thought it was one of the best movies of 2003. It is not only beautiful to look at, but it is both sad and hopeful at the same time. Every scene is equally as important as the last and in the end it feels like you have actually seen the lives of these people, felt their pain and understood them through it all.<br/><br/>The great novel that this was adapted from is just the beginning of many amazing elements that came together to make Cold Mountain a success. The screenplay does not feel like too much has been crammed into in but loosely enjoys the story that it is telling. The dialogue feels right and even though all the actors could have improved on their accents, this flaw seems to fade into the background because the actors don't place the emphasis on their words to tell the story but rather use them as one of their many tools instead of the only one as is the mistake in so many movies.<br/><br/>And as for those actors who couldn't create the accents...well, they can create characters. Nicole lives up to her title as Academy Award winner and gives a better performance than the one that got her that title. Jude Law's character is the simplest and he knows it. You won't see him stealing any scenes from his co-stars but that is what is supposed to be. Renee is the polar opposite of that. She is the comic relief for the film and she does it with grace. Her loud and very southern character of Ruby fits her well, but then again, so does everything else she does. She just further shows us that she is one of very few actors working today with a range that has yet to be defined. She is the focus of our attention whether we want her to be or not.<br/><br/>The entire film feels very natural and is one of the years best. ****/****"

","This story line is so emotional, it makes Gone With The Wind pall in comparison. The players, all stereotypical Southerners, are well portrayed. I have yet to see Jude Law in any role in which he did not convince of the nature of the character   he was playing. Renee actually ""stole"" the movie, and most certainly was deserving of the Academy Award. It was brutal, it was tender and, it was one of the best motion pictures I have seen. The Civil War was far from ""civil"", with American's killing American's, American's destroying American cities, but this movie was totally different in its message. The scenery of rural North Carolina was beautifully photographed, too."

","At the end of the Civil War, Confederate soldier W.P. Inman (Jude Law) makes the long, arduous journey back to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), whom he left four years ago with only the promise of a relationship-to-be.<br/><br/>This epic romance was adapted from the popular bestseller by Charles Frazier, and I'd have to say they did a pretty good job converting the book to film. This movie was met with a lot of disapproving critical reactions but to be honest, I really enjoyed it. I like all of Anthony Minghella's films. And I'll tell you what, it's a lot easier to understand waiting four years for someone you have barely spoken to when that someone is played by Jude Law (or Nicole Kidman, depending on which way you want to look at it - either way, they're both impossibly beautiful).<br/><br/>The movie does have some flaws. One - it's hard for our now more...promiscuous human race to understand waiting and waiting and waiting...and waiting and waiting to be with someone you just kissed four years ago. But times were different! At least that's what I told myself. However, this was smoothed over by a hell of a kiss between Law and Kidman before he takes off. I don't know what the critics were thinking when they said there was no chemistry between them, because I'm a-tellin' you these two were on FIRE. I almost felt guilty watching them.<br/><br/>Two - and I will be met with some disapproval here, but I absolutely did not like Renee Zellweger as Ruby Thewes, the pistol-packin' mama who comes in to help Ada survive the war. Ruby is a cool character in the book, but I didn't approve of Zellweger's over-the-top, cartoonish, stereotypical Southerner. I will never in a million years understand her receiving an Oscar for this role - it had to be a pity vote. She's kind of funny, but ultimately obnoxious, especially if you read the book - she wasn't at all what I pictured.<br/><br/>However, what you do have are divine leads. Jude Law was absolutely wonderful as Inman, exactly as I pictured it in the book. He definitely went through a great transformation along with his character - you'll see him sweat and strain through gunshots, near-deaths, starvation and heartsickness. It's a wonderful moment when he finally gets back to Cold Mountain and reunites with Ada, who I also thought was played beautifully by Nicole Kidman. Were I the one casting, I think I would have gone for someone a little younger for the role, but Nicole has the depth to carry this woman through four years of struggling and starvation. I'm not sure why people attacked Nicole's performance so much, I thought it was subtle and elegant. And as much as I didn't like the Renee casting, she and Nicole were good together. I felt the sisterly love.<br/><br/>Also some fine cameos in the supporting cast - a brilliant performance by Natalie Portman is the near-highlight of the movie, rivaled by Kathy Baker as Ada's kindly neighbor Sally.<br/><br/>And at the risk of sounding totally and completely shallow - oh what the hell, you'll all agree with me anyway - y'all should watch this movie if for NO other reason but the amazing, amazing scene between Law & Kidman at the end. Oh man... ...I wonder if Jude Law realizes that he will, in fact, be marrying me? He can be MY ain true love! Yeeeehaw!<br/><br/>All in all, not the best movie of the year but a dern good one. 4/5"

Renee Zellweger was amazing in all aspects. Jude Law had the best accent and did an incredible job. That and he is really, really hot. I don't think the violence is over done at all. I mean it's really not that graphic and there's not that much of it. The sexuality really seems to be a big issue. If you are a mature person than you won't have a problem with it. It's not that bad and it is completely necessary to the story. Anyways go see it. It's worth your time and money. I loved it."

","In my opinion the two songs from COLD MOUNTAIN nominated for the academy<br/><br/>awards were better than the winning song from Return of the King,  But, even on a ""Cold Mountain"", it is tough to stop a landslide.  At least, Renee ZELLWEGER received the much deserved award for the role of RUBY.<br/><br/>Of the two Cold Mountain songs, I would give a slight edge to the one with Elvis Costello, but the one with Sting was also very good.  There was something<br/><br/>special about the music in the movie.  Although music and movies go hand-in- hand, the Cold Mountain music was special.

","Big, sweeping romantic epics don't come along as often as we'd like, so set a date to see this powerful love story set during America's Civil War. From the director of The English Patient, Anthony Minghella, the film focuses on what matters cinematically, such as impressive scenery and artistic, daring camera angles, as well as adapting and delving deep into the heart-warming emotions, originally displayed in Charles Frazier's acclaimed novel. The chemistry between onscreen sweethearts Nicole Kidman and Jude Law is explosively romantic, while Renée Zellweger injects some well-timed humour in amongst the thrills, spills and heartache that wartime love can bring.<br/><br/>Although a sombre movie, with numerous explosive scenes full of the best special effects around, cinematically, Cold Mountain is given an authentic look- largely due to the exquisite costumes displayed on screen, exquisitely hand-crafted, and are appropriately suited for the backdrops around them.<br/><br/>
The actors in the film, all make admirable attempts at capturing the Southern accent. Although their accents are flimsy and inconsistent at times, the variations in speech could be put down to Minghella's creativity and authenticity, and relate to the different cultures and backgrounds at the time.<br/><br/>Overall, a terrific romance/war epic, with sensational technical work, horrifically spectacular action, rich characters and a love story to die for.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE FOR 2004!"

","Cold Mountain<br/><br/>	A fantastic, refreshingly original and understandably highly acclaimed film from the Writer and Director Anthony Minghella. The film combines some epic footage with superb acting from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and in particular, Renee Zellweger. <br/><br/>	In his moving and dramatic film, Minghella adapts the book to the big screen with the sort of class and impeccable attention to detail that sets apart quality Writers and Directors from the rest. This is without a doubt the best film adapted from previous material and would be top in this Oscar category, sweeping aside films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, if it was not for the disgraceful shambles surrounding the fact that it was not nominated in the first place. Perhaps this polemic shows that the good people at the Academy didn't want Cold Mountain to go away with too many awards, having already been nominated for six, including Best Achievement in cinematography. <br/><br/>	As well as the amazing writing and direction of the film, Minghella has managed to use cameo appearances that were as surprising as the quality of the motion picture itself. The cast included actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Natalie Portman, Ray Winstone and Charlie Hunnam and many more. This large and tremendously talented cast of well chosen actors helped to give the film just what it needed, a strong sense of community and friendship. This in turn was a brilliantly thought out move to back up the strong bond shared by Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman), which is the crux of the film. <br/><br/>	The action sequences, although incredibly well filmed, were few and far between. Many war films have two plots, the main part of which being the battles, interspersed with short moments from the sub-plot (usually a love story). However, in this plot, such a structure is turned on its head with the main focus being Inman and Ada's struggle to find each other again in the face of considerable danger or hardship. All credit to the writer of the book, Charles Frazier, for creating such an inspiring, touching and originally masterpiece, and to the actors, producers, writers and director for doing it such immeasurable credit.   <br/><br/>	Inman, the wood labourer turned Confederate soldier, struggles to deal with the pressures of the war, and after having been shot, an injury as well. He receives just three of Ada's numerous letters to him and when he hears, in the last letter, that she wishes him to return he sees his opportunity. Temporarily crippled by his injury, Inman must wait to recover before trying to come back to her.' One evening he escapes from the Military Hospital in which he is being treated and heads for his home town of Cold Mountain. Soldier turned deserter,' he is hunted down by the decadent Home Guard.' On his travels he meets an immoral Priest, banished from his home town, and together they are drawn into a web of deceit that leads them to being captured by the Guard, previously their Allies. Inman continues he fight, not only to get back to Ada, but also to survive with serious food and sleep deprivation. This fight is brilliantly acted in its entirety by Jude Law in this winning performance and supported by the cast of just as fine actors.<br/><br/>	Meanwhile, Ada, sick with love for the man who she is desperate to see and hardly even knows at the same time as facing starvation. She writes that the war is being lost twice over by the people who have been left behind.' In one of her finest performances to date, Nicole Kidman shows that she really knows what acting is all about, emotion. Hungry and poor, Nicole Kidman receives just the help she needs, only from an unexpected source. Ruby (Renee Zellweger), appears on the scene in an excellent performance, capped by her very authentic and well developed Southern accent, to help out. As good as a man in practical skill, Ruby has learnt to look after herself from a young age. She too has her own problems to deal with. In particular, the appearance of her deserter father/ musician and his friends, triggers memories of her hard childhood, caused in part by the neglect of her father. The struggle that she faces is beautifully acted and the grit and the determination that make her what she is are the building blocks for the portray of her character in the film. Renee Zellweger does this with a style and uniqueness that makes the part her own. <br/><br/>	From set design, to plot, to fantastic casting, this film has all the right ingredients for an all round spectacular film. With one of the best film endings I have ever seen I can justify summing up with the words: Ingenious, resourceful, imaginative and Breath taking!"

","Before going to see Cold Mountain I have heard several comments about it. Most of them said it is cold, for me is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. And it is not cold, but warm and emotive. I enjoyed and loved the whole movie, from beginning to end, though there are some moments that, for me, are specially great: the first kiss between Inman and Ada (I didn´t expected it and breaks the ""coldness"" between the couple), the scene with the white pigeon in the church (shows Inman's sensibility), when Ruby appears (Renée Zellweger really surprised me, she is completely different from her other movies and makes a great performance), when Ada and Inman meet again, and of course the end, which I wish it was different but the truth is that it is absolutely perfect."

","Cold Mountain is no way better than The English Patient, but like any Minghella's movie, there are always the acting and scenery which dazzle. I haven't read the original, but I do think the story is rather weak, and it's certainly the reason for most of the negative comments made by others on this film. Yet, Minghella managed to portray this weak romance into something fabulous that at least in the middle of the movie, we somehow FEEL that Inman and Ada do love each other. <br/><br/>The scene in which Ada and Inman sit by the fire chatting is superb -definitely one of the highest point of the film, but the film goes stale after that. The final shooting scene is somewhat redundant (kinda remind me of old stupid Westerns); it's like a reminder of the lingering of the civil war but it simply falls into the wrong place. The last 15 minutes are largely unnecessary and should have ended up in the editing room. But on the whole, Cold Mountain is a good movie and a more enjoyable tragi-romance in recent years. Worth a look. 9/10."

"phf_uk","8","1","1","23 January 2004"," Cold Mountain - A Review
","Ada and Inman love each other. But like most young people, they take life and time for granted and leave things unsaid. Only when Inman is called to fight for the South in the American Civil War do they realize the magnitude of their loss. Separated and constantly assailed by the horrors of war, death of loved ones and the cruelty of weak men, they hold on to the hope of finding each other to keep them alive.<br/><br/>
Director Anthony Minghella creates truly memorable images that are certain to linger on in the viewer's memory. The scenes where Ada and Inman interact are carefully played down and manage to maintain a clear originality. The superb visual style of the film owes much to the excellent work of cinematographer John Seale, who worked with Minghella in 'The English Patient' and in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'.<br/><br/>
Jude Law does a good job of portraying Inman, a man of few words, and the scriptwriters made sure his lines are well worth the utter. Equally impressive is Nicole Kidman, whose character (Ada) undergoes a complete transformation from a shy, spoiled girl to a brave and resilient woman. But Renee Zellweger is the one who steals the show as the laborer Ruby - in fact, she's so good you almost forget her character is rather two-dimensional.<br/><br/>
All in all, Cold Mountain is a very satisfying cinematic experience that works on all levels - good acting, well-structured screenplay, assured direction, beautiful soundtrack and superb cinematography. And unlike most long films, it keeps a fast pace right to the very end. A realistic, sometimes brutal, love story, Cold Mountain is a true work of art."
"macpherr","9","1","1","21 January 2004"," No doubt, a very good movie.
","Anthony Minghella, who directed `Truly, Madly Deeply' a movie I loved, wrote the screenplay, directed, did other things this jam of a movie. The movie is the life journey of Inman, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (`The Talented Mr.Ripley', movie also directed by Minguella; and among others `Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'). Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves. His life's journey is full of struggles and temptations, but more than anything a very humbly experience. He becomes a deserter and is very much persecuted because of it. Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (The Hours) is absolutely beautiful in the movie, and plays a very pampered pastor's kid. Now comes Renee Zellweger as `Ruby Thewes' (`One True Thing,' `Bridget Jones Diary' and the much anticipated, `Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.' She is an actress I absolutely adore, with that super fast southern accent, and full of bravery very upfront, making everyone laugh. Just when you think things are pretty bad.  Watching Renee work is worth the ticket price. I have watched at least fifty percent of her work, if not more. She is a very good actress. I can say every line of `One True Thing,' Yes... I can talk like Bridget.'perfect' and know the lines as well.  Renee has a sense of self worth, innocence, a strong sense of morals, even moved to NY, not to be polluted by Hollywood, that makes her a very, very  special  She DESERVES Golden Globes,  and Oscar and whatever other statuettes they are handing out this year. So please, members of whatever vote for RENEE!!!!!!! Please! I liked the other characters especially, the N.Y.U. graduate Phillip Seymour Hoffman `Veasey', who played in `Twister' plus 37 more movies. He is always playing those disturbed people. I look at him now and start laughing. Just like when I look at Jack Nicholson (`Something's Gotta Give,' `As Good as it Gets') I just crack up! I view this movie as the Inman's life journey of, regardless of where he is heading. It is his complete journey. Along with `Glory,' ` The Love Letter' (a movie worth looking for, with Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh) are my favorite movies about the Civil War. Speaking about a very American topic, Civil War, our Civil war, explain going to Romania. I find no reason for such fiasco, besides cheaper labor, than if made in the U.S., why sent those people all the way to Romania???????  when there are so many actors that could work in right here in our back yard... and don't feel like going all the way to Hollywood to get started.  For that I find no excuse. Sorry... but the money should have stayed right here with us. We are in wartime, Hello!!!!  This irritates me. But I must say the photography is beautiful, and so is the music. I recommend the movie, but I am not that much into drama. There are enough funny parts. My favorite and most funny lines came from Ruby and Veasey. Ruby: `They call this war a cloud over the land. But they made the weather and then they stand in the rain and say 'Sh** its raining.' No doubt, a very good movie."

The expressions of love and sacrifice that the characters endure are the greatest since the writings of Shakespeare.  I would recommend this movie to anyone I know."
"clydestuff","8","1","1","2 February 2004"," A tale of two movies
","When Miramax spends $80 million dollars of their money to back a film, then spends another $25 million for marketing it, you can be sure that they expect huge things in return for their investment.  Then again what studio doesn't?   Most studios are pleased as punch when their films simply give them a profitable return on their investment.  I'm sure Miramax loves a profit margin as well as any other studio but for films like Cold Mountain they make them because of the little visions of gold Oscar statuettes dancing around like so many sugar plums in Harvey Weinstein's head.  Nothing wrong with that either, I suppose, but when you set out to make a film with winning awards being a top priority, everybody had better be at the top of their game.  It is apparent in Cold Mountain that everyone involved is trying hard to achieve greatness.<br/><br/>Minghella bring us the riveting stories of a Confederate Soldier, Inman Balis, struggling to find his way back home to the life and the woman he loves, Ada Monroe.  Ada, at the same time is struggling to hold on to her farm with the help of Mountain woman Ruby Thewes.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain is a breathtaking film to look at.  John Seale's cinematography of Civil War Battles and landscape is almost worth the price of admission alone.  Dante Ferrati's production design, especially in an early battle sequence will leave you gasping. Along with Minghella's direction, it will remind one of the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan.  In other words, war is chaos and hell, and there's not much glory in getting your body parts blown around the battle field.<br/><br/>I can find no fault with the acting in this film either.  Though some have been critical of Nicole Kidman performance and most notably her accent. I found her southern accent to be every bit on a par with many others who have played the Southern Belle but were hardly from the South.  It is (the accent) easily comparable to that of Vivien Leigh's Scarlett in Gone With The Wind.  As for her performance, it is a role that is not demonstrative, requires reserve and Kidman gives it exactly that.  So why fault an actress for staying in character and bringing to life the role of Ada Monroe as it was meant to be?<br/><br/>Jude Law will quickly make you forget his robotic role in AI. As Inman Balis, he too is a quiet reserved Confederate soldier, who is willing to fight for the cause up until he has nothing left to give, and begins to see how hopeless and pointless the bloodletting has become.   <br/><br/>
As mountain woman, Ruby Thewes, Renee Zellweger nearly steals the show. When she shows up to aid Ada in putting her farm back together, she brings new life to the film and the audience.  Having watched as Ada struggles just to stay alive, and as Inman deserts the Confederate Army, Ruby gives us a shining glimmer of much needed hope.  She is a strong willed, no nonsense woman, and with Ada and Ada's farm sees a chance to have something that would not have been possible previously.  <br/><br/>There is not enough words available to me to talk about the excellence of the rest of the supporting cast.  Brenden Gleeson plays Ruby's no good father who returns for a last chance at redemption.  Eileen Atkins as the always concerned, always giving friend Maddy, who after witnessing one of many senseless acts of brutality in this film, is forever changed.  Natalie Portman as the young widow Sara, trying to deal with the loss of her husband while raising her ill child will make you forget completely about her stale performance in Attack of the Clones.  Ray Winstone, who plays the head of the local home guard, is as evil and lecherous a villain to ever disgrace the South.  Donald Sutherland is also on hand giving a touching portrayal as Ada's father.<br/><br/>So, with all the great cast and production values, why does Cold Mountain fail to achieve greatness?  Unfortunately, it just tries to do way too much. Most of the blame is with the screenplay, and the rest of it has to be placed on the shoulders of director Minghella.  In trying to bring us so much story, we are never quite drawn into it the way we should be.  At times we are with Inman as he fights to make his way home, then we are returned to the story of Ada and Ruby on the home front. What this does is shortchange both stories.  The opening scenes between Kidman and Law pass by so quickly that we never truly understand the chemistry between them.  This is made even more difficult because Ada and Inman are both quiet and reserved by nature.  We can see where they may be attracted to one another but we never feel it in our hearts.  Ada's struggles on the farm and Inman's struggle to return home are both captivating in themselves but trying to tell both stories just doesn't blend together. Just as we are being drawn deeply into Inman's story, Minghella quickly whisks us away to check in on Ada and Ruby. By the time we may return to Inman's narrative, it has lost whatever momentum it might have gained.  I would have like to have seen a film about the story of Ada Monroe, Ruby Thewes, Maddy and Teague.  A film about a Confederate soldier deserting the army to return home would also have been a great film.  Putting these two stories together is trying to give us too much of a good thing, and sometimes it's better to have just enough than overfilling the cup.<br/><br/>My Grade A-"
"Pavel-8","6","1","1","18 January 2004"," Hookless.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain,"" based on the best-selling novel, tells a love story set in the South against the backdrop of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law) plays a Confederate soldier who abandons his comrades to return to the woman he loves, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Meanwhile back at the ranch, Ada has enlisted the help of mountain woman Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to survive.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, therein lies the problem; the story that is intended to propel the film doesn't fulfill its purpose or promise. The first act love tale between the characters of Jude Law and Nicole Kidman isn't developed into a convincing relationship. Thus, without the necessary screen time or situations for the two to truly fall in love, the film has the unfortunate feel of a typical teenage romance, in which the two lovers fall for each other in a ridiculously short amount of time, based largely on looks and infatuation. The entire plot is based upon that hook, which provides each character with motivation to keep on keeping on. Rendered hook-less, ""Cold Mountain"" still looks great, but doesn't engage as great movies do, instead plodding along through the first hour.<br/><br/>Then Ruby shows up, infusing ""Cold Mountain"" with the vitality it desperately needed. Zellwegger, continuing her remarkable run of stellar role choices, effectively provides the comic relief while remaining entirely within her character as a woman well-acquainted with the physical and emotional hardships of life. Despite being the less attractive of the two female leads, she maintains a magnetism that outshines even Kidman's strong acting chops. Zellwegger will likely earn an Oscar nomination and completely deserves such an honor.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast ranges from solid but not spectacular (Law and Kidman) to surprisingly good (several stars in unusual roles). But the most entertaining aspect of the film was the long list of highly recognizable faces in minor roles. Many people will notice six or more ""names"" in parts that are slightly more than cameos, along with another half dozen faces that will be familiar to regular movie-goers. All of these actors turn in very good supporting work that colorfully fills in the background of the film.<br/><br/>
That background, both on the screen and behind the scenes, may very well garner a basketful of Academy Award nods, and while I would dispute other acting nominations and any screenwriting award, I acknowledge the technical quality of the film. In his director role, Anthony Minghella (""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""The English Patient"") has produced a quality presentation of a sprawling book, but as I have said, I point the finger at his adaptation, which failed to adequately evoke emotional involvement in the romantic aspects.<br/><br/>With Romania largely filling in for the South, John Seale (Oscar winner for ""English Patient,"" ""Witness"") lenses a good-looking film, and that beauty contrasts starkly with the often excessive violence on screen. Composer Gabriel Yared, another Minghella favorite, again takes a relatively minimalistic approach, similar to his score for ""Possession,"" mixing Southern strains with typical film music to complement the film well. The score doesn't stand out like many of the year's dramatic work, but that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The film doesn't live up to its hype. When a movie aims high and misses, it often falls below what might have been had it aimed lower and succeeded. That is the case with Cold Mountain; although signs of brilliance were evident, one glaring off note holds the movie back at all times. A marginal thumbs up at best. 6/10"

Here you have a movie where 4mm men went off to war, leaving all the women behind. Good idea.  Not only show a cival war period movie but show what went on behind the curtain as well. Ada and Ruby did not have time to feel sorry for themselves-they had to invent their own survival.I gave it an 8 based upon an average of 10 for Ada & Ruby, and 6 for Inman and the rest of the men.

","I hadn't read the book and had very little understanding of the storyline to this movie, but I went along to see it after hearing that the opening scenes rivalled Private Ryan. The opening battle scene was quite gruesome and brought home the true horror of a war fought on land that belonged to all of the participants, and which ran red with their blood. When the battle was over it was time for the real story to unfold, the real story, not of war or desertion or slavery but a story of love and journeys. Jude Law as Inman, makes a long and treacherous physical journey back to the arms of his soul mate whilst she makes a journey from somewhat spoilt and superficial girl to strong determined womanhood. There are many that will rail against the historical inaccuracies, and the script, and the acting - but the story was well told.<br/><br/>Bravura performance from Ms Zellweger and excellent support from Brendan Gleason, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charlie Hunnam and the wonderful yet still underated Kathy Baker. Ms Kidman and Mr Law are just a little too pretty for me, but the audience seemed to like them and cried alot at the end. 8/10 and a good effort from Mr Minghella, who but for Peter Jackson would certainly be taking home an Oscar."

The movie is the life journey of Inman returning home to the woman he loves, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil). I paralleled his return to `Ada' played by Nicole Kidman (The Hours, The Others ) as most people's life.  Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves. His life's journey is full of struggles and temptations, but more than anything a very humbly experience. He becomes a deserter and is very much persecuted because of it. Now comes Renee Zellweger as `Ruby Thewes' (`One True Thing,' `Bridget Jones Diary' and the much anticipated, `Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.' She is an actress I absolutely adore, with that super fast southern accent, and full of bravery very upfront, making everyone laugh. Just when you think things are pretty bad.  Watching Renee work is worth the ticket price.  She DESERVES Golden Globes,  and Oscar and whatever other statuettes they are handing out this year. So please, members of whatever vote for RENEE!!!!!!! Please! I liked the other characters especially, the N.Y.U. graduate Phillip Seymour (Twister ) Hoffman `Veasey'.  He is always playing those disturbed people and entertaining people. I look at him now and start laughing. Just like when I look at Jack Nicholson (`Something's Gotta Give,' `As Good as it Gets') I just crack up! I view this movie as the Inman's life journey of, regardless of where he is heading. It is his complete journey. Along with `Glory,' ` The Love Letter'  with Campbell Scott and Jennifer Jason Leigh, Cold Mountain will stand as of my favorite movies about the Civil War.  <br/><br/>The scenery is beautiful, the photography outstanding, loved the music. My favorite and most funny lines came from Ruby and Veasey. Favorite Line:  Ruby: `They call this war a cloud over the land. But they made the weather and then they stand in the rain and say 'S--- its raining.'"

","The movie Cold Mountain was captivating.  Jude Law was at his best. Everyone in the movie was at their best.  A nice surprise by Jack White.  I could not hold back the tears.  A very moving story and a very strong love story also. It also looked like it was filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains, which I am familiar with.  Just my opinion but Jude Law is a great leading man. Hope he considers doing more hero/love interest in the future.  He won't go wrong.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  It was very honest and moving. The Best Movie I have seen in a very long time.

","Whilst not perfect, I thought this was a film full of beautiful and moving moments and the simple fact is that I had tears in my eyes at 4 or 5 points during the film and, whatever comments or criticisms I can have, nothing can change the fact that I was deeply moved from this film.<br/><br/>I think one of the biggest perceived criticisms of the film (i.e. the fact Inman and Ada barely know each other film) is the very thing that makes it such a beautiful, moving idea.   I really loved the idea that someone could be going through such a terrible time and the only source of hope that I have is not even, as such a person, but the image and idea of a person who they don't even really know.<br/><br/>I found Ada's letters to Inman extremely touching and the sense of longing throughout the film is absolutely staggering heart-wrenching although, to be truthful, this sense of longing also does cause problems with the film's end as the hope and longing can never live up to to the final realisation.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Natalie Portman has the single saddest, sweetest moment of the film in a brief but outstanding cameo while Philip Seymour Hoffman adds brilliant comic relief.   Renee Zelwegger must surely be a strong contender for the Best Supporting Actress nods at the Oscars and elsewhere.<br/><br/>True, the ending has its problems, true the chemistry between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman does not entirely work and Law gives a strangely muted performance (I don't mean in the sense that the character doesn't speak much, although he doesn't, but that Law does not give as strong an impression as the character as you might expect from such a talented actor).<br/><br/>But, when a film is as moving and brilliant in its conveyal of the horrors of war and when I enjoy virtually an entire two and a hour film - I'm a firm believer that there is seldom ANY excuse for making film more than 120 minutes - all quibbles seem minor."

"harry_potter6688","9","1","1","10 January 2004"," Prepare to cry some tears
","Amidst the ridiculous movies of our time: violence, sci-fi... going back in time, getting your memory wiped and other stupid plots, Cold Mountain brings a monstrous movie to the screen. Although I do admit that the plot has been performed many many times before, Anthony Minghella is able to bring in different aspects to keep the story unique. The story does not only focus on the main love plot and the viewer is not over-stuffed with tacky romance and cheesy catch phrases. The entire time I watched this movie all i wanted was for Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's characters to get together. Both deliver amazing performances, and as always, Jude Law looks immaculate and Nicole Kidman is able to make the audience cry with just one look. The surprising actress for me was Renee Zelwegger. Having mostly seen her in comedic roles, I did not expect much from her. Her performance, however, is simple but extremely powerful. Although I admit that I did cry the entire movie, and through the credits, the movie is beautifully presented and pain-stakingly desperate love story. Some may say that this has been done before, but with the amazing cast and unique directing, there are many factors that set this movie apart from the rest. I say: watch it! And don't worry about crying or feeling that little squirm deep inside of you. This is a pure love story, but a truly incredulous one. I would watch it a million times over... and still cry!"
"Chris_Docker","8","1","1","18 January 2004"," Another triumph for Nicole Kidman
","Another triumph for Nicole Kidman  in this one she plays the long suffering sweetheart of a man she knew for only moments (Jude Law) and who has gone off to fight in the Civil War. There are plenty of realistically bloody scenes tracing this troubled period of American history, but Cold Mountain is much more than a war film. Kidman is the daughter of a preacher  she can play piano and speak several languages but is poorly equipped to look after herself when times get hard. Zellwegger plays her down-to-earth companion and saving grace and as such is a revelation. Jude Law's character as a moral' soldier is an interesting one, as his long journey, physical and emotionally, against many difficulties. <br/><br/>This epic tale tells not only of the torments of facing very alien scenarios unprepared, but of a love that spans several years of separation, based on next to nothing, and yet is the guiding light giving hope to the future. Kidman rises to the challenge and delivers another memorable performance. She is backed up by superb ensemble acting and fine storytelling, beautifully adapted to the screen."
"taniaalexandra","8","1","1","24 March 2004"," great Renée!!!!
","I believe this is an amazing movie, although not so good as Minghella's masterpiece - THE ENGLISH PATIENT. Jude Law has an astonishing performance, but the real treasure in this film, even more than the story itself, is the one and only Renée Zellweger. There are no words to describe her performance as Ruby Thewes. She brings real life into this film. I think she is the true soul of COLD MOUNTAIN. I really believe she deserved the Oscar she won. I can´t think of nobody who could perform such a though role in such a splendid way. When she is on the screen we completely forget the also great actress Nicole Kidman. If it wasn't for Renée's character this movie would be a bit boring and monotonous. I really think that you should watch this film and see for yourself what I mean."
"gcutforth","10","1","1","26 December 2003"," Captures the spirit of the novel superbly
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**** Cold Mountain is a beautifully written novel, one that captures the anguish and heartbreak of a time when families could not look to the future with any certainty. The story of Ada and Inman took me to places I had never been before and moved me to emotions that were felt deeply. The ending is filled with irony and heartbreak and yet it is also filled with hope. I knew Cold Mountain would make a great movie.<br/><br/>Thus, when I heard that Anthony Minghella would be making the movie I was sure he would do it justice. However, I was quite surprised and leery of the casting of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law ... not quite how I pictured Ada and Inman. Not to worry. They are both excellent and now I can't imagine anyone else in either role. Renée Zellweger was definitely not how I pictured Ruby, but she is also marvelous.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie, many of the feelings and emotions from reading the book welled up inside me as scenes that had been only moving pictures in my mind played across the screen in front of me. I wasn't expecting this until the end, but for me it is a sure sign the cast and direction and music and writing had all superbly combined to add even more pleasure to my enjoyment of the book. As with Mystic River, having read the novel was perhaps an advantage that enhanced the movie experience. Even though I knew how everything would play out, knowing the background behind each scene allowed me to add in my mind what the movie was unable to present. Both Eastwood and Minghella were able to strip the story down to the necessary parts that moved the story forward without losing any of the emotion and complications.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to seeing Cold Mountain many times again once it is released on video. It is one of the great Civil War movies, along with the Shenandoah, the wonderful James Stewart movie from 1965, that really captures the heartbreak of how the war disrupted the lives of ordinary citizens.<br/><br/>Those who loved the book shouldn't be disappointed. Cold Mountain will take it's place as one of my all time favorite Romances, along with Casablanca, The English Patient, The Princess Bride and The Way We Were."
"hummer2192","4","1","1","25 December 2003"," No chemistry whatsoever...
","It is most sad that there has been such a slew of bad Civil War movies in theaters of late. That said, you have an idea of how the rest of this review shall go. Cold Mountain concentrates on one thing, how war tears families apart. This it does very well, again, and again, and again. In fact there are so many examples, one wonders how they had any time for plot. This proves to be true as Anthony Minghella spends most of his time showcasing how pitiful Kidman is, how mopey Jude Law is, and how whiny Zellweger is. All three of these characters have no chemistry with eachother, especially Law and Kidman. The entire movie subsists of them pining for eachother, yet they had little, if nothing together to begin with. Now one might say that there is a much deeper meaning in this relationship, which i do acknowledge. These poor fools are cast into a conflict which they do not wish to be a part of, and they are trying to hang on to whatever is fimiliar to them. This is where it all ends however, as Law marches on home like a mindless fool and Kidman begins to move on with her life. The story as a whole sounds like the screenplay was derived using a cookbook strategy, requiring shoot outs, explosions, and a fat naked woman to keep the interest of the audience. Minghella also threw in a sex scene towards the end of the movie in a manner which lead me to believe that he almost forgot he needed one, and threw it in. Historically, there were a few inacurracies as well. Through much of the movie, Jude Law carries with him a Le Mat pistol, an item which would cost the average soldier over a month's pay. Overall, I believe that Cold Mountain should remain what it once was, a book. Simular to Hemmingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" the book is ripe with symbolism that High School English students would love to tear into, but as a movie the characters and events are as two dimensional as the screen on which they are projected. Please, if you are looking for a Civil War movie with profound depth and entertainment, save the nine bucks and rent Glory."

"spaceboy_a","8","1","1","5 January 2004"," This is why I go to the movies - NOT FOR ESCAPISM...
","After all the fuss over 'Lord of the Rings' and everything else out over the the Christmas period - you know all the films that people see in droves to try and escape from their reality? It was so nice to see 'Cold Mountain' a couple of days ago.<br/><br/>Yes it's pretty morbid but does have touches of humour. And when you have a great lead cast and an amazing supporting cast giving some very strong performances, plus some lush cinematography and a compelling story, how can you complain?<br/><br/>I like the fact that there's something deeper happening here with the characters other than the love story. But unlike 'Titanic', 'Cold Mountain' isn't a Hollywood love story, it's a story about survival and Law and Kidman are very convincing here - they also heat up the screen too towards the end. Plus Kathy Baker, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Melone (in a very small role), Natalie Portman (reminding us after 2 'Star Wars' films that she CAN act) and Rene Zellwegger, I came out full filled. This is a film about 'us' and anyone who says it's too bloody needs a reality check because this is what life was like and for all we know could be like it again some day.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone will come out of 'Cold Mountain' saying, ""that was just a bit of fun... harmless entertainment"" but I think it's impossible to come out thinking that you haven't just seen a film of very high quality both in production values and in terms of story. If you want your movies sugar coated, then by all means, go spend another 3 hours and see 'Return of the King' again.<br/><br/>If you didn't like 'The English Patient' or 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', then you might not like this film as all three are by the same writer/director, but if you enjoy seeing some real characters in real situations, this movie could be what you're looking for.<br/><br/>8 OUT OF 10"

All the drama and intensity of this civil war odyssey aside wherein returning Odysseus too falls in the wasteland, Renee is simply wonderful. Her perkiness reminds me of an early Shirley Maclaine with the refreshing honesty and simplicity without dumbing it up.  Some fine contrasts between the social classes wherein Belles were raised to be Belles and farm girls were raised to be tough. The mindlessness and dehumanizing aspects of war are also clearly made, especially relevant in today's context [one hopes that this film will be shown at the White House...and understood there!]. Fine performances from Kidman and Jude, Hoffman and Sutherland...indeed, all give their best.  The corruption of the local Homeguard is often overlooked and it was a fine point to make.  The outstanding message seems to be that there was not a hell of a lot of romance in killing each other during the Civil War.  Hopefully, this message will be understood as being just as relevant today as it was then."

This was a side of the Civil War that was relatively unknown to me--the desperate situation back on the home front, particularly involving self-righteous individuals searching for deserters. I found the movie incredibly moving, the war scenes horrific, and the love story unbelievably touching.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Any movie that moves me to tears once earns a high rating in my book.

","Wow, what a movie! After ""Chicago"" last year, Miramax has done it again. Come Oscar time, look for Cold Mountain to get plenty of nominations - and hopefully a gold statue for Rene Zellwegger.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert has criticized Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters as being like islands, complete unto themselves. I agree; while the two are talking, you just about want to grab them and say, ""oh come on you two, start smooching already!"" <br/><br/>But if they're islands, what islands they are. ""Inman"" is, on one hand, a man so gentle he can catch birds with his bare hands, but also a cunning warrior who will kill when he has to. ""Ada"" is an upperclass lady who falls on horrible times, and does what she must to survive. Yet nevertheless she remains a lady, with skin that never loses its  soft pearlescent glow.<br/><br/>Rene Zellwegger - wow, can you imagine anyone more perfect for this part! I loved ""Ruby's"" outspoken words and manner. Yet Ruby and Ada hit it off like sisters. Their chemistry is delightful, and you sense they're having fun. Rene's chemistry with musician Jack White is also tangible, and a closing scene involving children may be prophetic. <br/><br/>There is some VERY beautiful photography in this. There is also a lot of blood. As with ""Master and Commander,"" the fighting is often point-blank and frightfully realistic. Several good people die. (Several bad people die too, happily, but still....ewwww!) Funny how you can see three James Bond films in a row and never blink an eye, and then you see this and just about reach for a glass of water. <br/><br/>My only other complaint with Cold Mountain has to do with a love scene between the lead characters. I find it too graphic, and out of harmony with the rest of the film. Inman's and Ada's love is built on faith, promises and high ideals. Likewise then, their love making should have been romantic, idealized and cloaked with mystery. <br/><br/>Frankly, it seemed like the director or somebody wanted a sex scene, so okay, they did a sex scene. Ugh. In contrast, the sex that happens earlier in the movie suits the primal nature of those characters and that situation. It seems funny to say this, but in this context, I did not want to see close-ups of Nicole Kidman's tush. <br/><br/>Whatever. Nine out of ten is still an awfully good film. Enjoy it!"
"gregsrants","8","1","1","30 December 2003"," A good movie - not a great movie
","I find it a little ironic that Cold Mountain took an English Director (Anthony Minghella), a British Actor (Jude Law), an Australian Actress (Nicole Kidman) and a supporting cast that primarily showcased a Canadian (Donald Sutherland) and an Irishman (Brendan Gleeson), to bring to the screen the best movie set during the American Civil War since 1989's Glory. Don't get me wrong, Renee Zellweger and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have probably the two most memorable roles within the movie's 155-minute frame, but it's the southerly-accent-challenged that get the most screen time. <br/><br/>
Cold Mountain is directed by Minghella (who has worked with Law and Hoffman before in The Talented Mr. Ripley), who worked from a script he adapted from the best selling novel by Charles Frazier.  The story surrounds a young woman named Ada Monrow (Kidman) who falls in love with the town handyman Inman (Law) right before the breakout of the American Civil War.  After a horrific battle with the Americans, Inman is injured and decides to dessert the army to travel back to his true love.  Back at the ranch (literally), Ada is finding the times hard.  Her father has died and Ada is unable to maintain the farm and garden.  Enter one Ruby Thewes (Zellweger) who hears of Ada's plight and attempts to show her how to cultivate the land and groom the animals in exchange for free room and board and the eating at the same table as the owner.<br/><br/>Time goes on and the movie weaves between the lives of the two central characters.  Inman continues his odyssey back to Cold Mountain, evading those that hunt deserters and running into an eclectic bunch of characters that include a sexual promiscuous priest (Hoffman), a woman and a child left lonely by the war (Natalie Portman) and a hillbilly type character (Giovanni Ribisi) that lures Inman into his self-indulgent web.<br/><br/>In contrast, Ada and Ruby continue to work the land and Ada soon becomes capable of sustaining the property on her own. We watch as they build fences together, grow crops and hunt for food.  They become friends and no sooner does Ruby confide in Ada of her abusive father, Stobrod (Gleeson) than he shows up caught in food trap on their property. Stobrod and his daughter begin to rekindle their loving relationship of old  <br/><br/>But where would a movie be without a villain, and Cold Mountain has a few in a posse of men that are out to get back land once theirs and to rid themselves of undesirable deserters within their midst.  When the posse crosses paths with Stobrod and his band, Stobrod is killed and when Inman finally returns to the warm embrace of Ada, a gunfight ensues with nary a man standing its conclusion.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain is one of those films that does everything an Oscar contender should.  It takes a bunch of good-looking, previously nominated stars puts them in a big budget war/drama/romance film with a love story that is multi-generational.  Minghella does his best with a multi-layered novel and brings to the screen characters that are both believable and enjoyable. But it is the relationship between Ada and Inman, or the lack of it, which is at the core of Cold Mountain's problems.  These two characters share but a kiss and rarely have any scenes together, so it is not very credible that they would pine for each other as they do throughout the film.   This suspension of belief alienates the audience from connecting with the two leads.  Everyone involved with the film is well cast (even and including Jena Malone as the Ferry Girl), but it is Renee Zellweger (who was a colored woman in the novel) stands head above the rest in her portrayal as the rough around the edges Rudy.  <br/><br/>I heard one critic say that `Cold Mountain is a good film, not a great film', and I can't think of a better way to describe it.  The battle sequences you will admire in the trailer play a small part in the overall production so be prepared more for a dramatic romance rather than the fight for ones true love.  That said, Cold Mountain should do quite well come Oscar nomination time.  Kidman and Zellweger are Academy favorites and Minghella has won before with The English Patient.   In a year where the best films have all been about dark and dreary subject matters (21 Grams, Mystic River), Cold Mountain may stand above them all in late February with a bunch of non-anatomically correct statues in its hand."

","A very engrossing film of the hardships of the Civil War.  While most films give us a view of the Union side of the war this gives us the opposite, showing that war brings out the worst in everyone but also their best.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were good, however I may question the casting of an Aussie to play a southern belle.  Anyway the truly great performance was given by Renee Zellweger.  I base a great performance on whether or not the actor can make you forget about anything else they have ever done (such as Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"") and she did this.  This should ensure Miss Zellweger a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, her third nomination in as many years I might add.  However this time she will win because this was by far her best performance. 8/10"

","I enjoyed this movie.  In reading some of the external reviews for this movie there seems to be universal praise for Renee Zellweger's performance and I would agree.  There also seems to be some disappointment in the fact that the two main stars are separated throughout the movie and in this I disagree.  Whereas the detractors seem upset that the movie was supposed to be a great love story, I never took it for that.  It was true that the two main protangonists are infatuated with each other in the beginning, how can that be mistaken for love.  However, each becomes the symbol to the other of the way they want the world to be and not the daily horror the war has made it.  It is clear from the beginning that Inman's home coming is going to be long delayed, and that the story is each protagonists' reaction to the war and how they managed to survived it."
"Bgb217","10","1","1","28 December 2003"," This is why movies are made. Tops my list of 2003.
","`Cold Mountain' may perhaps be the best picture of 2003. In a year of such feats as `The Station Agent' and `The Human Stain'. I think I am coming to realize, that the Civil War epic love story (sounds like it's been done before, doesn't it?) stands in a high place, maybe above those other first two. <br/><br/> You see, `Cold Mountain' is the type of movie that is rather hard to review, as there are aspects of the film and plot that one can't allude to without something being given away; with that I say, if you are an avid movie fan, and think you may want to see this film in any (even small) way, go see this art and experience it for yourself. Each performance in this movie fits into the larger puzzle in pieces, with supporting performers such as Natalie Portman or Donald Sutherland or Philip Seymour Hoffman playing their parts with a certain flawless, true and often brutal, beauty. And so it goes for the leads-each is simply spellbinding. I believe Nicole Kidman to be one of our time's greatest actors, and as Ada, one part of the epic (though unconventional) love story, gives a phenomenal performance; capturing an inexperienced character in love and life in the beginning pieces of the film, and taking that character on an amazing, harsh journey into real life and romance in the face of such terror, through the film's remainder. And Jude Law; I did not know he had this in him. I'd seen very good performances from him in `Road to Perdition' and even `The Talented Mr. Ripley', but as Ada's lover Inman, he blew me away. His accent, look, body language were all perfectly woven together in his character. As is also the case with Renee Zellwegger; of course, given the uneducated attitude one might attribute to a stereotypical `hillbilly' type of her character, it is not hard to see how some would think her performance strictly comic relief. But Ruby, her character, is so much more than all that. She's funny, she's honest, and she feels; she's human. A beauty character-in a beautiful ensemble. <br/><br/> On to the story, which has been called `uneven' by some, for reasons which include every thing to its only having one graphic strictly battle scene in the film's opening (one extremely powerful piece of cinema that effected me in a way I'm not sure I've been touched before) to Inman and Ada's relationship before the war being to brief, to the fact that Inman is a deserter, low-life, traitor of his cause. If you watch `Cold Mountain', and still think that, then I do not know what to tell you. Yes, it is about a deserter; a man who leaves the war he's fighting what is his life's love, for he yearns for life beyond the death of war and no longer wants to support anything such as the brutal ugliness of the Civil War. That is what the whole movie is about, love and life, and the pointlessness of fighting in the extreme ways of war. The story is about the people-not strictly the battle fought on the field, but of the ones fought in the soul-their love, their simplicity, their depth, their comic moments, their tragic moments; as the moments of their lives. <br/><br/> No other film this year has captured me into the state of emotional involvement, also. Though the film is something close to two and a half hours, to me it seemed nothing like the time. It did not seem short, but it was in no way `long'. It was a perfect piece of time during which I experienced some great, involving art. And while you have to see the film to understand the type of love story it is, I can tell you the love story had me entirely swept away (unlike Minghella's other major work ""The English Patient"". The final hour of the film had me, and then, I knew this was a feat of cinematic achievement regardless of the ending, and I let the film take me entirely. <br/><br/> The result was quite possibly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>
 I highly recommend you go see `Cold Mountain'. A standing ovation from me for director Anthony Minghella, leads Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellwegger; and all those involved.  Avery large, enthusiastic thumbs up."

","This movie was leading the Oscar race before it even came out--with it's budget and pedigree, it was touted as the next big epic.  No pressure...<br/><br/>It succeeded.  It's a great movie, gritty, powerful, engaging, and wonderfully directed and acted.  It's not quite amazing, but it's worthy of the attention it has received (namely by the Golden Globes).<br/><br/>As much as I love Nicole Kidman and how well she did, Renee Zellweger is the best part of the movie.  Her often humorous, yet diverse, roll was perfectly done on her part.  Jude Law was great in the roll that where all the ""gritty"" parts take place, as he is a soldier in the Civil War who escapes to travel home (treason).  Nicole Kidman tries to have a southern accent, and it slips every now and then.  I'm not sure if she was supposed to have a big one, as I think her character doesn't originally come from the south...at any rate, she's great, as usual.  While it's not as ""rangey"" of a character as past performances (namely Moulin Rouge), she takes her role and owns it, sans a perfect accent.<br/><br/>I didn't care for all the historical, not harsh, gore, but that's just me. The two and half hours don't fly by, but I was never pondering when the movie was finally going to end.  It was very well done, just short of incredible.  9/10"
"ilovedolby","9","1","1","28 December 2003"," Many great filmmaking qualities, but the melodrama of it's love story is annoying!
","`Cold Mountain' is one of those tragic love stories that director Anthony Minghella loves, like his Oscar winning film, `The English Patient.' However, unlike `The English Patient,' one does not feel swept away in the grandeur of the love story. `Cold Mountain' plays out like an overemotional romance novel turned film. Still, I cannot deny that the film has many great filmmaking qualities that to down it would be unfair. This movie is marvelous for its cinematography, direction, performances, and musical score. The film is based on the book by Charles Frazier. 	`Cold Mountain' opens with a stunning battle scene during the Civil War in which one of the characters, Inman (Jude Law) is wounded. While in hospital, he is read a letter from his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), back home in Cold Moutain by a nurse. Ada's final comment was `come back to me,' so he deserts the Confederate Army and begins his trek home. On the way, he is troubled by the memories he has of Ada, as they have only met on a few occasions but have become infatuated with each other. The same is true for Ada-she is so consumed with grief that she spends more time writing him letters and pining over him than she does taking care of her farm. On the way home, Inman meets many colorful characters that give him aid, or slow him down. One of which was Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose piety and bad habits do not mix. As for Ada, a young woman named Ruby (Renee Zellweger) approaches her. Ruby has a cocky attitude and hardy nature that bring about some of the film's more whimsical moments. She wants nothing more from Ada than a home and food. The two agree and get the farm back in order. But there are problems in Cold Mountain-the sheriff is on a mission to kill anyone who may harbor deserters of the Confederacy. Ada, Ruby, and Inman will have to face the righteousness of the law before all is said and done. I was not impressed by Reverend Veasey's character, regardless of Hoffman's excellent performance. He added distaste to the film when at that point it was based on noble characters. However, Inman also met two other women during his travels. One of them was named Sara (Natalie Portman), a woman whose husband had died and she was now alone to fend for herself and her newborn son. Portman portrays her grief so effectively that it pulls at the audience's heart. Especially during a scene when she asks Inman to sleep in her bed with her so she will not be alone. Nothing sexual occurs, but it was a nice touch to give this woman something to feel after she had been alone for so long. Another interesting character that Inman meets is an elderly woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who looks after him-she lives in the woods, in a shack and raises goats. She provides Inman with medicine and food for his journey. What's more, she also provides understanding of Inman's heartache for his beloved. `Cold Mountain's' one weakness is its melodrama-it becomes irritating at times and one cannot help but want it to end. In one scene, Ada and Inman confess their love and want to get married by saying `I'll marry you' three times, as they do in some strange land unknown to them. Give me a break! It is a good thing that the film can fall back on so much filmmaking majesty as opposed to its overbearing love story. ***1/2"
"gcrokus","8","1","1","28 December 2003"," Nice Acting
","This movie, suffering a just a little from the semi-believability of the plot (a tale set in modern times and loosely based on real events; the real and somewhat less than heroic desertion a centerpiece for rumination), is nonetheless engaging and so well cast, acted and filmed it deserves a viewing.  The fans of ""Dances With Wolves"" will be delighted as well as those enamored of the Odysseyan journey-film, sure always to be populated with oddball characters, punctuated with humorous moments and almost always senseless violence.   ""Dead Man"" seems to be the only film of the recent past with the feel of ""Cold Mountain"", though the earlier film had more bizarre events than are recorded in the latter.  But here we must note the attractiveness of the cast in ""Cold Mountain"".  Renee would look great in a burlap sack, and Jude Law and Nicole are of the same ilk. The battle scenes are all quite good, although it is a bit of a stretch to think Inman would find his documents so readily after so horrendous an explosion.  And for the life of me I cannot determine how the ""turkey shoot"" devolved into a hand-to-hand combat situation within a few frames of film. Inman's journey (oddly from inland to coast to inland) expressly exploits the ""Dead Man"" aspect (or more recently ""Oh Brother.."") view of travels cross country.  Note the completely rural setting of all the scenes; even in the U.S. of the 1860's it would be difficult to steer such a course.  Not on any occasion is a large town sighted. There is more than enough good writing to offer us some laughs, but for certain Ms. Zellwegger steals the show.  Her portrayal of a country girl of resource and unbounded energy (I don't offhand remember anyone filmed walking so bouncily)is such a pleasure to watch almost anyone in the camera with her seems to be in a support role."
"chasehunterj","9","1","1","6 January 2004"," This movie was just plain good.
","Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger all put a great deal of effort into this film and it has paid off well. I think critics will agree that Law is one of the better actors in this 21st century... oh yeah, and not bad at the box office either. Inman really seems like a reasonably realistic person of the time. The only problem in my mind, is would even a woman of the civil war times stick around for a man who she has seen for a very brief period of time and has kissed only once? That struck me as odd, but in the long run... I was not dissapointed when my sister dragged me into this one. B+ for this one."

","This is a terrific film mainly because it is based upon a good story, with solid acting.  One of the things I like about Cold Mountain is the fact that it gives a personal view of war's effect on ordinary people.  The essential elements of any such story are the chaos of created by war, the goodness and humanity of some people, and the cruelty and opportunism of others."
"Nic_JudeROX","10","1","1","4 January 2004"," Much better than I expected.. I mean, WOW
","Cold Mountain was such a great movie! In fact, it's my favorite movie of the year, maybe even my favorite movie of all time. It was almost perfect, with the great directing and amazing performances. Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zelwegger make a magnificent team. They did such a great job that affected the movie in a good way.<br/><br/>I don't know why people were saying that Law and Kidman lacked chemistry in the movie. I thought they had a perfectly good chemistry in the movie that made it even better. Jude Law really surprised me on this one. I never knew he had the talent to pull this off. I thought he was perfectly cast. I can't imagine Tom Cruise (who was supposed to play Inman) to play this role. Jude deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance of a lifetime.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman, on the other hand, was also good, although I liked her better in Moulin Rouge and The Hours. She delivered a great performance, as usual, but  she kinda messed up on her southern accent. Renee Zelwegger HAS to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this movie. She just HAS to. She was perfect as Ruby Thewes. Natalie Portman, in my opinion, delivered her best performance so far in her career. You can actually feel her pain and her love for her husband, who died in the war, and her baby (who was, by the way, HUGE!). I think that Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zelwegger all deserve Oscar nominations, and hopefully wins.<br/><br/>Ok, about the love scene. It was... um.. weird and confusing. It's not like any love scenes you see in other movies. It was confusing too because one moment they're standing up and Nicole is naked, next they're lying down and Nicole isn't naked. Then they're standing again and she's naked, then they're lying and she's not naked. blah blah blah. I dunno about the love scene. I thought that it was uneccessary to show Nicole's butt twice. I didn't see the reason or the point of showing it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked this movie because you can relate to Inman as he travels home to Ada. You can tell that he's really, really, really, really, really in love with Ada, and vice versa. It was amazing how they didn't lose hope and how they remained faithful to each other even though they only shared three or four moments at the beginning. And that kiss. That kiss looked... WOW. I'd kiss Jude in a heartbeat. It was that kiss that helped him survive through the war, and with the help of Ada's picture.<br/><br/>This movie deserves all eight nominations it got for the Golden Globes. I'm rooting for this movie to win the Best Picture award for the Globes AND the Oscars.<br/><br/>I give this movie two thumbs up! ***** out of *****! 10 out of 10! A+"

"alanjj","10","1","1","13 January 2004"," Much more vivid and enthralling than the book
","I read the book and found it tedious.  The movie, though, is magnificent. The author, Charles Frazier, seems like one of these guys who really gets into describing everything--each action, each button, each leaf.  As well as the thoughts of the characters about these items.  Now, part of the plot is about the importance of knowing the names of things (Ruby knows the names of everything; Ada knows the names of nothing; Ada becomes one with her new land when she knows what things are called).  But reading this stuff was a horror, while watching it played out in widescreen technicolor with wonderful actors made it a fascinating element of a grand movie.<br/><br/>The battle scene in the book is practically un-envisioned.  It's a vague memory in the mind of Inman, which he wants to forget.  The directors wisely decided to include a battle scene, and it is one of the best ever.  Two segments in particular--where the US troops appear out of the smoke, and where the troops get trapped in a ditch and a ""turkey shoot"" begins--are among the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Visualizing the battle scenes makes the character of Inman seem so much more real.  You get a full sense of the horror he's experienced.  All his other actions afterward are understandable and seem trivial compared with the horror that happened all around him.<br/><br/>The book did one scenario a lot better than the flick:  Inman's transition from a soldier to a deserter is poetic in the book, mundane in the movie. Inman is in a hospital, looking out the window toward Cold Mountain.  One day, he feels that he must go back to Cold Mountain.  He wills himself from the hospital room out into the world beyond the window.  The window goes from a frame for something distant, to a gateway to Inman's new reality. The movie treats this as an ordinary escape from captivity to a tenuous freedom, whereas the book made it magic.<br/><br/>But the movie has so much other magic--it contains the best Phillip Seymour Hoffman performance ever--he's the perfect clergyman with  no scruples. Eileen Atkins as the frontier woman who can fend for herself is memorable.<br/><br/>Especially great was Rene Zellwegger--it's a role meant for Mary Steenburgen or Holly Hunter, and she plays it to perfection. It's hard to believe she was ever the star of a splashy musical.  She embodies the self-sufficient country woman, and deserves Oscar No. 2."
"travisimo","10","1","1","13 January 2004"," A Gritty Look Back
","If there was anything that really stuck out to me in Cold Mountain, it was the beautiful imagery.  The scenery was just amazing, and you really get a sense that you are looking at a Civil War-era South.  Some may complain that this movie lacked compassion or chemistry, but wasn't life back then a lot more restricted than it is now?<br/><br/>I thought the actors did a tremendous job, but it was the side characters that really stole the show.  Natalie Portman gave a very strong performance in a small, but powerful scene.  Philip Seymour Hoffman provided some surprising comic relief as did Renee Zellwegger who really shined as a tomboy who resurrects Nicole Kidman's broken down ranch.  In fact, I'd say Renee deserves an Oscar for this role, but that's not for me to decide.<br/><br/>The movie is a little long, but you come to appreciate the struggle Jude Law's character goes through as he treks miles to reunite with Nicole Kidman, all while being hunted down as a traitor.  I imagine this story isn't that far from the truth.  Life was quite different back then, as I noted earlier, and probably more ruthless, so it wouldn't surprise me that some people were hunted down like dogs.<br/><br/>So overall, this is a very powerful flick.  It gives you a true sense of what life was like back then, and it's another adaption of the classic Odyssey tale that just never gets old.<br/><br/>My IMDb Score: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)"

Renee is so funny and spunky. Lots of oddball characters and B list star cameos.  My favorite was Natalie Portman in a heartbreaking performance.  Best war battle scene of 2003 ( the turkey shoot in the bomb crater ).  I didn't think Minghella had it in him to display such intense, in-your-face carnage.

"Alex_Glass","9","1","1","3 January 2004"," A Review of Cold Mountain
","*Slight spoilers but if any one has read a review of this film, they will probably know them all ready*<br/><br/>Synopsis: Cold Mountain tells the story of Inman (Jude Law), a wounded Confederate soldier fighting in the American Civil War, and his journey home to meet his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Meanwhile, Ada is struggling to maintain her father's farm since he passed away. That is , until farm hand Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwger) comes along.<br/><br/>Many people have dismissed Cold Mountain as being boring and too romantic. Just because it is not an 'indie' film, it has rescieved mixed reviews. In fact, it is an excellent example of an epic and it is easy to see why the all star cast chose to star in this movie. It features drama, comedy, action and romance and is a movie and is a movie most people can enjoy.<br/><br/>Inman's journey is similar to Homer's Oddysey and the colourful cast of characters he meets along the way are almost as interesting as the three leads. Natalie Portman in particular shines as a young widow. The two plot threads, Inman's journey home and Ada maintaining the farm, could stand alone quite easily. As much I liked Inman's action-packed voyage back to Cold Mountain, I thought the scenes with Renee and Nicole were more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Ada loosing her reverend father, played by Donald Sutherland, is the first major emotional scene and it is done well without being cheesy. The introduction of Zellweger perks up the film. Her character is definatley the most interesting character and she is sure to win the Oscar this year. When first introduced, it is hard to understand her dialogue and it appears Zellweger is going for easy laughs by portraying stereotypes. Within about three minutes these thoughts are abolished and she helps to make the film more enjoyable. People who have seen it will know what I mean, especially on the 'bag of diamonds' scene. Ruby helps to make the emotional scenes less schmaltzy. Nicole portrays a subtle performance in Ada and proves once again why she is the greatest current actress in Hollywood. Ada's and Ruby's struggle to rebuild the farm complements Inman's chapters of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Cold Mountain is a marvel in film making and is one of this years best films. The three leads are excellent, as are the supporting players and cameos. Cold Mountain is well directed and well made. My only fault is that it could have been edited slightly but the time passes quickly anyway. 9/10"

"varenya1","5","1","1","2 January 2004"," Thinly Disguised Chick Flick
","Despite the ads showing the Battle of the Crater, anything looking like the Civil War only appears in the first few minutes of the film. The rest of this depressing film has the feel of a western. The plot is episodic, with Inman drifting from one encounter with a colorful character (more colorful than him) to another.  None of these encounters propel the plot or change him.  Meanwhile, the perpetually glamorous Ada, looking like nothing from the 1860's, is given a lesson in how to survive by Ruby. Aside from feminist feel-good, what does this have to do with the theme of waiting for Inman? Speaking of which, there's no explanation of why the two are so intent on reestablishing a relationship based on one kiss. Is she a beacon of comfort for a brutalized war veteran?  Is he the only eligible batchelor in the back woods? The movie doesn't address motives aside from a patently ridiculous romantic obsession.  And then there's the villains. The Home Guard seems to enjoy killing every stranger they find. Why?  What's in it for them?  The movie is handsome, it seems to have a grand theme, whatever it may be, and looks like a serious, major film. Problem is, the movie isn't really about anything other than two people getting back together. The grander themes of the Civil War, such as liberty or self-determination, don't play into it. In fact, if it weren't for the occasional grossly brutal scene, it would be boring.  What was Minghella thinking?"
"twyllie","10","1","1","2 January 2004"," An excellent drama that captures the dangers of the day
","Civil War films are of particular personal interest because of my many forbears who fought and died defending their homes.  The film opens with a dramatic re-enactment of the horrific Battle of the Crater. The necessary meanness that comes with combat is seen on both sides as well as acts of personal heroism. The Crater foreshadows the bloody battles of WWI and re-enactors will be engrossed. It is, however, a film about a Southerner's dangerous road home whether it was before or after the Surrender.<br/><br/>Jude Law's performance is extraordinary.  Up until the 1950s when roads came to NC's mountains, people spoke a dialect closely resembling 18th century English; so his articulation is effective as this would have resembled the language spoken in England at that time.  He also captures the sense of the strong, quiet mountain man who is a formidable adversary but inept in the language of love. Zellweger's performance also celebrates the virtues and determination of a woman from the Smokies.  Her dialect, expression, and sentiments capture the heart of the clever and quick witted Carolinian of the day. There has been no better performance by a supporting actress. While most of the characters rely on 'types', those that are developed are well done.  The licentiousness of some characters seems a bit over the top. For example, the murderous minister's character (not the father) is the exception rather than the rule. Read Glasgow's ""Barren Ground"" for an accurate, fictional depiction of white landowners relationships with African Americans.<br/><br/>The film's use of folk music is effective and helps develop the audience's understanding of Cole Mountain.  Was  surprised that the director did not use ""Imogene"" or ""In the Pines"" for the song played in the hospital.<br/><br/>The announcement of war in the film is poorly done and unfair to Western North Carolinians.  If they celebrated they would have sung ""Dixie"" (a song I heard played at the end of every major evening event followed by hurrahs until about 1970, which is an appropriate time for that custom to die). The idiotic, visceral hollaring about war is just that. Many opposed the war. One forebear from a tobacco growing region argued in county debates in 1861 to remain with the Union. When defeated in debate he enlisted as a private to defend his homeland. In 1864, North Carolina's gubernatorial debate centered on whether or not to re-enter The Union. The secessionists narrowly won the election. And she was the state who lost more men in the conflict than any other Southern state. But many other parts ring true. Great-great uncle Vann died at the age of 12 as a bugle boy. All we have is a tin type of him in his uniform. Great-great Uncle Bill was murdered by a scalawag while trying to return home.  It was a time of great nobility of spirit and base profiteering.  Very few people today in either the North or South understand the ethos of the players in the War Between the States and this film brings us a bit closer, if by way of metaphor rather than history. The best still remains ""Birth of a Nation"".<br/><br/>There is much more to be said for than against this film."

","I read the book Cold Mountain, and it is a wonderful book well written, haunting and emotionally involving.  I usually am deeply disappointed when I see a movie based on a book I've read.  Not this time!!!  This is a 2.5 hour plus movie, and not once did I look at my watch.  Anthony Minghella beautifully captured the feeling of the book, which is a somewhat surrealistic journey for Inman through all of the faces of evil temptation and a test of his inner strength and determination.  It also captures the trials of Ada as she struggles to learn to become useful in spite of her sheltered upbringing, and to hold onto her belief that Inman will return, and to overcome the dark designs of the local ""home guard"" soldiers. <br/><br/>
See this movie, it is haunting, uplifting and moving.  Also, read the book, because Charles Frazier is a masterful writer, and no movie could quite capture the beautiful quality of his use of the language."

","'Cold Mountain' is a fantastic movie about a journey home to a loved one. Nicole Kidman is my favorite actress, but however is not the best in this movie, she is good, but its Renee who steals the show. Renee is a hillybilly who brings some laughs to the movie.

Ruby helps ada on the farm and with all things she needs to survive. jude law plays inman who needs to travel from the civil war to be with ada. 'Cold Mountain' is a beautiful motion picture that has already got 8 golden globes under its belt and will have lots of oscar nominations.

"rcavellero","8","1","1","1 January 2004"," SUPRISINGLY WARM MOUNTAIN!
","Cold Mountain is just full of suprises. I must say tht I did not completely enjoy this film. But I liked it alot.  I found it to be very creative and involving.  The love story aspect of the film isn't particularly invovlving but what the film does succeed at is showing the loss that war brings on. On all accounts, from loves to families to lands.  The horror of war is very apparent in a film that fills it's moments with constantly changing charachters, weird humor, and a war torn land. Some of the suprise pop ups include Natalie Portman showing her acting chops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, The sexy guy from 28 days later, the guy from the white stripes and etc. The real reason I went to see Cold Mountain is for Nicole Kidman and although her porcelain presence and timeless acting are just as good as ever. Her role just isn't enough to sustain a real powerful performance. However Renee Zellwegger is the extreme stand out performance, with a rocky sense of humor and times of melodramtic overacting she contains into a heartfelt performance. Hottie Jude Law also does a fine job showing his charachter's complexities as he goes from one emotion to another. From acceptance to despair, from love to hate.  The film takes place during the last quarter of the civil war as Law and Kidman are seperated as he goes off to war. She longs for him as her father dies and he realizes the horrors of war.  She tries to keep the farm in shape as the local villain tries to take it from her, and she slips into lonliness from having no one and nothing. The war takes it tolls on everyone and everything and Renee Zellwegger enters as a young hard working woman whom decides to help Kidman. The only strong chemistry is those formed from friendships. The kidman Law love triste lacks it but they certainly look great together. Making probably the most sexy couple on film of the year! Cold Mountain doesn't draw any real tears besides a watery eye it remains overly warm and even though it's quite depressing it manages to leave you in good reassuring spirits."

Cold Mountain is not that good but it is very good in its own right.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is really growing as an actor and her work grows proportionally.  But the real gem in this film is Renee Zellweger. She is a lock for a lot of awards for this role.<br/><br/>The film is beautiful and sweeping in scope and short a few nit-picking things about a lot of sing song sessions going on when danger lurked around every corner from the ""home guard""...but as I say,... that is splitting hairs.  This is a wonderful movie.  Go see it!"
"jenjen21","10","1","1","11 January 2004"," Stayed in my mind for days after.
","Cold Mountain is truely haunting. The acting is impeccable. Renee Zellweger was unexplainably brilliant as Ruby Thewes. She completely stole the show as the loud and seemingly emotionless drifter. Nicole, as always, was brilliant, but I couldnt help but feel that Renee totally overpowered her.<br/><br/>
The film was extraordinary with a great script. I was reduced to tears on more than one occasion, the film moved me immensley. From each heart breaking letter that Ada (Nicole Kidman) sent to Inman (Jude Law) to each step Inman took to get home to his love. The ending wasn't 'typical Hollywood' and was one of the most powerful ending's I have seen in a film for a long time. <br/><br/>I would highly reccomend this film to every one who has ever been love and every one who wants to know just how important family and friends are. This film will be one that lingers in my mind for years to come."
"willrams","9","1","1","10 January 2004"," Historical & Romantic
","It is based on a romance after the Civil War. It is a terrific story, but it took me half an hour to really get into it.  The first part was a bit boring but once I caught on (too many flashbacks), it became very exciting and heartbreaking.  Compared to Gone With the Wind, I'd say Cold Mountain is much better.  Now I know what all the hoorays are about; Nicole Kidman was terrific as well as her leading man Jude Law, and what a strange love affair they did have.  But the one who stole the show was Renee Zellweger.  In fact it took me half an hour to realize who the actress was; playing a distinctly different role, that of a strong self-willed southern gal, she stole the show as well as my heart.  If anyone gets an award, Renee Zellweger should definitely be that one to get it.  The war scenes are brutal and bloodthirsty, but they do not take long, thankfully, and the rest of the two and a half hour show is definitely a must see.  The musical score is mostly piano which I do like, and there are a couple of hillbilly character songs in it.  It's also at least a one hanky film if you are a sentimentalist. 9/10"
"erialc","8","1","1","26 December 2003"," The love epic of the year
","Having read a great deal about the film during its production, I have to admit that Cold Mountain was my most anticipated movie of the year. Now, having finally seen it, I'm pleased to say that not only did it live up to my expectations; it has exceeded them in many occasions.<br/><br/>
Through its portrayal of the brutality of war, Cold Mountain more importantly conveys a powerful love story that transcends distance.<br/><br/>Aside from the breathtaking cinematography that takes us into the world of Cold Mountain, director Anthony Minghella yet again managed to assemble such a group of talents as his leading characters. Because so many have already commented on the scene-stealing performance given by Renee Zellweger, let us focus on the other two, more subdued, performances given by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. We should observe things from a different perspective. Unlike Ruby, Inman and Ada are much more introverted. They do not easily reveal their emotions through gesture or speech; instead, they most often communicate silently through their eyes that convey the sense of hope, of despair, and most importantly of love.<br/><br/>In addition, worth mentioning is that even though the two lovers, separated by war, are not to be seen in the same scene for the majority of the film, Minghella, through his juxtaposition of certain scenes, hints a sense of an emotional interaction between Inman and Ada. These poignant yet subtle details are what convince the audience of the reality and the passions of the love between these two characters."
"WCS02","10","1","1","26 December 2003"," I'll bet Charles Frazier has to be as pleased with the translation of his extraordinary work ...
","A brilliant film.   The book was fresh, original and `tight' as stories go. On film, it's the best love story since West Side Story.  There's plenty of killin' and explosions to keep the story moving for the guys.  If Minghella decides to release a 3 hour director's cut, I will buy a copy.  Seinfeld had fewer eccentric characters than this gem.  I did not want it to end.  And then it did  brilliantly again.<br/><br/>Every actor hit their marks.  Kidman has been exceptional for years Jude Law finds his talent here.  Both will get nominations.  Supporting: Zellweger, Portman and Hoffman are brilliant  Brilliant!  especially Zellweger and Hoffman.  Renee's worth the price of admission all by her lonesome.  <br/><br/>Cold Mountain is a beautiful place to be.  True love is a beautiful thing to have.   Against the backdrop of war's horror  the brief life spans of the day  the inability of mail getting through, forcing those starving for a lover's words to cling to a single sentence, or a memory when words are unavailable  . . . these are things to be treasured.   Only those with dry-ice frosting in their veins can't see it.<br/><br/>Favorite parts:  That the characters think / speak like they would in the era (as I imagine it anyway).   1860s South.  Zellweger and Hoffman are best in supporting roles.  The war is portrayed as realistically as I've ever seen it.  The war photography is gritty  real  the war action is painful and morally split - like a bayonet to the gut.   Remedies to repair damaged flesh are fresh out of Granny Clampett's doctorin' bag.  Dirty fingernails: the standard of the day.   I'll bet Charles Frazier is as pleased with the translation as I am.  10 / 10."

","Cold Mountain is a very moving and powerful movie. I was most impressed with Anthony Minghella's ability to clearly capture the emotional plight of a variety of characters on screen. Jude Law was great as Inman. The internal nature of this character makes this an extremely difficult role, and Jude succeeded most of the time in conveying the emotions of Inman. Nicole Kidman was good but not great in her role as Ada Monroe. I thought the accent and the fact that she is Nicole Kidman made her seem out of place at time, but overall she gives an effective performance. Her transformation and ability to not beg for sympathy from the viewers was most impressive to me. Rene Zellweger really stole the show. She was in total control of her character (Ruby Thewes) and served as not only witty but really spiritual relief. Her character was so complex and well developed it was very easy to forget the fact that she was being played by Rene. The supporting cast (Kathy Baker, Natalie Portman, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brendan Gleeson, Eileen Adkins) in general was incredible. They really shaped the movie as a whole. Overall I believe the message of this movie came through in a strong and powerful way. A true must see 9/10."

"peacefrogx","9","1","1","27 December 2003"," did Minghella even read the book?
","First off - let me state that I enjoyed this film very much. Now...<br/><br/>let me begin my rant.  I understand that every book or novel that is turned into a movie is subject to screenplay interpretations and revisions;  a custom tailoring, if you will.  But in the beginning, at the very touchstone of any screenplay of a successful novel, there must be the essence of the author's intention by which to proceed forward from.  In the case of ""Cold Mountain"" it is just that - Cold Mountain.  The book's central theme - it's essence - was Inman's love of home and longing for it's simpler life (back in Cold Mountain, NC) and THEN his love for Ada.  I'm not downplaying that a major major theme of the book was the lovestory of Inman for Ada and vice-verca - and of course, the movie played that to the hilt.  However, to ignore or at the very most make scant reference to, Inman's love of home and life back in Cold Mountain does the book and the moviegoer a great injustice.<br/><br/>Another theme (a central one at that) was Inman's abhorrence to the war and his own disgust with himself for his loss of innocence through his horrific experiences.  I understand the time restrictions and limitations of film, but to barely develop the author's true characterization of Inman will leave those who did not read the book prior to seeing the film at a loss of why Inman was such a righteous man BEFORE the war.<br/><br/>It's interesting to think what Minghella would have done if given Homer's The Odyssey instead of Cold Mountain to direct.  Would he choose to ignore the near god-like status that Homer betroths upon Odysseus throughout his epic and rush to  put him in the sack with Kidman's fair-headed Penelope? Would he skip the Sirens and the Lotus Eaters in favor of a more violent encounter with the Swineherd?<br/><br/>Probably."

I mean, name the last chick flick where two men cut up a cow in 'chapters' so that it could be moved more easily?<br/><br/>Also, the near three hours of the movie seemed to go by like minutes.  I could have gone through another hour or so.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give Cold Mountain a 9/10"

Overall, a fabulous story with remarkable direction by Anthony Minghella and powerful acting.  The uncommon fidelity of the lovers makes this movie unique among love stories, although the superficiality of the relationship made it a bit less than it could have been.

Things are done which are totally out of context or totally out of sequence.<br/><br/>The scenery is the films strong point, the rest of it is a pretty lame effort.

There was absolutely no true romantic chemistry between Kidman and Law, nor was there any build up for their relationship. I did not feel connected to any of the characters, and there were way too many of them with very short life span, as if the director was trying to con us into liking the movie based on its size. The movie did not move me in any way. It didn't make me feel sad, funny, excited, or entertained. I simply didn't care. Rarely has a movie made me feel so indifferent about its plot or any of its characters. It is worse than day-time soap operas. Cold Mountain wasn't just cold, it was devoid of any redeeming qualities."
"sddavis63","2","3","6","5 April 2008"," Both Pointless And Charmless, But It Does Have Renee Zellweger
","Essentially, this movie could have chosen to move in one of two ways: either as a war movie, depicting the agony that the Civil War wrought upon the South and its citizens, or as a romance, depicting the agony of lovers separated by war and uncertain whether they'll ever see each other again. In the end, it tries to do both, with the emphasis being on the romance, and, in the end, I found neither part of the story - which seemed to me to jump around far too much, giving it an unfocused feel - either convincing or compelling. The challenges faced by the South are realistically portrayed, particularly with the emphasis on the ""Home Guard"" - a group of Southerners tasked with the job of searching down deserters and those sheltering them, and who, as the war approached its inevitable conclusion, chose to abuse their positions to satisfy their own desires rather than to fulfill their admittedly distasteful job. This part of the story was often brutal - perhaps realistically so - but it left me rather empty to be honest.<br/><br/>As to the romance, it struck me as both forced and artificial. Neither Ada (Nicole Kidman) nor Inman (Jude Law) came across to me as star-crossed lovers, although I suppose that the point of the movie was that it was their love for each other that gave them hope, and the strength to get through their trials. Still, neither character really connected with me. The one character I did like was Ruby (Renee Zellweger) although, to be honest, it wasn't so much the character that appealed to me as it was Zellweger playing the character. Zellweger is a fine actress who seems to be able to take on any role in any type of movie and make it work. As to Law and Kidman, neither appealed to me. Law seemed flat, and Kidman, who is a very beautiful woman, nevertheless generally underwhelms me with her performances.<br/><br/>For Zellweger's performance alone, 2/10"
"moviemanMA","7","3","6","21 July 2005"," Zellweger steals the show
","Some movies has great acting that make the movie. This is a perfect example. Without Renee Zellweger giving an Oscar winning performance, this movie would not have been enjoyable. Her portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough talking farm girl who doesn't take nothing' from nobody. It was this character that saved the movie.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the journey taken by Inman (Jude Law) on his way back from the Civil War to find his lover Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On this journey he comes across some unsavory characters and has to tough it out to find his way back to Ada. Meanwhile, Ada must keep try and keep the farm with the help of Ruby. Ada doesn't know much about farming but since her father just passed away, she must make it or break it. Hiding two deserters from the war, one being Ruby's father, doesn't make things easier with the local law enforcement always keeping an eye out on the area for people hiding deserters.<br/><br/>This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't unbelievable either. If it weren't for Zellweger's performance, the movie would not be even close to the caliber of greatness. It is a good watch with some thrills and entertaining portions. The journey that Inman embarks on isn't an easy one and does have its surprises. Overall Cold Mountain is worth a viewing but may not be the right choice to buy. This film isn't for everyone but for those who like great acting, this is the place."

"Sabriane","6","3","6","2 January 2004"," Beautiful-looking and compelling in parts, but falls short of greatness
","This film is a sad reminder that an impeccable pedigree does not guarantee an impeccable result. Great cast, a powerful story, amazing cinematography, a director whose previous two films I enjoyed immensely - so why does this movie feel so underwhelming and hollow?<br/><br/>Well, the biggest obstacle for me is the central relationship of Inman and Ada. I love Jude Law and Nicole Kidman, but their scenes together are the weakest link that ultimately undoes the chain. In a film where your star-crossed lovers spend most of the time apart, it is crucial that one believes in their love and wishes for them to get back together, and that's just something the film fails to do completely. One could blame the fact that Ada and Inman spend barely any time together before they're torn apart by the war, but when you come down to it I simply felt no chemistry whatsoever between them. There's far more sparkles flying between the characters of Renee Zellwegger and Jack White, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>On their own, Law and Kidman fare with varying results. Kidman's Ada turned out to be a far more sympathetic character than I expected her to be, and her growth from a helpless and clueless house plant into a self-sufficient farmer is convincing even if not exactly demanding. Jude Law tries hard to inject some humanity into Inman, but his supposed suffering over the horrors he's seen and done never really rings true.<br/><br/>It is also a problem IMO when your main characters are getting constantly upstaged by the far more interesting supporting players. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is fantastic (as always) as a fallen priest who tries to commit a murder. I noticed that people either love or hate Renee Zellwegger's plucky Ruby. For my part I was initially distracted by her over-acting and the way every word comes out of her mouth like a pistol shot, but she definitely injects some energy and no-nonsense humour into the film. It's a flamboyant and showy part that is bound to get awards, but for my money the best supporting moment belongs to Natalie Portman as a single mother struggling to survive all by herself in the woods. The scenes with her are the most poignant and hard-hitting in the film and really make you feel that the horror and cruelties and senseless waste of war is not confined to the battlefields.<br/><br/>Unfortunately all this good stuff is not enough to give Cold Mountain a true emotional core, or make it the sweeping epic it clearly strives to be."

And even Sutherland's character comes off as being a rather simple-minded preacher, who doesn't have the decency to provide for Kidman after he is gone. <br/><br/>So, ladies, all men are oafs, at best, except for that one ideal man of your dreams, in this case Inman, who is easily manipulated by a pretty, scheming woman.

So, naturally, Ada falls in love with such a malleable man. This is romance? <br/><br/>And all the women are good, caring, honest, hard working, and detest the violence of war. Except for the hillbilly family, in which case they are drunken whores. <br/><br/>All hillbillies are stupid and have bad manners, and almost all Southerners who live outside the city are hillbillies, with poor hygiene (contrasted with Kidman, who always looks like she is fresh from a cosmetics ad shoot). But Zellweger is a hillbilly who is not a complete moron -- she can count to 20 and spell ""catastrophe""! She is the most interesting person in the film, but, sadly, she, too, is the victim of stereotype and exaggeration. <br/><br/>In Cold Mountain, we've got cartoonish caricatures masquerading as people, much like The Beverly Hillbillies. And, like Titanic, we've got a black and white world of either very good, saintly people -- the women plus Inman -- or very evil, sadistic, stupid people -- the men.<br/><br/>Plus, we've got the all-too-brief romantic love affair that is too perfect to ever survive on Earth, just like Titanic. So, it sounds like a formula for a chick flick.<br/><br/>Except, we've got unnecessarily graphic and gruesome violence, including animals being killed on camera. This is normally not allowed in American movies. The only other time I can recall this sort of thing is in British movies, and Anthony Minghella is a British director, so perhaps he thinks is all right to linger over the slaughter of a goat, as though it is art. It is not. <br/><br/>The way Minghella treats people is far worse, and sometimes almost laughable. Like three Yankee soldiers who threaten to kill a baby if her mother doesn't tell them where her pig is. Yeah, war is heck and there was plenty of looting, but this defies credibility. <br/><br/>And those home guard sadists are also beyond credibility, especially that blonde acrobatic sadist. The movie would have you believe these were the last men left in town and so the women were helpless. In North Carolina, especially along the Blue Ridge, there was less sympathy for slavery, and not every male was of draft age. Plus, in the South you could pay $300 and not have to fight. <br/><br/>As to slavery, the cause of the war, we do not see any actual slaves working or even talking, beyond one slave helping the Confederate army, who is treated so politely by Southerners you would think he was the town banker! Yeah, right. <br/><br/>Anthony Minghella resorts to time shifting in the beginning of the film, from present to future, and back to the past. It is interesting for a little while, but once you set up the film, enough is enough. This goes on for about a half hour, which is so lacking in momentum it is sorely tempting to time shift to a baseball game. <br/><br/>When I see this I begin to suspect the plot is too weak to survive a linear unfolding. In this case, we have boy meets girl, boy is separated from girl, boy overcomes insurmountable odds to return to girl. So the plot is a bit thin. But it is not as paper thin as ""An English Patient,"" which, once you straighten out the story line, doesn't actually have a story line.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie we have to endure cuts between Inman's Homeric odyssey of endless trials and tribulations on a 250 mile trek home, and Kidman's penniless struggle for survival. Talk about an exhausting movie! <br/><br/>Kidman's is the more interesting side; the story of the three women banding together to endure the war is by far the most interesting part of the picture, but, sadly, is marred by absurd exaggeration, including the near lynching of Maddy by the home guard. The extreme sadism reminds me of another foreign-created American ""historical"" movie, ""The Patriot."" <br/><br/>Like Titanic, there is a gratuitous graphic love scene that does not live up to the build up. Half-clothed, half-porn, all awkward, it seems to be there for the teenage girls, just like Titanic. Inman is in (Ada). We see the climax, and the result is a posthumous girl. Leaving it to the viewer's imagination would have been far more effective. <br/><br/>The cinematography is beautiful, though it would have been more beautiful if it had actually been filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the recreation of this historical epoch is thorough enough, like Titanic, that you assume the rest of the movie is historically accurate. But like Titanic, the people do not ring true. <br/><br/>Minghella's instincts may have proved true to the extent that foreigners would love a film that portrays most Americans, North and South, as stupid sadists. To foreigners, this film, sadly, might seem totally realistic. (Kaori Shoji, writing in The Japan Times, was one of the few reviewers to see through this movie's stereotypes.) It is not. Cold Mountain is no more realistic than a comic book."

","This is probably my shortest ever review for any film.<br/><br/>There is one spectacular battle at the start: grim, grimy and grueling and showing what war means: death all around. Technically well done, but nothing new. Quite a few war films in the last twenty years showed it equally well, or better: Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), The Thin Red Line (1998). Whew, even Gone With The Wind (1939) is a far better story.<br/><br/>This movie is death to the senses, however, because it's what you can get when you mix genres: is it a love story during war or is it a war story that shows love is still possible? Either way, it's a dull, dull, dull story. The characters are dull, and the acting is dull. <br/><br/>Which is all quite surprising from the late director of The English Patient (1996), a much superior film and story, in my opinion. Just proves, however, that you need a good story before you can make a good movie, especially when set during wartime. <br/><br/>Cold Mountain, however, reminded me of the tedium of another war movie, Battle Cry (1955). And for a more credible love story set in war, see From Here To Eternity (1953)<br/><br/>So, don't bother to see the rest of Cold Mountain after that first battle, unless you like long flashbacks, long interludes and voice-overs that serve merely to send you to sleep.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't even recommend seeing it, even the first big battle. It's just not worth your time."
"triple8","6","3","7","19 March 2006"," breathtaking visuals,moving story but the film itself was tough to watch.
","SPOILERS: <br/><br/>Cold Mountain was a film I tried to see when it first played on the big screen but didn't manage to get to the theater. It's been playing on television lately so I sat down to watch. I didn't like it all that much even though it was very moving.<br/><br/>The visuals, featured in this film, almost defy description. They were absolutely breathtaking, to the point where one could turn the sound down and just watch the film to let the photography envelop you. The landscapes were an absolute dream and the film was definitely moving.<br/><br/>So WHY didn't I like this? Well first off, is the length. This is a very long movie and moves very very slowly so one really has to be in the right frame of mind when they sit down to watch it. Also, as anyone who knows the plot would know, it is a very sad picture and that element, coupled with the very long length, and slow pacing makes it rather difficult to enjoy.<br/><br/>It is also very violent in many areas which again, most, who know the plot would know when sitting down to watch it, since it is about war.But there were other elements I had problems with. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law did not have any on screen chemistry, and, though Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses working today, I felt she was miscast. She was supposed to be exhausted and despairing on a farm, yet her eye makeup never looked better. It was a bit tough to buy as at times she looked liked she was headed off to a modeling assignment.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog seemed forced to me as well and the reunion between Law and Kidman lacked something as well. I'm an admirer of Cold Mountain because of it's beauty, poignancy and some of it's casting such as Zellweger as Ruby. But the movie won't go down as one of my favorites. My vote is 6 of 10."
"rmax304823","6","3","7","26 July 2005"," War is all hell.
","There's a stunning scene towards the end when Jude Law approaches his long-lost girlfriend, Nicole Kidman, on a snowy path through what appears to be an archway of rock pinnacles all dusted with white. Law is hardly more than a scrawny black scarecrow in a slouch hat. Not recognizing him after a year's absence she fires two warning shots towards him. He is shaken and begins to turn away, thinking she's forgotten him, but then awareness comes to her and she calls out, ""Inman?"" <br/><br/>Now, what follows ought to be a slow-motion shot of the two figures running towards each other and weeping with joy. She runs and weeps and laughs in slow motion. He runs and weeps and laughs in slow motion. But, no. Minghella, the director, has Law and Kidman crunch towards one another cautiously, as if neither is entirely certain that what is happening is not an hallucination. And Minghella cuts away from the reunion after only a brief and tasteful moment.<br/><br/>The movie is a series of rather loosely linked episodes, cutting back and forth between Law making his lonely and dangerous way back home from the battlefield, and Kidman who is about to starve on her wretched farm because, as a gentlewoman, she was taught only what was useless. She can name all the plants in Latin but she can't grow them. Renee Zellweger shows up at the opportune moment, a no-nonsense practical independent and blunt young woman who is able to show Kidman the ropes.<br/><br/>The initial meeting between Law and Kidman only lasts for a few minutes, and they are together at the end just long enough for the anticipated climax, so to speak, but everything in between the beginning and the end kind of meanders about, like one of the ox bow lakes that Law must traverse during his journey. What the heck is going on?<br/><br/>What seems to be going on is mostly two things. First, the movie gives us a pretty good ethnographic picture of the folks who lived in the Upland South in the 1860s. (Good production design and wardrobe.) There are no magnificent steps in the Big House for Bette Davis to trip down in a hoop skirt, just old weathered shacks whose shingles need replacing and whose corn cribs must be filled if the inhabitants are to survive the winter. Come to think of it, there are no hoop skirts at all. Everyone is dressed in more than usually drab garments, usually dirty. Even the women's underwear is yellow and blotched. The dialog isn't noticeably Upland South though. In the Lowland South, say around Charleston, ""sir"" becomes ""suh,"" but in the mountains it is ""sirr."" Not an important point.<br/><br/>Because of their beards and raggedy clothing the men tend to look alike. They all look like Chuck Norris, unless they are older and look like James Gammon. In fact one of them IS James Gammon. Nicole Kidman's visage is as sleek as her figure. She could be the hood ornament on an old, ornate automobile.<br/><br/>Some of the episodes are more interesting than others although it was never too difficult to figure out who would survive and who would die. Philip Seymour Hoffman as one of those pasquinades of pastoral piety is a riot. What music he lends his lines! And at one point Law is invited to spend the night in bed with Natalie Portman, her husband long dead, who writhes with grief, guilt, and horniness as she asks him to promise that if he lies down next to her he ""won't go no further."" Righto! It reminded me of a similar scene in which a lad was successfully tested in ""Tales of the Arabian Nights"", to which the translator, Richard Burton, had added a rare footnote -- ""The young man must have been a demon of chastity.""<br/><br/>I have a feeling there is a moral to this movie. The moral is that war should be entered into only as a last resort, but I'm not sure."
"lawprof","8","3","7","25 December 2003"," Hollywood's Civil War Executed with Commanding Skill
","Oscar nominations for ""Cold Mountain"" are assured.  It's a sweeping micro-epic of the Civil War and it succeeds where other recent sprawling films about the great internecine conflict, ""Gods and Generals"" for example, fail.  And the reason why it holds viewers' attention through two and a half hours is that it focuses on relationships - good, bad and homicidal - rather than on the great battles and still controversial generals from that conflict.  Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" we can all sit back in comfort and not debate or challenge whether Lee knew his business, a subject that prompts vigorous personal exchanges both North and South to this date.<br/><br/>Based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name ""Cold Mountain"" tracks Inman, Jude Law, a young, taciturn laborer falling in love with Ada, Nicole Kidman, as all in the small hilly North Carolina town await the act of secession that will lead to war.<br/><br/>Australian-actress-of-any-accent-needed Kidman is marvelous as Ada who falls in love with Inman (no first name) before he joins his friends to march off to a jolly war guaranteed to be over in a short time.  Inman, of course, has fallen for the preacher's blond and beautiful daughter.  They exchange tintypes (an early form of photography).  Donald Sutherland is the clergyman and he delivers an expectedly competent and familiar performance.<br/><br/>Inman does not have, as the English might say, ""a good war.""  He is present - up front and personal - when the Army of the Potomac launches one of the great disasters of its march on Richmond, the mining of Confederate lines before Petersburg.  A curiosity:  the slaughter of Union troops trapped in the Crater following the explosion is quite accurately depicted.  But the troops sent in were largely black and inexperienced and here they're all white.  Why so obvious a distortion of a horrific event? (Incidentally, the white brigadier general who commanded the black troops was hiding in his quarters behind the lines dead drunk while his men perished. Since the whole misbegotten, failed operation was an enormous embarrassment to generals Grant and Meade and the main Union casualties were just blacks, the drunk was quietly dismissed rather than being shot.)<br/><br/>Inman survives a grievous wound and, barely recovered, he decides to check out of the Army of Northern Virginia and hike home.  To Ada, of course.<br/><br/>On his journey he has many adventures most of which could have been fatal. He meets and makes and loses friends.  He meets and eludes or dispatches foes.  Jude Law is man with a grim determination that impresses and engrosses.  His pain becomes the audience's.  That's a compliment about how well he wears his role.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the farm, literally, Ada has taken in as a partner, not a servant, Ruby, played with insouciance bordering on the hopelessly comedic, by Reneee Zellweger.  There must be a reason why a large part of the audience broke out laughing when Ruby makes her first appearance in an unfolding set of scenes that has humor but also pathos.<br/><br/>All is not well in the environs of Cold Mountain where law and order seems to have been exclusively delegated to a small crew of Home Guard vigilantes whose cruelty and mindless killing polarizes the characters.    There were vigilantes hunting Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters, especially at the tail end of the war,  but this crew is off the charts.  I don't think anyone in the theater liked them. I hope not. The actors are excellent in an expectedly stereotyped portrayal. Forget Manhattan, they won't be cheered in the Deep South.  I think.<br/><br/>A short but intensely emotional performance is Natalie Portman's as the Confederate widow, Sara, alone in her forest cabin with her little baby when first Inman and then a trio of Union soldiers arrive.  Portman is believable and moving.  She is Everywoman who is victimized by conflicts men fight and women and children pay for with if not their lives, their welfare.<br/><br/>Curiously, except perhaps for Florida which fell to Union forces early in the conflict, North Carolina saw little actual combat (the one significant battle in that state, Bentonville, was near the end of the war).  The privations that occupy much of the screen time were common as the war drew to its disastrous close for the rebels but in North Carolina things were largely better than elsewhere.<br/><br/>Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghella crafted a surprisingly taut drama given its length and the complexity of interactions by numerous characters.  The cinematography is excellent-the movie was shot in Romania which, it's been reported, looks more like North Carolina in 1864 than any part of that state does today.  I'm not sure if that's good for Romanians.<br/><br/>General Sherman said that ""War is hell and you can not refine it."" Hollywood has grappled with the dilemma of capturing America's war that is still being fought over 140 years later.  D.W. Griffith was the first prominent director to deal with the war and its issues and the celluloid avalanche hasn't stopped.  ""Cold Mountain"" will achieve success throughout the country because it has truly terrible characters on both sides, avoids any real discussion of root issues such as slavery and shows kindness to slaves (Ava's willingness to go out in the rain to deliver cider to the slave quarters during a big party is almost enough to make one wonder what the fuss was all about).  The war in ""Cold Mountain is brutal as it affects individuals and meaningless as a recounting of a conflict without comparison in our history. So general audience acceptance north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line (meaning box office receipts) is assured.<br/><br/>But it is a very good, not a great movie, largely because of the intensity of Law's and Kidman's acting.  And we'll be seeing white-knuckled cast members in the audience at Oscar time.  Trust me on that.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Let's not be too harsh on the novel that inspired this abomination. The result would have been the same if it had been an adaptation of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in the hands of those filmmakers. Just like the benighted citizens of Ancient Rome amused themselves by watching human beings dismembered for their enjoyment in the arena while the rest of the world burned in a conflagration they had started but didn't know how to stop, today's Americans love nothing more (apparently) than to collectively cuddle up to tales of squalor, gratuitous blood spilling, dehumanized killing, torture and various acts of degradation and wanton barbarity. What distinguishes this little effort from the mainstream snuff porn you can rent at your local sex shop is that the values of womanhood, motherhood and vaginahood are raised on a pedestal on an equal footing with apple pie while all men (i.e. walking phalluses) are portrayed as anti-feminist pigs. For two and a half hours, the spectator is kept in perpetual suspense as to how his/her gag reflex is going to be stimulated next. This passes for art in the United States these days. And it wins Oscars and a lot of moolah for Mr. Weinstein. And, apparently, even the US matriarchy loves it!"
"jwryan","8","5","15","7 January 2004"," Guys, let her talk you into seeing Cold Mountain
","This is a movie for guys who like movies. Like ""Cool Hand Luke"", only with actual American girls included. A movie is such a huge collaboration between artists, far beyond my understanding; but Cold Mountain is a remarkable effort on the parts of some talented people. The production, the direction and the acting are greater than the sum of their parts. The camera work, the editing, the costumes and ESPECIALLY the sets get top marks. The script is good.<br/><br/>The Actors are great, save a small caveat. Some (not all) of the bad guys (and there are lots of bad guys in this movie) play the heavy a little too heavy. Not over the top, but just a little too mean AND evil at the same time, you know? Part of that probably comes from the way the characters and their actions were written in the original novel, and some of it comes from the age old problem of basically decent human beings playing (and directing) the role of sick, demented, evil human beings, and not really having anything in their own life experiences to base something like that on. I am not referring to Ray Winstones performance as Teague, I thought he was great. Very believable that you can dislike someone without being able to put your finger on why at first. A real trick to play that character and have the audience feel the distrust without the words and/or actions to substantiate that emotion.<br/><br/>There isn't a female actor in this movie that doesn't do an OUTSTANDING job. Nicole Kidman is stunning, she has never been more attractive than in Cold Mountain. Renee Zellweger is brilliant. Jude Law does a good job with a complex, difficult role.<br/><br/>I understand that this movie rates highly with females, under 18. That's surprising, for a macho guy movie like Cold Mountain."
"JWBly","2","4","11","24 October 2007"," Ridiculously predictable and BORING
","This is the kind of film that women almost universally like, and men generally hate. Jude Law gives a wooden performance as a deserter from the Confederate Army whose one mission is to return to Nicole Kidman, a woman whom he barely knows. Along his merry journey home, he meets a collection of other cowards and deserters, and has many adventures. Historical inaccuracies abound as apparently the entire Confederate Army was trying to desert, and the film lovingly celebrates these acts of cowardice. Kidman herself, whose meager talent has always been grossly overrated, gives another forgettable performance here. The one bright spot is Rene Zellweger, who gives the film some welcome comic relief. She plays a woman who apparently is one of the few people in the South with a Southern accent. Her performance is marred only by one over-the-top antiwar speech, intended to be a dramatic highlight of the film but which turns out to be unintentionally hilarious. Ethan Suplee and Giovanni Ribisi are also good in minor roles, as both apparently are developing their characters for use in MY NAME IS EARL. Except for some interesting battle scenes early on, there is nothing at all in this movie to hold a man's attention. It plods on at such an excruciating pace that Jude Law's death is a welcome signal that the end of the film is near. An hour of the film could easily be cut with no loss of quality."

","I'm not quite sure if it was bad casting or lazy writing.  Either way, the love story that runs through COLD MOUNTAIN is like ice on a pond: looks great from a far but don't dare tread on it.  Unfortunately, the film maker sinks deeply through the surface as the picture concerns itself with endless voice overs from Nicole Kidman to her love Jude Law.  Repetitive and filled with the same words, you start to wonder what would have happened, if they had just concentrated on the crazy union army and its cast of evil characters.  Nonetheless, Law does a wonderful job opposite Kidman with whom he has absolutely no chemistry.  Renee Zellwegger is a bit annoying but bearable.  The scenery is nice and the costumes cool (except for Kidman who looks like she's out of 1934 glamour magazine as opposed to 1864)."

","Kudos to Jude Law and Nicole Kidman ( and how can I not mention the mouthy and boisterous Renée Zellweger). They were bloody brilliant in the movie. Albeit the story moulded itself in a predictable fashion, it was exceptionally well directed by Anthony Minghella. Love was what bound them together (Jude and Nicole), although the moments were brief and the talks were tacit, Nicole kept on waiting patiently for Law while he eagerly wanted to return for her. A great love story, I'd say, hardly possible in today's scenario. While we always want things to end up happily, the movie ends up with a sad note. While I watched the flick I had a premonition that something bad was going to happen eventually.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's role was brief although very well portrayed as a widow. Giovanni Ribisi and Philip Seymour Hoffman performed their part very well. Renée Zellweger surely deserved an Oscar for her performance. She was brilliant and fluent with her accent. Nicole Kidman was amazing in the flick. While the whole world crumbled upon her and the wicked self proclaimed sheriff Ray Winstone kept on coming at her house asking her to give up but she wouldn't. She kept on patiently waiting for Law to come back as he had promised her. The war had separated them and that war demanded every man from the Cold Mountain to show up while the crude Ray Winstone didn't allow anyone who absconded from the war to live as he hunted them down wherever he found a runner.<br/><br/>Jude Law had to return for her. She had to wait for him. That is the basis of the entire story. It was a well written story by Charles Frazier with a brilliant screenplay by Anthony himself. A wonderful love story with marvellous dialogues and great acting by the actors in the flick. I would rate this movie a 7 on 10. Albeit the story went on in a predictable fashion it was brilliantly directed and well produced eventually. It managed to wet the cheeks of the viewers and that is what acting and directing is all about."

","I heard lots about this movie. I rented it when it came out on DVD. Watched it. Thought it was well shot. Well staged. Well acted. Well directed. Heck, even the script was good.<br/><br/>But there was something missing.<br/><br/>What was it? Oh yeah, the guy got shot in the end, and his wife winds up with the good life.<br/><br/>We live in a day and age where the marketers are chasing social trends. Social trends in turn feed off of the marketing that affects society. One synergizes with the other. It's a chicken and egg thing. One follows the others' trend, hoping to cash in. Who's in the lead? I have no idea. But the morning news, the soap operas, the game shows, nearly everything you can think of is aimed at garnishing dollars. And ""Cold Mountain"" was no different.<br/><br/>Consider; Law goes off to fight in the war while Kidman stays home. Not a big variance in theme there, but Law's character gets challenged with the harsh brutality of Civil War, while Kidman's character, though facing her own challenges at home, isn't quite so fretted with what could happen to her so much as what could happen to her neighbors. <br/><br/>We see one love making scene after Law's character comes home, and then a violent confrontation. And Law get's shot. Kidman? She goes on to live a happy and fruitful life now that she's been given a child from her alleged love of choice. I don't know about you, but it seemed more like Kidman's character was waiting to be fertilized than to protect her man.<br/><br/>Is this worrisome? Not really. If any feminist thinks this is a good message, then they're off their rocker. Me, I found it trite. A much better film with much the same story, better production values, and just scoring higher marks in the theme and values department, is Ang Lee's ""Ride With the Devil"".<br/><br/>Lee's film tells a better story; the harsh non-mystical realities of tribal warfare, and why men and women need each other, and why they create families that need one another as well. It's a story of survival to keep the hope of romance and family alive. In short, it's a better film on all levels.<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" is sophomoric pablum. It's aimed at the ""Sex in the City"" crowd, only designed to ride on the coat tails of other historic Civil War success stories.<br/><br/>And that's why I didn't take a liking to ""Cold Mountain"". The film should've been renamed ""Cold Women"", for not one man of worth survives to the end of this film. And the one man who should have, was shot in the gut, and needlessly so.<br/><br/>I guess you could say I don't really like this film much.<br/><br/>Watch it for its aesthetics, but then understand what you've seen after it's all said and done. It's an angry film for an angry segment of the sexes."

","If you are a Civil War or American History buff, then you'll appreciate how this film addresses an ignored aspect of that violent part of our past known as the war between the states. Although mired in a somewhat predictable and sappy love story, it pointed out very well how many common folks were abused by their own people as these miscreants preyed upon their vulnerability. Beautifully photographed, with set designs accurate to the era. I thought Nichole Kidman was miscast in the primary role, which is difficult for me to admit as I believe she is one of the most talented actresses in the business today. However, it was Renee Zellweger who stole the movie. This actress never lets her ego get in the way of playing any part, even if that part lacks glamor. I recommend this film on several levels -- acting, directing, and historical significance. Weakened only by a trite ending."

","Cold Mountain could have been more like Frasier's book, but what can you do.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully shot, with great care given to the costumes and landscapes. The peaceful Southern countryside has an almost mystical air, of some far-off legend which cannot exist in the modern world. There is plenty of action and heroism, and a suitably grand battle scene to end things. It's all been done before, but this does not mean the movie is not entertaining.<br/><br/>The one problem I have had was the over-use of cheap devices to provoke emotion, which had the action bordering on melodrama on several occasions. We don't need slow, sad music and slow-motion footage every time some character dies or gets hurt. Subtly inserting emotional content is one thing, but this film takes it and beats you over the head with it, then shoves it down your throat. It felt rather insulting and unnecessary, almost like the sad equivalent of a laugh track. But perhaps it was just me."

I sometimes wonder if people knew half the time who was actually in a battalion, let alone sending out warrants on them. Were people pursued like Jude Law was? I need to find a Civil War scholar. The movie is episodic, like a modern day Odyssey. Every obstacle just leads to a more overwhelming one. Was there no kindness? Were all betrayers? Anyway, I felt a great sense of having been in a fight at the conclusion of this film. See it for its intensity and its life. Some of the acting is a bit wooden, but the course is rough and the way hard. That's what the film is all about."

","I had heard news and stories about this movie before and so this kind of piqued my curiosity when I saw this on the cable days ago.<br/><br/>I don't know much about the Civil War and all that, I have to say first. Given I only understand this is based on Charles Frazier's novel about the final days of the Civil War and that is it.<br/><br/>It's the final days of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law), being wounded from the war, slowly made his way home to Cold Mountain to be together with his sweetheart Ada (Nicole Kidman) once more. Along the way he had to overcome various obstacles as he had learnt that those soldiers who had escaped will have to be brought back to be on the battlefront once more. Something definitely not all those who had escaped wanted.<br/><br/>Also at the same time, Ada is trying to keep her faith that Inman is still alive and well. She even got a helper for the house and it's in the form of gutsy Ruby (Renee Zellweger).<br/><br/>I was almost horrified looking at the war how some of the soldiers treated the ordinary folk. Looking at how Ada and Ruby are like, they cannot be more different from each other. Maybe Renee's convincing portrayal of Ruby was the reason why she won at the Golden Globes and the Oscars as well.<br/><br/>Maybe for someone like me who may not understand the historical aspects of the Civil War, but then maybe at least the love story part kind of won me over."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","4","27 January 2006"," Certainly watchable but many things in the movie restrain it from being a masterpiece.
","""Cold Mountain"" is a beautifully made movie with a great celebrity cast, than why don't I regard this movie as a masterpiece? There are several reasons for this.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is the love-story between the Nicole Kidman and Jude Law character. Everything that happens in the movie evolves around the fact that both characters are deeply in love and are always on each others mind. But problem is that the love-story is not believable at all. The love-story feels unlikely because there is no chemistry between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman at all. No click, no spark no nothing at all. Maybe this is also because the love-story in the movie is very underdeveloped. The love-story is only developed in the beginning of the movie when they are still together but honestly, that period of time is too short to build an entire movie around. It makes all of the other things that occur in the movie also extra unlikely.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another problem I had with the movie; it was highly unlikely at times. The events and characters in the movie seem to pop out of nowhere. Obviously the story is supposed to be an adventurous one but yet the movie is made too serious so all the sense of adventure and fun is not present enough. All of the events in the movie feel highly unlikely and most of them lack a point or purpose.<br/><br/>The big celebrity cast is great to watch but is also the downfall of the movie. Most actors suddenly pop up so every time a celebrity appears on screen you're thinking; 'Hey look there is Natalie Portman and hey there is Philip Seymour Hoffman, boy this movie sure has some celebrities in it'. Point is, it works distracting from the movie and it's story. It almost feels at times like they were bragging up by showing the many famous actors they got to appear in this movie. Yes, sure the actors are just absolutely great, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, Renée Zellweger (yes, she deserved her Oscar even though I din't always liked her character) and Natalie Portman. Still I have the feeling that the movie would had been a better one with a more 'unknown' cast in it.<br/><br/>Only reason why I still rate this movie as 'highly' as I do is due to the obvious profession it was made with. Director Anthony Minghella shows some moments of greatness and the settings and sceneries are quite beautiful. It also is no punishment to watch the big celebrity cast in the movie, even though still the movie is a 'celebrity-overkill' at times. The movie is loved by many, so I guess this is just simply not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Usually with a movie like this the complaint would be that it's too slow. But in Cold Mountain, things really move too quickly. I did not have much time to know these characters and build empathy. Jude Law's character survived so long because of so many people helping him, but he never seems to care about this. He was supposed to be broken down on his journey, but apathy by others would do this. Some people were uncaring, but so many were kind.<br/><br/>The scenes with Natalie Portman, the strongest in the movie, also show its weakness. She helps him and he just leaves her. 'Good luck with the sick baby, but I've got to get back to Cold Mountain. My girlfriend's there with that dude from The White Stripes.' Speaking of whom, Jack White is another of the film's strengths, along with all of the music. The soundtrack was good throughout.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger on the other hand is simply annoying. And she won an Oscar? Holly Hunter was robbed! The movie simply seemed disjointed. Usually I love barren, gray scenery, but in this case it did nothing for me. And how is it that Liberal Hollywood keeps making movies sympathizing with the slave-owning South. From Gone with the Wind to The Outlaw Josey Wales to Cold Mountain, Glory being a notable exception, the Confederates are the heroes, or at least the ones who are supposed to hold our sympathies. Yes, most people in the South did not have slaves, but they were pro-slavery and wanted to keep it that way. And Hollywood seems fine with this."

","It's very brief, but I couldn't help but wondering if the director meant us to see the irony. In the open battle sequence in the crater, there's a shot of Inman's Cherokee buddy struggling with a black Union soldier. To me, the image of the Native man and the African American man struggling to kill each other in a white man's war was deeply ironic, but perhaps unintended? I'd be interested in knowing if this was commented on in the book . . . Overall I though the technical quality of the film was quite high. Also, I was struck by how many Irish and English actors were used. Was this because their accents were closer to the way people in the American south spoke at the time, I wonder? I actually thought Law's performance was much more affecting than Nicole Kidman's. I think he did a nice job portraying a man who was swept up in events beyond his comprehension. And what's her name did a fine job as Ruby, just what was called for. I don't think her accent and mannerisms were over the top, rather they fit the character . . ."

","This was a really good movie. After reading several comments, I have to address some of the<br/><br/>issues with the execution of the film. Nicole Kidman's accent was actually pretty good. I thought she<br/><br/>sounded reasonably like a South Carolinian. <br/><br/>Several viewers mentioned the lack of African-American<br/><br/>roles/issues in the film. Because the mountains of NC were home<br/><br/>to a large percentage of poor farmers, sharecroppers and<br/><br/>mountain folk, there weren't many slaves in the area and mountain<br/><br/>people were some of the last to get involved in the war. They had<br/><br/>no interest in it one way or the other since they didn't own slaves or<br/><br/>plantations. Their plight would remain largely unchanged no<br/><br/>matter the outcome.

For whatever reason, Hollywood still hasn't seemed to figure out that NOT every good book has to be made into a film. In fact it rarely works, particularly with this Minghella dude at the helm. There was absolutely no chemistry between Law and Kidman, the accents were incredibly poor and ruined any semblance of authenticity, memorable dialogue was completely deleted for no apparent reason whatsoever, and... I could go on and on. In short, it had none of the heart, wit, beauty, and charm of the novel. It amounted to little more than another big budget ""epic"" that might as well have been called ""Hey!

","Cold Mountain was nominated for several Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture Drama.  When time for the Oscars came, however, and the Best Picture nominees were released, Cold Mountain had been replaced by Lost in Translation.  I was further surprised when I realized that this movie was not unanimously acclaimed by critics.  Yet I knew that since there was such controversy over this film, there was all the more reason for me to see it. I came out of the theater having watched a very good movie, but after seeing the movie I also realized why many critics would not praise this motion picture.  Let me explain.<br/><br/>First of all, the music from Cold Mountain, both the original songs by various artists and the original score by Gabriel Yared, was nothing short of incredible and I felt that it matched the film very well.  The film rightfully received three Oscar nominations for its original music.  Also, both Jude Law and Renee Zellweger put in solid, emotional performances, and Zellweger rightfully won her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award.  I also felt that the dialogue was well-written and genuine, evoking a flow of emotion from the audience.  The tragic aspects of the film are also shown to be full of emotion, and the story is paced well. The view of Civil War is well-balanced, showing corruption on both sides. <br/><br/>However, my one complaint was the often awkward acting and staging by and for the minor characters.  They are obviously seen to be in a league not of their own.  One of the most controversial aspects of the film is Kidman's performance.  I felt that she played her role well, even though her makeup often made her seem out of place.  The other reason that many seemed to hate this film is because it seems to be a poor adaptation of Charles Frazier's book, focusing more on the love story than on the fighting itself.  I have not read the book, so I can not truly affirm or discredit this idea, but Minghella obviously focuses on the love story in order to make the film as emotional as possible.  I feel that this was a good choice in his writing and direction.<br/><br/>Overall, a few minor flaws (as mentioned above) and some unneeded sex and nudity keep this one from reaching its full potential, which is a shame, especially as one considers the caliber of cast and crew involved with this movie.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A-."
"stefaniebanks","Null","2","4","27 July 2004"," ""A Tale from the Home Land""
","The movie Cold Mountain takes place during the Civil War and focuses primarily on a town in North Carolina called Cold Mountain. Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) comes to Cold Mountain with her father, Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) from Charleston. Ada quickly catches the eye of a young man by the name of Inman (Jude Law), but is too shy to tell him her true feelings about him. Soon enough the war has begun and Inman is called to go off to war; and now she is left to deal with her feelings for Inman bottled up and hoping that he comes home from the war. And if matter couldn't get worse Ada looses her father a year later and has nobody to lean on for support. So she is forced to work and live off of the land; and along with what little values that she had left to her name. Almost starved to death and worn down, Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) comes to Ada's rescue. Ruby teaches Ada how to work and live off of the land and teaches Ada what life is truly like -- hard and unfair. Years have passed and the war is still going and Ada has no idea how Inman is or where he is. But her heart is still with him. Meanwhile, Inman is faced with the hardships of war, wounded and determined to find his way back to the beauty of Cold Mountain and into the arms of Ada. <br/><br/>Director Anthony Minghella intentions of the movie are: 1,) He wanted his audience to get a realistic view as to what women had to overcome when the men were off at war; 2,) Soldiers' family and 'sweethearts' is what kept them going and sane during the war. With all of the blood, guts, and death that soldiers had to see everyday the memories of their loved ones help them to survive.<br/><br/>I would consider this movie to be one of the best Civil War movies because it is set in another point of view -- the women at Cold Mountain. Cold Mountain focused mainly on what was going on back home. And that is what I thought was one of the best parts of the movie. Many civil war movies are depicted from the soldiers at war; but here the audience sees what is going on back home."
"olethrosdc","4","2","4","2 August 2004"," Glacially slow, cliched, messy and uninteresting.
","This movie talks about the civil war. The main downfall of the movie are the numerous pointless scenes. <br/><br/>Do not get me wrong. In general, I enjoy slow movies - if they are well done. i.e. I loved 'The gaze of Ulysse's' and 'Das Boot', both extremely long movies that tell quite a simple story. However, the longer scenes in those movies aid characterisation and immersion. The scenes in 'Cold mountain' are one of the following types:<br/><br/>1. The heroine's voice reciting love letters to her love. 2. Pointless scenes of havoc and violence. 3. Depiction of unbelievable cruelty by the 'villains' 4. The hero wandering around.<br/><br/>This is all packaged with very badly thought out characterisations and motifs that follow really trite cliche's.<br/><br/>During the course of this overlong movie, nothing is learnt of the protagonists. I felt no empathy for them, or for their quest. The letter-reciting is particularly loathsome and does not add *anything at all* to the movie. Also, no matter how many times you show the hero not letting himself to the pleasures of another woman, or how many times he looks at her picture, it does not make us feel that he loves the heroine.<br/><br/>A lot of characters are introduced quite briefly. Given that this movie is so long, it would have been better had the characters been given some more time to develop rather than have all this letter reciting. Maybe it is better that they are not, since all of their lines are just patronising monologues.<br/><br/>This movie has no romance, no interest and no soul."
"El Guapo-2","Null","2","4","22 July 2004"," Not nearly ""Minghella"" enough for me
","Never before have I been so bewildered by a movie before, a movie that is by equal terms laughably bad and awe-inspiring. The opening battle scene is one of the best I have ever seen filmed (although the question of how Inman's Indian friend survived the knife fight with the black Union soldier when it clearly shows he was about to get the sharp end of it), and the reflection of fighting soldiers in the bloody mud puddle with a blood-drenched Union flag on the ground was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The problem I had with the film (notice I did not say, ""the problem with the film"" props to me!) is that, crowd-pleasing moments and Minghella-type storytelling do not mesh. Rumours abound that Boss Weinstein had too large a hand in this production in his zeal for the annual Oscar campaign. The deft artistic risk-taking and touches that Minghella lovingly placed on ""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" are few and far between in ""Cold Mountain"".<br/><br/>Ms. Natalie Portman is of particular notice, she gives an excellent supporting performance in her all-too brief screen time, and the sexual tension between her and Mr. Law clearly overshadows the tension that Inman and Ada were supposed to have. It just goes to show that some things cannot be faked.<br/><br/>I must point out Robert Altman's excellent film ""McCabe + Mrs. Miller"" on how to properly film a period movie, much less a Western. In that film, you can literally feel the dirt and grime oozing out of everything. The actors have real dirt on their face, clothes, and under their nails, not movie makeup. I only mention this because its the inappropriate use of makeup in this film that distracted me from fully immersing myself in the story. For example, when Ada meets Inman for the first time, instead of concentrating on how they are reacting to each other, I was totally mesmerized by the detail and complexity of Nicole Kidman's eye makeup.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, but not a great one. Somehow, I expected better from Minghella. I think he has paid his dues by now, so perhaps on his next Miramax film he will be able to tell Boss Weinstein what exactly he can do with himself."

Whatever charms the novel might have held were mostly lost in the translation. Supporting characters never stick around long enough to justify their presence - the hermit lady who heals Inman, for instance, adds nothing to the story line or theme that is not added elsewhere. With sparse dialogue and introverted main characters the script fails to invent ways to reveal their inner lives in ways that we really care about. And after 2.5 hours we really should care what befalls them at the end. <br/><br/>Despite the massive promotion as the year's masterpiece the film just doesn't deliver the goods, and, to their rare credit, most critics and Academy members were able to see that behind all that sizzle there wasn't a whole lot of meat.

What I couldn't understand however was the point of Inman travelling all that way just to die in the arms of a woman he hardly knew, he did admit that he hardly knew her, but then why? What made Monroe so special that someone like Inman would take immediate interest in her?

","Minghella's Cold Mountain is a love story gone wrong. The story was mostly accurate depicting of the impact of the Civil war on the Southerners. The story was written by Charles Frazier- whose great great grandfather, W.P. Inman, fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. During the war, Inman was wounded and brought to a hospital. After he healed, he escaped the prison hospital in Virginia in hopes to return home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina, to reunite with his love. Frazier did not know all the details about his grandfather's journey, but through research, he wrote what he believed Inman's journey would entail as he traveled home. Prior to the war, Ada, one of the main character, has recently moved to Cold Mountain with her father. She doesn't have any friends besides her father, but she briefly meets Inman and they fall in love. However, shortly after Ada's arrival, many men including Inman are overcome with nationalism and join to fight the war. <br/><br/>Ada and her father continue to live on the farm until the father dies unexpectedly. Ada now owns his property and the farm; she frees all of her father's slaves but now is struggling to keep the farm alive. Eventually, a neighbor named Ruby comes along to help her with the farm. Ada learns new skills and the farm begins to thrive again. Ada continues to stay loyal to Inman and writes him several letters. However, as the war drags, the more Ada questions their love- after all they had only known each other for a short period of time. She prays for his survival and tries to predict the future by looking in a water well. With the help of two neighbors, she leans back with a mirror to see the water reflection in the mirror. She briefly sees a man coming closer as crows surround him and he falls to the ground. Confused about the message, Ada is unsure if the message means Inman is returning to her<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Inman is traveling back home. Throughout his journey, he meets a variety of different people and encounters many challenges. He scavenges food and in some households he is invited for an overnight stay. At one stop in particular he meets a young woman named Sara. She became a widow when her husband joined the war and she is currently raising her young baby alone on a small farm. She lets Inman stay for the night but the presences of a man reminds of her husband and she begins to sob. Without a husband or father, Sara and her baby's life will be impacted forever. The morning after, soldiers come to her farm asking for a runaway soldier (Inman). She declines any knowledge but they search her house and torment her and her baby until Inman appears and kills the soldiers. On several occasions during his trip, Inman meets people that will delay or hurry his voyage; very similar to the epic, The Odyssey. In The Odyssey, Odysseus went far to fight in war which lasted longer than expected. He wants to return home to his wife and let her know he's alive but is faced with many challenges. Odysseus encounters a Cyclops, sea monsters and much more. Inman's story is very similar. Inman is returning home from war to reunite with his love, but his journey was not easy and very time consuming. Some people provided him with supplies, others tagged along on for the trip and others make the journey more difficult. <br/><br/>Overall, I think that the attitude about the war is supported well by the variety of people Inman comes across. Each has their own perspective about tolls war brings and each person has a story. Like the hermit goat lady in the forest. She is very kind to Inman without knowing who he is. She heals Inman and sends him on his way with supplies. Although the war changed people, it showed there is still kindness which has been lacking for some time. The movie demonstrates the impacts of the war, not always thought about. More than slave owners were impacted by the war- families lost their males and towns were reduced to mostly women and young children."

","Cold Mountain (2003): Dir: Anthony Minghella / Cast: Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman: Provocative drama about distant affection and the peaks that are not as high as they seem. Set in mid 1800's Jude Law fought in the civil war and suffered injury but he reflects upon the woman awaiting his arrival at Cold Mountain. She is played by Nicole Kidman and she is the daughter of a minister whose lifestyle changes after his passing. This subplot is interesting but Law's trek across country is littered with pointless subplots that greatly weaken his necessity. This climaxes with a simplistic gunfight and shed tears that viewers likely won't fall for. Directed by Anthony Minghella who made a superior film called The English Patient. Here he is backed with fine production. While Law's role becomes greatly expendable, Kidman slowly becomes a woman when a ragged Renee Zellweger appears. They have a fine chemistry as Kidman gets her hands dirty and Zellweger gets her hands dirtier. Among cameos are Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sleazy minister who steals his moments with humour and found guilty of a crime for which he meets consequences. Natalie Portman has a pointless role as a woman raising an infant son, and whom Law assists in a crucial moment. Theme of emotional endurance is evident in our cold society. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","After doing some research on this movie, I found that it was a decently accurate movie, but there were times when what was shown wasn't what actually happened. The first scene is the battle at Petersburg, which was very accurate, except that when it actually happened, there were both African-American troops and white troops, since they were separate at the time, and in the movie there were only white troops present. The details in the scene were very accurate, though, like that the place the Confederates were was blown up and because of how it was done, many were trapped, and then the Union army was able to move in and attack those that were still there. On the accuracy of how the women are shown, I have found that overall it was very accurate to the time. Often, people believe that everyone who lived in the South during the Civil War was a supporter of the war, but women usually weren't, just as they weren't in the movie. Also, since the characters lived in a rural town, the women weren't always supervised like they would have been in a place that was more populated. In the film, the two main characters that were women were often together, but not usually with anyone else. I personally thought the movie was okay. I didn't think that it would be as violent as it was, but it wasn't too bad. I enjoyed the love story part of it, too."

","I actually found myself watching it four times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away, you know? In the waning days of the American Civil War, a wounded soldier embarks on a perilous journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart. So what do we get? We get sludge. You can tell that everybody in this movie knew that it was a stinker, so why try? Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that deep down, beneath the bad acting and the awful script, there were some okay ideas. Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed."

","First, it is surprising that very little of the film is shot in North Carolina - and that the majority of it is actually filmed in the country of Romania! Having been to 'the real' Cold Mountain many times, one can see the similarities though. The landscape around the mountain is filled with the same type hillsides and hollers we see in the film.<br/><br/>And honestly, even in 1860's character, Nicole Kidman has never looked more beautiful. She is very much like a porcelain doll come to life, and the perfect choice for this film - cause she nails this helpless yet proud character of Ada, her performance is virtually flawless. And even though Renee Zellwegger's character is a little irritating, but her performance is brilliant. The rest of the cast is well chosen and most acceptably fill their roles. Watch for Giovanni Ribisi and Kathy Baker, they are especially good. Ribisi brings his trademark 'weirdness' to a despicable character, and Baker is amazingly 'motherly'...<br/><br/>The most upsetting thing about the film is the realistic and historically accurate portrayal of the disgustingly rancid 'home guard' - who in real life simply took advantage of the war (as an opportunity) to terrorize the countryside, humiliate or routinely murder personal enemies, and line their own pockets with impunity. As if the war wasn't bad enough, southern towns and communities had to endure it with this accompanying evil in the form of men purported to be patriotic to the cause - when all they were (were) violent criminals who deserved to die."

","Cold Mountain starts off as some sweeping, dramatic love story but soon settles into an unbecoming, whimsy mess of a movie, in a weird sorta way, but it completely strikes home. The movie begins by exhibiting a mood appropriately disparaging for a Civil War love tale, but it soon creates a strangely merry, airy atmosphere. It's fine or good either way. The plot is just as scattered as the movie is pieced together. There is largely lacking fluidity to the edited story. Although it has good action scenes, they are too ineffectively dark in contrast. More importantly worse, Cold Mountain has hardly any immersion. It detests and rejects you more than it entices and comforts you. I cannot care too much towards Jude Law's character as he makes his journey way back home, as he never ingratiates himself to the audience much in any way, other than being dashingly desirable as the love interest. The love story with Nicole Kidman and her character offers the closest thing to immersion, to getting lost in the story. Nicole Kidman is pure beauty. At this point in her life, Nicole has ascended into super beauty. She is, awe, her most gorgeous self. In a film that lives off its deep cast acting, Nicole in her lead's the best reason for watching, but Cold Mountain is not centered on Kidman's character enough. Cold Mountain is Kidman's movie. I'm certain Nicole Kidman gives the strongest acting performance of the three main stars, her, Zellweger, and Law, yet somehow Kidman was the only one that was not nominated of the three, and Renee even won! Zellweger gives an underwhelming performance, not even one of her best. Zellweger was far too exaggerated, talking and walking like some heehaw slack-jawed yokel, really ridiculous. How she won the Oscar, you tell me. She's just not a good an actress as Nicole is all. Her character, even though it's good in thought, is a big reason as to how the film winds up taking an unpleasant turn to the worse. Cold Mountain has near-great clips, but it's all throughout dressed up too unnatural. It's too divided between pained drama and gleeful amusement. I feel no chilling impact from Cold Mountain. I have to force myself to enjoy it. It's so, pointlessly underachieving. I do enjoy the movie for Kidman and Law's interacting, and that's about it. In retrospect, I was too critical in this review, but Cold Mountain sells itself as such an acclaimed movie and it's really not, so let me say, Cold Mountain is really, really good, very nicely romantically enchanting. There, is that good?"

","SPOILERS POSSIBLE<br/><br/>First let me get my gripes out of the way: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whose work I usually admire, was purely IRRITATING in this movie!!! I don't know why his comic relief didn't work for me, but it just didn't. Talking about having to take a dump, rambling on about his curly hair, and above all, his appetite for sex, which shouldn't be surprising, being that he's a ""man of God"". Still, it was just bad, really bad!!!<br/><br/>Gripe #2, the ending was just a wee bit melodramatic, but I can forgive that. <br/><br/>The music is absolutely beautiful, the instrumental theme and the songs by Allison Krauss. The score should have won an Oscar. <br/><br/>The cast, aside from Hoffman, was terrific. Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger (a great performance as a toughened farm girl), Brendan Gleeson, Jack White, Kathy Baker, Giovanni Ribisi, Natalie Portman, Ethan Suplee, and Eileen Atkins (as a somewhat scary old woman living in the woods), all were wonderful. <br/><br/>In spite of what a lot of reviewers said, I found the pace somewhat fast and easy to follow. The story kept me engaged. It only took a big blundering trip and fell down when Hoffman appeared on the scene. Thank God his irritating character was killed off relatively fast. While Inman is trying to find his way home to Cold Mountain, Ada is learning how to run her farm, and learning to be tougher than the Southern Belle she was in the beginning.<br/><br/>Lots of action, romance and wonderful characters. I give this movie an A- or a B+."

","Those of you who have read my other reviews will know 2 things: Most of my reviews are written without remorse (they're either very good or savagely bad), and I don't waste either your time or mine on plot summaries. Someone else already wrote that, so on to my review<br/><br/>As I said in the subject line, this is a rare less-than-brutal review. There are flaws to this movie, but they don't drag it down into a quagmire of mediocrity.<br/><br/>First, the good Renée Zellweger is brilliantly cast as the crotchety (and all the more lovable because of it) Ruby Thewes. She is a strong woman (which is immensely tantalizing to begin with), competent, and independent. She brings verve to the role, especially in the scene with the ""floggin' rooster.""<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman is also perfectly cast as the ornamental-without-any-real-redeeming-value Ada Monroe. She is completely believable in the part. You might wonder if she could pull off going from the charming southern belle with nary a marketable skill to an independent, functional, and prosperous farm owner, but there it is.<br/><br/>The cinematography gets a nod as well. Good location work and visuals.<br/><br/>Now for the bad This movie is at least half an hour too long. It wanders, repeatedly, away from the point and seems to forget where it's trying to go. Better editing could have made this movie top-notch, but not enough of it found its way to the cutting room floor. The excessive length and meandering plot are a serious detraction from the overall quality of the film, preventing a higher score, but the core of the movie is reasonably solid, so I can't knock it TOO badly.<br/><br/>6.5 (maybe a 7) out of 10."

And they weren't totally wrong, however there were a few things that saved this movie from having a horrible rating for me. Renee Zellweger kicked ass. I always liked Zellweger, but I never thought she was very versatile. To me she just always seemed to play the same kind of character. Until Cold Mountain. She was just so in your face, and over the top, and all together it was just an outstanding performance. I don't remember whether she got best supporting actress or not, but if she didn't, she was robbed. By far the best I've seen her perform. <br/><br/>Also very impressed by the soundtrack. Now, don't go out and buy the soundtrack because you think your going to be listening to some good tunes. Its mainly bluegrass, and I don't know a whole lot of people who listen to bluegrass in their spare time. But the way they worked it into the storyline was really subtle, and really completed the whole southern-romance kind of a mood. The storyline was a little slow, the battle scenes were kind of boring, and, I can't believe I'm going to say it, Nicole Kidman just wasn't a good choice for this one. Just wasn't impressed by her performance at all. <br/><br/>All in all, I'd give this movie a 6/10. Was worth seeing, just not that memorable."

","It's relentlessly grim and violent - it seems like every scene has to have at least one death in it. They aren't big Civil War battle scenes, just one scene after another of small, ugly events taking place in locations where nobody would ever find out about it. It's almost like a bad old Western, but tucked away somewhere in the hills of North Carolina. Memo to Hollywood: a good story cannot be composed of a series of unpleasant events! Supposedly, it's also a love story between Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters, but there is no real chemistry between the two and very little justification for their ""love."" Kidman looks too glamorous anyway, in the environment the film is set in. You get the impression that her stylist was never more than a few feet off camera. Jude Law does just fine in his role though. Renee Zellweger brings life to the film in the second half, but not really enough to save the movie overall. Just watch the scenes with Zellweger in it, and fast forward through the rest - you won't miss anything of value."

","When a movie tries to be everything to everyone, it usually fails to live up to anyone's expectations. Cold Mountain is one of few exceptions to that rule. The critically acclaimed, award-winning film is now available on 2-disc DVD and VHS.<br/><br/>While the recent theatrical success of Fahrenheit 9/11 highlights the country's division regarding the war in Iraq, this film tells a similar tale. Set in a time where America was torn apart by clashing ideology and values, Cold Mountain is an epic saga of life during Civil War America. In it, we bear witness to the lives of a blossoming couple who are torn apart by duty and loyalty to one's country. Inman (Jude Law, Road To Perdition) is a young Confederate solider who, after being wounded in battle, deserts the war and takes a 300 mile walk toward home and his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman, The Hours). Inman's journey takes him away from the war and towards the peace he sees can only reside at home with his love. But, standing in his way are bounty hunters, slaves, sirens and Union soldiers at every turn. Meanwhile, well-to-do Ada takes a journey of her own. While his absence cements her feelings for him, Ada fears her love for Inman may be in vain as her countless letters go unanswered. When her father dies suddenly, she must learn to take care of herself and to survive long winters, merciless lawmen and overwhelming solitude. Along the way, she forms a life-long alliance with Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger, Chicago), a scrappy drifter who only knows hardship and back-breaking work.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain is a breathtaking drama and love story starring award-winning actors, based on an award-winning book and directed by an award-winning director. Written by Charles Frazier in 1997, Cold Mountain, the novel, won the National Book Award that same year. Director, Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley) came across the book and decided to adapt it into the film now known for seven Oscar nominations including Best Supporting Actress, Best Actor, Best Cinematography and Best Score. In addition to about a thousand Romanian soldiers, the film also includes cameos by Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones), Jena Malone (Saved!), Jack White (singer of the rock band The White Stripes), Phillip Seymour Hoffman (25th Hour), Giovanni Ribisi (Lost in Translation), Donald Sutherland (The Italian Job) and more. <br/><br/>Cold Mountain has been released on DVD and VHS. Special features on the 2-disc collector's edition include feature commentary with the director and editor; 'Climbing Cold Mountain', a documentary; 'Words and Music of Cold Mountain', a 90-plus minute special about the music behind the movie; 'A Journey to Cold Mountain', a featurette on the making of the film; 3 storyboard comparisons and 11 deleted scenes. <br/><br/>Not only does this film deglamorize war and highlight its violence and brutality, Cold Mountain also takes us beyond the battlefield and into the lives of the civilians, many of them women, left behind to fend for themselves while the majority of the men fight for their cause. Rarely do you come across a film about the Civil War that is accessible to all people. Surprisingly, Cold Mountain has the ability to draw in men with its action and women with its romance. Though, the film does drag a bit at times, Zellweger makes up for it in her Oscar winning performance as the strong-willed yet humorous Ruby. In fact, all of the acting is brilliant. The above-mentioned cameos are all well executed and Kidman and Law are extremely believable as the star-crossed lovers, Ada and Inman. Shot largely in the unspoiled country of Romania, the landscape is stunningly beautiful. To top it all off, the well-crafted film is also set to a phenomenal score by Oscar-winning composer Gabriel Yared and original music performed by Sting, Elvis Costello, Jack White and many others.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain gives the audience a little bit of everything: action, romance, drama, even some comedy. It is a sweeping epic with big battle sequences, passionate love scenes and a haunting score. And, yes, it is worth 2 ½ hours of your time."

WWII movies are full of it; the longing to go back.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the DVD because of the historic background and the detail of the difficulty of making the film when so little of the world does not have modern physical features.  However, I would have liked to see a director's cut because some of the cut scenes helped make sense of events in the film and really belonged in.<br/><br/>I did not like the English Patient because I did not like the book either. The Talented Mr. Ripley is one of my all time favorites and I own  it.  I could not get into the book Cold Mountain but my give it another try.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Cold Mountain but it is not a love story or an action flick.  It is more about how difficult challenges effect a person.  Some cannot bear the burden, but some survive.<br/><br/>I also found the music mesmerizing.

A truly great performance, and a marvelous character.<br/><br/>I thought Nichole Kidman also had an excellent performance as Ada.

If they thought they were going to see a love story, they didn't. <br/><br/>Instead you got to witness the journey of an unworthy and somewhat despicable character who evaded and escaped from characters even more despicable then he, for the purpose of reuniting with, not a lover, but a mere acquaintance.<br/><br/>The performance of Jude Law was without any passion. He didn't show fear when he should have been scared to death. He didn't display anger when he should have been mad as hell, and regardless how perilous his plight, he never showed despair.<br/><br/>Whether the responsibility is that of the director, the content of the book or even the quality of the screen play, I do not know, but the opportunity to make a very good or even great movie was missed.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should have considered new patches on old jeans.

","Probably one of the more pronounced impressions of this film is its dusty and nostalgic feeling for old classics.  It has all the right ingredients - a small farm town, a southern belle, her farmhand lover, a war, villains and deceivers everywhere, and your immortal tragedy.  But in order to bake a cake it takes more than just ingredients, it also takes exquisite chefs. And who better for such a job than Jude Law, Renee Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>I found the most difficult part of the movie to digest in terms of plot to be the short-lived courtship of Ada Monroe (Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law). Once you can accept that their almost nonexistent relationship has had an enormous effect on them both, the movie seems to movie along without further questioning.  The plot is very simple.  It is the Civil War and Inman is a confederate officer gone off to war.  Ada agrees to wait for him but months and then years pass.  To help her survive, Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) comes to help her on the farm.  The two become close friends during dark times.  The only thing keeping Inman going out on the battlefield is the letters he receives from Ada.  When she tells him to come back to her he obeys, but the journey home proves harder than he ever could have imagined.<br/><br/>I have wondered how true to life some of the elements of this story are. More men died in the Civil War than all the other wars combined.  That alone should give some indication of how gruesome life was at that time.  But for those that lived on or who sat at home and waited, praying for their loved ones to return, what was it like for them?  This movie tries to give some indication of that existence.  The horrors it shows I can only hope weren't real but in my gut believe they could have been much worse. <br/><br/>
This movie seemed to depict how two young people were trying not to fall in love and yet despite themselves did so completely.  Outside influence symbolized by the war is so determined to break them apart in their struggle towards one another.  When all else appears to have to gone to hell, these two individuals cling tightly to what they believe and pray they have left - each other."

","The book Cold Mountain is a near-perfect example of what people mean when they say that certain books are extremely difficult to effectively transform into a movie. It seems as if certain scenes or plot elements were thrown into the movie purely out of obligation to remain (somewhat)faithful to the book. And even when some scenes were adapted fairly smoothly the literary elements such as irony did not really add anything to the movie [***SPOILER***: i'm referring to the scene in which Natalie Portman's baby is covered up by a soldier who has compassion for the child, and then the same soldier is subsequently shot in the back by Jude Law although Law's character could have allowed him to escape.]<br/><br/>Also I agree with other comments saying that Jude Law and Nicole Kidman had only so-so chemistry. It seemed to me that Mr. Law and Natalie Portman had much more natural energy in their scenes than did the former pair. In general the acting performances well all quite adequate, but not spectacular- except perhaps Renee Zelwegger, whose down-and-dirty character is about as far from her celebrity image as can be, but her character had the effect of being distracting in an almost sideshow-like manner. Overall however the movie did have a number of strong points. The period atmosphere was done fairly well. The musical score was quite good, although I would have preferred if they didn't attempt to replicate the sounds of the locale+time period and stuck to the gentle piano medley backed by occasional orchestral strings (the heart of the movie was the romance, after all). As far as being a true movie experience the film did very well so if you're into period pieces with epic scopes go ahead and rent or buy this movie. In the end, however, although I liked this film I keep thinking about how much better it could have been."

Some people thinks that all the love stories are the same, they think that all is already invented. I'm of the opinion that each love story is different and depending on how it is told is better or worse. This film shows a kind of love so strong that it can overcome all the obstacles (yes, yes, I know, like the majority of the romantic films). The main characters haven't known yet, but they understand that they are predestined. And they also understand that something wrong is going to happen and, even so, they decided to continue with their love.

","Few movies have had a tactile impact on me... Cold Mountain is one of them. When you plunk down your $23 dollars to go to the cinema, you expect to be entertained, but I was MORE than entertained by Cold Mountain.  It started about 45 minutes into it, I could feel the light prickle of goose bumps on my forearm.  Before I knew it, my whole body was numb and I was asking the stranger next to me if she had a jacket I could borrow.  Cold Mountain was the coldest I've ever felt in a movie theater - hats off (or should I say ""ski caps ON!!"":)) to Anthony Hopkins and his marvelous crew of thespians. Renee Zelwegger's American accent WAS a little bit on the shaky side, but anyone who has seen DOWN WITH LOVE knows that this saucy little Brit can act.  Bring tissue, but more importantly, bring a sweater - If you are ready to feel the chill, then head on over to Cold Mountain... where romance and intrigue are waiting for you."

","When I first went into the theater to see this movie I was expecting it to be more on the more action side of things.  Then, as things moved along I realized it was more of a love story than anything else.<br/><br/>But it was great.  The roles were perfectly suited for each actor, literally as if Nicole, Jude and Renee were born to play those.<br/><br/>To answer the previous review as to why a movie like this would appeal to the female audience under 18, it's probably because of the romance behind it.  Deep down, many of us crave for that ""love never dies, conquers all"" in our lives and to see it in movie form, and done so well, really hits home.<br/><br/>Macho movie?  Kinda, but for both sides of the gender really.  In this movie we also see two women take on very strong, independent roles.  Again, this may be a reason why the ladies enjoyed the movie so much."

","*Spoiler* Nominated for several academy awards, and set against the Civil War, Cold Mountain brings three highly-lauded actors to the screen under the meticulous direction of Anthony Minghella (Talented Mr. Ripley).  Just before the outbreak of war, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) moves to a quiet, North Carolina mountain village with her father, a minister.   Catching the eye of W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a quiet young man with no family, we witness the infantile simplicity of budding love in the 19th Century.  Only speaking a few words to each other, the war begins and Inman is whisked off to the battlefield.  Having come from aristocracy, Monroe is completely and wholly unprepared for life when her father suddenly passes away.  Without her parents (her mother is gone before the story begins), she begins a love-struck descent into poverty and starvation, as she lacks the ability to accomplish the simplest of tasks.  Unable to even cook for herself, she is essentially a fully ambulatory invalid without the intellect to negotiate anything beyond beggary.  As the audience packs their bags for a guilt trip of sympathy, Inman is experiencing true hell on earth.  No one who has ever seen combat can deny the physical and mental rigors of war; and however resilient and loyal to his fellow man, Inman is obsessed with returning to his true love, with whom he has spent mere moments.  The film trudges through sappy letters, personal reflection, and pathetic displays of worthlessness on the part of Ada.  Enter Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger). The Tomboy comes to the rescue, and adds a light-hearted, comedic relief to the nearly morose existence of Monroe.  As Ruby helps till the ground, prepare meals for themselves, and maintain the estate, only then does a bit of life reenter Ada's being.  With relatively interesting subplots of desertion and survival, Cold Mountain is saved by solid acting (if the performances were truly reflective of the characters of Frazier's novel) and talented direction and camerawork.  However, the main storyline nearly elicits nausea.  Rated R for violence and sexuality, I give the film a C."

","With all the oscar buzz, I went and saw this film. I read the book about 3 years ago, and I found the book to be the typical love story, and so I went adn saw it and I was so disapointed. Nicole Kidman is a good actress, but the role of Ada wasen't good. She looks like a princess in the civil war, with soft hair and make-up. I just can't belive Jude Law got a nomination. Renee was good, but it is not her best role. In my opinion Shoheren (spelling) did a better job. The music was very nice, ""Scarlet tide"" was a great song (deserved oscar), both, the cinematography and edition is very good (should have won CIDADE DE DEUS- city of god).

","There are many striking images to come out of Cold Mountain, the current screen adaptation of the novel by Charles Frazier about the final days of the America Civil War and one confederate soldier's arduous journey home to the woman he loves.  The magnificent vistas of the Appalachian Mountains in both winter and spring is one, as are the battle scenes with their gut-wrenching mix of mud and blood.  But perhaps the most enduring image, for better or worse, is Nicole Kidman as the film's heroine, Ada Monroe.<br/><br/>Kidman, undoubtedly the screen's most luminous beauty at this moment, shines like a porcelain doll through much of the movie, while the rest of her cast-mates are covered in sweat, blood and grime.  Ironic, too, that she should remain such a vision throughout so much of the movie given the transformation she undergoes from pristine and protected preacher's daughter to independent farm-owner.  Unfortunately, Kidman, with her perfectly chiseled features, rouged cheeks and spun-gold hair, looks like she is from another movie, not the `at the end of her tether' heroine on the brink of ruin you expect here.<br/><br/>Perhaps director Anthony Minghella wanted to present Ada in an idyllic light, showcase her as a fantasy of what her lover strives so mightily to return home to.  If that is the case, it is the one misstep Minghella makes in this outstanding epic of love, war, the ties that bind and man's inhumanity to man.  Minghella, whose other works include such outstanding films as The Talented Mr. Ripley and The English Patient, brings to bear his signature talent for deftly blending the epic and the intimate on this singularly captivating story.  Witness the grand scale of the battle at Petersburg in the film's opening moments, grand masses of men going to their slaughter, seamlessly intercut with shots of a tintype picture carefully preserved in a book, lovingly carried by a soldier far from home and his love.<br/><br/>Cold Mountain centers around the love story between Kidman's Ada, the daughter of Donald Sutherland's Reverend Monroe, and Jude Law's Inman, a hard-working young man who is called to war.  She is only recently arrived in the North Carolina village of Cold Mountain, but they are immediately attracted to each other and profess their love for each other the day Inman is called to war.<br/><br/>Injured in battle and captured by Union troops, Inman recovers enough that he escapes from his hospital bed and begins a long, perilous journey home to Ada.  Meanwhile, the death of the Reverend Monroe leaves Ada home alone with no means of support, no ability to till and maintain her farm, and a corrupt local law-keeper hanging around, determined to marry her for her farm. Fortune steps in and sends her Renee Zellweger's plain-looking, plain-talking and hard-working Ruby Thewes, who helps Ada get the farm up and running again.<br/><br/>There are many delights to partake of in Cold Mountain, not the least of which is Jude Law's nearly dialouge-free performance as Inman.  Law holds the audience spellbound, projecting a quiet intensity and determination of will that seems to propel him toward home and Ada.  Along the way, he encounters a variety of characters who both help and hinder him, including Philip Seymour Hoffman as a disgraced priest, Giovanni Ribisi's duplicitous farmer and Natalie Portman's abandoned widow, left alone to care for the sick child of her dead husband.<br/><br/>Her seemingly untouchable looks aside, Kidman creates a fascinating picture of the prototypic southern belle (though not in the Gone With the Wind, Jezebel tradition).  Her Ada embarks on a deeply personal, inward journey in which she encounters her own roster of memorable characters, from Ray Winstone's cruel lawkeeper , Kathy Baker's kind and nurturing neighbor and Brendan Gleeson's redeemed father to Zellweger's Ruby.<br/><br/>As for Zellweger, she commits an overt act of piracy and steals Cold Mountain from both Kidman and Law.  Almost unrecognizable at her entrance, and using an accent that verges on parody, Zellweger's Ruby ultimately injects Cold Mountain with a boost of human comedy and drama that is at once thoroughly charming, heartbreaking and endearing.  She takes charge of the screen as assuredly as Ruby takes charge of Ada's farm, and just like Ruby, she complements, never detracts, from the central focus of the love story that is Ada and Inman.<br/><br/>Orchestrating this entire enterprise, of course, in Minghella, the Oscar-winning director of The English Patient.  He is likely to be a top contender for that award again this year, given the burning passion he invests in Cold Mountain. (*** ½)"

","Allow me to preface my comments by saying that I have yet to read the book on which Cold Mountain is based, but Minghella's dependable allegiance to the literary works he translates to film lead me to assume that the original story is similar enough.<br/><br/>Jude Law offers a superb performance as Inman, the impassioned and driven lover who withstands many trials in his quest back to his love.  Although Law makes it very easy to believe that Inman is truly in love and devoted to Ada (Nicole Kidman), the non-existent foundation of their love as laid out in the first 30 min. of the film left me often thinking ""Oh!  Com'on, they wouldn't be that in love, that devoted, to someone they barely even know!""<br/><br/>Kidman's performance is average as Ada, the object of Inman's affection and the prize at the end of his course.  She pulls off the over-privileged and under-experienced upper-class girl quite well, but when it comes to the basic tenets of a character's believability, she falls slightly behind. One viewer mentioned that she loses her accent sometimes, but I never even heard her accent.  Throughout the course of the film, she is supposed to toughen and become more worldly, but she looks like the same porcelain Kidman in raggedy, rough-hewn clothes.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger delivers one of the best performances of her career.  I have never agreed with the Academy more than when they gave her the Best Supporting Actress Award.  She is wholly Ruby.  She is witty, unapologetic, and never skips a beat.  She seems to be the hearty person of the character she portrays.<br/><br/>Anthony Minghella's work in this film is well executed.  Beautiful, sad colors, even when the Sun is shining, subtle photography that blends with the story, and top-notch performances by (almost) all on screen make it worth at least a rental.  When I think about Minghella's films, I realize that he cares more about the culture and the place in which his characters live rather than the characters themselves, and this is more apparent than ever in Cold Mountain.<br/><br/>In general, the film is quite impactful and intense.  The performances are engaging and the scenery beautiful, but the love that acts as the foundation and cause of the plot is weak and gives way easily to the scrutiny of a discerning viewer."

","Apart from its being a great historical reconstruction of American Civil War, I would say this movie is really depressing; Ada, played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman, doesn't even kisses Inman (Jude Law) and she finds herself engaged to him, waiting for him coming back from the war. And as soon as her promised groom comes back, he gets killed after getting her into trouble... Should I comment on it I wouldn't know whether it's more unlikely or unhappy. There are also several positive notes, in my opinion. Locations are fantastic: the picture, though set in North Carolina, was filmed in Romania's Carpathian mountains that gave the rendering of then Carolina much more than every other american place. Battles are frequent and bloody but visual effects never excessive, so all those scenes, along with the ones shot in the village of Cold Mountain, offer a suggestive portrait of Civil War. Leading actor and actress, after getting an Oscar nomination, didn't win any prize, whereas R. Zellweger won the best supporting actress prize. Anyway they all three produced excellent performances.

","This is a great drama that contains many interesting elements of romance, struggle, and the human condition, that nicely combine into a satisfying plot but it is truly the actors (and mainly the supporting ones at that) that make this a film worth seeing. There are many striking performances from individuals who ofter go above and beyond their pre-established skill levels.  Indeed, it is not the actors telling the story but rather the characters themselves. The Stanislavski method was definitely in use and just as the actors had immersed themselves in the roles, we, the audience we're able to be fully immersed in the story. Of particular note (besides, of course, the incomparable Renee Zellweger, who is fantastic but won her Oscar based not only on this performance but that of the last three years of work!) are Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Kathy Baker and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who all make the most of their brief, yet poignant, appearances in the film.  Each of these actors make their jobs seem effortless and all have an incredible way of getting at the soul of the piece and the heart of the audience. All in all, this is a fine drama and worth at least one look.  Be prepared to get lost in the story and inwardly applaud those who made its telling possible."

","First off I would like to point out that I was actually looking forward to this movie. I'm a big fan of civil war movies. This was promoted as a civil war movie, but there was very little war in it. Aside from the incredible opening battle scene it wasn't a war movie at all. The real focus of the movie is on the romance, but the problem is throughout the movie you tend to forget that it's a romance.<br/><br/>At first this movie is quite an enjoyable movie. The early flashbacks of when they first met and when he first went to war made for a great story. I was actually enjoying the movie, but then enter Giovanni Ribisi. A gifted actor, who hasn't had a decent role in 5 years. Once his character is introduced the movie kind of falls apart. From that point on every single scene there's some other quirky character one of them meet. At the end the movie picks up a bit, but it's never able to completely stabilize.<br/><br/>Considering the talent the movie assembles, the majority of performances were rather bland. First off we have Jude Law. I think he is an amazing actor, but he was horribly mis cast. Jude Law is a very charasmatic actor who is best when he's playing characters with a lot of personality. Casting him as a quiet soft spoken guy was a horrible idea and a waste of his talent. Then Nicole Kidman, who is also a very good actress, but she was playing a character with very little depth. The circumstances around her character were interesting, but she was a very plain character. That brings us to the award winning performance, by Renne Zellweger. She was little more than comic relief in the movie. It just goes to show you, all it takes for an actress to win an award is to alter her appearance.<br/><br/>The only real life in the performances were the small roles of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brendan Gleeson and Natalie Protman. The scene with Natalie Portman is probably the strongest point of the movie, but far too short.<br/><br/>All in all Cold Mountain was a pretty good movie, but I think that if Harvey Weinstein and Anthony Minghella were more concerned with making a good movie than winning oscars it good of been so much better."

","Isn't anyone tired of all this Hollywood glossiness and soppy melodrama??? This movie almost made me sick with all those ""oh-so-Hollywood"" overly loud weeping music on the background of the fighting scenes (it is supposed to tell the very stupid viewer of the film how he is supposed to feel about this fighting - but for God's sake, don't make it this obvious!! + the viewer is not that stupid..); with all those cliches (white dove in the church and oh so many others); with its predictability (why, why wasn't Jude Law  killed right in the middle of the film?? - it would have perhaps made it a bit more interesting..) etc. The choice of music was terrible - over-dramatic and too loud!!(at the beginning, over the battle scene), just not subtle enough, so grotesquely Hollywood. The whole film prefers to chew things for you, assuming that you are not intelligent or sensitive enough to get the meaning of the scenes WITHOUT all those means. This film perhaps could have been turned into something worth watching, with the given script (even though the script has quite a few holes as well, and the relationship between Ada and Inman is not started off properly and not believable), if it was not for this style of directing. It could have avoided all the glossiness and been a bit more realistic (the sex scene between Kidman and Law, for example - why couldn't they make it simple and naturalistic rather than this pornographic glossy  Hollywood style - does that happen in real life??) Where is psychology? Where is the subtelty? Where is originality?.. Nevertheless, the film had also some good things about them, if you turn a blind eye on all the above. It made me think about how in the war relationships between people are so much more intense and rapid; how people who have been through this experience know what really matters in life; how they value so much more their lives and the people around them; and what an unnatural and silly in its cruelty thing is the war. The violence in the film also works well. 5 out of 10."

","Starting in I had a trepidation that ""Cold Mountain"" was going to be sympathetic to the South. It takes place in the fictional town of Cold Mountain in western North Carolina.  The townfolk are constructing a church in anticipation of the arrival of the new pastor (Canadian Donald Sutherland) and his daughter (raised in Australia Nicole Kidman).  Sparks eventually fly between the daughter, Ada, and a carpenter, Inman (Englishman Jude Law).<br/><br/>The romance between the two is supposedly the main plot point sustaining the movie but it's really to demonstrate the futility and eventual desperation of the Confederacy.  When war was announced, the menfolk of the town were enthusiastic to join the fight.  Three years later, some of them - those that haven't died - have had their fill of fighting and try to return home as deserters.<br/><br/>Here's where the dramatic tension comes in the film.  The South had set up a Home Guard, a force granted powers to ensure deserters and the people who sheltered them were punished.  Naturally the Home Guard abused those powers and that's what we see in ""Cold Mountain"".<br/><br/>I read one negative review regarding the lack of African-Americans in the film.  It is true their are very few scenes with slaves but I let is slide because the scenes take place mainly in the Appalachians where slavery was not common.  Indeed it gets me to thinking why the people there would want to fight for a system that was against their interests.<br/><br/>What did confuse me were the mountains.  The Appalachians are ancient and rounded.  The film was shot in Romania and its craggy Carpathians.  I expected to see troikas in the mountain snow scenes.<br/><br/>Lastly a reviewer remarked the Renee Zellweger appeared to be channeling Granny Clampett.  It was meant as a insult but I like that.

All the work done with the characters, their development throughout the movie, their purpose and intersections was indeed felt and understood. notice how Ada started off, how she matured all along and how she ended up (you can see her becoming that old  woman who provided Inman with food, medicine and words of wisdom).<br/><br/>I really liked how the movie begins with harsh present war scenes and soothing peaceful flashbacks in parallel. It places us right inside Inman's head. makes us understand everything. How a man feels in the field of the battle. Why he had to think of ada then and keep her inside him all along. And why, although they had only exchanged a few words, she was a reason good enough for him to risk his life back to cold mountain. The director did a brilliant job making us understand the characters insides, perspectives and motives.<br/><br/>can't remember when was the last time I enjoyed let alone believe an intense love story. the fact that Inman and Ada barely knew each doesn't make the story the least naive. I think that human beings are capable of such love, especially at times of war (that goes for great wars of men and small wars of our own lives) it's just that our structured minds won't let us believe it. But if we give ourselves the chance and are lucky enough of course, such a scenario is not so far from reality. And if. If the illusion of someone or something shall keeps us alive, I say hold on to the illusion and never let go.<br/><br/>the movie beautifully puts us in touch with that lost wonderful part in us.<br/><br/>other than that, the movie is so much more than a love story. It's about bitter war and what it makes of men. how the evil in us finds a way to create wars in already existing wars just for us to have a purpose. How men need a war to be in this world. And how in the middle of all, one forgets what he once knew and eventually what he's fighting for.<br/><br/>
I felt that in the movie, every word had its place, every character its function. and at the end, i felt like i was reading a book not watching a movie. and that sure counts. The movie was pretty intense. It's painful and beautiful.<br/><br/>It's Ice cold and heart aching warmth in sync."

True, it is flawed, and for most of the<br/><br/>reasons that people have cited; Nicole Kidman looks out of<br/><br/>place--tall and beautiful, with great skin and teeth;.  There is an<br/><br/>absence of black characters, when at this time, 1/3 of the<br/><br/>population of North Carolina was black; The film was made in<br/><br/>Romania, when it took place in the states.  <br/><br/>I personally don't mind it that the characters are all too ""pretty"" to be<br/><br/>in this film.  The way people look has much to do with the reason<br/><br/>they become stars.  The absence of black characters may be a<br/><br/>more valid criticism, as there were many in the book.  But this<br/><br/>does not take away from the story.  And, although I feel for the<br/><br/>people who protested this movie because it meant losing<br/><br/>entertainment jobs for Americans, Romania served as a great<br/><br/>location to film this movie, as it had many spots untouched by<br/><br/>industry, could convincingly depict the four seasons of the year in<br/><br/>the short period that they had to film, and of course, it brought the<br/><br/>budget down.<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" is a brutal and disturbing odyssey, much more so<br/><br/>than Anthony Minghella's other epic, ""The English Patient.""  In it, we<br/><br/>witness graphic animal slaughter, cruelty toward Southern<br/><br/>deserters, (including a pair of sons murdered in front of their<br/><br/>mother while she is being tortured), and other violent encounters. <br/><br/>At times, it is as unpredictable as it is formulaic, as we are<br/><br/>surprised by characters who are suddenly killed off, or who<br/><br/>unexpectedly come back to us.  <br/><br/>I can't understand why people find it unbelievable that Jude Law<br/><br/>and Nicole Kidman would have a connection from only a few<br/><br/>moments together.  War rushes things, and relationships like this<br/><br/>have been common (I don't know as much about the Civil War, but<br/><br/>during WWII, many couples divorced after the man returned home,<br/><br/>as they hastily got married before they went overseas.)  Even<br/><br/>without war, people have devoted themselves to others whom they<br/><br/>hardly knew, off of brief connections they felt with each-other.  I<br/><br/>also do not agree with those who complain that Law and Kidman<br/><br/>spend the entire movie apart, when we are paying to see them<br/><br/>together.  The two leads have quite a few scenes together. <br/><br/>
As Law deserts and travels back to Nicole Kidman, he experiences many different encounters with interesting characters,<br/><br/>including a woman who slaughters her loyal goat in front of us,<br/><br/>people who routinely try to turn him over to the Confederacy, and a<br/><br/>very powerful sequence with a war-widow (I never knew Natalie<br/><br/>Portman could act!).  These encounters are unfortunately uneven<br/><br/>when compared to each other, but they all work in their own right,<br/><br/>and always keep us interested.  Nicole Kidman's life back at home<br/><br/>is equally important, as is her relationship with Oscar-winner,<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger (and I do pity that poor rooster!)  A posse of men<br/><br/>stays in the town to hunt and kill deserters, providing many<br/><br/>suspenseful and frightening moments; these characters are<br/><br/>outrageously evil and murderous.  My biggest complaint about the<br/><br/>film is how their story unsatisfyingly ends with a quick shootout. <br/><br/>
Now while I found the film to be one of the more creative,<br/><br/>interesting, and entertaining movies of the year, I found it achieved<br/><br/>far less than the greatness that the filmmakers probably tried to<br/><br/>produce.  The script needed more work.  I haven't read the book,<br/><br/>and I suppose it was difficult to adapt.  Something overall is<br/><br/>missing from ""Cold Mountain.""

These help to transform the film from a straightforward tearjerker-for-spinsters into the kind of engaging quiet-loud epic that never quite exceeds the constraints of the human bladder. All in all, a solid choice for boy-girl cinemagoing. All performances are strong, even if Jude Law's matinee-idol southern drawl shifts occasionally into self-caricature, with deservedly Oscar-winning comic interludes from Renée Zellweiger, Kiefer Sutherland as a pompous philandering reverend and a banjo-playing cameo from Jack White of the White Stripes. Perhaps the southern landscape could have been better filmed - the landscape-shots are less affectionate than in, say, 'O Brother Where Art Thou'."

","I really hated the preview for this movie.  The preview had a lot of voice-over narration where Nicole Kidman is reading letters Ada wrote to Inman while he was away at war.  This narration is oh so overly dramatic like they were making this movie out to be on a level with Shakespeare.  But the movie turned out to be much less annoying.  Actually it is pretty good. Jude Law and Renee Zellweger are good in their roles.  I would agree that Zellweger deserves an Oscar nomination.  Her part is unlike anything she has ever done and it shows her range as an actress.  (By the way, if you want to see Renee's best performance, check out Whole Wide World.) <br/><br/>
The movie does have a couple of serious flaws, though.  For one thing, the whole premise is that Ada and Inman have this overpowering love for each other. Yet they never say more than a few short sentences to each other during the ENTIRE movie.  Despite the fact that they barely get to know each other before Inman goes off to war, he is willing to desert his army unit and travel hundreds of miles on foot to get back to her.  Yes, I know that some people do fall madly in love without really getting to know the object of their affection.  But in a movie, I need more than a few sentences to be able to buy into a relationship, especially if that relationship is the central theme of the movie.<br/><br/>""""Major Spoiler** The second problem is that I felt cheated by the ending.  You sit there for 2 1/2 hours watching this guy fight and claw his way back to Ada and then he gets killed the morning after he makes it back to her!?  When the whole movie is about someone striving to achieve some goal, you don't want that person to die when they finally get there.  That would be like Frodo falling into the pit of fire at the end of Lord of the Rings or Seabiscuit dying of a heart attack right after he crosses the finish line.  I get so tired of movies that kill off one of the main characters at the end for no purpose other than dramatic effect.  You can just imagine the movie-makers sitting around discussing the plot: ""This story just isn't dramatic enough.  Hey, why don't we have Inman die at the end?  That might be just what we need to put us in Oscar contention.""  7 out of 10"
"WalterFrith","Null","0","0","26 February 2004"," A patchy and spotty epic.
","'Cold Mountain' suffers from a lack of coherent structure.    There is confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law), his true love Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Ada's helper and friend Ruby (Renee Zellweger).  The three of them suffer the daily routine of waiting for the American civil war to end so Inman can be united with Ada.<br/><br/>'Cold Mountain' has patchy moments of conflict and unpleasantness and lacks the foundation of tying it all together until the final few minutes.  It's sort of like looking at a jigsaw puzzle that has its bottom third completed but the top of the puzzle is still in many pieces.  It is a war film that IS quite unique.  One major battle scene among the soldiers but several scenes of clandestine crime in the bushes by hillbilly thugs, soldiers who are deserters and people just looking for a way to survive.<br/><br/>Director Anthony Minghella hasn't been able to re-capture the artistry of 'The English Patient' and perhaps his art gallery style of directing could take a back seat for a while and maybe he could try and show us some diversity...if he has any."

","I went to see ""Cold Mountain""  with my wife and in the end we had a big argument--of course she liked it and I could not get out of the theater soon enough. But then even two days later I was thinking about the movie, and even had some dreams about it! The film clearly had a powerful effect on me.<br/><br/>Why was that? It was surely not the acting (the interactions between the protagonists are uninspiring--they give each other long looks that were supposed to embody pain and passion and that was it). It was not the character development (absolutely lacking except as the plot outline promised Ada ""struggles to keep the farm"" which culminates in her successfully shooting a turkey!). It was not the predictable plot (the cast of different characters Inman meets on his journey was the only redeeming feature). And even as the sweeping shots of Romanian landscape were good, I had a strange feeling that the cinematographer could have done a lot more with the peace and beauty of nature--as opposed to the gory mess the warring men create out of life. <br/><br/>Come to think about it later, that was it. The most haunting and redeeming feature of the film was that tons of people die in it. None of deaths is beautiful. None of the deaths is glorious. All the deaths seem almost inevitable. Nothing is more contrasting than the Southern jubilation on the great news ""we got a war"" shown (in a flashback) after one of the most gory battle scenes ever shot. It makes you really consider the frailty of life and especially question thinking about wars from your armchair in terms of geopolitical abstractions. (reminds me of ""Dead Iraqi Would Have Loved Freedom"" article from The Onion). It's interesting that just like in the ""English Patient"" Minghella takes up the cause of the losing side in the conflict.<br/><br/>All in all, an overlong, cheesy Oscar vehicle--but not a total failure."

","Cold Mountain is Oscar Bait personified: based upon an epic bestselling novel (by Charles Frazier) with a rabid following, adapted and directed by a multiple Academy Award winner, populated by an acclaimed star cast and crew, bursting with sweeping widescreen vistas and a plot that covers love, life, death and destiny.  Yep, on paper, Cold Mountain looks like this year's All-Star Oscar Team. So what's it like on screen?  Well, it ain't great, but it ain't bad either. and the pedigree's to blame.  This film wants to be caught in a hailstorm of Oscars so badly it shows.  And as we all know, desperation is never an attractive quality, even if you are gorgeous.<br/><br/>With the wilds of Romania ably standing in for the Civil War-ravaged American South, the film begins with a battle that ends in a bloodbath, in which confederate soldier John Inman (Law) finds himself smack in the middle.  The senseless carnage around him brings about a powerful moment of clarity, forcing him to abandon the travesty of the war and make his way home to the girl he loves, Ada (Kidman).  We flash back to years earlier when Ada, a startlingly attractive southern belle, arrived in the titular farming town with her Reverend father (Donald Sutherland) to start a new life.  She immediately strikes up a flame with Inman, a strong silent type if there ever was one. They begin a guarded courtship. then the War comes a-blowing.  Inman enthusiastically signs up and is whisked away to the battlefield - but not before trading photographs and one passionate kiss with Ada.  Months, then years, pass as Ada sends letter after letter to Inman, who is a little too busy being shot at by Yankee soldiers to reciprocate.  Cold Mountain has since become a place of tragedy; a band of self-appointed `guardsmen' (led by Ray Winstone) are shooting deserters on sight, while increasing numbers of husbands and sons are confirmed dead from the front lines. Ada holds out hope for Inman, but his silence is a cause for concern.  When tragedy touches Ada, she isn't equipped with the skills to maintain the family farm and it begins to decay, a situation alleviated by Ruby (Zellwegger), a rough-hewn, heart o' gold backwoods gal who kindly offers to help her out.  Meanwhile, Inman embarks on an odyssey of Homerian proportions to make his way back, meeting all manner of people on the way (among them, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Melora Walters, Jena Malone and an explosive Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>Despite various scenes of jarring brutality, this is all played out with a stately, old-school Hollywood manner and earnest intentions - a little too earnest at times.  The story's episodic structure is effective, though while some vignettes are gripping, others are strictly cornball.  The dialogue veers from profound to laughable and the performances are equally variable. Law is terrific, Kidman stumbles over her accent at first but manages to pull it together, and Zellwegger is charming but clearly overdoing it - but the efforts of the huge supporting cast keep you watching.  John Seale's photography is stunning and Walter Murch's skillful editing makes the 155 minute journey a smooth one.  It's surprisingly dark at times, shockingly cheesy at others - a real split personality of a film.  I guess that's what happens when you try and mix your own Oscar-winning masterpiece: there's going to be as much Titanic as there is Lawrence of Arabia.<br/><br/>* * * (out of 5 stars)"

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","19 February 2004"," Kidman's adequate, Law's darn good, Zellweger steals the show..and what a spectacularly dazzling supporting cast!
","Spoilers <br/><br/>During the first half-hour of this 155-minute movie, you wonder if the story is going to be told through flashbacks. A clear pattern soon emerges, as you realise that the brief flashbacks are only to cover the initial encounter of Ada (Nicole Kidman), the new minister's refined daughter and Inman (Jude Law), an uncouth, shy wood worker, before he sets out to fight the Civil War for the South. The story then unfolds, for most of the rest of the movie, in two parallel lines, until close to the end when the two meet again. His line follows basically the highway movie pattern as he, a deserter and fugitive on his way home, runs into all kind of interesting people. Her story takes a different mode, as we see her struggling against poverty after her father's death, to keep her homestead from coveting goons now self-appointed as local law enforcer during the war. The struggle seems hopeless until Ruby (Renee Zellweger), a down-to-earth expert farm-hand, materialises to help transform her from someone who has never done anything that would give concrete results to a survivor adept in ploughing the fields just as well as in going out in the snow to shoot a fowl for food.<br/><br/>There appears to be two main themes in the movie: war and love. The horror of war is shown not that much through actual depiction of battles, as through the aftermath. As a matter of fact, the only battle scene in the entire movie occurs at the very beginning and is nowhere near the carnage we witness in Saving Private Ryan. The senselessness and cruelty, as well as the warping of human nature, however, is seen in every event that surround the separated couple. <br/><br/>The love story elevates itself above common melodrama through an almost saintly sublimation. They hardly know each other when they parted and it's only the urgency of the imminent war that drives them to one passionate kiss, in open view his comrades waiting for him. Throughout their ensuing vicissitude in separation, they cling to the thoughts of each other for strength to survive, particularly at moments of near-despair. To ask whether this is realistic and possible is missing the point. It's the unreserved sublimation of everything good that is so completely refreshing and lights up this movie.<br/><br/>Of the three main roles, Kidman turns in a fine though unspectacular performance. Law had well distinguished himself playing a variety of roles since he made a mark with Talented Mr. Ripley, and convincingly proofing that he is not just a pretty face by his portrayal of a blood chilling villain Maguire in Road to Perdition last year. The intensity, fire and innocence he ably combined in the character of Inman again shows his quality. Put Tom Cruise in this role and the movie will inevitably drop two notches. It is Zellweger who steals the show. Completely opposite to the glamorous role of Roxie Hart in Chicago, she now plays the physical, earthy Ruby, emotions all bottled up under a tough appearance, and a bit of a rough diamond with grass root wisdom.  <br/><br/>Playing Veasey the fallen preacher is Philip Seymore Hoffman, whose performance in Owning Mahowny is more deserving of an Oscar best actor nomination than most of the actual nominees. This is also a mini-reunion of him and Law, from The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999).<br/><br/>Playing the deceptively harmless Junior is Giovanni Ribisi whom I saw twice within four days last week, in Lost In Translation and Heaven (2002). He also played the attention-grabbing character Kendall who died vomiting tons of blood in the suspense thriller Basic last year.<br/><br/>The young widow Sarah is played by lovely Natalie Portman, who brought immediate attention from the movie world as the little girl in Leon (1994), and went on to become Queen Padme Amidala (i.e. Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia's mother) in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. <br/><br/>Playing Ruby's father is Brendan Gleeson, well remembered from two recent spectacular roles, the formidable fighting `Monk' in Gang of New York and the amicable father in on of the 4 fugitives in 28 Days Later. Good neighbour Sally is played by Cathy Baker who in Edward Scissorhands (1990) played a minor but outstanding role of the horny neighbour. And then of course there is Donald Sutherland, playing Ada's father.<br/><br/>To sum up, Cold Mountain is one cut above the run-of-the-mill melodrama `epics'. Just watching the fantastic assembly of top-notch performers is well worth it. It is a bit two long but I guess it is very easy for filmmakers to succumb to the desire to `epicize' the film they are making."

","Every really accomplished film starts with a well-crafted script - something too many directors forget, simply plunging into an excess of explosions and special effects. British director and scriptwriter Anthony Minghella, who gave us the excellent ""The English Patient"", has taken another novel - the 1997 work by Charles Frazier - and turned a compelling narrative into a kind of poor man's ""Gone With The Wind"", part harrowing portrayal of the brutality of civil war for both combatants (the battle of Petersburg) and those left behind, part aching romance between two souls who barely know one another.<br/><br/>The narrative stretches over five years (1861-1864) and, in the early sections, the switching of chronology is a little confusing, but then it settles into a pattern of two alternating lives that once touched too briefly and must be fused once more in spite of all the geographical and human obstacles. <br/><br/>John Seale's cinematography is superb, with effective use of locations in North Carolina and Romania, and a good deal of effort has gone into the authenticity of costumes and weapons and the use of contemporary music. The acting is of a high order with Jude Law (who filmed with Minghella in ""The Talented Mr Ripley"") as the taciturn Inman and Nicole Kidman as his much better-educated muse Ada. Kidman is always clever with her accents (""The Hours""), whereas Jude is not so acute, but some others are even worse. The best performance, however, comes from a barely recognisable Renee Zellweger who is simply brilliant as the raw, but capable, Ruby.<br/><br/>Politically the film can be criticised for not making clear what the war was about and black slaves are hardly ever seen and never heard, but ""Cold Mountain"" is a movie that deserves warm praise and sears into the memory so many powerful images."

","Not the worst Civil War movie I've ever seen (that was Gods & Generals), but pretty horrendous, nonetheless, especially as compared to all the hype. The trailers for this movie made it appear to be an action-packed juggernaut of a film, alternately littered with passion and epic battle sequences.  In reality, there's only one battle scene, which occurs in the first ten minutes and leaves you bored to tears until the love-scene with the female lead and the final climax at the very end.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are both quality, accomplished actors...and both way too old for the parts they're playing.  Kidman is 35 now, and while still beautiful, is far too old to be the unwed daughter of a minister in the mid-19th century Deep South.  Just wouldn't happen.  Law is about 31 himself, though he looks younger than that, and the two just didn't make a believable pair.  She barely speaks to him at all throughout the movie, he barely speaks to anyone, and when they do speak they tend to slip into their respective home accents (Australia for Kidman and English for Law) instead of the Southern one you should have been hearing, often enough that it becomes difficult to ignore.<br/><br/>The plot too, is problematic.  Given the few brief encounters they have with one another, it's ridiculous to think that they would have developed such an enduring affection for each other in so short a period of time.  Bag of diamonds, my foot.  And the scene in which they ""marry"" is laughable.<br/><br/>
On the other side of things, the way the ""thugs"" of Cold Mountain stay and wreak havoc on anyone left there is also preposterous.  Those four young men seem to be of plenty sound body to be fighting, so they should be in the war themselves.  And you'd rather imagine that the town's usual law enforcement would have stayed behind, if only to protect the town from Yankee raiders. No real justice is ever meted to them either, except Easy Movie Justice: they all die.<br/><br/>There is one enormous continuity problem, in which Law and Philip Seymour Hoffman are talking on a riverbank (OK, so mostly Hoffman's talking) and then suddenly Hoffman has a big saw in his hand, explaining how it will be useful.  No explanation where the hell it came from at all.  What's that all about?<br/><br/>Generally though, the cinematography was excellent.  Lush landscapes and interesting angles make the reality of battle clear and believable without making the scenes unwatchably gory or campy, as in some war movies.  Renee Zellweger was excellent as well, not just as comic relief, but as a reality check for anyone who might tend to get too wrapped up in the sappy, Prince-Charming/damsel-in-Distress crap and forget that there's a real life to live if this war ever ends.  If this movie has any redeeming qualities other than the scenery, she's it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's two and a half hours of tedious malarkey, punctuated with some good scenery and a few decent performances."

About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I began to feel like I was in for a page-per-minute interpretation.<br/><br/>As little regard as I have for her, I must confess that Renee Zellweger is the only reason to see this movie. Her comic relief, in addition to being much needed, is wonderfully done, and she comes closest to having anything like an accurate dialect.<br/><br/>If you've heard like I did that this film got snubbed for Oscar nominations because (a) Nicole looks too glamorous or (b) it was filmed in Europe instead of on location in North Carolina, let me assure you: there are hundreds and hundreds of good reasons this movie didn't get more nominations.

I understand very well that there are times and places in which that's what life mostly is. And if this movie were an exception to an overload of happy films, who could object? But it is not.

This played very well to the anti-Iraq war crowd, displaying the stark realism of war, any war. The other cast members had dirty fingernails, and life appeared harsh. The absence of blacks was unsettling -- this was the South, after all. I know that large plantations were not shown, but that small band of running-away slaves did not suffice. I agree with another poster that Renee Zelwegger was Mammy ""Ah has spoken!"" Yokum -- way over the top and just plain dumb!

","Jude Law in a career defining role, stars in Anthony Minghella's American Civil War love story as Inman, a wounded Confederate solider who deserts the army to make an epic 300-mile journey back to Cold Mountain, to his sweetheart Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman's journey through the war-torn South is filled with trials and tribulations in which he encounters a variety of peculiar characters and faces enemies at every turn. Inman's odyssey runs parallel to Ada's plight to manage her deceased father's farm and fend off the advances of the monstrous local land owner-cum-sheriff, which she does with the help of the rowdy and raucous Ruby (Renée Zellweger), who provides the laughs in this otherwise bleak tale.<br/><br/>Adapted from Charles Frazier's critically acclaimed novel, Cold Mountain contrasts the grim reality of war with outstanding drama and brilliant cinematography, which is only overshadowed by a fantastic cast, including Ray Winston, Donald Sutherland and Natalie Portman. Minghella, the Academy Award winning director of The English Patient has yet again pulled off another fantastic literary adaptation, which except for a few corny accents and a love story that becomes a little tedious after two and a half hours won't be going home empty handed from this year's Academy Awards.<br/><br/>

What it did do was leave the audience with a lot of questions and thoughts that couldn't exactly be answered. That's because most all the minute - but terribly significant- details of the book were left out. I read the book, and was thoroughly intrigued, entertained and stimulated. After the movie, I wanted to tell my friends to read the book and not bother with the movie. It is overly - romanticized and completely butchers the essence of the story. The story (from the novel) is not one of love and sex, but rather one of a man's perseverance and courage, his journey home, not his destination. It's about the path you walk, not what's waiting for you at the end. If you hate reading, I would suggest you watch the movie only for the few fleeting moments of intriguing thought it offers. Otherwise, I recommend the book for a truly thought-provoking, enjoyable story. The movie will leave you unsatisfied, wondering, and perplexed - but I promise, any question you have from the movie is more than answered in the book. Before forming any thoughts or opinions of the story, read the book - most of what you think from the movie will probably be dispelled."

Ada even compares it to the passionate bond between Catherine and Heathcliff when she quotes passages from Wuthering Heights, and I thought Jude and Nicole were extremely convincing.<br/><br/>As audience members, we know it is a tragic love story, full of bird omens and dark visions of the future.  The whole story is a reckoning of light and dark, sin and redemption, good and evil, and love and hate.  The final scene of Inman's death is gorgeously shot, an echo of the scene with the sheep being slaughtered by the forest woman.  Ada and Inman, both in black, with his blood seeping into the white snow, appear as an image of a black bird in flight.  Beautiful.

The fact is, things like this DID happen in the South during the Civil War.  I'm glad the producers chose not to soften the harshness and brutality that civilians, mostly women and children, had to suffer.  The movie was rated R, so viewers should have been fairly warned.  I do agree that some of the sex/nudity could have been seen as gratuitous, but in the context of the story I think it was acceptable.<br/><br/>Does the movie live up to the promise of the novel, and does it stand out as a literary landmark of the twenty-first century?

The most clever aspect of Cold Mountain is the constant reassurance of pleasure and happiness through the leading female characters, however, once in a while we are driven to a shocking or at least an emotional response. the most vivid example is when that woman leans over the table and tempts Jude Law for sex. Just when we thought nothing could get any better, Natalie jumps on set and arguably gives the most convincing piece of acting (not including Leon, although that goes with out saying)."

","Rating: **** (out of *****)<br/><br/>Inman (Jude Law) goes off to battle in the American Civil War, leaving his newly found love, Ada (Nicole Kidman) behind in the small community of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. During the severity of battle, in 1864, Inman becomes a deserter and sets out to return to Cold Mountain. The story (based on the novel by Charles Frazier) follows his dangerous journey home as him and other deserters are tracked by cavalry led by Teague (Ray Winstone). It also follows Ada as she takes care of the farm that belonged to her late father (Donald Sutherland). She finds aid and friendship in the form of the spirited Ruby (Renée Zellweger).<br/><br/>As I watched the unclear opening moments of this road epic/romance, I remember thinking that Cold Mountain was going to be a ""waste of time"" as well as ""obvious Oscar bait with two over-hyped actors as the romantic leads"". Well, it's nice to be proved completely wrong in one respect, as the film makes a marvellous recovery to provide over two hours of worthwhile, if frustratingly inconsistent entertainment. <br/><br/>These days, there's always at least one Miramax film that will be heavily promoted during awards season, and Cold Mountain is one of them. Just look at the talent involved. Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley) has adapted and directed this. Also, the film's supporting cast contains impressive actors such as Ray Winstone, Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Natalie Portman. Even The White Stripes' Jack White gets a good performance coaxed out of him.<br/><br/>Then there's the film's soundtrack, which, as well as being a little melodramatic, had some elements that could have been lifted from O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Cold Mountain, however, isn't as funny, compelling or memorable as the Coen brothers picture. Yet it does have the significant advantage of more realistic characters. And the film needs that advantage.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of either Nicole Kidman or Jude Law, but they both hold their own here, and they have enough chemistry for a good romance (if not a great one). Both Kidman and Renée Zellweger better their rather overrated performances in The Hours & Chicago, respectively, by some distance, especially Zellweger. Alas, all three leads run into a little trouble with the accents. Zellweger's is sometimes grating, and even Kidman & Law struggle in that department near the beginning.<br/><br/>Like another certain Oscar contender, The Last Samurai, Cold Mountain is hampered by its inconsistency and length (although the Cruise film got away with it a little better). This is probably the result of some pretentiousness on the director's part. But, just like The Last Samurai, I recommend this."

The adapted screenplay writer did an excellent job with the story while not taking a stereotypical view on the civil war.  The war was about slavery, yes (very wrong), but it was also about southerners preserving their way of life, which the movie manages to capture in a beautiful subtext way.

I didn't feel the love between Ada and Inman as well as I should have, and that took away from the actual character development.

","I go to the cinema infrequently these days.  I love the old movies, but I am usually disappointed by the chase-them, bed-them, blow-them-up approach taken by so many of our current movie makers.  Advertisements for ""Cold Mountain"" managed to conquer my trepidation.  It seemed that  finally we were going to be given a real old-fashioned romance along with a bit of history.  I regret to say that it was a disappointment.<br/><br/>There was romance, of course.  I found the main story line of star-crossed lovers very appealing, and I thought that the lead actors carried it off very well.  They were attractive and generally convincing.  Also, the supporting cast was excellent, the cinematography was outstanding, and the director did a good job of depicting the horrors and sadness of war, both in battle and on the home front.  As a student of history, however, I must say that historical accuracy did not enter into it.  Perhaps this was also true of the novel.  Since I have not read it, I cannot say.<br/><br/>The way this story is presented, the Home Guard was nore of a threat to the Southern civilian population than the Union Army.  This, of course, is utter nonsense.  The Home Guard was made up of men too old or too young to serve in the army, and its primary mission was home defense -- not hunting down deserters and shooting them on sight.  In reality, the aim of Confederate officials was to return deserters to their units in condition to fight -- not as cadavers.<br/><br/>At the time our fictional hero was trying to make his way back home to the North Carolina mountains (in the winter of 1864-5), there were deserters all over the South, especially in areas of strong pro-union sentiment such the Southern highlands.  Also there were thousands of former Confederate soldiers who had been seriously wounded in the fighting and invalided out of service.  Under these conditions, does one think that a man like Teague, along with his murderous companions, could have terrorized and entire county for months on end?  But the lack of historical accuracy is not my main problem with the movie.  After all, when do you go to the cinema expecting an accurate portrayal of an historical event?  Like most people, I go principally for entertainment.  On that level, my real problem with this movie is some of the excessive non-battlefield violence and the graphic sexual encounter that is depicted at one point in the movie.  That sexual scene was gross, unnecessary, and over the top.  It made be embarrassed to be in the theater, and I was embarrassed for the actresses who had to bare their breasts and bottoms to make the scene."

","...but with poor/middle class people rather than the rich. In fact, I think they made a couple of references in the film about how the Civil War/Secession was less about southern pride and more about plantation owners wanting to keep their feudal way of life. We definitely get the sense that ""war is hell"" as evidenced by the trauma faced by the residents of Cold Mountain (along with Natalie Portman's character), but I would have liked the idea of ""a war to keep the rich man's slaves,"" and the concept of Southerners who really didn't give a damn about ""the glorious cause"" to have really come to the fore. <br/><br/>I wonder if Charles Frazier (or Anthony Minghella for that matter) reads Flannery O'Connor because some of the most shocking images/scenarios in this movie not related to the war itself seem lifted right out of the imagination of the great Southern Gothic: a libidinous preacher, a cadre of grotesque-looking whores with a little boy among them, and a blind peanut vendor spouting words of wisdom.<br/><br/>Even though I highly enjoyed myself, I'm not 100% satisfied. It's a powerful film, sure, but it's not a great film. The ending was too soap opera-ish (a love child? puh-lease). Nicole Kidman and Jude Law didn't stand out as much as they should have. I've seen Jude have more fire in his eyes in other films. Vivian Leigh expressed so much more emotion and raw energy in one look, one raised eyebrow than in all of Nicole's breathy supplications throughout the story. Renee Zellwegger stood out so much more, as did Brendan Gleeson, Ethan Suplee, and Philip Seymore Hoffman.

","I felt this movie might have somewhat conveyed the horror of the Civil War. Not only the famous battles themselves, but the sinister vigilantes known as the Home Guard, and the devastation to women and children left widowed and fatherless in a low-tech time when life demanded heavy physical work for survival. The early battle scenes were powerful, graphically showing the carnage, chaos, and stupidity of a war that young men on both sides charged into with flags, fervor, and bravado. Director Minghella takes us down into the pits of mud and blood as countless lives are ground into oblivion. The movie is beautifully photographed throughout, but some of the situations are preposterous, and a transparent grab for recognition during the awards season. Renee Zellweger's character was entertaining to me, with only the quibble that I couldn't understand some of her dialogue. It seemed a stretch to me that Ada and Inman could have such a monumental devotion to getting back together after a handful of words and one kiss. My biggest complaint was how Nicole Kidman's face, hair, and clothes looked in the latter parts of the movie. Come on! - she had been transformed into a hardscrabble life of no money, little food, and the incredible workload to run that large farm. Her continued polish and beauty were distractingly unbelievable. Finally, (Spoiler Alert!) I left the theater feeling bummed out that, after cheating death so many times throughout the story, Inman is done in by one of the Home Guard scum. I would have liked to see him survive to parent his child and work the farm after the war. I suppose the source book dictated otherwise, though. Overall, fairly entertaining, beautiful to look at, but too long, and too unbelievable."

Such films do not limit their depiction of war to epic battle sequences; perhaps even more horrifyingly, they show us the small scale, behind-the-lines struggles necessary for survival in such times.<br/><br/>Jude Law plays Inman, a working-class North Carolinian, who is smitten with the new preacher's daughter, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman).  Their love does not have half a chance, because Inman is handed his Southern grays just as things are getting interesting.  Despite having known each other a very short time, Ada promises to wait for Inman.  She and Inman hope to be reunited in a month when the war is over.  This is not to be.<br/><br/>Much of the running time of Cold Mountain, then, consists of Inman trying to return to Cold Mountain and his Ada, a quest of Odyssian proportions. Director Anthony Minghella has a knack for portraying passionate romances that ring very true in times of war.  Before I recalled that Minghella had directed both films, I found myself drawing parallels between Cold Mountain and 1996's The English Patient.<br/><br/>While Inman dodges death on almost a daily basis, things are also not going smoothly back in Cold Mountain.  A local baddie, Teague (Ray Winstone) is instituting his own, rather wicked, variety of law and taking advantage of the lack of able-bodied men to abuse the local populace.  The near-starved Ada gets some much-needed help on her crumbling farm from Ruby Thewes (played more effectively than I had expected by Renee Zellweger).<br/><br/>Cold Mountain is a thought provoking film.  It makes us ponder how much time we really need to fall in love with someone.  Ada and Inman certainly haven't known each other very long, and are not even able to correspond much (letters often don't arrive during wartime).  But Minghella and the lead actors so masterfully express these characters' all-consuming desire to be reunited that we can only acknowledge the power of the romance and hope fervently that the lovers are reunited.<br/><br/>I was troubled when I saw The Last Samurai.  Although the film presented a sensitive and favorable portrayal of the Japanese bushido code compared to the evils of modern nationalism, I thought it went too far in glorifying `honorable' military death.  Not so here.  Minghella and author Charles Frazier give us a much darker, more realistic depiction of war.  Inman says it best: `I'm like every fool sent off with a flag and a lie'."

","Spoiler Alert I wanted to see this movie because I am a civil war buff. Characters were great and credible, Renee Zellweger was exceptional. Nicole wasn't very realistic. I thought it was probably an accurate portrayal of the war and conditions for those left behind, but it was too gory for me. I thought the Home Guard was a little too conscientious in their work, but don't know, it may be historically accurate. There are some breathtaking scenes of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I have to say the camera work was excellent, even though it was shooting gory stuff I didn't care for. I also didn't care for the ending, but it was expected - with everything that happened, there was no way those two were to live happily ever after. I don't like birds, and there were too many in it for my taste."
"kwongers","Null","0","0","19 January 2004"," enjoyable, but the movie exists purely in parts (some spoilers)
","This movie exists purely in parts.  It doesn't quite work for me as a whole (it felt REALLY long, gratuitous sex, a slow opening, and a storyline that I cared less and less about as the movie went on), but I enjoyed it.  It is good but not great.  But this movie is absolutely heartbreaking in some scenes, which moved me completely to tears. 	<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about a confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) who is tired of fighting in a war he doesn't believe in.  He decides to return home to his love, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), but Inman is hunted by the North (`yankees') and the South (who are killing deserters of war) alike.  Of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, it can be said that they are well-cast in their roles as Ada and Inman.  They do have some chemistry and there are some beautiful scenes between them, but their performances are nothing very special.  (Read: not Oscar caliber.)  This is not intended as a criticism because I enjoyed their work (I thought they captured anguish and love), but they didn't `wow' me. 	<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I'm not entirely sure what I am saying is fair, but here are my criticisms: one, a really slow opening.  It seemed to take an hour for Inman to finally start returning home to Ida.  I thought the opening war scene was not very well done; too much shock value and too little emphasis on human emotions, brutality of war, etc.  Two, gratuitous sex.  There is just one bizarre sequence in the movie (is it in the book?  I don't know) where Inman and some corrupt priest end up in a brothel house. It's very disturbing, gratuitous, and disgusting.  I find it rather unnecessary.  (The love scenes between Inman and Ada are rather graphic but I can understand it since they are deeply in love and `Cold Mountain' is an intense love story.)  This is definitely not a movie to take little kids to. 	<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten all my criticism out of the way, let me say that I also have a lot of praise for this movie.  I said the movie exists entirely in parts and there are several, particularly the ones where the Southern men are hunting down Confederate soldiers who have deserted the war.  There is one scene about a husband and wife hiding their two young boys in their home.  There is another about two men playing instruments to the Southern men, while knowing they will be shot shortly after.  These scenes are very beautiful. 	<br/><br/>I think high praise goes to Renee Zellweger for her funny, touching, and strong portrayal of Ruby, the woman that comes to help Ada on the farm. Zellweger is uproariously funny and coarse; she steals every single scene she's in.  And she is also responsible for one of the more moving moments in the film, when she finds her badly wounded father in the snow, bleeding from a gunshot wound.  But the gem of this movie is, without a doubt, Natalie Portman as a widowed mother with a young child.  Portman's two short scenes are my favorite in the movie.  I don't want to spoil this one for you but Portman's touching and memorable performance (in only 10 minutes of film) will bring you to tears.  It's a very powerful momentAlthough `Cold Mountain' has a lot of these moments, they don't quite work together as a whole.  Still, it is an enjoyable effort and well worth the price of admission.  7/10"

","Call me a prude, but in a civil-war era film that lovingly portrays the sensitivity and decorum of its protagonists during that ""outwardly"" chaste period in our history, why in God's name does a gorgeous film have to be tainted with soft porn?  I loved the book, loved the movie, EXCEPT when we see boobs and butts flappin' in one brutal scene, then nipples and butts in another absolutely unnecessary love scene, it brings the viewer right back into the 21st century where sadly not much is sacred anymore.  If a real Ada and Inman were to step forward in time and see their most sacred moments together revealed to the world, they would certainly believe that the devil was in charge and the world had gone to hell. (After discussing Cold Mountain with co-workers, family and friends it seems that those two scenes alienated a lot of history lovers and lovers of the book and in my opinion without them, the movie is a near masterpiece)"

","I am an incurable romantic. Therefore, I saw this movie, read the book, and saw it again. I was so happy to see that Minghella preserved Frazier's style of alternating between Inman and Ada's tale until the very end when they come together. Once I started reading Frazier, I got sucked into it and simply could'nt put it down. He reminds me of Emerson in the way he describes every detail. Minghella's direction is true to the book, although I missed some of the scenes from the book. For example, Ada sitting in Inman's lap in the kitchen, and the portals of shining rocks. The movie was so moving that I could have easily sat through another hour of it. I've never seen Nicole look so lovely, and Jude is at his best. They reminded me of Uma and Ethan in Gattaca. And last but not the least, Alison Krause and Sting's ""You will be my ain true love"" is poignant. I predict that this movie is going to age extremely well just like Nicole. For all the romantics and lonesome people out there, this movie has been especially made for you. Kudos to all involved in its making. Score: A+"

","With an acclaimed director, stellar cast, and stunning locations, Cold Mountain had the makings of a masterpiece.

Frankly, the dialogue was<br/><br/>weak.  Only one of the characters had strong dialog, and compelling speeches. With the exception of a well-acted character by Renee Zelleweger, the dialogue was simply not worth listening to.<br/><br/>  The Cinematography and editing was effective enough, and the costume/ design, while not worthy of awards, was realistic.  In short, the film looked o.k. and was cohesive. But that is it.   <br/><br/>  Kidman, Law, and an impressive supporting cast did well [with what they were given] but it was obviously that the entire cast [but Zelleweger] was starving for lines.

"dancechick318","Null","0","0","26 December 2003"," An Amazing Film
","""Cold Mountain"" is a beautifully-done movie that tells the Odyssey-ish story of a Civil War soldier who is returning home to his love the Odyssey connection is not entirely obvious, and therefore does not detract form the story; it is not merely a re-telling of Homer.  There is a blind man, sirens, a goat-herder and such, but really probably simply a coincidence. The story is not simply one-sided; it is not just about Law's character, Inman and his journey.  The film also details what was happening on the ""home front"" in the town of Cold Mountain.  The film does an amazing job of detailing what the women who were left at home had to do during the war to survive.  The balance between the characters is very effective, and allows the audience to remain connected to everyone involved.  The characters are all very well developed and all of the actor(esse)s performed amazingly well conveying the story in a most beautiful and impressive manner.  The film also raised some interesting issues; it portrayed the soldiers who learned after fighting for some time that they truly didn't understand the war, and realized that they really didn't know what they were dieing for.  It discussed the fanatic men who for one reason or another couldn't fight and therefore stayed at home and took joy in harassing women, and hunting down and killing the men who were ""deserters"" coming home form the war early.  The film touched on many aspects of the Civil War that either I didn't really know, or had never really thought about.   The film is also tastefully done; it is not overly-romantic, it does not romanticize, or condemn war, and it acuratly displays what many young woman were subjected to due to the war that Zwellwiger's character states is a man's war; ""They created the storm clouds, and now they stand outside in the rain and say: 'Oh s***, it's raining!'."" ""Cold Mountain"" is a well-done and beautiful film to which I give my highest review.  I believe that the film, and the three main characters, (Law, Kidman, Zwellwiger) all are deserving of Acadamy Awards.  I would also like to state that Jack White did a wonderful job, and that I was pleased to see him in a film. ""Cold Mountain"" is a must-see, and I highly recommend it."

They've been pushing Cold Mountain down the public's throat for quite a while.  My only question is: Will they refund me the $10 for two matinee tickets, $13 of refreshments, and time spent traveling to, sitting through, and racing home from this piece of garbage??? They did just enough Civil War research to learn how to spell ""war."" As an avid student of the time period, I was horribly disappointed by their parade of inaccuracy.  They present battle scenes unlike those ever witnessed during the 1860s, because their film crew had no apparent clue about Civil War battles and tactics.  It is no small wonder that they had to retreat filming overseas.  They had hoped that re-enactors would give their time and effort to this work, as they had done so for ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals.""  Not a single living historian of the Civil War was willing to be associated with this drivel, and now, having seen it, I understand why. One is hard pressed, indeed, to find anything historically accurate, emotionally moving, or socially redeeming in this utter affront to the hundreds of thousands who died during the American Civil War.  This film wants so badly to be on par with ""Gone with the Wind.""  It would have trouble matching up intellectually with ""South Park"" or ""Freddy vs. Jason."" Don't be suckered in.

","This is a beautiful movie, replete with a boat load of wonderful actors all doing wonderful jobs.  It is delight to see.  I would like to quibble about some details.  Nicole Kidman is just toooo glamorous - even after hardscrabble has set in, she is cruising around in an A-line, black, calf length black coat fit for a stroll down 5th ave.  The house Ada Monroe (Kidman) lives in is just ridiculous - it looks like one of those movie lot fake homes in a yuppie upper middle class suburban developer neighborhood. I really don't think they lived that way, and they used whitewash which essentially washed off and needed painting every two years or the wood started showing.  This thing could have been in an ad for Duron or Martin-Senour paints.  Why the fake big bertha rifled Dahlgrens in the Confederate lines.  They should have used a appropriate artillery piece. Frankly showing the fact that the Union Colonel in charge of the attack was seriously drunk and never left his hovel during the attack would have added more verisimilitude and also the hopelessness of the whole affair.  Jude Law was incredible - his face changed perceptively from an untouched rural to a truely depressed, horrified, and worn out man whose only desire to keep at it was his drive to see Ada.  Great movie though - don't miss it."

Donald Sutherland and Ray Winstone pulled it off but the rest of them did not sound like they were from the same place let alone the south. I saw the movie as a bit of ""the Odyssey"" with the romance between the main characters poorly supported but lots of entertaining unconnected episodes for Law's character on his way back home. Of the three lead characters Zellweger's performance stands out to me, but she has done better work. The memorable battle scene made me think of Enemy at the Gates or Saving Private Ryan, but it was fairly brief.

","""Cold Mountain"" certainly lives up to its name. It is a monumental film with almost no hint of a beating heart. To call it cerebral, as The Hollywood Reporter did, is to put a kind spin on the utter lack of passion in the storytelling and the performances, and also suggests a heady element that maybe I just missed.<br/><br/>From the first frames of the picture, the level of professionalism from Anthony Minghella's frequently enlisted team of craftspeople -- John Seale, Dante Ferretti, Walter Murch, Gabriel Yared, and others - is undeniable. They certainly have their act down. (At one point in the movie, I kept myself entertained by counting the impending Oscar nominations, and that game went on for some time). The film is elegant, even pristine, and so very tasteful. Within minutes, though, it's also clear that it is to be a film in which every character speaks like an aspiring poet, regardless of their level of education or their wits. The story, which the film makers purport to be about man's eternal failure to respect natural law, gives itself a cramp trying to be literate. Yet in the final outcome, it has managed neither authenticity nor poetry nor philosophy, leaving me to wonder what all the florid dialogue was in service of.<br/><br/> The picture nearly chokes on its pedigree. Minghella stuffed the cast with Oscar-credentialed actors (both past winners like Nicole Kidman and nominees like Jude Law) and others, like Donald Sutherland, whose very presence seems intended to maintain an air of prestige. The lot of them seemed as bored as I did with the script's simplistic philosophizing (is Law's character really dodging bullets and trudging through swamps so he can find some hermit woman who'll enlighten him that he's just part of the circle of life?). As a result no one in the cast, with only a few exceptions in the bit parts, ever manages to transcend who we know them to be. Kidman is Kidman throughout. Law is Law. Sutherland is Sutherland. Zellweger is, to a lesser degree, Zellweger, but she's also the movie's only consistent comic relief so she's spared the worst of the effect.<br/><br/> Kidman and Law, for their parts, look like they're asleep for most of the picture. The passion, the ennui, and the despair they both supposedly suffer is talked about, inferred, and presumably understood on the part of the audience, but I'll be damned if you can find a trace of it on their faces. Kidman especially is never given her due as the actor of incredible spunk that we know her to be. I know she could have played Ada's overwhelming fear of death - her loved one's as well as her own. If she can carry off a prosthetic nose, surely she could have let her skin take a weathering from all the hunger and hard labor her character endures. Someone decided to not let it happen that way, rather that she should remain the radiant movie star throughout, and it was a catastrophic choice, undermining the depiction of rugged endurance that the movie so desperately needs.<br/><br/> Renee Zellweger hams it up like a pro, and if the rest of the cast had looked a touch more alert, she might not have seemed so completely over-the-top at times. Still, she gets to say stuff like, ""You can get three feet up a bull's ass just listening to what sweethearts whisper to each other,"" and she hits the proverbial ball out of the park every time she does. It's a showboat of a role, but in the absence of anything else really happening, her levity was really quite welcome. And yeah, she's probably got the Oscar in the bag.<br/><br/> Natalie Portman, whom I was shocked to find I did not recognize, is featured in the movie's only genuinely touching sequence. Her advantage was to land the role that is the least heavy-handed in the writing, and she rises gracefully to every nuance the page offers her. As a widowed mother caring for her sick baby in a cold house, she subtly negotiates an arrangement with Law's war deserter that both satisfies her unfathomable loneliness and respects his spoken-for heart. After twice succumbing to the rigor mortis of the ""Star Wars"" pictures, her re-emergence as a natural, warm-hearted actress is the greatest gift that ""Cold Mountain"" offers.<br/><br/> Also, the veterans Kathy Baker, as Kidman's kindly neighbor, and the great Ray Winstone as a deserter in at least two senses, are also spot-on: never forced, always real, bringing welcome doses of gravitas to every scene they're in.<br/><br/> The greatest disappointment for me in ""Cold Mountain"" is that it's the first Minghella film to paint strictly by the numbers. Everything of his I've ever seen has taken the form of a well-known model and then upset it with something wholly unexpected, but this latest holds not a single surprise. ""Truly Madly Deeply"" took the same premise as ""Ghost,"" and then played against every known rule by first suggesting that the ghost may be a creation of the widow's neuroses, and then delivering as its message that love is not eternal, but that death demands that the living get on with their lives. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" though messy and somewhat ungainly, was a mesmerizing balance of travelogue and psychological thriller.<br/><br/> ""The English Patient"" is most similar to ""Cold Mountain"" in its intent, an epic romance playing equally to the head and to the heart, but it was one that actually deserved the ""cerebral"" descriptor and also brought hard-earned tears to my eyes. ""The English Patient"" made me feel the cleaving knife of choosing love over country. It hurt to watch Fiennes endure his choice in that film. No such sense of pain gets through in ""Cold Mountain."""

Renee Zellwegger was a key reason why I liked this movie. She injects energy and life and displays once again her wonderful ability to inject her comedy with tragedy. It would be a shame for her to win best supporting actress because her other body of work shows she is clearly a lead actress. Kidman and Law are good in their roles and so are the many of the supporting actors but the romance and the sexual tension which is believable suffers in comparison to other romances in movies that have covered this territory before. This movie is not has compelling and grand as Minghella's ""English Patient"" but it is adequate and the audience does pull for Kidman and Law's characters to reunite.

"Nezz","Null","0","0","2 January 2004"," Putting aside my enthusiasm for Return of the King.
","I feel that Cold Mountain is still a good movie and is being unfairly lambasted. <br/><br/>In regards to the acting, the film features a good cast (primary and supporting) with few if any truly sour performances. Zellweger is the obvious standout (and almost steals the show) while Law also does quite well in his role. Kidman was perhaps the weakest link here where her accent didn't always come off as convincing. (Kudos to Portman who does very well with what is more or less a brief cameo) <br/><br/>Minghella handles the story well. Things seemed a bit slow at first but the story and pacing picked up substantially as the film progressed. The plot provided plenty of interesting elements and characters in both of the parallel storylines (Inman's journey vs. Ada's struggle to survive).<br/><br/>
A weakness in the film was the lack of substantial romantic development prior to Inman's departure. The film acknowledges this and plays upon it, which softens the damage it does storywise but doesn't completely make up for it. Development of Inman's disgust for the war was also something that could have used more time before he went off on his odyssey back home.<br/><br/>
The main problem with the film is probably how violent it is. Despite being a tale of romance and adventure, the film can get quite violent, especially in regards to which characters it's willing to dole out death to and the methods by which it's done (which may come as a surprise to some who think it's just a sappy romance film).

","When are directors going to learn? To have scenes in a film where actors just stare into the camera, at each other, or at nothing, is boring? I thought there was much of it in Return of the King, but believe me, the cast here out-stare the ROTK-cast at a ratio of 10 to 1. To have actors just staring can actually serve a purpose, but it should be used as little as possible, and it should be very explicit what they are trying to communicate. But here, it looks like they just do it for fun. I understand that the director wanted to recreate a time period where you couldn´t just get into a car and drive where you wanted, but had to walk for several hours to get there. But it seems to have slowed down the film as well. I´m not saying that the actors are bad, Renée Zellweger thoroughly deserved her Oscar. Kidman was fair enough, she seemed amateurish in a few of her scenes. But no matter how good the cast is, the director had to include so many shots lingering on trees, birds flying around, farm animals and some hen who was supposed to be the devil, that the boring scenes drowned out the good ones."

","OK, it is a pretty good film. It certainly does not glorify war, which always is an excellent point. The performances were all good, though I did not see how Kidman survived as long as she did after her father died and before Zellweger arrived. The human gene pool can be improved at anytime when we lose a person with such poor survival skills (should Paris Hilton be far behind in a Darwinistic world???). So, if the performances were finely crafted, why isn't it the best film of the year? It's trite. You always can guess the outcome of a scene, so the film begins to drag. Jude Law deserved to survive, but after dodging thousands of bullets, he falls slowly from his horse after a pistol shot from a somewhat distant, mounted evil-doer (homage to Dubya). Everyone else in the film explodes when he is shot, but Jude Law melts. Come on. Shane showed us that big calibre guns throw you backward. And even well-aimed shots usually miss moving targets. Mortality in war is luck, not marksmanship, and most wounds are not fatal (check out the wounded vs. killed statistics for Vietnam, for example)."
"redleigh86","5","0","0","23 December 2003"," It was better than I expected.
","First, I have to explain the one line summary above. The only reason I saw this movie was because the theater I work for was screening Cold Mountain and Peter Pan the same day and I didn't want to go home so I stayed for the first screening (Cold Mountain) just so I could go straight to the Peter Pan screening in the adjacent theater. So, having said that, I think it's obvious I didn't really want to see it. I don't like war movies and I'm not a huge fan of Nicole or Renee (I do, however, like Jude). It was better than I had expected, of course that doesn't mean I think it's a good movie, I'm just a the-glass-is-half-full kind of girl. Another way to put it would be that the movie isn't as stupid and lame as I had expected. Judging by the previews I assumed there would be a lot of battle sequences. Well, there really wasn't but the battle scenes that were in the movie were some of the most horrifying and grotesque I've seen (and I have seen quite a few). The movie seemed way too long as it jumped back and forth from the character's present day to the character's past and then jumped from Jude's story to Nicole's story. It all seemed very tedious and there were some scenes that could have been left out to make the movie much shorter and not so boring. Nicole's American Southern accent is not very good, Renee is somewhat entertaining and the highlights of the film were all the close-ups of Jude's rear end. And, as much as I enjoy seeing Jude naked, the sex scene was much too long as well. The whole premise was a bit unbelievable (they go through these great ordeals after having known each other for only a few days) and there were a lot of scenes that were a bit unbelievable as well. Then again, this is a movie and its sole purpose is to provide entertainment, which it does at times. I don't suggest seeing this movie unless you're a great fan of the actors, of love stories, or just need to kill three hours. I gave it a 5/10."

","I must admit, after watching the trailers, I wanted to despise this movie. It seemed a heap of melodrama with some utterly stupid dialogue (what was Ruby saying about the weather again?  Come on...) intended only to win Oscars for Miramax.  And while it had all the trademarks of Minghella, the overt symbolism and sheer epic-ness seemed to work for it.  Certainly the performances by Jude Law and Renee Zellweger will not go unnoticed come the Oscars - Jude is quite touching as a man of few words with his emotions all stirring beneath his face, and Renee is a barrel of energy and intensity who can put on the brakes when she has to.  Both create very unique performances, which cannot, unfortunately, be said of Nicole Kidman.  Brilliant in the Hours, here she returns to her trademark ticks and stock emotions, which are normally quite nice, but certainly don't match up with the other more subtle and intriguing people that surround her.  As well, her accent is pretty awful, even for Hollywood-impersonates-the-South standards, and she is FAR too old for the role this time.  Really surprising is Natalie Portman in her small role, getting back to acting after her horrendous turns in Star Wars. In five minutes of screen time she shows more layering and creates more understanding for a character than she has in the last five years of her career.  Perhaps she should have been given a chance at Ada, although Miramax must have desired a huge star in the lead, regardless of how ill-suited she is for it.  Overall, probably Minghella's best movie to date, with possible Oscars for Cinematography, Actor, and Supporting Actress, but if this gets Director and Picture over ROTK, it'll be a crime. 7.5/10"

I kept waiting for it to grab at me and pull me in, but sadly, I eventually was beginning to think Inman's journey would go on forever and the ending would never come.  I will say that Rene Zellweger was the best of the bunch, a joy to watch her.  This film could have been so much more.

"Shakespeare-2","Null","0","0","28 December 2003"," Unforgettable battle scene, forgettable film
","I would recommend seeing ""Cold Mountain"" for one reason, and one reason only. The battle sequence at the very beginning of the film is truly a military masterpiece, a scene that graphically conveys the mud, blood and guts of war, masterfully employing the various techniques of cinematography, direction and makeup toward this end. In my view, this is one of the best battle scenes that I have ever seen committed to film.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Cold Mountain"" fails utterly in other respects -- first and foremost, as the romance it purports and is advertised to be. Jude Law is credible enough as Inman, the Confederate soldier who braves Union armies and the Home Guard of his own state of North Carolina to return to the woman of his dreams. But why on earth would any man spend three years dreaming of Ada Monroe, or at least Nicole Kidman's incarnation of the southern belle? Nicole Kidman's character is truly an ice maiden -- a pale, cold, rather remote and distant blonde. Believe it or not, Nicole Kidman's character is dwarfed and overshadowed by the rest of the cast. Both major and minor characters alike are more colourful by far.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger may very well garner a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role as Ruby, a poor backwoods girl (somewhere between Doris Day's Calamity Jane and Donna Douglass's Elly Mae Clampett) who teaches Ada the survival skills her preacher father (Donald Sutherland) has failed to instill.<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" fails as a romance, but works as a meditation on man's inhumanity to man. One only wishes that the cruelty were not so relentless."
"schappe1","Null","0","0","27 December 2003"," The Eyes Have It
","Originally, this film was to be a Tom Cruise-Nicole Kidman vehicle. With their split, they had to find another actor and they hit the jackpot with Jude Law, perhaps the finest young actor of his generation. Law is an abnormally handsome man but his huge, intense eyes convey much more than prettiness. He can play an off-balance character such as the assassin in `The Road to Perdition' or he can play a war-weary soldier, as he did in `Enemy at the Gates and here. Amid all the beautiful and horrible images of this film, it is Law's eyes that linger in the memory.<br/><br/>Nearly as good is Nicole Kidman as the subject of his dreams. I much prefer this nuanced performance as the southern belle who learns how to take care of herself to her short turn with the long nose in last year's `The Hours'. Oscars are being given out for superficial things these days. Alter your appearance or play someone with a `condition' and the Academy will beat a path to your door. Play a three dimensional human being without any props and you get taken for granted. One complaint: in the love scene with Law, she's a little too dolled up. Notice that her hair is in curls in the scene and, (more logically), straighter and drabber in the adjoining scenes.<br/><br/>
Rene Zellweger has the showiest role. I have no complaints about her performance but I did not find anything special about it. Her function in the story is to cut through the romance and bring it back down to earth, as she does during the lover's reunion. She does this well but again I'm more impressed with Kidman's more subtle work. Zellweger is basically Calamity Jane on grits. <br/><br/>The episodic film is full of fine performances by supporting actors. Maybe the whole cast should be given a `best supporting actor' award. Brendan Gleason, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Eileen Atkins stand out, as do ex-child stars Natalie Portman and Jena Malone as young women who are trying their best to survive in a hostile environment.<br/><br/>That hostile environment somewhat reduces the entertainment value of the film. This is a war and this is the 19th century. We see a graphic presentation of the most terrible battle of the Civil War, the `Battle of the Crater' at Petersburg where the Union army dug a tunnel under the Confederate lines and filled it with dynamite. After the blast, the Federals charged into the gap in a poorly executed attack that trapped their men in the Crater. The Rebs surrounded the hole and slaughtered the attackers. That's hardly the end of the killing and much of the cast gets blown away, (or bayoneted) by the end of it. Also a woman gets tortured and another raped. Finally, several animals are killed and slaughtered although these images are much more disturbing to us in the 21st century than they would have been to those who lived in the 19th century. These days, when you are hungry, you go to the refrigerator. Back then, you went to the barn."

I've heard some  people say that it was the best part of the whole movie, and I thought it was a poorly  edited confusing mess...I.E. they are right and it is better than most of the rest of the  movie. Nicole and Jude's characters completely bored me. I didn't give a crap about  either of them and didn't believe they were in love for one second. Nicole had more  chemistry with that rooster than with Jude. Nicole is incredibly miscast in this movie. I didn't believe her in this roll. It is easily her worst performance that I've seen, and I've  seen Birthday Girl. Jude was a lot better than Nicole and was pretty good in some  scenes, but I still just couldn't connect with his character at all and just like Nicole, his  accent was very questionable in many parts. People were trying to kill him and I really  just couldn't have cared less if he lived or died. Nicole and him lacked any chemistry at all in the beginning scenes so it was impossible for me to understand how he could risk  death to just see her again ""for 10 minutes."" This is the kind of movie you have to care  about the lead character for it to work, and I down right hated them for the most part. I  was more emotionally connected to just about everyone else in the movie than Ada and  Inman. Even some of the bad guys that I wasn't supposed to like. Horrible editing,  cheesy dialogue (I call this nail 'Northern aggression.'), painfully melodramatic, repetitive, lifeless lead characters, uninspired directing, and just plain BORING. There is  only one thing that saves this from being even worse than TEP...Renee. You only really  comprehend how dull everybody else's performances are when Renee absolutely puts  them all to shame. She is the highlight of every scene she is in and saves the movie from  being completely unwatchable. I absolutely loved her and I hope she wins the Oscar.<br/><br/>They should have just made a Ruby movie because the rest is a complete waste of time.

The people that Inman (Law) encounter along his trek, shed light onto the cruelty of man when times get tough and the fragility of life. As the film switches back and forth between Imman, and the difficulty back home on the farm for Kidman and her helping hand Ruby, played memorably by Rene Zellwenger, you're taken on an gut-wrenching ride that will have both very bright and dark parts.

","I've seen comments on this site that say that ""Cold Mountain"" moves too slow, it's overhyped, not enough character development, the chemistry between Nicole and Jude Law is weak, the plot is aimless and depressing, etc. To that I say hogwash.<br/><br/> This was an excellent film with Oscars written all over it. Directed by Anthony Minghella (""English Patient"", 1996) with a sterling cast (Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, Rene Zellweger, Donald Sutherland, Natalie Portman, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Kathy Baker), ""Cold Mountain"" delivers. Packed with emotion, this film contains some of the great war and romance movie scenes that will be remembered and discussed for a long time. Filmed in the pristine countryside of Romania, the producers of ""Cold Mountain"" found the perfect setting for a film to re-create what life was like in rural North Carolina mountains during the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert<br/><br/> It was absolutely amazing how two actors could be on the set together for so little time and bring out such a romantic intensity. The characters of Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law) give special meaning to the word 'longing'. The incipient romance between these two star-struck lovers had been stalled by the declaration of war, and Inman's inevitable conscription as was expected by any able-bodied men in his position. This almost unfulfilled romantic destiny is what made the chemistry between Ada and Inman more tantalizing than most films.<br/><br/> When the two reunite after years of separation caused by the war, the fires of passion ignite during their one night together in a cold mountain cabin like no scene I can remember in recent movie history. Nothing can be more passionate than subversive romance. Despite many doubters, Inman, an army deserter, and Ada, a harborer of deserters finally get their one night together, and that's all that counted in this movie. Every thing led to that moment, and the consequences thereafter, tragic or otherwise, mattered so much less. That's what was so superb about this film.<br/><br/> The 'longing' between these two characters was so powerful that nothing could deter their motivation to reunite. With the help from Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellweger), and stubborn determination, Ada was able to manage her deceased father's small farm, holding onto the fleeting notion that the man she barely fell in love with would eventually return home. And Inman, who was wounded in battle, and who during his convalescence acted upon the wise advice from an old blindman (the one roasting peanuts) to desert his army and follow his heart home to the woman he wish he knew more. The picture of Ada he carried on his person wherever he went reminded him daily of his purpose.<br/><br/> With our own war going on today in Iraq, we tend to forget how chaotic things can off the battlefield. Our minds are never straight when bad news never ceases and bodies keep coming home. What we tend to forget is that the families and loved ones of whom soldiers leave behind, lead lives of absence and are never at peace until their soldier has returned. Suitors and unscrupulous opportunists don't make their lives any easier, tempting and scheming those who are left behind in war.<br/><br/> This movie helps to put things in perspective once again while the war politics of our current times make us remember the sad stories of our past wars, stories that reach even the remote corners of supposedly placid places like Cold Mountain, N.C."

","Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the most beautiful people on the planet, so it shouldn't be difficult to understand why many critics are praising this film. Watching the emotions play upon their nearly perfect features is mesmerizing. Did any Confederate soldier really have teeth this good? Impressive performances by both leads (particularly Kidman's range) and a stellar cast bring this Civil War tragedy to a higher level. Brendan Gleeson and Philip Hoffman are wonderful. Natalie Portman is so convincing and heart-wrenching that one has to wonder what narcotics George Lucas had her on in Star Wars Episodes I and II. I will say that the opening battle scene was a huge disappointment. The choppy cuts and camera movement meant to give the documentary feel doesn't work here. The reason it worked so well in Spielberg's WWII era films (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"") is because there were actual gun cameras, footage of combat and newsreel documentary footage as a frame of reference. The film feels gritty and authentic in all other respects. Excellent suspense is maintained up through the rewarding and mature climax."

"WheezyJoe","7","0","0","13 January 2004"," Misery Mountain
","Adapted from the much-loved novel by Charles Frazier, `Cold Mountain' has been a welcome arrival to the big screen. Acclaimed director/screenwriter Anthony Minghella, thankfully, has taken on the responsibility of bringing forth the tangled story of love and war to a visual reality. May it be war on an epic scale or war on a personal level Minghella knows precisely how to capture the moment. And even with the abundance of splendid scene-scapes and backdrops spread throughout the film the key achievement `Cold Mountain' exhibits is the emotion and passion harnessed within the characters.<br/><br/>Clearly the heart of the story is one that viewers are more than familiar with. Hope, loss and love, all up against overwhelming odds, it's hardly original. But, you will find satisfaction by being able to identify with the emotional quandary of these characters. Once you get to know them you slip into the story and enjoy yourself all the more. But Minghella has some trouble getting you there. The movie starts off slowly as exposition and character development is needed to boost the rest of the film. It's all stuff that is essentially needed but it's just a little dreary at times. On top of that the need to get closer to true history means that the tone gets quite depressing. This is only strengthened by the characters who the majority are driven by a sad coating of misery, sin or defeat in their lives. Then add the Confederacy losing the war and you don't have a very happy place to be. Make no mistake about it Minghella has made a serious drama with a somewhat relaxed momentum in the telling. But if it's authenticity that he wanted then he has done a marvelous job. It's just that, in this case, reality can really bring you down.<br/><br/>Performances are all A-class. The two leads, Nicole Kidman as Ada and Jude Law as Inman, are truly great actors. The roles themselves are not the best we've seen but they work well within context of the story. RenÃ©e Zellweger's character, Ruby, strikes a sudden change to the pace and grim guise the rest of the movie holds. I found myself liking all of Ruby's scenes but am still trying to figure out if it's because she's the inversion of an overly dim film or because she just sticks out like a sore thumb. Either way I think the film would have probably fell completely stagnate if it weren't for Zellweger's lively portrayal.<br/><br/>`Cold Mountain' is not exactly Anthony Minghella's greatest effort but definitely one of his finest. This is a great story made with tremendous care by a large handful of master filmmakers. It's a little bleak and sluggish for most of the time but done in reflection to the literary source and the authenticity of the story. Ironically, it's hard to imagine it done in any other way. Despite some minor announces you will have a hard time not enjoying yourself. In the end this is a good entertaining few hours. I'd even go as far as saying it's a must see film, because you really must see it to make your own judgment.<br/><br/>Score - 3 out of 5"

Simple setup: Gigolo Joe is a Confederate soldier who deserts the smoldering trenches to return to his idyllic paradise hometown, the namesake of the film, where he can find peace and (more importantly) Nicole Kidman. Sounds like one helluva setup, right? Moving a character from A to B allows for all kinds of exciting encounters and the opportunity for hilarity to ensue.<br/><br/>The first major flaw of this movie lies in an obvious place: the two lead actors. Jude Law is unoffensive in this role, but nowhere near remarkable. On the other hand, Nicole Kidman is simply not right for her part. There wasn't a single moment in this movie where I could tolerate her. Actually, have her exchange roles with Natalie Portman and you have the makings of Hollywood ""magic"".<br/><br/>Why do I have a problem with our two star-crossed lovers? Because I never care about them. Not once did I feel any tangible connection to their ""love"". They barely knew each other when he went off to war: they had shared a few words and a single session of passionate necking. And this isnt a vendetta I have against Kidman, she made me care about the romance in ""Moulin Rouge!"", its just paper thin at it is. ""Oh, but even though they knew each other only briefly, they loved one another"". Fine, but don't just tell me this, convince me.<br/><br/>Now for the duplicitous dilemma at the core of this mess: the movie tries to be a mix of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" and ""The Matrix:Reloaded""...what do you get when mixing elements from a great movie and an awful one (in that order)? A mediocre movie leaning heavily towards travesty.<br/><br/>Why ""O Brother""? It is a journey full of ambiguous and yet blatant ""Odyssey"" references that attempts Coen-caliber humor. ""Reloaded""? Because of the spiel that the Yoda lady goes on about everything having a predestined purpose, a special providence. So I'm supposed to be moved that Sky Captain's purpose was to return to his beloved, plant his seed, and die in the act of cleansing his town? How profound.<br/><br/>Actually it could've all been profound, but the filmmakers decided it would be better to spend time with Kidman and Zellwegger learning how to plant corn than focus on the one character that I could've actually given a damn about: Cold Mountain. Minghella would've been would've been wise to have better established the corruption of Cold Mountain by Teague and his posse after most of the men leave for war. Instead this corruption and its physical effect on the town is only hinted at, and Teague's band of misfits become static foes on the prowl for deserters. In the end it is the town that is saved, not the blossoming love they've been building up. The tragedy I could feel for the is the destruction of immaculate, unadulterated Cold Mountain. Instead I'm told to long for the fulfillment of Joaquin Phoenix's lustful desires.<br/><br/>I hate Renee Zellweger. Her accent is terrible. Phillip Seymour Hoffman isn't anything more than entertaining. Come to think of it, Donald Sutherland gives the best performance of the cast after the Native American fellow and Jack White.<br/><br/>There are many moments in this movie that I enjoy... the sequence with Natalie Portman is one of the strongest and Ethan Suplee is always a plus, but please, please do not convince yourself that this is an acceptable movie by any account: just because something has all the makings of greatness, it doesn't mean it can achieve it."

I'm wondering what the young lady's father, the Reverend, would have to say about his daughter leaving the plantation to marry a carpenter, in the class conscious South of the 1860.<br/><br/>
Leaving the love theme aside, it is also difficult to believe that what is presented as fact in this film is historically accurate.  Many deserters were shot, I'm sure.  But I doubt bands of official ""vigilantes"" were allowed to run about killing anyone they pleased, leaving the bodies where they lay and having to account to no one. And if it were the case, I would think it more likely to happen out on the high road, not once one is home in a close nit mountain community, where they have always taken care of their own.<br/><br/>The mindlessness goes on and on.  In one horrific scene, three Union soldiers raid a farmhouse; there they demand food from a single woman they find there.  They are either lost or more likely deserters themselves. One of the soldiers explains that they are desperate, that they have not eaten in three days. After they locate the chickens and a hog, they seem to forget about eating all together and proceed to rape the woman.   Can anyone believe that it would not be food first and women after?<br/><br/>
This film go on and on like this from one improbability to another until the mind just goes numb. Therefore, even though Cold Mountain is certainly entertaining, well acted, and beautifully filmed, I can't give it better than a B+. So don't fall for the hype. There are several better movies made in 2003.  This is not Oscar caliber stuff and it's certainly not ""Gone With The Wind.""<br/><br/>

"lightbluechalk","Null","0","0","3 January 2004"," Hope in a post- LOTR world [slight spoilers]
","Its ridiculously well acted. I totally bought into the wonderfully chaste yet aching yearning of Ada and Inman, [as in, Nicole and Jude] which is what i think the film needed to hinge on. There's this lovely part in the film where the two are standing outside her home, having exchanged not more then half a dozen words in total - its obvious that they are desperately in love but both are inexperienced and stilted by social conventions and the knowledge that they are communing on borrowed time - he's signed up for the Civil war you see. She wonders as to his feelings for her [though never so bluntly] and he is incapable of expressing himself - yet the depth of feeling is conveyed when he breaks his silence to explain that, even though you can't describe the colour of the night's sky, and although theres no term for 'that feeling when all night you've laid awake thinking so hard that your ribs are bruised', these things are very real and present.<br/><br/>
As is death, and destruction. The horror of war is everywhere, right from the non-preachy slow-motion-free beginning, where the Yankees [northerners to you and me] blow up Inman and his fellow Southerners. He decides that being killed for a pointless cause he doesnt believe in is much less preferable then risking torture, starvation and death by naked adulterous wives - all in the hope of finding Ada once again. To me, tactical details about the civil war didnt matter, neither that characters come and go in his Odyssey-like journey, because its about the way people get through pain, how they deal with dilemmas [such as the couple who are tortured by the Home Guard to reveal their deserter sons] and how people change because of war.<br/><br/>
Ada doesnt just sit about writing letters, either. She fights her own personal war against the elements, gold-digging guards, and a psychotic cockeral, having been raised a genteele Southern belle with no practical skills. thankfully Renee Zellwegger turns up with a mean ol' glint in her eye, a pair of capable hands, a very pugnacious pout and beheads said chicken and restores the farm.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, like i said, i believed that Ada and Inman could wait and save themselves for years despite barely knowing each other, or even knowing if the other was alive, and that he would travel 1000 miles for her, reliving their one and only kiss every day. The whole cast is great too, no one is a stereotype, there aren't any awful pitchfork-wielding yokels with straw hanging out their mouths. Some people may think its on the road to soppiness but i have a superb cheese detector and i think this film strikes the right chord, and anyway, Renee cuts right through it all with her snappy comments.<br/><br/>One actor who was particularly moving was an unfortunate Natalie Portman [she of the awful Star Wars seduction] as a young widow trapped alone with a sick baby who shelters Inman for a night. She puts him in the corn store, then thinks better of it and puts him in her bed as you would with Jude Law. Yet she doesnt ask for anything other then him to hold her, as she cries and recalls a time before her husband left to fight and never returned. in the morning, Union soldiers arrive [including Cillian Murphy - he of 28 Days Later] to hunt out the Southerner and generally bully the girl. Her turn as a girl so selflessly in love with her baby that she would allow the captain to rape her in the hope that he will leave the child alone is truly touching. And Jack White from The Stripes is in it! and hes good! Law is getting better and better, he is obviously trying to be recognised as more of a character actor then pretty boy [as befits a man whose face is partially obscured by a period beard throughout half the film] and it continues the good work since his stunningly slimy 'photographer' in Road To Perdition. Kidman is, as always, perfect, playing a woman a good ten years younger.<br/><br/>I was really annoyed 'cause i'd read what happens in the end in an article about the director, Anthony Minghella, in The Times, of all places. it shows how good it is when I could still enjoy each moment. You get a real sense of the harshness of life, of the need for security and hope in a world falling apart - for characters like Portman's and to a lesser extent, Kidman's, the war has been paid for dearly and safety is a key theme. Minghella directed [and adapted for screenplay] Talented Mr Ripley, and The English Patient so there you go, hes top class. Proof that Dorset has something to give the world besides Cerne Abbas Giant biscuits, education for pre-Coldplay singers and erm, Martin Clunes. Seriously good, wanna see it again!"
"JAKastner","6","0","0","3 January 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of Cold Mountain
","What is with Hollywood and the concept of love in the mitts of great disasters? There can be no greater example of this obsession than the highest grossing film of all time, Titanic. Though the Oscar darling can be blamed for the most recent trend, it is not the first to start this. There's the classic Casablanca and many other films set in and around World War II that do the same thing that is happening today in war features. Many films have come out recently and tried to duplicate the same result as Titanic but none have come close. Miramax is hoping they can break that statement with their film set in North Carolina during the Civil War. The Great War that divided this nation from 1861 to 1865 has become a hot subject as of late but few have taken the time to really focus, accurately at least, what this war was truly about. Instead they focus on side issues and stories that were only a small piece of the puzzle that was this time period. Gangs of New York, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, is a perfect example of this. If the subject matter of Cold Mountain and the historical time period are blended in a way that creates an accurate interesting tale then maybe more and more films will be able to do the same.<br/><br/>The story follows the young Confederate soldier who has deserted his position in the army in order to return home to be with his pre-war sweetheart. Inman is a man of very little words and actions but when he discovers the new missionary's daughter, Ada, he is at even greater loss for words. The two young North Carolina residents seem to take an interest in each other but that development is quickly put in jeopardy as Inman goes to join the other young men of the South to defend their homeland from `Northern aggression'. After he is wounded after the Siege of Petersburg, he deserts the Confederate army and starts a long and tiresome journey back to Cold Mountain. Along the way, he encounters many different characters that both help and hinder his journey home. Back in Cold Mountain, things are no better for Ada for the farm goes into disarray after the death of her father. With help of a drifter named Ruby, she hopes to survive long enough to reunite with Inman once again. The story for Cold Mountain may have been a bestselling plot when it was in book form but up on screen it is nothing short of disappointing. The plot is pretty predictable with several actions leading up to `major' events that could be seen from a mile away. The feature runs into the same problems as Gangs of New York, which opened this same time last year, in that it tries to cram too much into three hours and loses its focus not too far from the end.<br/><br/>Though the cast seems to be an impressive group of Oscar favorites, few of them really show off why they should be labeled as such in this film. The biggest problem has to be Nicole Kidman's character, Ada. In the beginning of the film, it seems as though her character should be a little younger then Kidman herself makes her out to be. How old is Kidman? Forty years old? Whatever age she is, the way the character is presented, it seems she should be a lot younger. Another problem is featured after the death of Ada's father. Obviously Ada is going through rough times taking care of herself and the farm all alone but her faces just holds up so well. Boy! The medical care back in the 1860's may have been crap but make-up was just spectacular. This sarcasm being said, they could have made her character a little less dolled up, cosmetic-wise, as the film progressed. Despite a somewhat impressive performance by Jude Law, the bottom line is that the so-called relationship between Inman and Ada lack substance. They barely know each other and yet the audience is made to believe that they act as if they have known each other all their lives and once the war is over, they can go back to where they started? And critics should especially be yelled at believing this after ranting on such films as Daredevil and Pearl Harbor for attempting the same thing Cold Mountain tries to pull off. If there is anything good about the cast, it has to be Renee Zellweger's Ruby, who really picks up the film where it seems to be heading for a continuous decline.<br/><br/>Overall, Cold Mountain manages to outdo last year's Gangs of New York but like the English Patient, it takes the film a long time to get to its predictable and pointless conclusion. Once again the Union on the basis of the Civil War are demonized and made to look like idiots no more so then in sequences like the scene that involved Natalie Portman's unnecessary character. Even the issue of freeing the slaves, which was not the main issue of the Civil War though many try to make it that way,  isn't as focused on correctly as they could have made it. What would have been a lot more interesting then the bland `love story' would have been the more grand battle sequences and issues of statehood and homeland but those are only battered about here and there without developing into anything grand scale. The film presents a valid topic of the Confederacy wanting to start a war and even doing anything they could to fight the North but when it comes to the end of the war, they blame everybody but themselves for what has been brought upon them. Director Minghella could have done something like that but chose not to. Once again another lackluster Civil War feature is presented to the movie-going public. Hopefully the American education system can pick up where this film fails to lead up to.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)"

","I read the book nearly four years ago. I very much enjoyed that and seem to recall it had much more interiority for Inman, whereas this film seemed focused on Ada/Ruby for character development. Jude Law was left to speak in silence too much of the time. He was longing embodied, though righteous (overly so at times).<br/><br/>I almost wish they had given the narration of letters to Inman rather than Ada, it would have helped with his character as a deserter who has seen too much disaster. The interplay of Ada/Ruby seemed to work well-enough on its own.<br/><br/>Also in the novel, the trek seemed more arduous, with more on the isolated survival of Inman. And I recall passages that felt quite poetic, that helped to distract me from the distinction what on film seemed to much like the good characters and the bad characters. Maybe more strife and chafing between Ada and Ruby would have helped? More dishonor for other deserters, as opposed to Inman??<br/><br/>That said, this certainly makes fine use of the music cited in the text. And enough of the quirky encounters are decently recapped here. Seemed like an awful lot of close-ups, playing up the romance angle. The eventual sex scene was funny to me, as it seemed out of place with an edit of the two just laying in what I thought was post-coitus first and then into the beast with two backs and plenty  more wounds.<br/><br/>Sex was not a problem for me, but a brutal beginning bugged some with me. Actually I recall the book being far more visceral, but reading pages of slaughter and amputation provides a better barrier of distance than on screen jump-cuts and gouges.<br/><br/>This will win awards as a treacly epic when its really one of those not-so-bad, not-so-great films, I'd rather it had more of the arty starkness of Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man.""<br/><br/>Who will make ""Blood Meridian"" into a film, one frets.<br/><br/>

","HERE THERE BE SPOILERS<br/><br/>However, if you haven't seen this movie, i would recommend you don't. This is a chick flick, plain and simple.  Sure, they added a few battle scenes, put in some rather disgusting characters, and generally annoyed the hell out of me with Kidman's ability to act totally useless, in terms of farming and acting ability.  Lame dialogue plauges this film (although a few inexplicably awful lines are later mocked by Zelwiger's character). Paying attention, something i found to be a challenge, you realize that every good character eventually got shot (ex: Ethan Suplee's character the banjo player, the ferry girl, the Union soldier who Jude Law let run...) and killed, while Law is shot 2 or 3 times, not counting surviving a big explosion, and makes a miraculous recovery each time, except for his ""suprise"" death at the end.  Oh, the sex scene was a hackneyed cliche, any organism with any amount of sex drive would undoubtedly ask themselves ""Ew... do i look like THAT?""  In a few words: THIS MOVIE BITES."

SPOILER - I actually leaned over to my friend after Jude and Nicole had sex and said, 'ooh dear, he is going to die horribly now.' It was so obvious the film just couldn't let him survive. i thought the moment where they first met again was heart stopping though.

","I found the openings scenes of this movie a bit too much to handle.  Same goes for some of the scenes in the middle (I won't go into the descriptions; they were simply horrible).  It was intended to be that way of course, to bring home the horror of the civil war. The movie is about how people survived the civil war, despite their losses.<br/><br/>I got into the movie in the second half better, which probably means after Ruby (Rene Z.) comes on the scene.  Upto that point it seemed like a usual love story. I have not yet read the book.  The movie grows into a beautifully touching work toward the end.  My favorite episode in the movie is the one involving Natalie Portman, and she is not even one of the major characters. The main characters Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are believable, although Kidman did not initially appear so.<br/><br/>I loved the cinematography, and the scenery which I understand is from Romania.  When the movie ended, what I was left with was knowing a little more about the people that lived through the civil war. The movie was not that much about the war- who won, how, etc.- but about how it changed the lives of the people.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be a bit too long. Still it is worth seeing."

It looked great, the acting was fine and there were some genuinely interesting characters and quirky moments. I was even beginning to think that maybe it was going to be worth adding to the list of great movies made by foreigners about America - Milos Forman with Taking Off and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, John Schlessinger with Midnight Cowboy, John Boorman with Point Blank, Peter Yates with Bullitt and, of course, Sergio Leone. However, almost as soon as the thought was formed, my enthusiasm began to evaporate. Jude Law just isn't strong enough to make you care whether he gets back home or not, Nicole Kidman fails to convince as a woman surviving in those cruel times and, most damning of all, the final showdowns with the baddies are oddly weedy. Cold Mountain, like all of Minghella's films, is also grotesquely overlong. It would be improved greatly by losing at least half an hour.

For whatever reason I found that I did not care about Nicole Kidman's side of the story nor did I care about the love story. To have a gripping love story when the main characters are not in the same scenes is hard, but not impossible, to do, and they fail here. Jude Law's side of the story is entertaining and I would argue a great 2 hour movie could have been made just with Law's story including a lot more of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's entertaining character. But instead we get a drawn out film that shows some great promise(the Civil War scene, the various character's Jude Law meets)mixed with a lot of unnecessary scenes and a story that fails to engage the viewer beyond it's surface.

Jude Law and Nicole Kidman have outdone themselves with their performances.  And what can I say about Rene Zellweger except that she is the very highlight of this film.

","Even though this is one of the better looking films of the year its still a disappointment when you think of the main part of the story that involves the two main roles. Story is about a man named Inman (Jude Law) that lives in a small southern town called Cold Mountain and the Civil War is only days away from starting. Inman meets Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) who is the daughter of Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) and once they lock eyes a flirtatious relationship begins. The two of them say almost nothing to each other but after war is declared and Inman is putting on his uniform he kisses Ada before he marches off. While at the front lines the Yankee Army dig tunnels and plant explosives underneath the Confederates and this is the start of a very bloody battle where countless lives are lost on both sides. Inman is wounded and while recovering in a makeshift medical facility he decides that he doesn't care about ""The Cause"" and deserts from the Army and plans on walking back to Cold Mountain and to Ada.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Back at Cold Mountain the Reverend Monroe dies and leaves Ada alone on the farm to tend for herself which she is not equipped to do. A local man named Teague (Ray Winstone) has his eyes on Ada's property and Ada herself and along with his band of thugs they execute Army deserters and torture and kill anyone that aids them. One of Ada's neighbors decides to get her help so one day the rough and tumble Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) shows up and she helps her take care of the farm. During they're time together Ada and Ruby develop a strong friendship even though they appear to be total opposites. Ada keeps telling her that Inman will return one day even though she hasn't heard from him in years. While on the road Inman meets several people that either help him or try to arrest him and kill him. He meets a lecherous preacher named Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), A grinning hillbilly (Giovanni Ribisi) with a house of sirens, an old woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who lives in the forest with goats, and a young widow (Natalie Portman) who has a sick baby but yearns for the touch of another kind person. Both Ada and Inman spend the next 3 years or so going through all sorts of turmoil until Inman finally makes it back to Cold Mountain where they are united.<br/><br/>This film was directed by Anthony Minghella who makes films in the most beautiful locations. This film is suppose to be in the South but is actually filmed in the lush forests of Romania and even though some of the scenes don't look like the South the scenery is still rich and gives the film a unique and remote look. The battle scene that takes place in the first part of the film is as barbaric as it is impressive. When the explosion goes off we actually see soldiers getting their uniforms blown off. Its a scene that film historians will be discussing at great lengths and its probably the best reason to view this film. With that, this film does have a glaring flaw that is evident from the first 10 minutes. Kidman and Law are practically strangers when he goes off to war and the supposedly love angle just doesn't come off. I wasn't sure why Kidman's character even gave Inman a second look. She's educated and proper and he's...well, he mumbles with nails in his mouth. Both Law and Kidman come off as strong but dull. What saves the film (For me, anyway) are the supporting performances that are all vividly shown and Zellweger steals the entire film. It's not that her performance is believable but it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she's with Kidman who stands around looking like a deer caught in the headlights. Zellweger's Ruby is a cross between Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking and she chews the scenery with gusto. While the story definitely has its share of flaws its still quite impressive looking and I believe this film is more about the journey than what its suppose to lead to. Minghella has shown once again that he knows how to tell stories on an epic scale and this is a well crafted film from start to finish."

The bloody war footage left me cold, and I never did (even as the movie went on) see any sense in the connection between Nicole Kidman's character and Jude Law's -- there was no real chemistry and no cinematic rhyme or reason to their attachment, in my opinion.  That should have been fleshed out more, and perhaps exchanged for all the time spent on that loser of a ""preacher"" who's thrown in, largely for laughs, on Inman's journey home.<br/><br/>The most solid acting in this movie was from the supporting cast.  Renee Zellweger was convincing as Ruby, and her arrival on the scene revitalized the movie for me and probably kept me from walking out.  (I think this is, believe it or not, the first movie I've seen her in).  Also, the actors portraying the Swanger family turned in good performances, as did Natalie Portman.  Nicole Kidman did a good job, as always, although even she occasionally had a hard time hiding her Australian accent behind a Southern one. There were high points, and some good funny moments. Overall, however, I just felt disconnected and disappointed.<br/><br/>****SPOILER WARNING BEYOND THIS POINT******<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest reason I couldn't get emotionally involved with this film was that, even without having read the book or a single review or summary of the movie beyond the bare-bones ""civil war"" label, I KNEW that the majority of the characters would be doomed to die by the end.  I knew that there was no way the couple could really wind up together; the new Hollywood wouldn't allow that.

No hard feelings, but there are plenty of teens who wuld enjoy this film that I know. I hate stereotypes.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Cold Mountain"" is the tale of a Civil War ""drifter"" named Inman, deeply played by Jude Law, who is trying to return home to his girlfriend, played by Nicole Kidman. She, in turn, is having a hard time keeping up the farm until a ""friend"" (wink, wink) comes along, played by Renee Zellweger.<br/><br/>
The problem with this movie is one that has oft been repeated; it wants to be a romance, but based on what? There is a more budding relationship between Ada Monroe- Kidman's character- and Ruby Thewes- played by Z-money. Inman and Ada only knwe each other for, in Ada's words, ""a few moments"", but a deep romance is supposed to spring from that? Before the war, he was distant towards her, yet for some reason, she wrote him numerous letters in which she poured out her heart? Sorry, sister, I'm not buying it.<br/><br/>This happens numerous other times in the movie, too- in the beginning, when Inman is fighting in the muddy, violent hole battle and two of his friends get killed, we're supposed to care? The characters in this film were not developed enough; we didn't know enough about them. We care for Inman at the end of the movie not because of his love with Ada, but because of what he went through to see her. Of course, one could argue that that's a plus because we do care for him; whenever something bad happens to him, we feel it, and whenever something goes his way, we feel happy for him.<br/><br/>An interesting development in this movie could have been the relationship between Ruby and her father, at once estranged and emotional. (spoiler time) When her father is shot, at once the veil comes off Ruby as she races to her father's side. Too bad this relationship wasn't explored more thoroughly. Conversely, this film portrayed a stunningly accurate portrayal of Civil War life that is too often overlooked by history books. Single-room wooden huts were the norm back then. The settings are very authentic, and the battle scenes accomplish the rare feat of capturing much action without seeming confusing and all over the place- like what happened in Return of the King.<br/><br/>Overall, wait for this to come out on video. The only reason to pay 8 bucks to see it on the big screen is to witness a few sprawling shots of the settings. *** out of ****"
"pompaj","Null","0","0","10 January 2004"," Excellent film in all the hugeness of its scope
","This was a terrific movie. It was dramatic, exciting, and at times, even funny (Rene Zellwegger). I guess movies of this time of year, around the oscar season, are all a little bit of everything. This one comes disguised as a romance, but more of a drama than anything else. Yes, there are two stories going on at once. That seems to be another common theme of films of this season. The House of Sand and Fog is two stories, 21 Grams is 3. Cold Mountain is two, and since there is a romance there, it seems to be a little wierd that the members of the couple are split up for the film. It's not half as wierd as it might seem. This is because both stories are very, very good. You'd expect that Nicole Kidman staying at home, learning to take care of her farm would be boring. It isn't. She gets Zellwegger helping her out, sparking up life every time she opens her mouth, and she also gets a band of southern hunters who terrorize them and their neighbors. Meanwhile, we got Jude Law, as Inman, trying to make his way home and being detained at stop after stop. His story reminded me of one of those journey movies like Easy Rider or The Last Detail, where each stop is a story unto itself. One of his better stops involves Natalie Portman as a young mother and a bunch of Northern troops who terrorize her. So, you see how what has the seeds of a romance actually surprises everyone by springing up into a drama with occasional action. The movie might be long, but it doesn't feel it. That's because every frame is edge of your seat compelling. Anthony Minghella knows that his English Patient was boring. Yes it was beautiful and won the best picture oscar, but the general consensus is that it was boring, and he's been trying to make it up to us ever since."

","...surrounded by another 110 minutes of bad lead performances, horrible writing, bad editing, weak melodrama, incredibly obvious dialog that spells out what you already know, and very, very, very frequent boredom.<br/><br/>
I've never seen a movie that depended on its supporting cast as much as this one. The first hour or so focuses almost entirely on stars Jude Law and Nicole Kidman--and it is one of the most deadly dull hours you've ever sat through in your life. It should be a punishable offence to make two such great talents look so amateur. It isn't until Rene Zellweger's Calamity Jane-ish Ruby appears on the screen--about an HOUR into the story--that the film shows any life at all. Luckily, Rene's performance is just the first of a series of great acting mini-masterpieces. Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Eileen Atkins, Jena Malone, and, most surprisingly, Natalie Portman, all do amazing bits of work. Unfortunately, they are the lonely dots of pepper in this vast pot of bland Hollywood mush. Without their work, ""Cold Mountain"" would just be another piece of homogenized, balless, corporate, tinseltown claptrap. <br/><br/>
How to fix it:<br/><br/>1)	Get rid of the sappy music all together. I love movie music, but the score here never adds anything, it only subtracts.<br/><br/>2)	Cut the dialog by 70%. What we've seen we don't need a narrator to tell us, and a good story doesn't need its characters to constantly tell us why they exist or what the movie's themes are.<br/><br/>3)	Cut the entire film down to less than one hour and fifty minutes--because that's all the story there is."

Nicole Kidman was fantastic in another good role her third or fourth in a row. She really potrays Adas longing very well and has a very amusing scene with a chicken.

","I was really excited about this movie coming out, and I actually read the book in the week prior to its opening so I could compare the two.  I was not disappointed, however some of my favorite moments from the book were left out of the movie.  On the other hand, I understand that Minghella had to leave out some things from Frazier's sweeping novel or we would have been in the theater for about six hours!  I didn't even really have a problem with the alteration of plot surrounding Sally Swanger's character, since what Minghella seemed to do was basically transcribe the story of another brief character in the book onto her character.  The only aspect of the movie that left me somewhat disappointed was the way in which Inman and Ada's romance was portrayed in its early stages.  In the movie, they have more encounters prior to Inman's leaving than they do in the book, but many of those meetings seem to be missing the kind of magic present in certain scenes within the novel (i.e. the moment when Ada sits on Inman's lap beside the fire).  But, the scene between Inman and Sara, the widow, was left pretty much untouched, (another of my favorite moments) and I thought it was wonderful.  Also to Minghella's credit, I must say that I thought the scene where Ada goes to see Inman off to war was extremely well done. All in all, I thought it was a visually and thematically beautiful movie that stayed with me long after I left the theater."

","Excellent film which cracks a real emotional punch without dissolving into sentimentality. The real standout performances come from the supporting cast. Zelleweger goes from strength to strength (after introducing herself to the story by chopping a roosters head off), giving the movie some much needed humour and brimming with charisma. Also Natalie Portman gave a heart rendering performance as a grief wracked widow and mother,showing that there is MUCH more to her than wooden Queen Amidala impressions and fulfiling the early promise shown in Leon. The story keeps moving at a decent pace whilst managing to develop the key relationships and characters so we actually care about what happens at the end and feel a sense of loss at the films conclusion.

There is some rather horrible gore at the beginning, during the civil war battle. The rest is like ""The Outlaw Josey Whales"" without pace and without Eastwood's charisma. Just when you think the action may pick up, we get another softly-spoken, dirge-like voice-over from Nicole Kidman. Jude Law makes little impression in the lead male role. He is monosyllabic, and comes over as too lightweight for the 'epic' tale he is obliged to carry. Overall, the action is fatally episodic and the script WAY TOO LONG. Someone should have told Mingella to get busy with the blue pencil, but I guess he is too big a fish these days for that to happen. Pity. In the hands of a more dynamic director/writer it could have been good."

"starnightwhole","Null","0","0","28 December 2003"," a gruesome civil war time experience. Integral spoiler material.
","Note: Some spoiler material but integral to the review. Cold Mountain starring Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellweger is a scene by scene brutal depiction of the civil war experienced by Inman, a young Confederate soldier, played by Jude, and those people living in Cold Mountain, North Carolina.  Nicole plays Ada, the minister's daughter, from Charleston.  Inman is a carpenter farm hand, who sets his heart to capturing Ada.  Renee plays Ruby Thewes, a poor mountain girl, but a strong farm hand, who will save Ada from starvation and helplessness.  All three actors do a wonderful job at acting their roles, but to me the script was immediately down graded, when I realized the constant contrivances displayed in almost each new segment.  Each scene really displays nothing more than the sole purpose of shocking the audience.  It depleted any stream of emotional depth, which is a total shame, as I just adore Nicole Kidman.  But maybe we are only supposed to feel like we are to be given the run down list of civil war time gruesome dilemmas.  There is much more meat to the film, Gone With the Wind, probably the most famous civil war epic film.  For example, Ada's father, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) passes away seamlessly, while sitting in his backyard listening to Ada's piano playing from inside the house.  She runs to his side when she discovers that he is not coming inside, during a sudden rain shower.   On the other hand, Scarlett has to cope with her father losing his sanity, bit by bit, every day, as they struggle to grow food, on the very barren land of Tara.  In a delusional state, he saddles himself upon a horse, and I am almost sure that he dies being thrown from the horse.  We feel Scarlett's complete devastation at her loss.  But my intention is not to point out that one film is better than the other.  My intention is to notice that shocking incidents compete too much with the emotional interplay among characters.  In other words, the display of one shocking incident after another, only detracts from character development, rather than build it.  On a positive note, I did like the portrayal of not being able to trust an apparent ally, as war transforms even the seeming apparent strongest soles, into ones of desperation, to capture or kill a fellow man, one in his alliance.<br/><br/>The movie begins in Petersburg, Virginia, 1864, where the Yankees are setting a huge line of explosives under the southern defense.  Inman is recruited as a Confederate soldier.  He survives the blast.  Then we are taken back three years prior to the war, where we see a glimpse of Ada's and Inman's more at ease natures, prior to the implications of war.  Ada is very close to her father and his ministry.  The remainder of the story jumps forward to show Inman's, many times debilitating journey home to his barely acquainted love, Ada.  He leaves for war, only briefly conversing and kissing her.  On his treacherous journey home, he encounters endless threats to his life.  Even a high ranking Confederate, Inman's alleged ally, will heartlessly chain him to form a make- shift group of soldiers.  Teague (Ray Winstone) is another Cold Mountain character, who will ruthlessly turn upon his neighbors, killing innocent families, including children, just for their live stock.  It is rather odd, since Ada, in all probability having never used a rifle, in one shot kills a turkey, in the mountains, for sustenance. If she can accomplish this task, it makes Teague look like a total buffoon.<br/><br/>
Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays Reverend Veasy, a perfectly crooked minister, who is ready to drown a black slave woman, whom he has drugged and impregnated, in hopes to save his reputation, that is, until Inman stops him.  The minister thanks Inman from preventing a most heinous crime. Other cruel incidents transpire in and around Inman.  And soon enough, Ada and helpmate Ruby, find themselves in the thick of war, in their own back yard, defending their lives, others in need, and Ada's property.  In this war, the motto is `trust no one.'  But when Inman finally makes his way back to Ada, looking down into a rifle barrelhead she holds steadily at him, which I thought so perfect, she soon lets down her guard, to learn that this is a person whom she can trust.  During this year, both have changed since living through a terrible chain of events.  Their faith in humanity has crumbled before their eyes, and they both see that in the soul of the other.  Ada invites Inman to her sparse living quarters, and she opens the door to having sex with him, as she has feelings for him from the past, seeming also to symbolize that she has not given up on the human spirit, which is lovely. By now, 2 ½ hours have passed unsuspectingly, and I must leave the movie to return to my housemate, Lilly, my dog.  If anyone will reply with the ending scenes, I would really appreciate it.  Do Inman and Ada marry and settle in Cold Mountain?  Does she buy a new piano and start a family?  What about Ruby?  Does she find a love or at least a friend, after her losing her Dad in the horrid injustices of war?"

I was just kind of surprised after having Law's character live that long that he would be killed off.  Law gets blown up, shot in the neck, trapped in a chain gang (of which every single one in the chain except him gets killed), and travels thousands of miles just to clean-up, shave, have sex, and get shot buy some nobody character?  That was a real downer.  He should have stayed in the cabin with Natalie Portman it was probably safer.

","Cold Mountain.  Miramax's 83 million dollar bet.  Harvey Weinstein put alot on the line for the gorgeous epic and ultimately the film just does not deliver.  Now i am not saying this to stand against the waves or act differently simply to be noticed. I am being truly honest when I say that the movie is not very good.  The scenery is beautiful and the actors look the part , however i could not excuse the ridiculous antics and look of Charlie Hunnam's character. Minghella shows that he has a direct idea in his intentions for the film however he clearly was lost character wise and ultimately his lack of character direction destroys the film. The film follows the implied love connection between a one emotioned Jude Law and an over accented Nicole Kidman.  They both give awful performances and they simply show that even the most proven actors can do a bad job with meaningful material. Anyway the film follows Inman (Jude Law) as he makes his journey from the battlefields of the civil war, back to the love of his life, Kidman.  Well the ""love connection"" shared between the two is flacid and poorly dealt with.  It amazes me that two actors of such high caliber can do such a poor job despite the scenery that is meant to support their actions.   The most valid reasoning behind my hate for Jude Law's performance is the fact that his character does not change or develop anywhere throughout the film.  One would think that after the horrors of war, the triumph over such negative events would change a man for the better.  However Jude Law maintains the same solemn look throughout the entire film. Its a pathetic and meaningless performance which could have been done better had the original choice of Tom Cruise landed the role.  If you doubt me see The Last Samurai and your respect for Tom Cruise will return, he shows his sense of development and intelligence throughout that picture. The most demeaning quality of this film is its time.  Now i realize that the runtime is acceptable and not neccesarily unbearable, however how can you watch a movie that is so utterly boring?  By the end of the film i had forgotten most of the other supporting characters, with the exception of  Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Lucas Black, and Natalie Portman.   The film is slow and boring ultimately.  However slow is not always bad, The Last Samurai was long and slow but I loved it because it held the viewers interest.   Hoffman is hilarious and Portam is moving and perhaps the reason i liked them so much is because they were bairly in the dam thing. Now i can be disagreed with by thousands but i maintain, the film sucks and i was very dissapointed, it is 2003's Gangs of New York, it garners respect for no dam reason.  6/10."

","I was present at a preview screening in New York this week. Having read this fantastic book, I was a bit nervous that the film would fail to capture the horrors of the Civil War and the wrenching details and ramifications of the war to our county that the author captured so well in his novel. I felt certain that due to the time constraints of a movie, the plot would be butchered and watered down. To my surprise, Mingella has brillantly condensed the story (still leaving in all the major story factors) as well as expanded and created additional scenes. The most notable addition is the epic battle scene that opens the film, which is not present in the novel. However this scene immediately sets the tone of the brutality and the intimacy of the violence in this war. The actors all give wonderful naturalistic performances and Mingella really manages to recreate the period in such completeness that it is as though you are eavesdropping on history. Jude Law gives a complex and moving performance speaking few lines, but speaking volumes with his eyes. Nicole Kidman, (who manages to look beautiful and clean throughout, I would have appreciated at least one scene when she looked just slightly dirty) gives a restrained and intense performance. Her accent tended to veer off from the southern dialect, but the chemistry between both her and Jude Law and Renee Zellweger was wonderful. Phillip Seymour Hoffman practically steals all of his scenes for some much needed humor to this dark story. Renee Zellweger is a bit over the top, but had a very effecting transformation as the story progressed. The other supporting performances (especially Kathy Baker) are fantastic and the soundtrack wonderfully captures the flavor of the time and, unlike so many soundtracks is not a distraction. This movie is definately one of the best of the year, with a story that should engage both men and women. I highly recommend this film."
"harvey0","6","0","0","7 December 2003"," It could have been better.
","Director/Screenwriter Anthony Minghella takes so much time showing gruesome battle sequences that the fragilelove story between Ada and Inman hardly has a chance to come to life during the first 45 minutes of the film. It's only after the appearance of Renee Zellwegger as the mountain woman Ruby Thewes that the picture becomes interesting. If nominated in the best supporting actress category, Zellwegger will be hard to beat this year. The film strives so hard to be epic in scope that the intimacy is often lost. ""Cold Mountain"" is a good film, but could have been a very good one had it been edited down to under two hours by chopping out much of the military violence.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman as Ada is not asked to do much. Jude Law as Inman has the more physical and challenging role and is outstanding. The supporting cast is also excellent.<br/><br/>One of my friends loved the film. Another said she wouldn't have gone had she known it was going to be so violent. Me? I though it could have been better."
"kiss_my_sweet_ass","Null","0","0","5 December 2003"," Easily Best Picture 2003: War is not Civil
","Attended a screening last night followed by Q & A with Minghella, John Seale & Dante Ferretti.  This movie is a jaw-dropping acheivement in storytelling - every element beautiful, perfectly told.<br/><br/>Performances by the all-star cast are stellar: Jude Law throws down the gauntlet in a performance that could have been eroded by ""actorly"" indulgence in a less-finessed actor.  Here, he is marvelous - subtle, empathetic; it's a beautiful and spare rendering of a simple man living on fumes in a war he doesn't wholly embrace.  Supporting characters are a delight - Philip Seymour Hoffman is Ham-City, appropriately, in his role as a disgraced preacher.  Natalie Portman provides one of the most heart-wrenching performances I can think of related to this time and a woman's plight in the Civil War; it's an absolute gut-punch of a portrayal. Taryn Manning and Melora Walters are absolutely unrecognizable in their roles.  Scene after scene, you discover that these supporting characters are heavyweights in their own right, but the revelation of their identity is not detrimental to the flow of the film.  The actors seem to delight in their anonymity here, with the exception of Nicole Kidman's character Ada, who is (puzzlingly) perpetually rosy-cheeked and pearl-toothed.  Kidman's performance is effective - we believe her story, her passion, however she looks like a movie star here - so much Vivian Leigh in ""Gone with the Wind"" - which, for my eye, did not enhance the believability of the character.<br/><br/>This is a film about the Civil War, told through the eyes of the denizens of rural Cold Mountain, North Carolina.  The story is based on a book by Charles Frazier, which I (thankfully) did not read - thus had no basis for comparison.  The statements that this film makes about the horrors of war are strong and disgustingly realized, without being overtly political or heavy-handed.  We get the idea that this is how our Civil War was waged, in the mud-pits, sumac-covered gullies and smoking cabins of rural America. The film takes a look at how the war impacted the civilian population of the country, not just the soldiers.  Without giving too much away, this film delivers a prescient message about what is going on in our world right now.<br/><br/>Technical credits deserve awards, certainly.  Ferretti's production design and Ann Roth's costumes resonate with period detail, and help tell the story particularly through the use of color.  Observe Nicole Kidman's Ada go from white to black as the movie progresses.  Seale's photography is intimate and natural.  This is not lyrical, obvious camera work, which is a good thing. The audience gets the feeling that they are observing the action naturally, invisibly.  It's a gorgeous bit of cinematography that is so invisible as to go unnoticed, but let's hope not, at Oscar time.<br/><br/>For making a movie about North Carolina, it's curious and sad that the film was shot in Romania.  However, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference.  Who knew that Transylvania was a lush, hilly Southern-US-looking region, where you could actually grow tobacco -?<br/><br/>There is so much more to say about this wonderful film, but it's best to just go out and see it.  I can't wait to see the message boards on this film once it is released.  Hats off to you, Anthony Minghella - you've done it again.  5/5 stars."

","A movie incredibly over-awarded. Sure, Zellwegger is good but I think she's had more Oscar worthy performances. Ever since the divorce, I've come to really appreciate Nicole Kidman but this is just crap. I don't like Jude Law but tried not to think about it when I watched this. The problem is that even if these two did get together, it would most likely have been more of an occasional visit type of thing. Maybe this worked in the book, but it just didn't pan out for me. If you want to see one of the stupidest courting scenes, watch Kidman play piano on the back of a moving wagon while she's intermittently watching Jude Law in the field. It's so stupid, I wonder who her publicist is. I know that everyone in America really loved this movie and thought it was the godsend of great post Civil War romance/dramas but in my opinion, America seems to have forgotten Gone With the Wind. Want to see really painful love experiences and blood, and war, and drama, and everything else really uncomfortable? Watch Vivien Leigh be Scarlet O'Hara and you will wonder why you thought Cold Mountain was so good. And the sex scene? Yeah, right. I'm sure it's a really sexy experience for someone who's never seen a naked man before. Imagine, in real life, they both had butt facials and I just couldn't get over that one real aspect of movie making. Who needs to see that anyway? I don't. Rent a porn if you need to sex in a movie. It completely took away from the ""love"" and you realize that these people have been jonesning from afar for way too long. They could have picked someone else up by now. Just forget about this sappy, crappy, junky Hollywood movie that is a terrible excuse for believability -- unless, of course, you like that kind of thing."

","The best thing about this movie is without a doubt Jude Law. Oh my goodness he is hot! <br/><br/>The plot is somehow tired, full of clichés and very predictable, but I suppose it was being true to the book (having never read it, I wouldn't know). But it has some redeeming aspects, like Ruby, played fantastically well by Renee Zellweger, and Ada (Nicole Kidman) who did a very good job playing the fine lady with useless skills in a time when finesse was the least thing required.<br/><br/>However, Jude Law definitely steals the show (at least from a woman's point of view), he's totally charming, very sexy and incredibly handsome. He seems very natural in the skin of a southern man. The love scenes are very well done and very beautiful, the chemistry between them is electric.<br/><br/>But it's a rather long and boring movie, with many unnecessary sub plots and annoying characters, like the priest and his strange habits, (at least for a ""man of God"" anyway as he calls himself).<br/><br/>The self appointed home-guard is also quite good, being true to their call: nasty, cruel and relentless, if not contradicting! How come the blond rock star look alike thug was not fighting in the war and apparently quite right in hunting other men just as young as himself and killing them for desertion?<br/><br/>Anyway, if you don't have something else better to do, it's a good entertainment on a wet, cold night!"
"=G=","7","3","9","30 June 2004"," Not all that
","A kind of poor man's ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Cold Mountain"" tells of a man (Law) who falls in like with a woman (Kidman) but has to go off to fight for the CSA during the American Civil War. After the battle of Petersburg in late 1864, he deserts and spends the bulk of the 2.5 hour film humping it back home to his kinda-sorta beloved all the while bumping into all manner of peculiar hillbilly characters while Kidman does a sort of Scarlett O'Hara thing trying to maintain a stiff upper lip in the face of cold and deprivation and never having had to do labor before. ""Cold Mountain"" is a worthy albeit Hollywoodized star power and hype film about star crossed would-be lover hillbillies who struggle with the tribulations of the time. The film suffers from a thin plot with a story which is filled with side characters who contribute little to the plot and a denouement which is predictable and too little too late. Don't expect to be seeing much of bit parters Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, or Sutherland in this long wannabe epic which fared well with critics and public alike and garnered a respectable brace of awards.

"Leofwine_draca","4","2","5","10 March 2015"," Plodding
","Why are Anthony Minghella's films so plodding? I remember seeing THE English PATIENT at cinemas back in the day and being astonished at how long it felt. Okay, TRULY MADLY DEEPLY was acceptable but still could have been shortened a little. COLD MOUNTAIN is the worst yet, as what should be a Civil War epic turns out to be a lengthy and often routine melodrama with little to recommend it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the novel was at fault too, although as I haven't read it I can't comment. The film is told from the point of view of Jude Law, a wounded soldier whose sole purpose is to get back home to the woman he loves (Nicole Kidman). The film chronicles Law's journey throughout, so why then do we get all the needless boring scenes of Kidman pining for him back home? Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, in comes Renee Zellweger with a supposedly comedic character and proceeds to reduce it to pantomime level.<br/><br/>There are elements to enjoy in COLD MOUNTAIN, not least the battle sequences which are well mounted. Law comes into contact with various characters as the story progresses, some of them engaging (Philip Seymour Hoffman), others less so; Ray Winstone seems particularly underdeveloped in a supporting role. But after a couple of hours or so it all gets rather repetitive, and you wish they'd just get on with it instead of dragging things out so much. The ending is particularly anticlimactic."

This movie should not have been made with major Hollywood stars from England and Australia. This story deserves real Southerners, and emerging stars who don't divert focus from what is otherwise a beautiful story.<br/><br/>Read the book instead.

"Pedro_H","8","2","5","8 November 2006"," Basic human values laid bare - for those with the time and inclination to explore them.
","A slightly narratively-divided tale of how America was torn apart by civil war using the device of two people (Inman and Ada) that want to be together despite all that has happened.<br/><br/>This is a classic case of a movie which you can either get inside and consider a minor classic (as I do) or one that you get left outside of. In which case you may well use puns based on the word ""cold"". I think the IMDb reviews reflect that.<br/><br/>What is amazing is that some of the serious UK press gave this a drubbing and the kind of ratings you would expect for X Men 13. If cinema is going to be a serious art form then it needs movies like this. Big money has been spent on what might be (crudely) called quality art-house with mainstream players.<br/><br/>Not that it is perfect: Anthony Minghella has a tendency to spend a long time emoting and explaining when the actions and motives of the main players are already clear. War is hell and being on the losing side of a war is an even greater hell. Like Francis Ford Copolla - he tends to linger on a scene long after a point has been made or an action has occurred.<br/><br/>America has never looked kindly at country people. It has a culture that is urban based and urban-basting. In cinema often a bunch of inbreed hillbillies that cannot be trusted. Growing food will never be hip and trendy and let's not pretend there is any chance of a makeover. The historical nature of this production doesn't change a thing.<br/><br/>The concept of lovers torn apart (by war) is not new, nor is strong women that can cope on their own. There is plenty of cod drama here (fights, war, chase, capture, life-and-death struggles, etc.) but it has a proper setting. Tragic scenes are followed by happy scenes - because that is how life is and was.<br/><br/>I thought all the main players were good. Nicole Kidman might have been a bit too pretty and made up at times and Renee Zellweger a bit over-the-top crude, but they worked well off each other. Jude Law has the kind of face (and hollow look) that the camera can focus on for long periods without him doing a lot. He is almost in another movie as he tries to fight his way home.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Miramax for putting up so much money to make a risk piece - I hope you got your money back so you can invest it in more quality productions. Cinema that is worth the entrance money and that can send you away moved."

","I was really disappointed in this movie. First of all, it's really long. I'm not saying that I can't enjoy a movie for more than an hour and a half, but the fact that the journey is an ordeal for the Jude Law character doesn't mean that it has to be an ordeal for the viewer too. I've seen long movies before, but these succeeded in keeping the viewer interested. That wasn't my feeling with ""Cold Mountain"".<br/><br/>The end was a downer too. It was a complete cliché. (SPOILER) I can't stand another movie in which the hero comes back and has sex with the heroine just once, only to die afterwards. And, of course, she gets pregnant! I'm starting to think that waiting for your lover for a long time, having sex with him and having him killed is an excellent method to improve fertility.<br/><br/>What disappointed me the most was that, in fact, the actors did a very good job. And, besides the clichés, the script depicts certain aspects of the war that are not usually shown, like the role of women or the cruelty away from the battlefield. I have the impression that these aspects were treated quite realistically, and that emphasizes the contrast with the glurge in the end.<br/><br/>I have to admit that, in terms of music and photography, it is a really beautiful movie. Nevertheless, that's not enough to make it a great movie.<br/><br/>That's what annoyed me so much: with great resources, Minghella didn't make a great movie."

Only in a very few moments I felt that all this could have been much better - as in the sequence with the young widow (Natalie Portman) searching a moment of comfort with Inman (Jude Law). Renée Zellweger's genuinely comic performance was also one of the few good points - even though the script didn't help her much.<br/><br/>And please: Nicole Kidman is quite a good actress, but she was definitely too old for this part - especially with her Botox-ridden features...

","After 630 or so comments what remains to be said? A European view maybe? The film fails. Why? Historically, its so American. 1860 of the civil war was fought primarily between the European immigrants who fled Europe because of the continual wars, social conflicts, poverty that their generations had experienced. The film lacks this perspective. The films from the great directors on war, U.S. and European, avoid the exaggerated dense combat in such a compressed colour spectrum as that of the Cold Mountain, found however in European paintings but nowhere better than in Leonardo da Vinci's Battle of Anghiari. Paintings are not films. Cold Mountain lacks distance, space and battle rhythm that is so well done in Sam Peckinpath's masterpiece Cross of Iron in the other great war films. The love story fails to reach the heights of intense emotion as other U.S. and European war films have done. The acting is good, but no better than many other films of relatively good quality. Strong coherence of a powerful current throughout the film is lacking. Through American eyes the film has nostalgic merit but as an independent work of art in the western world it lacks emotional conviction, and so sadly fails."

The two lead characters, Ada and Inman, share one or two passionate kisses and speak about ten words (if that) to each other before he goes off to war. Those must have been some GREAT words to make him leave the army to come home to her. Where is the development of a great love story? How can we feel for this couple if they were hardly ever together? Perhaps I am analyzing it too much. Perhaps I should accept their few attempts at smoldering glances as love and leave it at that.

It's not that I didn't like Nicole Kidman, it's just that prior to her work here I always thought of her as overpraised. That all changed with her performance here. It wasn't only the delivery of her lines but she also brought an intense, genuine, and robust physicality to the character that blazed with power and intensity. Jude Law and Renee Zellweger played opposite characters, one barely spoke at all (Law) and the other wouldn't stop talking (Zellweger), but both were just right here. The score, which was a combination of newly written music along with traditional American folk music and was very emotive and greatly enhanced the story.

","I should start by noting that I've never read the novel on which Anthony Minghella's ""Cold Mountain"" is based. Seeing the movie on its own, I can say that it's a good movie. The gist of it is that war damages all sides involved. Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) have vastly dissimilar experiences in the US Civil War but they both get affected by it. Even after the war, the effects will take years or even decades to heal.<br/><br/>The most interesting character in the movie is Ruby (Renée Zellweger). From a background unlike Ada's, she always has something to say. But she, like the other characters, won't remain untouched by the events surrounding her.<br/><br/>One of the points made with the movie is that not every southerner at the time was a slave-owning racist. Plenty of them rejected the plantation system and simply wanted to live their lives. It was unfortunate that the events of the ten years following the Civil War resulted in the old Confederates rising to power again and establishing the Jim Crow Laws, resulting in almost a century of institutionalized racism.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's worth seeing. Zellweger deserved her Oscar for her role."
"zardoz-13","10","1","2","25 February 2015"," Bold Mountain!!!
","""English Patient"" director Anthony Minghella died before his time. Nevertheless, he made one of the more memorable movies about the American Civil War. Adapting Charles Frazier's first novel, writer & director Minghella depicted aspects of the War Between the States that no other film else has ever detailed. First, this epic length war film unfolds with the disastrous Battle of the Crater at Petersburg in 1864. Late in the war, Union troops tunneled beneath Confederate lines and detonated explosives that they had stockpiled in a mine. Indeed, this constituted a daring maneuver, but the Union didn't take into account the consequences of such a plan and they paid dearly for their audacity. Our sympathetic protagonist, Inman (Jude Law of ""Alfie""), is one of many Southern soldiers resting in a trench who got the surprise of their lives. Moments before the explosion, a rabbit tears through their trench and not long afterward the charges ignited and blew up the area. The spectacle of the explosion is truly incredible. Afterward, Union troops poured into the crater as they charged Southern lines, but the rebels trapped them in the crater. ""Cold Mountain"" not only deals with the battlefront, but also it concerns the home front. After Inman and his friends enthusiastically march off to war, some of the most notorious citizens, led by Teague (Ray Winstone of ""Beowulf""), establish a Home Guard. The Home Guard has the right to enter anybody's home if they suspect the occupants are housing deserters, and they may even be able to confiscate the property. Teague and his evil henchman, including Boise (Charlie Hunnam of TV's ""Sons of Anarchy""), exploit these opportunities for their monetary gain, too.<br/><br/>Aside from these two little seen events, Minghella assembled a strong stellar cast. As Ada Monroe, the refined daughter of the widowed Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland of ""M.A.S.H.""), Nicole Kidman is a young lady who has been raised like an aristocrat in Charleston, South Carolina, and has led an insular life. She doesn't know any practical to do, except play the piano. The Reverend Monroe left Charleston for reasons concerning his declining health. When they arrive in Cold Mountain, Ada meets Inman while his friends and he are erecting Reverend Monroe's church. Ada and Inman mingle now and then, but they never indulge themselves in hugs and kisses until the day that Inman must depart for war. After the opening Petersburg battle, Minghella shifts back and forth between Ada and Inman. Ada's father dies and she struggles to survive on a farm that she knows nothing about until her neighbors send her a laborer, Ruby (Renée Zellweger) who gets everything back in order for Ada and teaches her how to survive. Meantime, Inman leaves a hospital and deserts. He spends most of his time on foot avoiding groups of Home Front horsemen. Along the way, he encounters a hypocritical preacher, Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who has impregnated an African-American slave woman and plans to murder her. Inman thwarts the minister's plans and compels him to suffer the wrath of his congregation. Miraculously, Veasey escapes and stumbles across Inman later during his flight. ""Cold Mountain"" qualifies as first-class from fade-in to fade-out, with a top-notch supporting cast, including Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Brendan Gleeson, Giovanni Ribisi, Katy Baker, and Lucas Black. No expense appears to have been overlooked by Minghella in this impressive $79-million production that was partially lensed on location in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. If you consider yourself a Civil War fan, you should enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, as an afterward of sorts to my comment about the Civil War and this film, historian Gary W. Gallagher cites Minghella from an interview about the director's sentiments about the Civil War and its relevance to ""Cold Mountain."" Minghella words can be found in Gallagher's book ""Causes Won, Lost, & Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know About The Civil War."" Says Minghella, ""This film is not a history lesson. It doesn't exist to stand in for a study of a real event. Rather, it tries to cast light on some circumstances which surround any war . . . . If I thought I was making a Civil War film, then I wouldn't have taken this project on."""

","Cold Mountain is an excellent story of how the Civil War affected everyone from the soldiers who fought, to their loved ones who were waiting at home for them. Cold Mountain also drove home the point that the Civil War tore families apart and left no real winners, as is apparent in the end of the film. This film also brings to light the point of view of the South during the Civil War, which is not as common as the north's side being shown; at least in my experience. It was interesting to see that Inman, a Southerner from North Carolina, did not believe in the South's cause, yet he chose to fight. I guess the director has a little bit of a Northern sentiment. I definitely thought that Ada's progression from dainty lady to tough farmer/outdoors- woman was realistic given the circumstances, although her hair was always a bit too perfect. I thought that the ending of the movie was fitting. The Civil War left no victors, and that had to include Inman and Ada. Cold Mountain was, in my opinion, an excellent film that showed the brutalities of the Civil War."

","This film not only exemplifies the art of ""love at first sight"", but also demonstrates the living conditions among men and women during the time of the Civil War. After the passing of her father, Ada Monroe, an upperclass young woman living in North Carolina, must learn how to survive on her own with the help of Ruby Thewes. On the contrary, Inman escapes from the war in an attempt to reunite with the love of his life, Ada. He takes on the highly dangerous journey home to Cold Mountain with many tough and oddly interesting obstacles along the way. 'Cold Mountain' is the perfect combination of a twisted love story and the sustainment of individuals in a deficient environment. For those who are interested in what life was truly like during the Civil War, and those who enjoy a little spark of romance, this is the perfect film for you! I would highly suggest viewing this particular movie. You will LOVE it! It's worth the consideration."

","Before the war, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrive in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. She immediately falls for Inman (Jude Law) and they become sweethearts. In 1864, Union sappers set off a large charge under the Confederate trenches outside of Petersburg where Inman is stationed. Union soldiers charge into the crater and are trapped under heavy Confederate fire. Inman is injured by friendly fire. After reading a letter from Ada, he deserts to go back to Cold Mountain. Meanwhile Ada's father dies and she is unable to work the farm alone without slaves. She is hounded by a home guard soldier. Her neighbor Swangers (Kathy Baker) sends her Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to help.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a very impressive battle. It is one of the grittiest vision of the ugliness of war. After that, the movie depends on the romance. The overwrought melodramatic romance doesn't strike me with any heat. It is literally the proverbial love at first sight. In great film romances, they spend a little time building to that point. It is usually time well spent. This is no Scarlett and Butler. In fact, Nicole Kidman makes me want to ring her neck like that rooster. The Old South of Cold Mountain before the war is a beautiful lush gentle place with few references to slavery. I guess that's fine although they mention that the Monroes let go of their slaves. It seems like a good thing to put on screen. Inman's journey seems fascinating but very random. Renée Zellweger may have won the Academy Awards but it's a bracing performance next to Kidman's. Overall, there are interesting scenes but most of all, I find the romance rather uninspired. This is no 'Gone With the Wind'."

But when her father passes away and she gets put in a dire situation she has to fend for herself. Until Ruby Thewes gets in her life and is my favorite character in this movie thanks to the script and a outstanding performance by Renée Zellweger. This movie has quite a cast and all the actors and actresses puts on some memorable performances even if some of them hardly has many scenes. This movie starts out kinda slow but as it progresses it becomes more and more compelling and a bit haunting because of the realistic and well told story direction. And because of the realism and the struggles of the two lovers to be with one another becomes strong to the point I felt they really earned it.

"axlrhodes","7","1","2","22 July 2012"," A solid tale of love and survival with some questionable casting choices.
","Based on a book by Charles Frazier and adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, Cold Mountain is a broad, ambitious love story set against a backdrop of the American civil war (1861–1865). It has a cast that you imagine being assembled at Cannes, as almost every character we encounter on the journey (all 148mins of it) is instantly recognisable, and therein lies my beef. For any period piece brimming with big names, there's an inherent distraction from the material when each time we're introduced to a new Hollywood star. I found myself holding my breath as to whether he or she had the ability to adapt to the landscape of the time with an authentic southern accent. What's worse is when my fears are realised and actors like Ray Winstone, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman allow their accents to slip resulting in a character/audience detatchment that need never have been there. I understand the box office benefits to having star names dotted all over your poster, but in this case, a few more indigenous folks wouldn't have gone amiss. Casting issues aside, the film looks beautiful. Clearly, this is an ambitious piece and fittingly the cinematography is epic and sprawling. There's striking visual metaphors too. Apart from in the opening scenes, we see very little of the actual conflicts, although what we do see is brutal and bloody. Instead of witnessing soldiers dying, we see the crops on the farms and the unattended fields going to waste amid the absence of farmers to tend to them. It's symbolic of a country that was tearing itself apart from the inside. Essentially though, this is personal love story, but within that it's also a survival tale and the film stands and falls on buying into that love. I'm pleased to say that i felt it worked. Casting issues aside, such is the weight of what's happening in the background coupled with the obstacles our couple have to overcome to try to be together, that it's hard to deny some sort of emotional investment. That said, the initial set-up of the relationship, crucial to understanding and believing in the central love, could have been more played upon. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress yet here she lacks a sense of warmth. The times she shares the screen with a lively Renée Zellweger, she almost fades into the scenery. Additionally, Natalie Portman, in a brief role, brings real humanity and weight to proceedings leaving Kidman, the main star playing very much third fiddle. I'd have to say that although Cold Mountain is long and flawed, the backdrop events really help carry the film through some odd casting choices to help it become a good, but not great story of love's efforts to overcome the seemingly insurmountable. 3/5"

","You might just want to flip over your Civil War classic Novellas. Well this movie just does that for you. In a telling tale of love in times of war, men in times of service to country, and a women trying to cope with sudden helplessness! The ingredients are just right. This story parallels back and forth two lovers. One who goes for war and hopes to get back home to this other who is touched by some feeling that she is ready to wait till he comes back. What is really beautiful are the emotions of this young man in upholding hope of reaching back just to try and tell her that she wants to marry her. Amidst the ravages of war, the experiences in those times of men running away from their cavalry and being declared a criminal on charges of treason; is handled superbly. The subtlety of the multiple stories while the protagonist travels back is amazing. If one is really not impressed, then there are more on the other side where the female protagonist tries to uphold herself. An upper class petite girl faces the hardship she never expects. There is where the icing of the story also lies (Renée Zellweger). For all the depth, it finishes beautifully.<br/><br/>Hence a 7.5 out of 10."

","I had read the book before seeing the movie, and also listened to the unabridged audio book read by the author. I found it's story astounding. But the movie....it became a discombobulated contortion right before my eyes.<br/><br/>Ada was a brunette, and a snotty little uppity-chick from Charleston whose sole intent at times seemed to be shoving people away, or saying something outrageous just to shock those within earshot. Inman and Ada knew of each other, but their encounters were few. Inman told Sally Swanger that he'd ""clear an acre of new ground for an introduction..."" to Ada. After the intro, there was little said, with Inman finding himself lost for words and staring down into his hat. Ada asked if that collection of ""dullards"" had put him up to it, and ask how he thought it was going. Inman said ""...like picking up a chestnut burr, thus far."" The book is far more satisfying, and far more of a look into the characters of Ada and Ruby, and Inman, and Sally and Esco, and all the other rich characters.<br/><br/>The movie is a swill-trough of poorly matched character-representations, all due to a poorly written script and simple-minded attempt to capitalize on a truly extraordinary novel.<br/><br/>Rene Z. should have been allowed to purchase the rights also, so she could make a semi-faithful MINI-SERIES that would actually allow the audience to see how Ada's coming into her own (from a socialite to a ""person"" of substance) shaped her into a much better person, with Ruby's guidance and ""foot in the back"".<br/><br/>I'm still bummed out about how this wonderful story was so recklessly mangled...."

","I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, thought not quite so much as ""The English Patient"" (a modern-day classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I don't agree at all, and she does well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give it their all and convince. Ada's journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. Zellweger at first seems all wrong as Ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented Irish actor in an early bit part, and Natalie Portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. It's a pity that in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" she's so inadequate."

","This is actually a very decent film. It centers around the cold war and has a beautiful cast with Jude Law (could have been a bit better) Nicole Kidman (very well done) and Renee Zelweeger (best of the cast who gives 100% and deserved the Oscar). Jude Law portrays Inman. He is a laborer in Cold Mountain N.C. He soon meets the mayor's daughter played by Nicole Kidman. The obvious occurs and they fall in love but only do they share a kiss just as Inman is about to leave for war. Five years go past and neither forget each other but it is clear that they are beginning to lose hope. Then when everyone is on the verge of tears from this very emotional story, in comes Renee. The funny, somewhat retarded farmer who helps Nicole through managing her farm shortly after Nicole's dad dies. She loosens the tension a bit but creates some new chemistry with Nicole Kidman. Both are fine actresses and they did well together. The ending is climatic and the audience cannot hold back there tears."

It's a flawed, but highly entertaining piece of work that leans heavily on it's terrific musical score, cinematography, and cast of supporting characters.<br/><br/>With an unnecessary two and a half hour running time, ""Cold Mountain"" has plenty of time to present minor characters played by familiar faces.

","This is a really well executed film. There are some scenes that are absolutely just perfect, like the main war sequence. I think it is beautifully filmed and the story is OK but the characters make it. I particularly like the smaller characters as played by Brendan Gleeson, Renee Zellweger and Philip Seymour Hoffman is, as always, amazing. The two female leads are actors that annoy me as much as they impress me but have most definitely impressed this time around. The one problem I speak of is Jude Law. There are any number of great actors that could have played the part and they wouldn't have even had to fake an accent. By no measure does he ruin the film and actually does a good job through most of the film. It's when he and the Nicole Kidman character aren't going at it that the relationship is farcical. Their debates as to whether they are behaving appropriately as a couple and their attempts to outdo one another in the ""most poetic expression of love"" competition were unnecessary.<br/><br/>The casting was great but almost unnecessary. As was the marketing ploy of the bit part player Jack White, who performs the musical parts well but acts badly. Other personnel include Cillian Murphy, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi who do really well but, again in bit parts. Ray Winstone is unrecognisable as ""the baddie"" and plays the part really well. Charlie Hunnam is someone I'd never heard of before but I'll be keeping an eye on, pure evil.<br/><br/>Overall a very good watch and good value for money with over 2 1/2 hours entertainment."

"yxcool","7","1","2","29 March 2005"," Cold Mountain tells a story happened during American Civil War:
","Cold Mountain tells a story happened during American Civil War: Young Inman(Jude Law) fell in love with beautiful Ada(Nicole Kidman) in a place called Cold Mountain. But Inman decided to leave and fight with the Confederate Army when the civil war broke out. As the years pass, Ada struggles on her deceased father's farm with Ruby (Renne Zellweger), a doughty girl who assisted Ada along way, they had to work extremely hard to survive from the harsh environment and protect themselves from the Home Guards bullies who left behind the war. Meanwhile injured Inman received a letter from Ada and he realized that he had enough pointless slaughter, so he tried to go back to his spiritual land- Cold Mountain and beloved Ada. Inman had to walk through the dangerous and unstable south, cross the mountains without let the pursuing Union Army find him. On the way of his unforgettable and perilous odyssey, he met a lone line of interesting people who suffered from the war in different ways. When finally Inman arrived to Cold Mountain and married Ada, an irreparable tragedy happened: Inman lost his life during a conflict with the Home Guards, but Ada faced her miserable future bravely with her friends. The movie clearly expressed its theme- the ruthlessness of the brutal war by showing audience two different parts' stories: the journey of Inman and Ada's hard life back in Cold Mountain. Examples: On the way home, Inman suffered from starvation, injuries and frustration; Back in Cold Mountain, Ada the genteel intellectual had to face the real world on her own for the very first time, all she could do was to create the refuge herself or to die. The story contains some interesting characters that have distinctive personalities. E.g. a beautiful and well educated young lady was forced to run a farm, something she knows absolutely nothing, she was waiting to die in the beginning, was fortunately saved scrappy Ruby. And then she turns 180 and shown great determination to survive. There are some people like Ada in the real life: could be very depressive in a special moment, but when once activated by someone or something, they could change the way of attitude and do really well. Obviously, Ada's special personality made the story more interesting and extend-able; the next good example should be Ruby, she has a resisting personality, it shown by her dialogs like ""oh, I am better than any men!"" and actress' great performance like her complex emotion when found her father has been shot. So Ruby was also an important role of connecting and extending stories. The movie used some remarkable techniques such as the repeating of flashback in the beginning, it shows the huge difference between the life in Cold Mountain and the life that Inman is having in the war. It worked with actor's incredible performance to made audience feel stronger of character's situation and created a sense of horror which could immediately draw audience' attention to the film. It also symbols how serious the movie is; cross cutting has been largely used through out the movie, it created the special structure of the film: starts with flash back, and then tells two different parts of story at the same time by kept cutting forth and back. The director used this structure was probably it deferred to the original form the story: the novel Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier. And it also successfully reinforced the meaning of the movie: on both side, they were all suffering but not giving up.<br/><br/>There were also some impressive scenes in the movie: Scene one: when Ruby's father realized that Home Guards were came to kill them, he chose to play and sing a real nice song and hopes to soften their hearts. The pace of the scene was so slow in the beginning but was sudden turns to fast when the singing plan fails- they shot two members of the band. After that, the pace slowed right down and long still shots were used again to emphasis the death. it made the scene so shocking! Scene two: In the last part, whole ""family"" was sitting around the table, they were the survivors and everything seemed great. But from their faces, audiences could easily tell that none of them is happy, because they've all lost something from the war, things those will never come back. It once again strongly reinforced the powerful meaning of the movie and highlighted the main theme: ruthlessness of the war.<br/><br/>Over all, I think it is a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it. Excellent acting performance, vivid personalities of characters, refined camera shots all linked by a nice storyline. The only regret I left was the pace of whole movie; it seemed a bit too slow to tell such a story. But anyway, this is good movie to watch. Recommended to everyone who interests in the movie."

","I never bothered to see Cold Mountain in the theater, because the style and subject matter didn't off-hand appeal to me. Still, I felt I had to see it eventually, so I thought I'd give it a try now.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, but I also understand why it has many negative reviews. It surely isn't very engaging, especially not in the beginning. I do think it gets better and better as it goes along, with a notable improvement as soon as Renee Zellweger appears. Natalie Portman was great, also.<br/><br/>But although I think Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful in this movie, it does start off being rather dull. As it proceeds, however, one starts being caught up in the terrors of the civil war and the way the land was left largely without men, because the few ones left - even the old ones - would be shot by the patrolling deserter hunters. It was a momentary total breakdown of civilization. I don't know exactly how realistically this movie portrays the situation, but I assume it's very realistic indeed.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was bittersweet. I was quite annoyed that Inman managed to return only to get shot dead by the last ranger - it seemed to invalidate all the hardships he'd gone through on his quest back to Ada. But the final scenes, with their daughter, Ruby's father and husband and their children, and the beautiful music they played, actually managed to restore my faith in the beauty and continuity of life (in the context of the movie's story). It shouldn't all ride on single individuals; what really matters is that life, in a broader general sense, goes on. It is life itself that matters, and we are all part of it. Every individual is somehow present in every other individual, in every blade of grass, in the land itself. This beauty; this appreciation for all life, is greater than the love for a single person, because it spurs those who survive to live on. And this movie's ending actually manages to convey that. So the ending was very fulfilling to me after all.<br/><br/>Still, the entertainment value of the movie wasn't great, which is why I will not rate it higher than a 7 out of 10."

","Anthony Minghella is a master of the old fashioned love story. His films do not house cynicism nor bad intentions. His two previous efforts, 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and 'The English Patient,' were so good I had them at the top of my top ten lists for their respective years. In the case of 'The English Patient,' I believe it even outdid 'Fargo.' The classic beat the absurd.<br/><br/>'Cold Moutain' is different, it is a long film. Not particularly its running length, which I don't surmise is much longer or shorter than 'Ripley' or 'Patient.' It is long because many of the actions in the film are not entirely that entertaining.<br/><br/>We start toward the end of the Civil War. At a bombed out confederate strong-hold we meet Inman, not so different from the other soldiers. It is as if by happenstance that we should immerse ourselves into his life rather than anyone else out there. Inman, we learn, has been separated from his love, Ada. Although as we soon find out, Ada and Inman hardly know each other. It was fate, or love at first sight, that brought the two together. It was bloodshed and war that tore them apart.<br/><br/>In ways this seems hokey, and it is. Minghella had done so well in his other films to stay away from sappy, in this one he dives right into it. As the story moves along we understand their feelings deeper, and thus some sappiness goes away, but to many it will be too heavy to bare.<br/><br/>Inman deserts his comrades knowing the end is coming. He is far more interested in meeting up with his Ada, though the journey will be perilous. As he leaves, the Confederate Army everywhere begins to hunt down deserters and those who let them stay on their land. Inman's journey becomes an 1860s Oddysey through the American south. Along the way he meets an amorous preacher, runaway slaves, a widow and her baby, as well as your standard country cabin full of horny women.<br/><br/>These stories are okay but lack any cohesiveness, it is the same problem that faced 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'. 'O Brother,' however, was an all-around better film, the pace quicker and the characters better situated. All this having been said, the guilty truth is that I liked it. I tried reading the book at least four times and could not get past the first few chapters. I figured the movie had no chance.<br/><br/>There is plenty wrong with it, but the gorgeous cinematography and exquisite acting made the film sweet enough to swallow. Listen to the names: Jude Law (as Inman), Nicole Kidman (as Ada), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Natalie Portman. But above all, the year's best scene stealer was Renee Zellweger, a character straight out of the back-woods to help a bewildered and dainty Ada survive on the farm. The humor and life she brings to the film is enough to lift it from the despair of the rest.<br/><br/>There is enough wrong with 'Cold Mountain' to make it a bad film. It is a credit to the fine director and gifted cast that they were able to lift a diamond out of this rough. *** out of ****"

Only it had experienced the death and blood. Did every thing come back original appearance again? This is a problem which is worthy to think deeply."

","This is one of the rare films that you are able to watch two times in a row. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman give outstanding performances. Though I am not a big fan of Renee Zellweger she did give a great performance. Director Anthony Minghella who brought us such excellent films as The English Patient and The Talented Mr. Ripley delivers yet another remarkable film. Though Jude Law and Renee Zellweger received Academy Award nominations the film was shamelessly overlooked for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay nominations. One of my favorite actresses of all time Natalie Portman gives a stand-out performance. This film is a must."

","Great movie! <br/><br/>Cold Mountain is one of the best movies I have seen recently.Very good performances by all the cast and well directed by Minghella. It tells brilliantly the story of simple people who get caught in events beyond their control. Of course war is not an enjoyable subject, and this movie is so crude and realistic sometimes that you really can see why just a good memory can sustain someone during difficult times. I don't understand why so many people are surprised by the love between Inman and Ada. As her father apologized to her for bringing her up the way he did, we came to understand that she is not a normal southern belle raised to marry and have kids. She lived immersed in books and had only her father a companion. So is it so surprising that she feels so attracted to a young, handsome man, so sensitive that manages to pass so much with just his eyes? She is just responding to what she believes he feels for her. They barely know each other but in the world they are living in the middle of a senseless war (does any war have any sense?) the attraction they feel for each other is what keep them as a whole. What could they discover after being together for a while? Was their love real or just desire? Could they learn to appreciate one another after what they have been through? Maybe the ending was ""fair"" to the characters. At least they had a moment of peace and happiness after so much horror.<br/><br/>When I read some comments regarding Ada's appearance, I wonder if we saw the same movie. Has anyone remember the state she was in just before Ruby's arrival? Or when they were building a fence? And I don't recall seeing Ada wearing any elaborate coiffure by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The only negative thing about the movie is the tasteless scene of the whore house. There was a bit of exaggeration on that. And congratulation to Rennè for the Oscar, she really deserved it!"

","Inman is a laborer living in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. He is a quiet man, content with his life of solitude. When Ada and her minister father move into Cold Mountain, he is instantly smitten. Ada is immediately attracted to Innman as well, and after only a few meetings they have fallen madly in love with each other. <br/><br/>But they never get a chance to form a real relationship, because Inman is soon sent off to fight in the Civil War.Inman is gone for several years, and Ada continues to hope for his return and send him letters. While in a hospital bed, Inman receives a letter from Ada; ""If you are fighting,"" it reads, ""quit fighting. If you are marching, quit marching. Come back to me.""<br/><br/>And Inman does - he gets out of his bed, and sneaks away in the night, heading back to Cold Mountain. He treks through the wilderness, avoiding the army (he is a deserter, after all) and running into several interesting characters, including an adulterous preacher and a widowed mother. Ada, meanwhile, is having trouble maintaining the farm after the death of her father. <br/><br/>So Ruby Thewes, a strong-willed southern woman, is sent to help out. Upon arriving, the first thing Ruby does (other than berate Ada), is rip the head off of a troublesome rooster. Soon, the farm is nearing its former glory. But not all is well. The head of the local ""home guards"" has his eye on Ada and her land. <br/><br/>Things continue to get worse when Ruby's father, another deserter, and his band of musicians (including a surprisingly good Jack White, of the ""White Stripes"") show up for a visit. Everything soon falls apart, but soon things begin to look good for Ada. With Inman on his journey home, with Ada tending to her land, at times things will look dim.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is superb. Notably Renee. She received an Oscar, and rightfully so. Jude Law's performance is also Oscar worthy. Kidman's how ever is nothing special, as usual. Cold Mountain has ""epic"" written all over it. Although, I didn't get that feeling with it. It is a good movie. Don't get me wrong. I didn't want to see it. (Long story).<br/><br/>What makes the film fall short of perfection is that it at times drifts away from Inmans quest. Making it confusing, and sometimes annoying. It looses focus quickly on Inman's quest, his journey home and that hurts the film. It relies too much on supporting characters. By supporting I mean characters that last no more than 5-10 minutes. No importance really to a good portion of them. <br/><br/>***1/2/*****"

","Anthony Minghella is a genius! He loves to do these complex love stories when love is at its deepest, when passion is at its greatest, and when heartbreak is at its most touching. Ada Monroe (the great beauty Nicole Kidman) is a shy Southern belle and the daughter of the local minister in the small town of Cold Mountain, North Carolina. At the beginning of the Civil War, she meets the equally shy and deep Inman (striking performance by the handsome and great Jude Law) and they fall in love. But it's not like what we would expect: Southern belle playing hard to get or the usual Civil War soap opera. Inman and Ada are so in love its crushing and their love is expressed through their looks, the awkward moments, and the passionate first kiss they share before he marches on to the war. The film dances between the past and the present, between the war fronts and the home front. We see through historical accuracy the horrors of war and the toll it takes on humanity and of society. We see the Yankees raping and pillaging the women left behind by their Confederate husbands. And we see the harsh struggles that those on the home front must endure. While Inman lays injured he begins to see the reality of war and its illusion. He is the classic hero defined by Joseph Campbell: on a journey where he is tested by lust, vengeance, and faith. He endures starvation, pain, and harsh weather. He is a deserter and a target for death by treason. But his only hope and his only reason is love. Love in all its purity and in all of its crushing power to be with the woman he loves: Ada. Meanwhile, Ada herself waits for Inman and waits with agony and worry that he may never return to her or may never have loved her. She struggles with poverty, the possibility of losing her home to thieving opportunists like Col. Teague (great performance by Ray Winstone), and borderline poverty. And then Ruby Thewes, (Oscar-winning performance by Renee Zellwegger) a tough, no-nonsense, and strong young woman who befriends Ada and together the two women learn from each other. Ruby teaches Ada how to farm and keep busy while Ada teaches Ruby about culture and love. Together they are like sisters fighting off the crows and the weather. Anthony Minghella uses the formula used in another complex love story called ""The English Patient."" He is not a filmmaker who will go for the girl meets boy and they live happily ever after soap opera or teen slick. He is fascinated by love stories where words are said at the last moment and when love is at its greatest in times of war. There are so many moments in the film, but my favorites: Inman and the old woman (Eileen Atkins) who nurses him back to health and sends him his journey. Inman and the young Confederate widow (a brief, but touching performance by Natalie Portman). He needs shelter and she is alone with her baby. The scene where she asks him to sleep next to her is so poignant and touching. She is lonely and in mourning of her lost love; He is in search of the woman he left behind. It was scene not to be in any sexual matter, but it was scene of comfort and of true humanity at its finest. But like any other war movie there are also moments of horror: ""Patrols"" on the home fronts torturing and killing their own people in search of deserters. Union soldiers terrorizing widows and families of the Confederate army (Natalie Portman has an agonizing scene when three Union soldiers force her to watch her sick baby being exposed to the cold in order for them to get food and to eventually rape her) ""Cold Mountain"" is a beautiful film because it shows both the beautiful and the ugly sides of the human race. The film is also a show of love at its greatest."

","Aside from the fact that most people apparently are not cerebral enough, nor paying attention to details, the comments I have seen lack imagination in the extreme. When I see a movie I suspend disbelief and become absorbed with the plot and characters. I am, however, more disappointed to discover that there are a large number of people whose attention span does not go beyond 90 minutes.<br/><br/>As to the film, I have seen it about 12 times which gave me the opportunity to watch the details and still I am compelled by this film. I have also read the book, which indeed does not match the film. However, the details that are added to the characters are worth the time to read it.<br/><br/>I have to agree that Nichole's acting is shallow and that the development of her character seems lacking. As you watch Inman from the beginning to the end you see a remarkable change in his carriage, looks and demeanor that is stunning to watch. He ages in accordance with what he experiences. As you watch Ada, she does little more than change her clothing and it is obvious that makeup is performing all the acting when she should be blushing.<br/><br/>Having seen both of these actors in other movies, I am very impressed with Jude Law and his desire to hone his craft. Nichole seems to be riding her sexuality to the end and I fear she will never go beyond that to make a real actress.<br/><br/>I give this film a resounding 10/10 rating."

","I just watched to movie for the first time a few weeks ago. Loved it! Have watched it 3 times. Usually do not like war movies, but this one has a breathe-taking love story that goes along with it. Could watch it over and over. Love Ruby and the look in Inman's eyes when he looks at Ada. Since the movie was based on a book, I thought, the books are always better, I am going to read it. Got the book and HATED it. There is so much that is different in the book - all things that just mess up the story! How they meet is different, the town and people are different. Throughout the book Inman and Ada hardly ever say anything about each other. They are suppose to be long lost loves returning to each other/waiting, longing for each other. In the book Inman is just returning to his home. Ada is always talking and being reminded about her dead dad - not about Inman! Ada only writes to Inman 3 times in the book, and there is no breath-taking kiss before he leaves for war <br/><br/>If you are thinking about reading this book - skip it - watch the movie again! :)"
"hokiemo","7","1","2","23 August 2004"," Worth Watching
","This is a good but not excellent film. To begin, at 152 minutes, the film is too long. I could have easily cut out 30 minutes of the film with none the wiser. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law do well with their scripts, but are they too old for their parts? I haven't read the book ""Cold Mountain"" so maybe their characters are suppposed to be in their thirties. I have no problem if the characters are supposed to be in their thirties, but it would have been interesting if this had brought out more in the film as people used to get married much younger.<br/><br/>Further, I think parts showing Ada messing up domestic chores should have been included, a bit like Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind"". Ada Monroe mentions her naivity in farm and house work, but adding some humorous learning experiences for Ada to a somewhat sad film could have added more realism to her transition from fair haired maiden to skilled markswoman.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not a prude, but the sex scene between Ada and Inman in my opinion is softly p*rnographic and unnecessary. I think more awkwardness would have occurred between Ada and Inman for their first time yet Ada appears to be a skilled and unhibited lover. I think less should have been shown and more imagined by the audience.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger is excellent as Ruby and most believable as her character. Lesser known actor Brendon Gleeson as Ruby's father also does a fantastic job in his role.<br/><br/>The film's cinematography is excellent and the scenery gorgeous. Overall, a good film worth watching, but it could use some improvements."

","When I saw Cold Mountain, I felt that there was a costume party, with Nicole Kidman coming as a beautiful Southern belle and Renee Zellweger coming as a poor mountain girl (with bathtub white teeth and lipstick, which woman did not wear in that era). Despite all this, Zellweger was probably the best thing going for this film, that and the wonderful scenery.<br/><br/>The worst thing going was the history misinformation. The mountain areas of the South were not rebel hotbeds. The most mountainous part of Virginia seceded from VIRGINIA, and named itself West Virginia and fought for the union. The mountainous, eastern third of Tennessee was solidly with the North also, and would have seceded from Tennessee if not held captive by the rest of the state. This is because there was little cotton grown in the mountains and therefore very few slaves. There WERE some Confederate-leaning counties in the mountains of North Carolina, but areas like that weren't solidly pro-Southern, and there was a lot of the neighbor-against-neighbor thing going on. The anti- secession sentiment in the mountains was accurately addressed (albeit briefly) in the book."

","I won't bother you with the plot as it's been done so many times, you might as well not rent this DVD as I did.  I will bother you with my reaction to this highly anticipated DVD that I actually bought,  without seeing it. Mistake!!!!<br/><br/>It turned me off in every way.  Director Anthony Minghella seems to favor films with heavy handed suffering and death.  Slow death, actually.   In TALENTED MR RIPLEY and ENGLISH PATIENT.  No sympathy for any of the characters in spite of good acting from Jude Law and Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Minghella adapted this screenplay from a book by Charles Frazier.  I wonder what Mr. Frazier's reaction to the film was.  Haven't read the book to compare.<br/><br/>So much slaughtering of animals and human beings to the point that I was screaming at the TV set to end the bloodshed.  The scene with the perfect loving look of the little goat with the old bag who owned it, stroking the sweet face then killing the innocent animal was too much.  I turned off the TV and kept the film rolling without watching, long enough to let that scene pass by.  In fact I found myself turning the set off many times during the film's playing, simply because I just didn't want to see any more animals slaughtered, abused and/or butchered.  I don't see entertainment in this at all.  You accept the killing of people as you know really it's only acting. But I do question if those animals were actually killed for the sake of the movie.<br/><br/>Then there's the ending, which totally ruined the picture for me.  After all that suffering and struggle to do what they did (or the author intended) was totally unacceptable to me.   I hated the ending and was sorry I had paid even a dime for the DVD.  Now I have a copy that will sit on my shelf for I have no intention to view it again.  I might try to sell it on Ebay.<br/><br/>As to the acting, Jude Law was wonderful.  I have always liked this actor and never stop being amazed at his work.  More Jude Law!  Renee Zellweger, Academy Award and all, also was very good.  I didn't like her in CHICAGO, but loved her in this.  She brought a great vitality to the film.  Too bad she doesn't come into the scene till half way through.  Nicole Kidman I have always liked in most of what she does, but felt this was a bit of wrong casting.  I also felt there was no warmth between the two stars in the love department.  Too bad as they are both such beautiful people.  Minghella was too busy getting the gore instead of the romance.<br/><br/>The distinguished Donald Sutherland (it's always great to see him still working) had a small role as Nicole's father, a Reverend.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, an actor I have never liked, manages to keep proving to me his bad acting.  He continues to give terrible performances.  I am told his LONG DAYS JOURNEY INTO NIGHT on Broadway, was as bad.<br/><br/>Please, Mr. Minghella, stop directing these horrendous and bad taste films. On a range of 1-10 I give this a 3 for the three stars of the picture and their attempt to make a long boring script into a believable picture."

Law and Kidman have really been lazy and really been making much money without effort.

"JamesHitchcock","8","1","2","13 February 2004"," A Confederate Odyssey
","Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>Ever since `Birth of a Nation' and `Gone with the Wind', Hollywood has tended to be over-indulgent towards the Confederacy, playing down the evils of slavery and treating the rebel forces as, at best, romantic heroes and, at the very worst, misguided but nevertheless honourable. `Cold Mountain', which tells the story of a deserter from the Confederate forces during the American Civil War, is a welcome exception to this tendency. The central character Inman, who comes from a remote mountainous area of North Carolina, joins the Confederate army in a fit of bravado along with many other young men from his village. He deserts it not out of cowardice but because he has come to realise that the cause for which he is fighting is a hopeless one, both in the sense that it is doomed to failure and in the sense that it is morally worthless. There is no `romance of the Old South' in this film. The Civil War is shown for what it was- a grim and (on the part of the South) desperately defensive struggle, fought for much of the time in trenches and prefiguring the later stalemate of the First World War. The battle scenes with which the film opens are particularly graphic and dramatic and vividly convey the hardships suffered by the soldiers.<br/><br/>After deserting, Inman tries to return to his native village of Cold Mountain and to his sweetheart Ada. The film recounts his many adventures along the way, intercut with scenes showing Ada's life in his absence. (There are echoes of `The Odyssey' in this tale of a soldier facing dangers as he attempts to make his way back to his loved one). Both Inman and Ada face great difficulties. The greatest danger to Inman is not so much the Northern armies as the `Home Guard', a band of Confederate irregulars who ruthlessly hunt down deserters and others they regard as disloyal to their cause. Ada's greatest difficulty is that she is a genteel, well-bred city girl who knows little about farming or housekeeping and finds it difficult to cope with life in a remote village, especially after the death of her clergyman father. She is helped to survive, however, by her friend Ruby, an uneducated but capable and practical young woman.<br/><br/>It is interesting that in a film set in America and dealing with one of the central episodes of American history neither of the lead roles is played by an American; Inman is played by the British Jude Law and Ada by the Australian Nicole Kidman. There are a number of other non-Americans in key roles; Ada's father is played by the Canadian Donald Sutherland, and Teague, the villainous leader of the Home Guard, by another Englishman, Ray Winstone. The Israeli Natalie Portman has a role as Sara, a young widow whom Inman meets on his journey. The director, of course, is an Englishman of Italian descent, and the film, despite its ostensible setting, was actually filmed in Rumania. Filmmaking seems to be becoming more international, even when the film concerns an American subject.<br/><br/>Nicole Kidman's acting in this part was a pleasant surprise to me. I had previously thought of her as the cinema's equivalent of the duck-billed platypus- happy only in her native Australian habitat- and she has her share of horrors on her CV (`Far and Away', `Batman Forever', the dull `The Peacemaker' and the truly dreadful `Moulin Rouge'). `Cold Mountain' is the first film in which I have seen her since `Flirting' in the early 1990s in which I have felt she was completely at her ease. I am not familiar with the dialects of the Carolinas, so I am not worried about whether her accent was entirely accurate. What matters is that she gives a convincing and touching performance. Jude Law's performance as Inman was adequate but not especially brilliant, and I found his Best Actor nomination surprising. There were good cameos from Portman (a welcome return to form after her `Star Wars' experiences) and from Philip Seymour Hoffman as a lustful preacher. The real star, however, was Renee Zellwegger as Ruby, a character who is ignorant but sensible and crude but sympathetic. Her Best Supporting Actress nomination is one that is well deserved.<br/><br/>The other striking feature of the film is its magnificent cinematography, particularly the shots of the mountain scenery. Although the title of the film is taken from the name of the village, it is an appropriate one in that much of the story is set in wintertime, and the memorable scenes of the beautiful but bleak snowbound landscapes are a vivid symbol of one of the coldest, bleakest periods in American history. This is not the best film of 2003 (in my view both `Return of the King' and `Girl with a Pearl Earring' were better), but it is nonetheless an excellent one, a testimony to the human capacity for both cruelty and hope. 8/10."

","Many 'Lord of the Rings' fans seem to be blinded in their votes for most likely film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. 'The Lord of the Rings' series has not won before and it is not likely that it will win this time because of it's content and predecessors. The Academy have never given Best Picture to Fantasy picture and they have never given it to a sequal unless the first installment won (Godfather part II should've been Chinatown) and it doesn't look like they'll do it this time.<br/><br/>'Cold Mountain' is a sweeping romantic epic and a five star visual acheivement with stand-out performances and stunning music. Even though it is not as critically loved as LOTR it is exactly the period romantic tales that the Academy love and how can this Film be snubbed when it has the Oscar giant Miramax throughing 100% of it's support behind it this year (They won last year when they had three film's to support: 'Chicago'(won)'Gangs of New York' and 'The Hours'. It also has a previous Oscar winner at the helm, Anthony Minghella.<br/><br/>Now to the picture itself: 'Cold Mountain'is a beautifully constructed re-entry into the great romantic epics of old (my personal favourites of which are: 'Gone with the Wind','Doctor Zhivago')The lead performances from Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are impeccable, but admittidely the supporting players slightly steal the show especially Renee Zellweger (my Best Sup. Actress pick) and Natalie Portman (I don't think she got enough rcognition for this role). The Technical sides of this film are also amazing: John Seale's cinematography, Dante Ferreti's art/set direction (should've won last year for 'Gangs'),Ann Roth's costume design, Walter Mursch's editing and most of all Gabriel Yared's amazing score (I'm listening to the soundtrack now)<br/><br/>Many people on this site have complained about the violence and sexuality, but that's what films need these days, realism (that's what it was like back then, times were tough)<br/><br/>Now for all the offended LOTR fans out there I do like the LOTR series (I thought Fellowship of the Ring would win over a beautiful mind anyday, But to all you blinded fan's out there just think was ROTR really going to be able to compete with Oscar's fav. genre, Romantic Epics ???<br/><br/>And I just think that Cold Mountain is a bigger individual acheivement while ROTR is just really a continuation (would it be so successful critically if it was the only LOTR movie released? (I think Peter Jackson should get an honorary oscar for the overall acheivement of the series rather than just a fragment of it (all be it a very impressive fragment). When you think about it the more likely choice for best picture out of the LOTR series would be FOTR because it could at least stand as a movie with a beginning and an end<br/><br/>In conclusion: Cold Mountain 9/10 The Return of the King 9/10<br/><br/>Thankyou and may the best movie win.............'Cold Mountain'"

"meeza","8","1","2","1 February 2004"," Good view of Cold Mountain!
","Almost every freeze frame of the epic `Cold Mountain' is encompassed with ravishing cinematography, an authentic art direction, and a heart-rending musical score. Those are definitely the hot properties of `Cold Mountain'. Jude Law stars as Inman, a Civil War soldier who is on an enduring journey to Cold Mountain to reunite with his love- Ada Monroe.  Ada is played by newcomer Nicole Kidman. Just a little kidman kidding!   Part of `Cold Mountain' revolves around the series of adventures that Inman is confronted with on his journey, which very much resembles `Homer's Odyssey'. The other side of the mountain focuses on Ada's desperation for her Inman to return, and the friendship she develops with the tough grassroots southern farmgirl Ruby- here played with dynamism by Renee Zellweger. Director Anthony Minghella continues to prove that he is mountains above many other directors as far as adapting epic literary works into major motion pictures. However, I must give the cold shoulder to the screenplay of  `Cold Mountain. It was a bit falsifying and way too melodramatic. Nevertheless, `Cold Mountain' is high enough with positive attributes for you to climb on to. **** Good"
"brower8","Null","1","2","31 January 2004"," Gore with the Wind (visual pun intended)
","This could have been a classic anti-war movie, but it fell short because it entered the realm of offense. I could tolerate the battle scenes at Petersburg, including even the throwing of bayonets. War is horrible, and anything less than explicit statement of its horrors is necessary. The Battle of Petersburg presaged trench warfare as practiced a half-century later in World War I.<br/><br/>This movie falls short of greatness because of all the gore not related to battle. So many people and animals are killed in gruesome ways that I had to avert my head several times. That's enough to drop this movie from an 8 to a 7 or a 6.5.<br/><br/>I like the acting of Kidman, Zellweger, Law, and Sutherland; all characterize themselves well.  Kidman and Zellweger exemplify the class divide between the elites and the 'po-white trash'; Kidman as 'Ada Monroe' is wonderfully versed in everything devoid of vocational practicality, and Zellweger, as 'Ruby Thewes', is the 'farm-smart' young woman devoid of all social graces and little book-learning; the two are perfect complements. Law convinces one that he has been betrayed by the promises of a cheap and easy victory as the war comes to the point of Confederate doom and that all that is left is the inevitable sockdolager punch into an enfeebled Confederacy. Sutherland, as Reverend Monroe (Ada's father), reminds one an many ways of the 'Gerald O'Hara' patriarch of _Gone with the Wind_.<br/><br/>The gore in part results from the villainous ""Home Guard"" enforcing its authority against deserters, Union sympathizers, escaping slaves, supporters of any of the above, and anyone with whom the Home Guard has scores to settle. This vigilante force strips all romance from the Confederacy by exposing the Confederacy as a collection of brutal police states and exposes itself as a precursor of the Ku Klux Klan, if not the Gestapo. Add to this the gruesome demises of animals, including a rooster, a goat, and a wild turkey; a rabbit nearly meets such a fate except that the Confederate soldiers in a trench chasing it get blown away in an explosion under the trench. To be sure, they all become dinner, but we don't need to see the inside of an abattoir, do we?  <br/><br/>This could have been a great movie, even the most obvious second choice to -Gone with the Wind-... if only the director could have shown some restraint in depicting death. The old Hays Code would have made this a great movie. Excess is not greatness!"

"bdotson","8","1","2","5 January 2004"," Renee Zellweger ""stole the show""?
","I just saw this film over the weekend. It is quite good! There is some amazing imagery here, and the opening battle scene was very well done. Very gritty and muddy. To bad there weren't more battle scenes, but this is not that kind of film. <br/><br/>What we have is a loose re-telling of ""The Odyssey"" set in the Civil War. The long journey to returned to a loved one and overcoming the obstacles to get there are right out of The Odyssey. Even the sirens are in this story. This is a classic formula for good storytelling. The protagonist (played by Jude Law) has a literal journey in this film, but he failed in having his inner journey. The character is rather flat and doesn't change much. It is implied that he is changed, but I just felt Jude Law didn't portray that change well.<br/><br/>Here's where I will demonstrate unpopular opinion...Renee Zellweger. Everyone raves about her performance and how she ""stole the show"", how great she is, her best performance, bla, bla, bla. I completely disagree. Sure, she stole the show, but it was with a completely campy, over-the-top, almost cartoon performance. The characters in this film were so believable, except for the character of Ruby. They might as well have had Ruby played by Daffy Duck; it would have had the same effect. This movie is steeped in realism, but Renee takes the audience out of that realism and puts them into another movie. The character was a nice contrast to all of the low-key characters, and was necessary for some comic relief, but a better actor should have been used. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance is a better example of doing a colorful and comedic performance without being out of place. Rene Zellweger was acting in a completely different movie than everyone else. You think that the director would have noticed and had her tone her performance down a bit. That being said, the rest of the supporting cast is outstanding (unfortunately, the leads are rather flat). Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as I mentioned before, and Natalie Portman are the ones who ""stole the show"" and Renee Zellweger should be happy she was not in any scenes with either of those actors because they are a completely different caliber of actors than she, and it would be very apparent that she doesn't know what screen acting is. Her style would be better suited for stage performances, because that kind of acting is necessary for that environment.<br/><br/>Gee, I guess I don't much like Renee Zellwegger. I never realized that until now. <br/><br/>All in all, I still think Cold Mountain was an excellent film with some amazing cinematography. The visuals alone are enough to see this film."
"lawprof","8","1","2","1 January 2004"," Hollywood's Civil War Executed with Commanding Skill
","Oscar nominations for ""Cold Mountain"" are assured. It's a sweeping micro-epic of the Civil War and it succeeds where other recent sprawling films about the great internecine conflict, ""Gods and Generals"" for example, fail. And the reason why it holds viewers' attention through two and a half hours is that it focuses on relationships - good, bad and homicidal - rather than on the great battles and still controversial generals from that conflict. Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" we can all sit back in comfort and not debate or challenge whether Lee knew his business, a subject that prompts vigorous personal exchanges both North and South to this date. <br/><br/>Based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name ""Cold Mountain"" tracks Inman, Jude Law, a young, taciturn laborer falling in love with Ada, Nicole Kidman, as all in the small hilly North Carolina town await the act of secession that will lead to war.<br/><br/>Australian-actress-of-any-accent-needed Kidman is marvelous as Ada who falls in love with Inman (no first name) before he joins his friends to march off to a jolly war guaranteed to be over in a short time. Inman, of course, has fallen for the preacher's blond and beautiful daughter. They exchange tintypes (an early form of photography). Donald Sutherland is the clergyman and he delivers an expectedly competent and familiar performance.<br/><br/>Inman does not have, as the English might say, ""a good war."" He is present - up front and personal - when the Army of the Potomac launches one of the great disasters of its march on Richmond, the mining of Confederate lines before Petersburg. A curiosity: the slaughter of Union troops trapped in the Crater following the explosion is quite accurately depicted. But the troops sent in were largely black and inexperienced and here they're all white. Why so obvious a distortion of a horrific event? (Incidentally, the white brigadier general who commanded the black troops was hiding in his quarters behind the lines dead drunk while his men perished. Since the whole misbegotten, failed operation was an enormous embarrassment to generals Grant and Meade and the main Union casualties were just blacks, the drunk was quietly dismissed rather than being shot.)<br/><br/>Inman survives a grievous wound and, barely recovered, he decides to check out of the Army of Northern Virginia and hike home. To Ada, of course.<br/><br/>On his journey he has many adventures most of which could have been fatal. He meets and makes and loses friends. He meets and eludes or dispatches foes. Jude Law is a man with a grim determination that impresses and engrosses. His pain becomes the audience's. That's a compliment about how well he wears his role.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the farm, literally, Ada has taken in as a partner, not a servant, Ruby, played with insouciance bordering on the hopelessly comedic, by Renee Zellweger. There must be a reason why a large part of the audience broke out laughing when Ruby makes her first appearance in an unfolding set of scenes that has humor but also pathos.<br/><br/>
All is not well in the environs of Cold Mountain where law and order seems to have been exclusively delegated to a small crew of Home Guard vigilantes whose cruelty and mindless killing polarizes the characters. There were vigilantes hunting Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters, especially at the tail end of the war, but this crew is off the charts. I don't think anyone in the theater liked them. I hope not. The actors are excellent in an expectedly stereotyped portrayal. Forget Manhattan, they won't be cheered in the Deep South. I think.<br/><br/>A short but intensely emotional performance is Natalie Portman's as the Confederate widow, Sara, alone in her forest cabin with her little baby when first Inman and then a trio of Union soldiers arrive. Portman is believable and moving. She is Everywoman who is victimized by conflicts men fight and women and children pay for with if not their lives, their welfare.<br/><br/>Curiously, except perhaps for Florida which fell to Union forces early in the conflict, North Carolina saw little actual combat (the one significant battle in that state, Bentonville, was near the end of the war). The privations that occupy much of the screen time were common as the war drew to its disastrous close for the rebels but in North Carolina things were largely better than elsewhere.<br/><br/>Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghella crafted a surprisingly taut drama given its length and the complexity of interactions by numerous characters. The cinematography is excellent-the movie was shot in Romania which, it's been reported, looks more like North Carolina in 1864 than any part of that state does today. I'm not sure if that's good for Romanians.<br/><br/>General Sherman said that ""War is hell and you can not refine it."" Hollywood has grappled with the dilemma of capturing America's war that is still being fought over 140 years later. D.W. Griffith was the first prominent director to deal with the war and its issues and the celluloid avalanche hasn't stopped. ""Cold Mountain"" will achieve success throughout the country because it has truly terrible characters on both sides, avoids any real discussion of root issues such as slavery and shows kindness to slaves (Ada's willingness to go out in the rain to deliver cider to the slave quarters during a big party is almost enough to make one wonder what the fuss was all about). The war in ""Cold Mountain is brutal as it affects individuals and meaningless as a recounting of a conflict without comparison in our history. So general audience acceptance north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line (meaning box office receipts) is assured.<br/><br/>But it is a very good, not a great movie, largely because of the intensity of Law's and Kidman's acting. And we'll be seeing white-knuckled cast members in the audience at Oscar time. Trust me on that.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Contains Spoiler I hardly find another way to evaluate a film than pointing out the scenes that stay with me. The camera, as it remains fixed on Inman's face, after the desperate widow shoots the soldier whom we know is innocent, one feels the despair in his washed out expression; that he has nothing to hold onto, except to move on, since there are those few precious moments in memory that demand a final word. There is the old woman who soothes Inman's wounds, also soothing his soul; his love pours out in words. There is Ada digging the soil; her awkwardness in life striking her, maddening and incapacitating her; she still exercises the art of eloquent speech, when she needs desperately to learn to work her fragile body. There is Ada's photo, being charred in the remains of the fire, when Inman, in his zombie-like resurrection, saves it from ceasing to exist, or maybe he doesn't and I am imagining this (remembering a film is always an act of imagination) There is the parade of the American flag, as it sweeps across a land exploded into a dark, saturated, reddish glow. What must that photo, and those few letters from Ada have meant for him, during the time of death, when they are always at the brink of being lost, being left behind. There is also forgetfulness, in the cheery obscene dinner table where caresses are swapped beneath the table, along with vulgar proposals, when raw, immediate desire threatens the abstract, precious memory.There is the promise of the green forest, when it stretches, from a bird's view,immeasurable distances and also its deceit, when it proves itself inhospitable for refuge. There is the irony of Inman's appearance, at the very moment when Ada grasps the workings of the world, surprised at her own ability to cope."

","The opening battle scene at the siege of Petersberg is filmed in a truly epic manner. If one doesn't comprehend the very real horror of blood and guts fighting while battling the muddy elements that go along with it, those gut wrenching scenes will stay with you a long time. They serve as a chilling counterpoint to the flashback scene of jubilant Southern farm boys who couldn't wait for North Carolina to enter the war. Many of them would not make it home. <br/><br/>But the film isn't about the Civil war so much as one man's attempt to return to an idealistic vision of a woman he holds in his heart and mind. To do so, he must find the wherewithal to desert from the Confederate Army and undertake a grueling journey on foot to his former home at Cold Mountain. You can't really say that Inman's (Jude Law) behavior was admirable, as a deserter he would be hunted down by forces on both sides of the conflict. Yet there is something stoic about his resolve in the face of the war's inhumanity and the way it tramples on a man's dignity and self respect. <br/><br/>Quite honestly, even though a number of reviewers here found Renee Zellweger's character to be intolerable, I thought Ruby Thewes was a hoot and a half. As much as she was embarrassing, there was a quality of loyalty and discipline to her character that helped mold Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) into a more well rounded individual. For most of the story, Kidman appeared to be just a bit too glamorous given the circumstances of her life at Cold Mountain, so Zellweger provided a much needed balance. I think this might have been the first movie I ever saw Renee Zellweger in, and it's not the type of role one forgets easily.<br/><br/>I originally saw this film in the theater upon it's original release and hadn't gotten back to it until the other day. It still retains the drama and power of my first viewing, though for it's intense battle scenes and majestic cinematography, one's best bet is to catch it whenever possible on the big screen."
"TheUnknown837-1","7","1","3","11 February 2010"," Minghella's love story set in another gritty war plays well enough, unfortunately the romantic plot is the least interesting element of the picture
","Watching ""Cold Mountain"" gave me the impression that its director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable ""The English Patient"" from 1996. Comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again. The primary plot differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War.<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" is, story-wise, more watered down and mellow than say ""The English Patient"" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem. It is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. However, it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as ""The English Patient."" My *only* big complaint about ""Cold Mountain"" is, astonishingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar-winner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then he would have had, I feel, a better picture.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting. The Civil War sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. The re-enactment of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrifying. Minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner, and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. There are moments where women as well as men are killed, oftentimes by crossfire. And there's more to it. Just the sound design of the movie generates tension. There's a scene where Inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. We don't see the slicing, but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening.<br/><br/>Lastly, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was terrific in the movie and deserved the Academy Award nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserved one as well, even though her character was a bit shallow. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. And then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in America's past.<br/><br/>Maybe ""Cold Mountain"" would have been better as a war picture, but it most certainly would have been spectacular like ""The English Patient"" if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it's a most enjoyable picture, I wasn't bored by it, and I recommend it. I just say that its love story - though a central plot point - is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked."

"xredgarnetx","6","1","3","22 January 2007"," Great battle scenes
","As with the French weeper, A LONG ENGAGEMENT, COLD MOUNTAIN is a war film within a romantic film, a chick flick with some pretty awesome battle scenes and satisfyingly bloody violence. Jude Law plays a southern farmhand who goes off to fight the Civil War, vowing to return to his true love, the aristocratic Nicole Kidman, who has recently moved with her ailing father (a bewigged Donald Sutherland) from the big city to the hills of North Carolina. While Nicole is waiting for Law to come home, she undergoes various trials and tribulations, as does Law. An almost unrecognizable Renee Zellweger plays Kidman's spunky right-hand woman, and Natalie Portman is a woman with child and no husband whom Law befriends on his arduous journey home. Jena Malone, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, Philip S. Hoffman, Ray Winstone, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Giovanni Ribisi play supporting roles. With all this star power, especially all the foreigners, I half-expected Keira Knightley to pop in. The thick southern accents are something to hear, if not always understand, and the many fight scenes are worth a look by all you unreconstructed males out there. I could have done without all the romantic folderol, but you can't have everything. Zellweger gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Come to think of it, she did win an Oscar for her role in this."

","I've now seen three of Anthony Minghella's films. ""The English Patient"" is among the least interesting ways I've ever spent three hours of my life, and I wish dearly I could have them back. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" was on the other end of the spectrum, an immensely enjoyable experience. ""Cold Mountain"" falls quite squarely in the middle.<br/><br/>From what I can tell, Mr. Minghella is at his worst when he's making Oscar bait. ""The English Patient"" was blatant Oscar bait, as is this movie. Fortunately, the supporting performances pull the film through. Minghella and Miramax owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Renee Zellweger, who gives a titanic, loving, and joyful performance that pretty much saves the movie. Almost as terrific is Natalie Portman, who makes the most of her ten minutes of screen time. Big ups to Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kathy Baker, and Brendan Gleeson as well.<br/><br/>Jude Law does what he can with the character he's given, a dullard by the name of Inman. I could not have cared less about Inman or his journey except within the context of the people he meets along the way. The same goes for Nicole Kidman, who didn't appear to have a character to play at all. Their chemistry was just about nil - as a result I was actually dreading their inevitable reunion, when all the wonderful supporting actors would fade into the background.<br/><br/>The cinematography and music have been rightfully lauded. Say what you will about his command of plot and character, Anthony Minghella certainly knows how to make a good-looking film.<br/><br/>Minghella, I find more and more, is a bit of an enigma. Is he a true artist trying to tell stories, or is he a hack trying to nab the adulation of film critics? Unfortunately, this one definitely leans more toward falling into the ""hack"" column.

","I An overly-dramatic civil war love story that really, really wants to be Gone With the Wind but just ain't. Nicole Kidman plays the young Southern belle Ada Monroe. Kidman is usually excellent in everything she's in, but this role is really weak, unbelievable, full of forced sympathy that just doesn't work, topped with a truly horrible fake Southern accent. Jude Law is alright as the deserting soldier Inman who makes his way back to his true love. There is virtually no chemistry between the two, and I didn't really care that much about either of them. As Inman makes his way back to Cold Mountain, the locals are all harassed by the overly-evil, cruel heartless bastards of the North Carolina Home Guard (these are essentially the same guys who were the villainous Redcoats in The Patriot) Renee Zellwegger, in the role that earned her a Best Supporting Actress award, plays Jar Jar Binks in the form of the obnoxious tomboy Ruby Thewes. A few of the supporting cast is very good, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland, and Kathy Baker give fairly good though sadly short performances. Jack White from the White Stripes sings a song, which is kinda cool. Natalie Portman is the standout of the whole film as a desperate young widow and mother who Jude Law encounters on his journey, her scene is the only truly great bit in this whole film. The whole thing is just too long and unengaging, the storyline is completely pradictable, OF COURSE Jude Law is gotta get a cap in his ass so that Nicole Kidman can pout and wimper some more. If you want a beautiful, romantic masterpiece of an epic set in the Civil War, watch Gone With the Wind.

This was carried out successfully in the short-run, but in the immediate aftermath the Union troops were standing around watching their deadly handiwork but the Confederates reacted quickly with rage and shot down more Union troops, with the North thus taking the heavier casualties. The movie says nothing about this, preferring to focus on the rabbit being chased down by troops.<br/><br/>The Siege at Petersburg is a part of the Civil War seldom told, seldom with honesty. Essentially a 10-month standoff, the South kept Grant's troops at bay even though Grant's army outnumbered the South by 12 to 1 and the North's troops were well armed and well fed while the South's were starving and ill equipped --- except for their tenacity and courage.<br/><br/>Another review compares this film to Gone With the Wind.

She was absolutely stunning. This is the first movie that I ever remember seeing Renee Zellweger in. I fell head, over hills, in love with her character, Ruby. I'm from the south, and am quite familiar with southern accents, and this is one of the few movies I've seen where the accents of everyone included were done with perfection, especially Ruby.

"TxMike","Null","1","4","7 October 2004"," Homer's Odyssey, superimposed on a Civil War background in the 1860s.
","What we always learn from movies about war is that men always start them, and war is terrible for everyone. So the story is familiar. Young men go to war, most get killed, while their wives, children, and girlfriends back home miss them and wonder if they will ever see them alive again. A few of the older, less-capable men stay behind to preserve the peace, but they inevitably get caught up in power and jealousy, and become evil men that the women have to fight in their own war back home. Some men in the army get fed up with all the carnage, and waiting for the war to end, so they become hunted deserters, trying to find their way back home. Meanwhile, as years pass, those who stay home become changed. All that is in 'Cold Mountain', in a story not too different from Homer's Odyssey, except Ada (Kidman)is waiting for Inman (Law), while Ruby (Zellweger) is hoping to stay on the farm that she is working with Ada. It is long, at two and a half hours, and slow at times, but best appreciated almost as a 'mini-series.' Watching it in four 40-minute sessions, with food, exercise, and toilet breaks, made a lot of sense to me! Overall a very good, worthwhile movie. All actors did super jobs, but my favorite was Zellweger as Ruby, truly an Oscar-worthy performance.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, in all the rest of my comments, you may want to quit reading now. The movie is edited in an interesting manner. We see Ada and Inman three years earlier, meeting, as she moves to this small town with her father, a minister. He is shy but very capable. She is outgoing and well-educated, but has no skills. Can't cook, can't garden, can't clean house, and after her father dies suddenly is practically helpless. Later after Ruby shows up and becomes her partner on the farm, and they are building a fence, Ada says ""This is the first thing that I ever made that has some use."" Ruby is just the opposite, she can do anything that a man can do.<br/><br/>The parallel story is in ""present"" time near the end of the war, Inman is injured, a volunteer reads him a letter from Ada, which motivates him to walk away from the hospital, basically becoming a deserter and hunted man. He begins the long trip back to Cold Mountain, walking along rivers and through forests. He encounters the equivalent of sirens and a cyclops, plus other hazards, becomes part of a chain gang of prisoners, escapes as all others die. Meanwhile Ada is forming a new life, as a partner (non sexual) with Ruby, all the while hoping to see Inman again.<br/><br/>In the snow, in a remote area, Inman finally shows up, and pretending there is some religion somewhere that says you're married is you say ""I marry you"" three times, they profess their devotion to each other and have one night of bliss in a well-made, tasteful love scene. The next day the rogue enforcer shows up, is snuffed, but one of his men shoots Inman, who a little while later dies in Ada's arms. A tragic ending for him that parallels the fate of the men in 'Das Boot', dying after surviving all sorts of perils before apparently making it home safely. <br/><br/>In the end we jump to about 7 years later, judging from the age of the red-haired girl that is Ada and Inman's daughter. In spite of his death, he had given something good. Ruby had a husband and young child and, the war being over, all were living happily on the farm. Ada also had become a capable person."

","It is really pretty easy to describe ""Cold Mountain"". Just take the worst parts (the very few there were) in ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""The English Patient"", mix them together and you have this ponderous, long and sometimes down-right silly epic that is still somehow saved in the end and becomes a slight winner anyway in spite of itself. The Civil War is all but over. The Confederacy is going to lose, plain and simple. Death has become a way of life across the nation, but the toll in the South is truly monumental. Soon there are Confederate deserters that try to return home. Of course this leads to the historical fact that this group becomes hunted by not only the Union, but by the very forces they once fought for. One deserter (Jude Law) tries to return to North Carolina and the titled town found within his home state. The war has all but killed him (this guy has more lives than Sylvester the Cat) and the only thing that keeps him going is his love to resident Nicole Kidman. Kidman, who is not originally from the town, had come to Carolina with her minister father (Donald Sutherland) to start a new life and build a new church. All goes awry though very quickly as Kidman falls in love with Law, but Law has to go to war. Then her father passes away and Kidman, quite sheltered and helpless really, has no one to take care of her or work the land she now owns outright. Neighbors Kathy Baker and husband James Gammon worry about Kidman and send laborer Renee Zellweger (in easily her finest role to date) to do mundane tasks and basically keep her new employer from starving to death. Soon Zellweger's long-believed-dead father (Brendan Gleeson) and two of his new friends from the war (Jack White and Ethan Suplee) come to hide out as they are now deserters as well. Naturally there is friction between Zellweger and Gleeson, but still a mutual respect, admiration and even hidden love. As all this transpires, Law runs into every sort of character you can imagine. He meets up with a sexually-addicted holy man (a priceless turn by Philip Seymour Hoffman), a somewhat simple backwoods girl (Jena Malone), a drunken farmer (Giovanni Ribisi) and even a Civil War widow/single mother (Natalie Portman). Each meeting though is far from a safe one and Law keeps on dodging bullets and pulling himself out of rough situations with his undying will and his surprising intelligence. Ray Winstone (of ""Sexy Beast"" fame) becomes the designated antagonist as he tries to rule Law's hometown with an iron fist. He and his band of cronies become dominant fixtures on the town's landscape and eventually become the primary assassins for Confederate deserters as well. ""Cold Mountain"" is a very long picture, but it seems even longer than it is. So many things happen that your head is sometimes left spinning and sadly the picture even becomes a bore at several intervals. Law is quietly effective, giving a war-weary performance. He and Kidman really have very little chemistry though and they were never completely believable as lovers to start with. Zellweger is the real revelation. Her appearance nearly comes too late to salvage the production. She ends up smothering most of the shortcomings here all by herself. Writer/director Anthony Minghella's grasp of the book is not as tight as it should have been. He sometimes gets wrapped up in beautiful cinematography and art direction and loses focus of the would-be deep characters. Sadly the characters are really not as complex as they could have been or should have been and that ultimately makes ""Cold Mountain"" more of an exercise than a joy. 4 stars out of 5."

","Anthony Minghella, responsible for such films as The English Patient (which I did not like despite the acclaim) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (which I liked), returns with another adaptation- Cold Mountain, which entails the romance-during-civil war scenario passed down by the Gone with the Wind movie gods. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play two people, Inman and Ada, who've barely known each other before Law goes off to fight in the War, but they write (Kidman contributes voice-overs that more often than not don't work or aren't needed for the story) to one another, that is until he witnesses a terrible battle years later. He becomes a deserter, as he travels across wild parts of the South on her way back to her. During this time Ada's father dies, and she's all alone until a girl from the mountains who's also lost her father, Ruby (Renee Zellweger), comes down to help on the farm. It doesn't take this reviewer to tell where the story is headed, and that's probably how Minghella liked it set up (from Charles Frazier's book). <br/><br/>There's much that I liked about Cold Mountain: the strong, period-perfect production design by Dante Ferretti, an entertaining battle sequence near the beginning, and an all-star cast that, though mostly supporting, does it's job well. And among the Oscar nominations the film is bound to receive (from my perspective this film follows in the tradition that Miramax puts out at least one film every year around this time to garner some space in the audience at the show), I'd say that Zellweger could perhaps get her's. What I didn't think was all that great about the movie, and what makes it over-rated, is that it's a story that makes itself too clear that this will happen now, and this will happen in the next scene, and in a few minutes we can expect this, and so on. The presence of confederate soldiers, always on the look out for traitors around Ada's region, makes it all too by-the-books, so to speak. A couple of minutes could've been chopped off as well. Is it a well made movie? yes, but maybe it's TOO well made for its own good."

Nicole pines away for Jude and finds it difficult to manage on her own until the feisty, Southern-cliché-ridden tomboy Renée Zellweger shows up and helps her. With Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland, Cillian Murphy, Eileen Atkins, and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, you know you'll be in for some quality performances, even if the overall aura of the film isn't enjoyable.<br/><br/>The most famous element to Cold Mountain, besides the very graphic sex scenes and Nicole Kidman's needless nudity, is the make-up Oscar it won for Renée Zellweger, who had lost the gold the year before for her tour-de-force performance in Chicago. As a native Southerner, playing the tell-it-like-it-is Southerner in Cold Mountain was not a stretch for her acting abilities, and even though I'm sure she was very happy to receive her statue, I'm sure she realized it was a make-up Oscar.<br/><br/>Be prepared when you go into it that the movie's a very heavy drama, more on par with Free State of Jones than Gone with the Wind. It's pretty upsetting at times, and will more than likely leave you unsettled in the years after you watch it. My brother cites this as one of the films he wishes he hadn't seen, but I'm used to the type so I wasn't too phased. Use your own judgement whether or not you can handle it, but by all means, put the kiddies to bed before watching it! Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to nudity, violence, and graphic sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it. Also, there may or may not be a rape scene."

","There is no doubt that Cold Mountain has a decent plot and the film keeps its audience somewhat entertained even with a duration of roughly two and a half hours; however the characters aren't very intriguing. Simply put the film is about a Civil War deserter trying to get home to the love of his life.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Inman is just a little too humble to be the main character of a romance film such as this one and it is beyond insane that he is driven by his love for Ada even though the two had barely known each other and only crossed each other's paths a handful of times. As a result it is hard to really care if the two end up together or not because the fact that two people could be so blinded by this sham that they call love is nauseating. Overall, the film does an outstanding job recreating the Civil War setting in the south and there are a few watchable scenes, but the boring Civil War deserter Inman and the unlikable Ada eventually put the viewer to sleep."

","I have never bothered to watch this movie as I'm not much of a Jude Law fan, and the thought of him an movie almost three hours long about the civil war did not appeal to this reviewer, even with the always reliable Brendon Gleason, Giovanni Ribbsi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Donald Sutherland in the supporting cast. Not to mention Nicole Kidman and an Oscar winning turn by Renee Zellweger. But it was on TV tonight and in the absence of anything else to watch, I gave it a go, and boy am I glad I did.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: A wounded Confederate soldier named Inman (Law) who struggles on a perilous journey to get back home to Cold Mountain, to his sweetheart Ada (Kidman) the woman he left behind before going off to fight in the Civil War. Along the way, he meets a long line of interesting and colourful characters.<br/><br/>Every actor I have listed gives a good if not great performance. Portman stands out in her small role, whilst Seymour Hoffman reminds us what a talent we have lost.<br/><br/>Zellweger deservedly won the Oscar for her work here, Kidman may have been aggrieved that her work was over shadowed by her costar. As she too is superb, and was rightly nominated for a golden globe, but their was an academy award snub for some reason. For some reason I found the love scene with Law awkward to watch too. Weird. I didn't even find Jude Law as annoying as normal and he picked up an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>There are several problems with it, but not enough to ruin the movie. Definitely worth checking out."

","It seems this is a controversial movie. Reviewers are equally divided in pros & cons. In my opinion this is not an outstanding film, but it has some good features to point out. First of all the marvelous photography done by John Seale (he is also responsible for ""Gorillas in the Mist""). Snow covered woods; rural trails and mountainous landscape are shown with masterful skill. The music is another high point, T-Bone Burnett is the executive producer and three of his songs are scored here. Nicole Kidman in the role of Ada Monroe and Jude Law as Inman performs correctly and convincingly. Renée Zellweger as Ruby Thewes a rural girl is really the best of the cast. Outwardly hardboiled and outspoken, she let the viewer get in touch with her inner tenderness and humanity thru her shinning eyes and glances. The director, Anthony Minghella, is not one of my favs, but this is by far, much better than his well known ""The English Patient"".<br/><br/>The story is situated in the Civil War times. Inman goes to war, as thousands of others, only to find out that war is cruel and senseless for the ordinary soldiers. After long years of service he is wounded one more time and decides to quit. To go home, to return to his true love, to where he belongs. This is a forbidden issue for any soldier in any war. So his long pilgrimage is full of obstacles and dangers. In Cold Mountain, Ada awaits the end of the war and the return of her lover. She faces many hardships with the only help of Ruby. Will they reunite? You must see the film in order to discover it. A final caution: there are some nude scenes, well acted and filmed but may be inconvenient for young audiences."
"mac-hawk","7","0","1","22 November 2009"," A valiant attempt but not quite there
","It's initial premise is based on the American Civil War but it's ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. The main thrust of this film is for Law's character to return to Kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. The reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before Law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. Everything else is just about fine, Renee Zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. Sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. An honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless."

","Anthony Minghella seems to have cornered the market in slow, overlong period flicks - with The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and now Cold Mountain providing ample evidence of this. Despite some admittedly impressive visuals (thanks to cinematographer John Seale), Cold Mountain never quite manages to engage the viewer - primarily due to an abundance of characters and a few too many pointless subplots. The story, set during the American Civil War, follows a soldier named Inman (Jude Law) as he attempts to return home to his sweetheart, Ada (Nicole Kidman). It's a decent setup that is diluted and eventually destroyed by Minghella's refusal to remain focused on the two characters; this is exemplified by the presence of Ray Winstone's Teague and his ridiculously evil posse, who appear to have been included for the sole purpose of forcing Inman into a showdown at the film's close. Law is very good in the central role, while the continuous cavalcade of stars eventually becomes distracting - though Natalie Portman briefly injects some life into the film with her turn as a single mom. As for Oscar winner Renée Zellweger, the actress seems to be channeling Yosemite Sam here - a bizarre choice that is kind of entertaining, but ultimately jarring and out-of-place. Finally, there's the ending, which is deeply unsatisfying in so many ways - further cementing Cold Mountain's status as an ill-advised adaptation (Charles Frazier's Pulitzer Prize winning novel must be better than this)."
"slokes","6","0","1","5 April 2007"," Tough Climb
","Some films are like sprints. ""Cold Mountain"" is a marathon. It pushes and pulls you a long way from point A to point Z, forcing you to bear witness to a lot of cruelty, devastation, and wildly variant plot lines, all in a sincere albeit misplaced effort to faithfully reproduce the Charles Frazier novel on screen. Oppressive, yes, but at least it's never dull.<br/><br/>Inman (Jude Law) is a Confederate soldier, badly wounded, who decides to give up the Civil War and return to his North Carolina home, Cold Mountain. ""Come back to me is my request"" writes his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), and he obliges. While Inman meets a deviant preacher, a young war widow, and a kindly goatwoman en route, Ada keeps the house her father owned with the help of a female Huckleberry Finn named Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger).<br/><br/>""Cold Mountain"" runs nearly two and a half hours, and you feel every minute of it. Because the film compresses everything so much, trying to fit all of Frazier's vision in, it never quite breathes in the way of another longer war epic such as ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" (an unfairly great film, yes, but those are the stakes ""Cold Mountain"" director Anthony Minghella plays for). While Ruby is running Ada through various farm chores, for example, she's also providing pertinent details on her character and motivation through talky exposition. Everyone in the film seems to have a monologue to deliver, crammed one after the other like air traffic over O'Hare.<br/><br/>The other thing that makes ""Cold Mountain"" tough is its capacity for sadness. Sure bad things happen to good people, but seldom in so concentrated a form. This is also largely faithful to the book, but it should be pointed out that the novel uses its opportunity to better space out the ""war is hell"" theme. Also, certain characters suffer a worse fate in the movie than the novel (i.e. the Swanger family, the girl in the canoe, the war widow if you catch the extra scene on DVD). Usually films lighten up on a novel's content precisely because hard scenes one against the other alienate an audience, but Minghella trusts his audience to bear with him.<br/><br/>I didn't exactly, but I did admire ""Cold Mountain"" for what it was, a stage for uniformly splendid acting and camera-work. Law nicely develops an understated tone as Inman, man of few words, while Kidman makes the romantic parts sing louder than they otherwise would and plays a good straight man to Zellweger, who gets most of the best lines and delivers them with gusto. The only great performance I saw was Brendan Gleeson as Stobrod, who really faked me out with his accent and with Zellweger co-stars in the best sequence in the film, when they meet again after a long separation.<br/><br/>""He's so full of manure,"" Ruby says. ""We could stick 'em in the dirt and grow another just like 'em.""<br/><br/>Minghella works in some great shots that keep you watching even as they don't lead anywhere, aided by an authentic-feeling musical score that feels at times almost devastating. In this way, ""Cold Mountain"" pushes in your face the fact the Civil War was fought by real people, not just played out in the quaint pages of a history book.<br/><br/>I was reminded, with that music and Ada's voice-over letter readings, of Ken Burns' famous ""Civil War"" documentary. While not as inspiring or commanding as that, ""Cold Mountain"" retains the same aesthetic, and on that level succeeds more often than it does not. I just question anyone's ability to come to this movie without doing some serious homework, and when you do the homework, it may prove more interesting to you than the film itself."

","""Cold Mountain"" - a movie that you can watch.<br/><br/>Script: tight, if you can mentally insert the ""Years later..."" card between a few scene cuts, and I know you can. A few Oscar-bait monologues are clunky in that adapted-from-the-novel way... but that's just me, I like to be shown rather than told by a character what they're going through.<br/><br/>Production design: convincing, believable, with that old movie-magic feeling of being a window into the way people lived oh so long ago and far away... (though when Kidman walks in front of it, the jarring incongruity jumps out that, despite her partial grime-over, there simply were no women as pretty as Nicole Kidman 140 years ago. Squinty-eyed pout-machine Zellweger looks more like Appalachian mountain breeding stock.) <br/><br/>Cinematography: Amazing. Everything has the natural light look - absolutely absorbing. One of the most beautiful winter snow scenes ever filmed.<br/><br/>Story: Good Guys good, Bad Guys bad... with their character conflict/resolutions built right in. A series of long, protracted tragedies you don't have to see comin' round the mountain when they come. But still, the familiar crudeness and cruelty of events have that original-source feel - when life was more of the hardscrabble scrape than the dreamworld we live in. <br/><br/>Casting: Ahhhhh... this is where the movie both succeeds and fails. <br/><br/>It's mostly inspired. Jude Law and Brendan Gleeson are very good... no, they're excellent. <br/><br/>The character actors are all first-rate - I mean, you could SMELL the backwoods witch goat-lady. <br/><br/>Jack White does a fine understated job, though I found it impossible to stop seeing Jack White and thinking how cool it was that Jack White was in this movie, and wondering if Jack White was really playing his instrument. <br/><br/>(It couldn't have been more amazing if his character's name was ""Jack White"" too - I mean, that even sounds like the name of a traveling mountain musician. Anyhow, the point is it kind of breaks the spell. )<br/><br/>And Philip Seymore Hoffman is good in anything.<br/><br/>But this movie belongs to Ray Winstone. His Confederate villain is more than just menacing. He's got the violence of battlefield madness in his quiet voice. (Can you believe he's British ? His Southern accent wasn't just convincing, it was FLAWLESS, something that even American-born Yankees can't manage.)<br/><br/>I know villains never get For Your Consideration treatment - but this one should've instead offfffffffff..... (*drum roll*)<br/><br/>ZELLWEGER-MANIA !<br/><br/>She won award after award for this. People gushed about how great she was as the comic relief. Hm. I didn't find anything she said or did particularly comic. And I could spend a little while detailing why she shouldn't have all those awards. Cause Renée Zellweger stinks. <br/><br/>Her accent is inconsistent and drawling - it's Appalachian mountain folk accent, Renée, not Savannah, not 'Bama, not Texas or Nawlinz... Study the dialect tapes, honey. Amazingly, she's up against British, Australian, and Irish lead actors, and yet her accent is the weakest. Maybe that's why she kept changing her mind about it as the movie progressed. (Do like Kidman does - pick one wrong accent, and stick with it.)<br/><br/>Zellweger plays her character with three emotions - mad, madder, and wounded-&-mad. But it's not the bitter anger of a young woman whose life has already let her down and had to come up fighting - it's more like the pouting petulance of a teenager who spends most of the day brooding cause she's mad at her mom. She's so ADORABLE when she pouts ! Oh no, her pouting is out of control ! Ha ha, oh, Renée !<br/><br/>How does Zellweger keep getting work ? Beats me. I wonder if her British affectation is any more convincing. <br/><br/>Who would've been better in this role ? Oh, I could say something cruel like, ""Hold an open casting call and throw a rock."" <br/><br/>But instead, let me ask who might have been a WORSE casting choice for Renée Zellweger's role. The answer springs immediately to mind: Winona Rider. An only slightly worse choice. <br/><br/>Also, it seems Nicole Kidman is in the movie. ""Cold Mountain"" may have originally been a vehicle for her. I like Kidman, and she's done good work elsewhere; it's just that this was just not a standout role for her. Next to the wailing klaxon horn of Zellweger's acting, Kidman seems merely to perform adequately. And again, it doesn't help that she's just too Hollywood-pretty for the part. <br/><br/>Truthfully, both female leads could've been cast better. Because the other issue is that not for a MOMENT did I believe that Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters were attracted to each other. <br/><br/>Sting, who used to be a rock and roll singer, wrote the theme song that uses the word ""ain"" in the title, which just gives me Reason #98 to want to kick him in the *ss. But I can't fault the movie's music at all. Good score, great sound.<br/><br/>So there you go. ""Cold Mountain."" A movie that you can watch."

","The film Cold Mountain portrays aspects of the Civil War in many different ways. Cold Mountain does not focus on an actual battle, or series of battles, but rather around the lives of a few people and how the war at large impacts all aspects on their lives. The film depicts an odd duality, a double edged sword, and shades of gray that have become the modern understanding of the Civil War. The war is shown as not an end, or final destination, but rather as a journey, fraught with war and peace, love and hate, and action both magnanimous and malevolent, and all the shades in between.<br/><br/>The film opens with the siege of Petersburg. An explosion tears the cities defenses asunder, and soon after an unfortunate union corps charges into the crater left by the explosion. Here an understanding of the savagery and murderous nature of the war was illustrated as hundreds of Confederate soldiers take position around the edge of the crater and pick off the helpless Union forces trapped inside. Wild calls of bloodlust fill the air as countless blue coats die. Yet amongst the bloody horrors of war the protagonist Inman, dives selflessly into the crater in attempts to rescue a mortally wounded comrade. Though surrounded by an immense slaughter one man brazenly risks his own life to save that of another. This action shows us the duality of the understanding of the war, wanton carnage, and selfless valor to protect life all in the same scene.<br/><br/>Life away from the front is seen through the eyes of another protagonist, Ada, a preacher's daughter cast adrift in a small unfamiliar town. Her love interest, Inman, goes off to war leaving her alone to cope with the hardships the war brings to those who remain behind. The war brings chaos to a previously tranquil environment. At the onset the men cheer for their long awaited war, and joyfully march off to the sorrow that awaits them on the battlefield. The film illustrates the hardships that await those who remain as the news of the deaths of the once exited boys return to Cold Mountain. Ada nears madness with uncertainty and anticipation of Inman's fate. The townsfolk suffer under the unscrupulous care of the local magistrate and his posse. Life at home slowly unravels into struggle and despair. The portrayal of the hardships of the civilian southerners establishes a modern understanding that the war left no aspect of social life unscathed.<br/><br/>The stark suffering of the battle's aftermath is portrayed as Inman is wounded and taken to an over-crowded makeshift hospital. Men lay all around, bleeding and dying as moans of their suffering fill the space. These scenes add additional understanding of the massive scale of pain and human loss. Yet in this hopeless location, one man's will to live and to return to his love overcome the grisly reality and as soon as he is physically able he decides to desert and fueled by a letter he takes on the long and arduous journey home.<br/><br/>The journey of Inman echoes the central focus of the film. This journey exposes the viewer to various social and individual impacts left by the war. The chaos created by the war act as a perfect backdrop to display both the very best and very worst aspects of human nature. Inman comes across reverend Veasey, who is about to drop an unconscious African American woman into a river because he had impregnated her. Later he and Veasey pay a young girl an exorbitant price to be ferried across a river to escape perusing soldiers tracking deserters, half way across she offers her body up for a price. A moment later she is killed by rifle fire from the departure point. After their escape Inman and the fugitive Veasey come across a man who offers room and board for their assistance, they agree and are baited into a trap set for deserters. Later Inman is welcomed into the home of a young, recently widowed mother, her infant son is ill, her husband had been killed in action and she is left to reconcile survival with the pain of carrying on alone in the world. All of these vignettes signify the disorder, opportunism, and survival mechanisms of individuals attempting to cope with the societal shock-waves of the Civil War.<br/><br/>One of the few positive side effects of the war portrayed in the film is how circumstances caused by the war bring individuals together. As Ada struggles with depression and madness another young woman, Ruby, appears on her dilapidated farm to assist her. Ada might not have survived otherwise. The two women help inspire each other to do what is necessary to survive. These circumstances allow Ruby to reconcile with her estranged father, and meet her future husband.<br/><br/>As Inman's long journey reaches it end and he returns to Ada it seems that all the suffering each had to overcome was worth the cost, love triumphs over trials. However, their time together is not long as Inman is fatally wounded in a gunfight with a local unscrupulous law officer. The long journey home and all the ordeals that were overcome seem to be for naught. Despite this tragedy, Ada is able to move on her with her life and with the help of her new friends, all brought together by the war, and create a good and happy life."

","I realize I must sound like a bit of a flake, but the improbable deaths of the Swangers almost ruined this film for me. I would just as soon not have had all the violence that opened and continued in the film to show me that ""war is hell"", but, I was revulsed by the gore and aware of its relation to war, so, I suppose, it accomplished its purpose, and, anyway, I might not have liked the film as much as I did w/o being manipulated that way. And I wasn't tremendously put off by the historical improbability, as I understand it, of much of what the movie depicted. Neither Confedrate nor Union Army was much for rape during the war, so the historians tell us, and I am willing to believe, but I can't believe some of it didn't go on. Likewise, neither North Carolina rural farmers nor those anywhere else outside of certain border state areas were much afflicted with the relatively able-bodied and well supplied Home Guard depicted here, but there may have been some, and I'm willing to afford a degree of license to the director. But the way the Swangers were murdered was so bizarrely unbelievable, that it jarred me out of the suspension of reason that I'd been willing to afford the film up to that point and made me walk away from it; had I been watching CM in a theater, I likely would have stifled myself for ten minutes or so and then walked out (yes, I also don't take exception to the criticism that the movie seemed overlong). The murder of Mr. Swanger was jarring enough, there had been entirely too little precedent in the movie to establish that the Home Guarders had broken that far with the social contract that they'd had w/ their pre-War neighbors, forgetting the fact that such lawlessness is entirely at odds with the historical record. But then to have the sons come running to their deaths immediately thereafter is too much of an absurdity to tolerate. We are expected to believe that the sons had fought for three years in the bloodiest conflagration to occur in the Western Hemisphere and then, somehow, become so rattled at the actual/potential death of their parents that they run to their deaths like lemmings over a cliff? What detachment did they desert from, one guarding Jefferson Davis in Richmond? Every major Confederate battle unit had suffered severe casualties by the beginning of 1864; even the most innocent of veterans had combat instincts that were not going to be swept aside by death/danger to a loved one, death and dismemberment of one's friends were too constant companions. These battle hardened soldiers came running to their deaths with loaded firearms in their hands! With the enemy in plain view? The likelihood is just too absurd. There were any number of quick and gory ways of killing the Swangers off available to the director that weren't as offensive to logic as the ones chosen; they should have been picked and the scenes used consigned to the cutting room floor. The superb acting - particularly the appealing relationship developed between the Zellweger/Kidman characters - deserved better accompaniment."

","Not sure exactly what I was expecting with this film.... I went into it with a pretty open mind, but I was disappointed nonetheless. The story is just too flimsy to be believed, a very 19th-Century romantic story without much to back up the romance -- in fact more than once the main characters have to comment on how they had barely seen or spoken to each other, as if this makes up for the fact that their relationship is not established properly. I think the performances were generally good, if a bit over-sincere. Jude Law really made me feel for his character, and I was interested in his story as he trekked back to his love, though the episode with Portman fell flat for me, the sequences with Seymour-Hoffman made up for those. Zellwegger is great here, too, really appealing as the sort of tomboyish young woman who might actually have been found at that time in the South. One thing I also appreciated was that it gave a fairly balanced view of the average Southerner's take on the war.... in contrast to Hollywood's sometimes stereotyped approach. The battle sequences are excellent, but too short and falling only in the very early parts of the film. The big problem I had with the film was the unsubstantiated romance, along with some truly bad dialogue. It seems like the film-makers felt compelled to make a big statement on war when they really should have left their story a tragic romance and not tried to make it seem ""great"". The photography, however, is at times astounding, I particularly remember a shot of Law framed against a sunset early in the film that was quite beautiful."

","The movie had a pretty good story, but overall I didn't think it was a great movie. Overall I just think it went on too long. I don't really understand why they did the ""three years earlier"" thing, it wasn't really necessary I didn't think.<br/><br/>The end of the film was surprisingly anticlimactic and dragged on further then it had to. I was under the impression that the whole movie was about these two people in love with each other and trying to find each other again. So he finally finds her and...well the next scene is Ada and Ruby are having some off topic conversation. Maybe its just me, but I was a little disappointed when, after three years of searching, they didn't simply find each other, put something good in, and end the movie. They finally made love about 10 minutes (film time) after meeting for the first time in three years, but by then it was already ruined.<br/><br/>Then I thought that parts of the story were pretty phony. I know it's a movie and its not supposed to be 100% realistic, but after he stumbles upon the third random woman in the middle of nowhere who happens to openly offer him food and shelter (which was limited to them as well), it got kind of fake. Then, Ruby's father is shot and laying in the snow overnight but Ruby and Ada somehow revive him in a little wooden shack on the mountain? My whole party believed he was dead after getting shot, kind of fake there as well.<br/><br/>The last little quirk for me was that some of the dialog seemed really bad. Like lines from a Schwartzeneger movie or something. Like when the old hag kills the donkey (I hate her for that), the little monologue she says before that, come on. Nobody would do that. For a movie that was supposed to be so serious, the one liners in the battle scenes were pretty dull as well.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't a great movie. I thought it had a good story from about 15 minutes in to about 15 minutes before it ended. The acting was pretty good, I don't know what the deal was with the Boy Meets World guy, but even he wasn't bad.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely a movie for the women. I can see how a woman would like this more then a man. You can't be picky when you watch it, and you have to be really ready to watch it, because it moves at a SNAILS PACE. I would say that it is worth a watch, but isn't one that will live through time. I would take Legends of the Fall over it any day though.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

The whole world sh-ts on them? Life's not worth living? Then, what a cheep shot for and ending scene, there is no redemption in guilt. Do a good job in the first place. Something more than Ruby should have shined.<br/><br/>When having something good, it should have been building plot and character, but it quit cold, when it should quit and move on, it dragged on, then came back and threw in more.

","To be fair, I rarely like a movie once I've read the book, and this is especially so with a book I loved as much as Cold Mountain. So those of you who haven't read it should take my comments with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the novel was the lack of schmaltz. There, the relationship between Ada and Inman was secondary to Inman's travels and Ada's coming into her own -- yet always there was the potential for love. Focusing on the character development -- and hinting at this potential -- made sense because Inman and Ada really didn't know each other before their separation, yet through the years each developed in a way that could only add to their compatibility. I looked forward to their reunion knowing that it had become logical for them to be together. That's romantic. In the movie, however, it was presented as a given that they were each other's ""aine true love"" -- yet Minghella never did the heavy lifting of creating scenes that showed them actually getting to know each other -- just blushing and making googly eyes. So really all we knew is that they found each other hot. Instead of Inman clinging to the notion of Ada as ""home,"" and Ada finally arriving at the mature conclusion that she wanted to be with Inman, we saw a lot of pining after each other to the swelling of syrupy music. Please! If you want to see a true romance, watch Minghella's MUCH superior ""Truly Madly Deeply."""

","The not so engaging story of two people who barely know each other falling in love and staying in love throughout the Civil War. The hero, Jude Law, spends the majority of the film trying to get back to his beloved, Nicole Kidman, who has to run the farm by herself after her pastor dad (Donald Sutherland) dies. The hapless Kidman is helped by a rugged Zellwegger and struggles to carry on in spite of the hardships and bullying of a greedy man (Ray Winstone, slumming it badly) who wants her lands and just happens to be the sheriff. Well, him and his thugs are later destroyed by Jude Law, but does Law live happily ever after? After the first ten minutes you probably won't care. Law gives his best but the film is just too bloated and sluggish to be engaging (and Law has noticeable trouble holding a Southern accent). Nicole Kidman is miscast as the hapless love interest; she's just too much of an authority figure to be convincing as a soft, delicate, helpless woman (plus she doesn't look roughed up enough when the hard times get underway). Zellwegger's heartiness borderlines being too comical for the film's own good.<br/><br/>Scenery's beautiful though. That's New Zealand for you. Bad music at the end, I'm afraid."

","This movie suffers from a case of something that I find in a lot of newer films. The narrative or plot is rushed as if the director was in such a panic to get the story told that he forgot to develop the plot and characters. A great actor like Donald Sutherland is wasted in the role of Nicole Kidman's father. Case in point is the scene where Sutherland is trying to suss out Jude Law's intentions toward his daughter, the camera inexplicably pulls back in a monumental crane shot to reveal Kidman at a window listening. The effect is that we are supposed to somehow sympathize with Kidman. This is difficult to do while the dialogue is rendered inaudible and ineffective. Another remarkable weakness is the fact that the film is about the civil war but there is very little reference to black people. The ever hammy and over-rated Rene Zellweger comes across as giving the best performance only because her character is the only one that has more than one dimension. A waste of money all around."

","The romance is more complicated than that in ""The Birth of a Nation"", but not so much as in ""Gone with the Wind"". Expectations are rewarded. Slavery is mostly ignored, so there's supposedly no racism, either. A romance struggles against the vast setting of the American Civil War, but fate will reward the wait. Crosscutting between the lovers' situations was enough for me. The climax was the editing in the mollified sex scene. I must applaud any such sex scene for merely not being annoying. Additionally, it helps that the crosscutting is between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>We don't expect Law or Kidman's characters to die, or anything, on any of their adventures, so we get the next best thing after surprise: encounters with many stars, including Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson, Renée Zellweger, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Giovanni Ribisi and Natalie Portman. Zellweger, who gets her Oscar, and Hoffmann are actually good; the comic relief outshines the leads.

But since the Civil War is underway, there aren't any handymen to be found who could help her with the day-to-day operations, so Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellweger), a rough-and-tumble tomboy who happens to have long, flowing blonde hair and wear a copious amount of lipstick, shows up to lend a hand and a barbed tongue.<br/><br/>There are two story strands: Inman's travails as he desperately tries to get home (and labeled a deserter, at that) and Ada's difficulties as she alternately clears fields and pines for Inman.

She puts off advances from other, opportunistic menfolk who are a-dyin' to get in her britches, all the while learning all kinds of Man Stuff, like firing a gun. O, will she survive?

There are heroes, but the causes are never heroic."" Has this man and much of modern society forgotten that the war between the states put an end to the institution of slavery in the U.S.. It has been argued by those who detest our heritage that the war was actually about 'states rights' but who can honestly believe that men and boys (not a professionally trained military anxious to use their newly acquired skills) would feel passionately enough to leave their homes to fight a bloody war about 'states rights'. These were people who knew that slavery was an evil that could not be tolerated, and they finally took the initiative to put an end to it. On the other side were the people in the south who had become blind to that fact because their entire way of life depended upon it (slavery). War is a horrible fact of human life; but there are noble causes and the civil war in the U.S. was truly one of them."

","Wonderful, rousing story of true love with a tragic ending. Jude Law is haunting as Inman, the brooding, sexy mountain boy who gets pulled into the dying Confederacy's hopeless struggle. Nicole Kidman is luminous as Ada, the sheltered but courageous southern lady left behind on a dying farm, who learns to survive in the most trying circumstances. And Renee Zellweger is absolutely irresistible as Ruby, the poor white girl with the heart of gold who goes from scorning and teasing Ada to being her best friend and most loyal companion. <br/><br/>It's very pleasant, this movie, as long as you don't look below the surface. If you love these characters enough as individuals, you can ignore the historical surroundings. Hollywood has been making this kind of movie ever since GONE WITH THE WIND. You know, the sufferings of the good and noble southern people during the Civil War. But black people are invisible. The idea that Ada is brave and plucky for learning how to pluck her own chickens is cute and sweet -- until you realize that for years black children went hungry so she could eat. No one wants to make a movie about that! <br/><br/>Chris Rock tried to make some of these points at the Oscars a few years back, but Sean Penn (that well known liberal) shouted him down, showing his true colors once again as the classic playground bully. Why is it that Hollywood, the most liberal town in America, still wants to make movies like Gone With The Wind? They talk about how brave they are, (and I'm talking to you, George Clooney) defying racism in their talk and attitudes, but the movies they make reflect a very different reality. There's nothing in COLD MOUNTAIN to suggest that slavery was wrong, that blacks suffered, or that lovely young creatures like Ada and Inman have anything to apologize for. <br/><br/>Wouldn't this story have worked just as well in Nazi Germany? Outside of Stalingrad, 1943, there is a noble German infantryman named Innmann. Of course he has never heard about the Fuhrer's plans for the Jews! But when his beloved Gretchen writes him that the family farm is failing he makes the pure, noble, humanistic decision to desert his comrades and head home at once. On he treks, nobly crossing five thousand miles of Russian steppes in the dead of winter, fighting it out with hateful, misguided Russian partisans who insist on trying to kill him. (They just don't understand.) Finally, on the outskirts of Berlin, he is gunned down just short of his goal by -- oh, the tragic irony! the literary brilliance! -- a callow, overzealous member of the Hitler Youth.<br/><br/>A three hour movie about the sufferings of a Confederate soldier does not make it in my book. Inman got what he deserved. ""Those who deny freedom to others do not deserve it for themselves, and under a just God cannot long maintain it."" ABRAHAM LINCOLN"
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","1","1 February 2004"," Glossy, underwhelming adaptation
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>As usual with Minghella this is a glossy production with glamorous stars - Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger - and some great supporting actors - Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson, Eileen Atkins, Natalie Portman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, -- the list goes on and on: Ray Winstone (as the evil Teague) and Charlie Hunnam for once as an evil guy, Teague's Home Guard sidekick. The freshman Hunnam turns out to make a great evil guy, and Jude Law is every bit as handsome as the magazines always say he is. Nicole is a blooming dewy pink rose, even when laboring in the fields like a hired hand. Every hair is in place, even when they're out of place.<br/><br/>
Renée Zellweger, as Ruby, for a while unquestionably breathes quite unexpected life into a story that constantly loses energy and momentum. The Reverend Monroe (Sutherland) dies in a rainstorm; as in the Charles Frasier novel, Ada is quickly fading when left alone by her father's unexpected demise. The young Inman, despite the energy of his love for Ada, seems perpetually about to die. There's not much excitement in foregone conclusions. Ruby however comes in to save the citified Ada and with her jumpy energy and matter of fact coping skills she keeps the farm going. It's a charming but somewhat ambiguous performance, at once selfless (for the recent star of Chicago and Down with Love to look so comically dumpy) and attention-grabbing. The audience is thankful for it. Inman's `Odyssey' -- as he wanders from the hospital AWOL back home to his love, Ada - is a constant faltering. The movie would die on the vine completely without jerky, manic characters like the tireless Ruby and the wicked Junior (Giovanni Ribisi) to liven it up.<br/><br/>The battle sequence is extended beyond anything in Charles Frazier's book (which I think may owe something to Cormac McCarthy but lacks McCarthy's poetic prose and his epic sense of doom; and itself is constantly faltering), but it's still short, that battle, and it's so beautiful, with its Delacroix panoramas of flying limbs and nude torsos and explosions and mud, that you wish it were longer. It's the high point of the film. But it has little essential to do with the whole story. It's just a lovely, inspired tableau.<br/><br/>This is, basically, a teaser love story: two people meet a few times briefly. They're separated by a war; they are reunited very briefly, and it's over. When they first meet, a certain gap of station and money holds them apart but the chemistry is evident. The movie telescopes the romance but pumps up the smooching. The Civil War comes, and Inman goes off, but long before the couple has their passionate kiss Minghella has made it very clear they're totally gone on each other. In the book, Ada never actually sends a letter to Inman. They're in love in Charles Frazier's version; it's just that in the movie, with its emphasis on spectacle rather than inner experience (despite voiceovers), the romance has to be heavily underlined. There's no time in all the spectacle, it seems, to show it developing.<br/><br/>
There's an awful lot of killing, despite the battle being done with early on. The story emphasizes how dangerous the lives of people are away from the actual direct confrontations, with soldiers raping and pillaging. Even moms of suckling babes mow down enemy soldiers with shotguns. There's an implication that the South had to scare its people into loyalty: the Home Guard represents an evil element in the South. Teague and his boys in Cold Mountain, North Carolina, the place the deserter Inman is heading back to, are perpetually hunting down deserters and Federal sympathizers and terrorizing Ada. Teague wants her land, which he once owned, and her.<br/><br/>
This is too eventful a movie, made from too flat, rambling, and badly written a book. The adventures of Inman are constantly cut in with Ruby and Ada's progress toward friendship and self-sufficiency and so forth, but when Ada and Inman finally meet again it's one night of lovemaking and then Inman is killed by Charlie Hunnam's evil young Home Guard after a battle with him and Teague which Teague loses. And so the tease ends. Except that there's the epilogue where we see Ada happy with her `family,' Ruby, Georgia, her husband now, their children, her father, Sally the widow neighbor. . .a sunny scene, everyone together at a table outside and the musicians playing.<br/><br/>
The strongest emotion Cold Mountain evokes through its long length is horror at the brutality of war. It's like you're being cattle-prodded every five minutes: Look! Look! War bad! It's an anti-war story in some sense, but the romance powerfully dissipates the energy of anti-war sentiment. And Nicole, as so often lately, is too pretty and perfect. The inner lives of the two principals aren't evoked well enough for there to be much more than some romantic twinges in it, and some horror.<br/><br/>This may be Jude Law's best star turn yet in what has already been a distinguished and varied career, though one that has still lacked one great movie and one great role. Nicole is a splendid star, but too much so for the nitty gritty life Ruby is supposed to be taking her into. The two, Ada and Ruby, make an odd but charming combination.<br/><br/>What you're left with after Cold Mountain is over is no very strong emotional impression, just a sort of Classics Illustrated Comic Book kaleidoscope of vivid visual images expensively risen from their story boards. Previously Minghella made glossy stuff out of an arty novel, Ondatje's English Patient, and it was embraced by American audiences but seemed like a Masterpiece Theater mini-series all run at once more than a movie. Then he made glossy stuff out of a sort of camp classic, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and despite one or two terrific scenes it lost its edge through the wrong alterations. Now he has made glossy stuff out of a clumsily written Civil War epic, and the result falls flat. His movies are too full of themselves. Cold Mountain leaves you underwhelmed. The prettiness, the ugliness; the explosions; the kisses: it's all too much, and none of it adds up to anything in the end. The movie is fine as a spectacle and in its parts: if that were all movies were about, Minghella would be a great director."

","A great film; the best thing I've seen on the screen in recent memory (and this from someone who thinks the vast majority of major films these days are absolute crapola).  I was enthralled from the first moment to the last. Excellent acting by all concerned, outstanding visually, and an equally strong score.  When I finished the book a couple years ago, my reaction was: God, I hope they don't try and make a movie of this; they'll ruin it. Well, they made the movie, and it stayed true to the book; a minor masterpiece. And--will miracles never cease!--they didn't indulge in the political correctness I;d been dreading.<br/><br/>I'm astounded that so many reviewers here panned this movie.  Did I love this film just because I read the book?  I don't think so.  I think some of the people who panned it brought a post-modern sensibility to viewing it. I don't know what they expected; the latest Quentin Tarrantino comic book gore-fest, perhaps?  One reviewer said it wasn't nearly as good as the latest Lord of the The Rings movie (I wonder what that says about the juvenile nature of the culture we live in?).  Others decided (beforehand, perhaps)that Rene Zellweiger gave the outstanding performance while Kidman and Jude were terrible (maybe they felt that because Ms. Z didn't get the Oscar for ""Chicago"" she ""deserved"" the be the star of this film).  Her performance is terrific, but so is that of Kidman and Jude.<br/><br/>Yeah, this movie has gotten a lot of hype.  Is that what's motivating the nay-sayers? I don't really care if it's been hyped or not and I don't car if gets the over-rated Oscar.  It's an outstanding film no matter how you look at it.<br/><br/>Others complained that Kidman's and Jude's Southern accents were flawed. They weren't; I didn't notice any lapses at all, but that may have been because their respective performances were so it it over-rode any so-called lapses. I would never have guessed that Kidman was Australian, based on her dialog, which I found convincingly southern (my late grandmother hailed from Alabama, I might note).<br/><br/>I found the love affair between Ada and Inman thoroughly convincing. People DID fall in love in that era on the basis of much less than a kiss, and the letters which Inman 'reads' in his mind by way of Kidman's voice-over conveys the emotions nicely.  Again, I read the book, so the love affair came across even more strongly for me.<br/><br/>Yes, I'll go see Son of Lord of the Rings, or whatever it's called, and I'll probably enjoy it as much as it I did the previous 'Rings,' but on a different level.  Lord of the Rings is a kid's movie (even if it's the kid in all of us).  Cold Mountain is for adults.  Don't miss it!"
"El_General","5","0","1","13 January 2004"," Just a Bit too Cold
","Why is it that every friggin' year, a movie comes along that is made purely to win awards, mainly that gold statue everyone refers to ask ""Oscar""?  A couple years ago, here came ""Chocolat"" bumbling along in all it's sensual tastes that were bittersweet to most.  Last year, the literary tale ""The Hours"" was transformed into a psuedo-epic of triple proportions, and it seemed the only thing the movie was accomplishing was obtaining acting prizes.  So, here we are, another year, another Oscar season, and another Oscar-made production.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you ""Cold Mountain.""<br/><br/>Hmm, where shall I start?  Let's start with the movie itself.  The grand scale in which director Anthony Minghella paints his portrait of the ""South"" is relatively huge.  The landscapes are opulent, lush beyond your wildest dreams.  In fact, it rivals LOTR in the category of ""Beautiful Scenery."" The story isn't all that bad.  The writing isn't spectacular, but it probably will be nominated for reasons already mentioned.  The dreaminess of the film is all around beautiful, spectacular in all its shapes and colors, and the spectacle of such a view is unmatched in many parts of the world. (However, this movie was made in Romania, which continues the trend of artsy moviemakers moving their production sets around the world, and that doesn't fare well to the US)  The fault of the film does not lie with Minghella. In fact, I believe that he and Ms. Zellweger deserve nominations, if not wins. So, what exactly makes this movie subpar, or par in some people's eyes? Well, it's mainly the acting of Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>How many times is good ol' Jude gonna say with his faux-southern gruff tone the word ""Ada"" with a heavy accent on the ""D""?  Seriously, I thought he was, to put it bluntly, a meathead.  I'm not saying Jude is a horrible actor by no means.  In fact, at the beginning of the movie, it seemed to me that he was going to have a breakout performance, one of those ""quiet and subtle"" performances that Benicio Del Toro has perfected.  However, by the end of the movie, I saw how much Jude failed in his quest to be a leading man. His character didn't change.  Period.  He was the same rumbling, bumbling, stumbling baffoon who left Cold Mountain at the beginning of the movie. Such a shame.  Nicole Kidman, on the other hand, does less with the little she is given.  She's a remarkable actress, maybe the best of our time (although highly debatable), but she just doesn't do anything special here to merit a nomination, although many ""experts"" have her picked to be nominated.  She looks quite radiant in her belle costume, but not much of that radiation gets to the audience.  She is quickly turned upside down by the appearance of Renee Zellweger, who STEALS THE MOVIE!  I haven't seen such a remarkable performance by a supporting actress in quite some time. I even forgot it was her.  It may be Oscar grandstanding in a movie full of attempts at Oscar grandstanding, but this one is genuine in my mind.  She struts around, openly showing her accent and womanly power as if she had possessed it all her life.  Such an extravagent performance in an otherwise dull adaption.<br/><br/>Final Grade:  C+"
"kellyadmirer","6","0","1","19 January 2004"," Weak unintentional remake of, well, you know
","I know, I know, this is the film of some fairly recent book that everybody loves. Well, to me it is just a lame remake of ""Gone With The Wind"" that is dumbed down for the modern era, with several essential ingredients removed because the film-makers probably feel they are too sophisticated for modern audiences to grasp. Girl falls for handsome dude, the Civil War is declared, everybody down on the plantation thinks this is just the coolest thing, handsome dude goes off to war, war is hell, girl's daddy dies leaving her to fend for herself, girl has a hard time keeping Tara, err, I mean the family farm going, handsome dude returns home all roughed up, girl and handsome dude ultimately wind up not together after all. The best part of ""Wind,"" Rhett Butler, is missing and replaced with the vastly inferior character played by Jude Law, and that isn't the only reason this is a lesser film.<br/><br/>I will give credit where it is due. Renee Zellwegger absolutely steals the movie and runs around the block with it. Her character is refreshing and easily the best thing in the film. Some of the other supporting characters, such as Natalie Portman as a war widow in dire need of assistance, do fine work.<br/><br/>But the list of faults is greater than the list of virtues. Jude Law is stiff and even more inarticulate than his character could possibly call for. Nicole Kidman is simply too old for the part of a naive preacher's daughter blushingly falling in love for the first time, and it is unbelievable that she continues looking daisy fresh even while supposedly suffering the greatest of privations. Donald Sutherland sleepwalks through his role as Kidman's father. The villains are one-dimensional and unbelievable, and the background townspeople who would have been a major factor in such peoples' lives pretty much non-existent with a few notable exceptions. There is a notable and inexplicable paucity of African-Americans, by the way, they seem to get thrown in for atmosphere once in a while and then disappear without a trace.<br/><br/>War is hell, and this movie keeps hitting us over the head with that inarguable fact. Fluff it up with a few soap opera moments (women getting pregnant after one romance-novel type of encounter, for instance), some obvious foreshadowing (no, don't split up before going back down that mountain, someone always gets killed when that happens!), some really unnecessary and obscure plot complications with symbolism that just bangs away at your head like a gong (having a preacher try to throw a slave off a mountain after drugging her up but getting stopped from doing so by our oh-so-pure hero, then have that same preacher coincidentally save our hero later, what exactly were the screenwriters smoking anyway?) and you have ""Cold Mountain.""<br/><br/>I have a pet peeve about films told out of sequence like this one. It is becoming a common tactic to tell films out of chronological order. The directors who do this are just telegraphing that they feel the story is insufficient to carry the film without tricks. This was terrific in ""Slaughterhouse Five"" thirty years ago, but is suddenly being used in films where it is pointless - as here. The most egregious recent example was ""21 Grams,"" where it was difficult to tell what the heck was going on despite the simple plot. There is absolutely no reason to tell ""Cold Mountain"" outside of normal order, and I hope this Hollywood fad passes away quickly. Please stop!<br/><br/>I like history-based dramas. There was enough good acting and enough action and plot complications to keep my interest. This film, though, is not nearly as good as the hype it is getting as the big Oscar candidate this year. Zellwegger may deserve honors, but the rest of the film is just one step above dull."
"Red66","7","0","1","19 January 2004"," Law Soars, Kidman miscast.
","WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! The main aspect of ""Cold Mountain"" that resonates with me is<br/><br/>Jude Law's haunting performance. For most of the film, Law is<br/><br/>required to act with just his face and he conveys much complex<br/><br/>emotion and turmoil within his eyes. I was again reminded of what<br/><br/>a truly splendid actor Mr. Law is. It's so easy to get caught up in his<br/><br/>equally splendid beauty and forget that he is certainly one of the<br/><br/>top five best young actors of today. The only problem is that there<br/><br/>is absolutely ZERO chemistry between Law and Nicole Kidman,<br/><br/>which makes the film's central love story fall flat on it's face.<br/><br/>Kidman is fine--she's pretty much on auto pilot, which, even for<br/><br/>her, is far more compelling than most of her contemporaries. But,<br/><br/>it's impossible to believe her agony and struggle over the man she<br/><br/>loves, when you aren't convinced she actually loves him. Plus,<br/><br/>she's too old for the role. Natalie Portman would have made a<br/><br/>more believable  virginal daughter of a minister (in fact, Portman<br/><br/>contributes a compelling cameo). Law is on the borderline of<br/><br/>being too old as well, but he can pass for a man in his<br/><br/>late-twenties. Also, to nit pick--how could starving, unwashed<br/><br/>people from the 1860's have such perfect white teeth? Every time<br/><br/>Law smiles through his bearded dirty visage and flashed those<br/><br/>pearly whites, I just thought of modern dentistry. At least knock the<br/><br/>color down a shade or two. In the cameo department (which<br/><br/>comes close to a ""Love Boat"" episode), Phillip Seymour Hoffman<br/><br/>is exquisite--deserves an Oscar nod as usual; Zellweger<br/><br/>continues to proves herself and steals every scene from Kidman;<br/><br/>and, once you get use to the bad wig, Charlie Hunnam is<br/><br/>surprisingly up for his deliciously evil role. This boy may have<br/><br/>some range. The cinematography is gorgeous and the art<br/><br/>direction is spot on. Overall, the film is enjoyable and offers some<br/><br/>great performances. But it is the miscasting of Kidman that keeps<br/><br/>the film from truly soaring. I say this as a huge fan of Ms. Kidman's<br/><br/>work, who I think  deserved the Oscar for Moulin Rouge, and a nod<br/><br/>for ""Too Die For."""
"ferguson-6","7","0","1","3 January 2004"," Awright Then ... a rooster, a goat, a fiddle and Zeger
","Greetings again from the darkness.  My first movie of 2004 has already shown up on most critic's top 10 list for last year so my expectations were high, yet tempered with the knowledge that director Anthony Minghella was responsible for ""The English Patient"" (the focus of one of the funniest ""Seinfeld"" episodes).  What an unbelievable cast Minghella assembled.  Every scene brought a recognizable star.  However, as feared, the story is excruciatingly predictable throughout.  The wonderful performances make the movie quite watchable, but never should such a predictable story land on a best movie list of any respectable film lover.  Surprisingly, Renee' Zellweger is most impressive in her quite less-than-glamourous role while firing off one liners to pick up the pace in the painfully slow dialogue. The stellar cast includes the leads, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman and the celebrity baggage associated.  Young stars such as Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi and Charlie Hunnam (""Nicolas Nickelby"") are joined by screen vets such as Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson and the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Especially effective and creepy is Hunnam.  Biggest question I have is, why so many foreign actors in a civil war picture?  The battle scenes are filmed wonderfully and the countryside alternates between beautiful and stark and with hope and desperation.  Law and Kidman are fine in the leads, but really have little to do other than look longingly into the lens.  While Minghella knows how to craft a beautiful film, he has yet to figure out how to write a unique screenplay."
"FilmSnobby","5","0","1","3 January 2004"," A better-than-usual Miramax picture.
","But let's not get too carried away.  *Cold Mountain*  emerges as a profoundly unadventurous film.  It's devoid of ambiguities . . . an unforgivable thing, given the setting of the Civil War, and the subject, which is the desertion of a Confederate soldier  (Jude Law)  who forsakes ""the Cause""  in order to return home to his wallflower Southern belle (Nicole Kidman).  This movie was based on a  ""prize-winning""  novel by Charles Frazier.  The story could withstand some improvement.  For instance, let's make things interesting by having Jude Law be a UNION soldier.  Let's challenge that multiplex audience just a bit.  Because after all, the ""moral problem""  of this picture as it now stands -- e.g., the hero's placing of higher importance on his love-life over his country -- has been solved far in advance.  OF COURSE any sensible fellow would desert the evil Confederate Army in order to get back to luminous Nicole.  Nicole is a worthier cause than States Rights . . . but is she worthier than Abolition? Ah . . . now the scene would begin to cloud, a bit.  And the Home Guard (who patrol the local area looking for deserters and otherwise  ""assisting"" those who remain home), represented by an unrecognizable Ray Winstone and several other heavies, provides the audience with straw men hissable enough to leave no doubt as to the justice of Law's desertion.  Or, if we must insist on keeping Law as a Confederate, why not make the Home Guard a bunch of nice old guys, rather than Winstone's murderous mercenary who also has a pecuniary interest in Kidman's property?  Or, even further, why not have the women at home remain fiercely patriotic, who would consider a deserter a gutless coward?  Then Law would actually have to WOO Kidman, a task he otherwise gets to avoid in this movie  (apparently, his suffering baby-blues are sufficient to make the lady weak in the knees, without the demonstration of any other virtues).<br/><br/>But to ask for any of these possibilities is to ask too much from the likes of Miramax studio, and the wise viewer will regretfully put such considerations aside and cast about for other things to enjoy.  The fundamental emptiness of  *Cold Mountain*  gets redeemed by a number of things, starting with Anthony Minghella's expert direction, particularly with regards to the difficult time structure in the first half.  The picture is graced with astounding cinematography all the way through, but especially near the beginning during the siege of Petersburg:  the gigantic pit caused by a large underground explosion, and the resultant  ""turkey shoot""  by the Confederates after the Federals stupidly rush in, is smeared over with a dank, sulfurous haze, making the scene look like something from Hell itself. (The movie is otherwise gorgeous as hell.)  And finally, a large cast of well-known faces contributes, rather than distracts:  Philip Seymour Hoffman gets another opportunity to give a flashy performance; Brendan Gleeson, Kathy Baker, and Ray Winstone  (despite the phoniness of his part)  all provide strong support.  But praise is especially deserving to two young actresses:  Natalie Portman as a widow with a sick baby whom Law encounters on his trek home; and the wonderful Renee Zellweger as a sort of prototypical white-trash tomboy named Ruby.  Portman surprisingly, and magnificently, aces the crucial cameo part of the desperate widow . . . and Zellweger steals the entire movie out from under everybody's feet.  (Kidman knows it, and doesn't even bother to challenge Zellweger for supremacy in their scenes together.)  Once Ruby is -- finally -- introduced  (it takes almost an hour), the rest of the movie is basically a waiting game:  we wait for the next scene with Zellweger, and become indefatigably bored with the dour young man trudging homeward.  In fact, we didn't realize how bored we were with  *Cold Mountain*  until she shows up.  It's the serio-comic performance of the year, and the  ""Academy""  should feel free to give her a long overdue Oscar for it.  She makes this otherwise dutifully anti-war picture  (and hence, rightfully unpopular picture, given our current circumstances)  well worth seeing."
"MLDinTN","Null","0","1","30 December 2003"," If the love story would have been more believable...
","this movie would have been so much better.  While an ""epic"" film like Gladiator really makes you feel for Maximus and root for him because his troubles are written well, this movie feels cold because the 2 lead characters barely knew each other before being separated.  They should have fell in love and been engaged or something before Inman gets sent to war. It seemed boring in places, but since I have read the book, I think that comes more from the book.  I didn't think the book was that great either.  Renee Zellweger saves the day as Ruby. She was the best actor in the film and got all the great lines.  Also, the first battle scene is not for the sequemish. We get some close ups of swords going through bodies that is gross.  But, I like war movies, so I thought it was great.  Also, it seemed to me that Nicole Kidman lost her southern accent at times. I found that annoying; plus the accent she used was way over the top.  Everyone from the south doesn't sound like a mountain hillbilly.  Not to mention for someone who was supposed to be starving, Ada's hair and skin always seemed perfect.<br/><br/>
Another question I had was why did that young blond bad guy not have to go to war?  Instead he got to play deputy even though he was in the age range to fight.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  This certainly isn't one of the best movies I have seen, but it is better than a lot of films out there.  Teens probably won't like it, but I recommend it for the older crowd."
"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","1","13 January 2004"," generally worthy of praise
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>It's hard to know where to start with ""Cold Mountain"". It's basically excellent.<br/><br/>In this film your faced with the ever popular story of the young in love couple, who yearn for each other across distances and change as people before meeting once more. Add to this mix an array of different characters with stories of their own and you basically have an Oscar's favourite.<br/><br/>The thing with ""Cold Mountain"" is that I do find it very hard to judge, and I'm not surprised by it's mixed reviews. This film for me is a display of how to do something technically very well. The acting is superb, the soundtrack excellent, and the general feel of the film stunning. The problem is that whilst some reviewers will use these qualities, some will look more to if it actually makes the mark with it's plot. Truthfully, I find myself flipping either way between whether it does or not. The problem with the plot of ""Cold Mountain"" is that I can't help but feel that it's a bit too long. For all the random people in it, some of them do provide alternative viewpoints which are necessary, but some of them feel slightly too drawn out.<br/><br/>If I had to choose four things about this movie, which really make it stand out as a film to watch, I'd choose Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, the occasional beautiful landscape, and Cillian Murphy. To those who are unaware of who he is, your most likely to recognise the actor as Jim in ""28 Days Later"", however he is also in another of this years big films as Pieter in ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"". Murphy in ""Cold Mountain"" plays a Yankie fighter who finds himself at the home of Natalie Portman and who is starving. As his two friends forsake their morals for food and for sexual gratification, Murphy shows a sign that for all the fighting in the war, people on both sides have moral problems with events and find themselves unable to act upon others misdemenors.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I'd recommend to everyone that you go watch this film. For the romantics there is a beautiful love story, for the violence enthusiasts out there, there is a lot of fake blood and violence, and for those who want to know how to create a successful, technically superb movie, there is ""Cold Mountain""."

"Ronin47","5","0","1","8 January 2004"," Well, the last hour is good (**1/2)
","Miramax's ""gimme some Oscars!"" movie for this year, ""Cold Mountain"" is a distant and rather empty movie, but does manage to become pretty involving in its last hour. You just have to get through an extremely bumpy hour and a half to get to it, which isn't really worth it if you ask me.<br/><br/>
Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the several European actors trying on southern accents here (well, Nicole Kidman is Australian, but you know what I mean), as two southern lovebirds during the Civil War who barely let each other know of their feelings before Law's character, Inman, leaves for war. Kidman's Ada is then left home to fend for herself, after her preacher father (Donald Sutherland) dies and leaves her broke and hungry.<br/><br/>
Near the start of the film is a huge battle sequence that in my opinion is not very well filmed, with its fake-looking, orange CG sky and comically overbearing choir music. Hospitalized soon after, Inman decides to desert and head home to Ada. <br/><br/>And that's basically the meat of the story, we cut back and forth between Inman's journey on foot home (crossing paths with several would-be interesting people, but the only actually interesting one is played by Natalie Portman) and Ada's struggle to survive at home, with the help of a sassy local woman, Ruby (Renee Zellweger). <br/><br/>After solidly disliking ""Cold Mountain"" for a long time, I was surprised to actually become quite involved in the last hour, when the plight that Ada and Ruby are facing becomes genuinely interesting and suspenseful, especially when dealing with the intriguing neighbor played by Kathy Baker. Kidman's character finally becomes interesting and so does Zellweger's, who seemed overbearing at first, but suddenly becomes likeable and sympathetic.<br/><br/>
In a nutshell, ""Cold Mountain"" is pretty to look at and has good performances, but it's cold and remote for the most part, and only comes alive in a few isolated scenes. Pretty much like the other two Anthony Minghella films I've seen (""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""). <br/><br/>One note of interest is that it does feature the first and not-bad-at-all acting performance by Jack White of the phenomenal rock band the White Stripes, playing one of the members of Ada's father's bluegrass band. That's pretty cool, I guess."
