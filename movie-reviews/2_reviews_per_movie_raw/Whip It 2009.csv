"Mortalias","8","65","83","4 October 2009"," Fantastic directoral debut
","Drew Barrymore is well known for her quirky acting and distinct personality. But now movie goers across the country will begin seeing her in a new light- director.<br/><br/>""Whip It,"" which stars Ellen Page (Juno), Marcia Harden, and several other notable actors/actresses is a fun filled, action packed, emotional film that forces you to give an old fashioned thumbs up as you leave.<br/><br/>Page is fantastic in her role, perfectly capturing the rebellious, curious character of Bliss Cavendar. Her innocent face leaves you rooting for her while at the same time wondering if her decisions are ultimately right. Harden again plays her role flawlessly, down to her own hidden dreams disguised under her thick shell.<br/><br/>Unlike most ""rise to the top"" movies, Whip It is believable. It seems real at all times. It feels as though all of us at one point in our lives were like Bliss, longing to live a different life.<br/><br/>If you want a great night at the movies, if you want a solid movie with enjoyable memories, and if you want to answer that question of ""I wonder how Drew Barrymore would be as a director,"" go see Whip It. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
"larry-411","8","62","86","24 September 2009"," Drew Barrymore + Ellen Page = a winning team
","I attended the World Premiere of ""Whip It"" at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. This is quite an impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore (who also stars).<br/><br/>Barrymore works with a Shauna Cross script (based on her own novel Derby Girl) and an all-star cast featuring Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Daniel Stern, Kristen Wiig, Landon Pigg, Jimmy Fallon, Eve, and Juliette Lewis.<br/><br/>Page is Bliss Cavendar, whose mother (Harden) sees her daughter in gowns and crowns as she continues the family tradition of winning beauty pageant trophies. But Bliss' chance encounter with a group of roller skating girls plants other ideas in her head. Austin, Texas happens to host a roller derby league, it's not too far away, and Bliss finally sees a way out of her town (and gown). This sets up a family confrontation that is the stuff of classic coming-of-age stories.<br/><br/>The film starts out slow then whips into action, its brilliant ensemble cast hitting its stride and functioning like a winning roller derby team (without the bruises). Then just when you think ""Whip It"" is headed into sports rom-com cliché territory, surprising twists keep it original and refreshing. But despite the multitude of talented actors, Page clearly carries the film on her diminutive shoulders and is easily in control of the material.<br/><br/>Production values are naturally first rate, with a vivid color palette and in-your-face costumes that are occasionally (and appropriately) over the top. Cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman and editor Dylan Tichenor work perfectly in sync by reflecting both the snail's pace of Bliss' home life vs. the secret one that flies on wheels around the Austin track. Camera-work places the viewer directly into the action. Despite having been filmed primarily in Michigan (due to favorable tax credits) the Austin scenes are prominent, placing its landmarks in a warm, affectionate light. One benefit of a big budget is the ability to purchase music rights, and the result is a killer soundtrack that will have the audience singing along. Be sure to stay for the second of the two closing credits songs, the best ever cover of one of the greatest rock 'n roll love songs of all time, The Association's ""Never My Love."" Fox Searchlight scores again with Ellen Page, just like they did in 2007 with ""Juno."" Unlike that (at the time) dark horse, this is no little indie. This is classic Hollywood comedy. ""Whip It"" is another crowd pleaser to add to this year's must-see list."
"tomthumb1","9","96","138","13 September 2009"," Congratulations Drew, you've done yourself proud!
","If you like to be entertained and you enjoy seeing some of the best actresses working today, you should see this film. Ellen Page is a delight. I thought she did more with this role than she did with Juno. Kristen Wiig was her usual funny self, The rest of the cast, including Zoe Bell (excellent in Tarantino's Deathproof), Juliette Lewis, Marcia Gay Harding, Daniel Stern, Drew, Jimmy Fallon, all performed well. That says something about Drew's directing. She elicited excellent performances out of her cast, the film was well shot, the sound and editing were nicely done and I look forward to seeing what Drew can do on her next effort.<br/><br/>The premiere of Whip It, which took place on September 13th, 2009 at TIFF was enthusiastically well received by the audience.<br/><br/>And by the way Drew, you looked smashing at the premiere! Congratulations!"

","In a sense this is a 6 or 7: a kind of kookie inspirational sports movie - fun, energetic, easy to watch and easy to like.<br/><br/>However it gets a 9 because I cannot recall any film that truly takes the conventions that male cinema does so well and wholesale translate them to something that girls will love.<br/><br/>This film isn't sappy but it isn't about masculine heroism - it is about women having a great time being truly what they are - not 1950 prissies, but punky, spikey, ironic, sexy and just plain fun.<br/><br/>Whip It has great roller derby sequences but more than that and more than most male sports movies we get to see the personalities of those involved and they shine.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore knows films - she's being doing it all her life - and this may look lightweight and simple, but the way the camera tells the story is excellent - it is all well-composed and supported by a tip-top script and a great cast. The romantic interest is too good-looking (of course) and above all this is a film that will hit the target with girls and women - but I promise you guys will really like it too.<br/><br/>Almost impossible not to enjoy we loved its free spirit and would recommend it heartily to teenage girls as a film about doing your thing and being strong."
"ScreamingBlackEyedPea","10","81","126","11 September 2009"," Drew Barrymore did this one very well...
","I attended a screening of this on Wednesday night (the 9th) with a Q&A with Drew after the movie. This movie was superb. It was done very well. I really liked the score and the music selection (from Peaches to MGMT) was amazing. The story is really good and so realistic...it wasn't cheap. Drew said she wanted to direct this movie because it was close to her heart, and you can tell it is because of the final product. You can tell she put a lot of effort into this one. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden were GREAT in this! I loved every scene they were in together...(btw, Drew was REALLY nice and answered my question). Kristen Wiig, Juliette Lewis, Drew, Landon Pigg, and the young lady who plays Bliss's best friend Pash (I forget this actress's name) were wonderful. There is everything in this movie...romance, drama, mild humorous violence, and comedy. The film also explained the sport of roller derbying very well. Good research Drew! My final rating: 9.5/10 GO SEE IT!"
"etniesfootwear07","8","57","90","2 October 2009"," Surprisingly Good
","Enticed by free t-shirts and comfortable seats, two of my friends and I made the journey to Alexandria last Saturday to catch the sneak Preview of Whip It. Upon our arrival, our expectations were not high, as none of us were fans of Drew Barrymore.<br/><br/>Once the movie began, however, our opinions quickly changed. Drew Barrymore may not be the best actor, but she definitely has chops at directing. Whip It is the tale of a girl who hates life in a small town so she decides to rebel by joining a roller derby team with often comedic results. The movie is much better than plot may sound. It has some cliché moments but definitely beats the standard chick flick.<br/><br/>The film had a very unique feel, shifting between humorous and hipster-esquire scenes. This also was probably my biggest problem with the movie. The comedy often reminded me of something out of an Owen Wilson film but then the dramatic scenes reminded me of something more hip than Juno. That being said, the movie was much funnier than the average chick flick.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is superb as usual, taking on a somewhat different role than what I've seen before. It's impossible to compare her to her role in Juno, as in Whip It she plays a much more introverted, but still conflicted girl.<br/><br/>Andrew Wilson was probably the funniest character in the movie. I'm actually wondering where this guy came from. The other two Wilson brothers are huge and this guy just comes out of nowhere. Hopefully we'll see more of him, as he is just as funny as Owen and Luke.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore had a very small role in the movie. The few scenes she is in are certainly not ruined by her. Landon Pigg should probably stick to music, or maybe even quit that because he sucks at that. He is not an actor, and that was prevalent throughout the movie. Jimmy Fallon provided a solid array of one-liners as the quirky announcer for the games.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was solid, including Marcia Gay Harden as the strict but loving mother. Juliette Lewis is good as the over-the-top, intense player who takes things way too seriously. Alia Shawkat I couldn't stand but I just can't stand her in general.<br/><br/>This movie definitely goes far beyond what any average chick flick would. In fact it's hard to classify it as such, as I found it good and I'm a dude. All things considered it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of hip movies or just comedy in general."
"LittleLotti","8","4","4","23 February 2018"," Underrated Movie Gold
","Drew Barrymore created a stunning film with Shauna Cross's script, and you would never know it was her first time directing. The characters and story are so well crafted and there's never a dull moment.
I love the way this movie feels nostalgic and makes you remember that time in your life where you're trying to figure out who you are, and you have that one best friend that gets you through the tough times. I'm impressed by the actresses' skating abilities and making this all look so natural to them. Marcia Gay Harden is total perfection as Bliss Cavendar's mother, bringing such a realness to her character, and Ellen Page and Alia Shawkat have realistic chemistry that pulls you into their friendship.
This isn't a raunchy movie and I find it totally enjoyable. I can watch this movie over and over and I never get sick of it - it's become a classic for sure!"
"Troy_Campbell","8","23","36","10 October 2009"," Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is a little gem
","Drew Barrymore's directorial debut is a little gem. It could have been called Juno on Skates, such are the comparisons, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Sure, Bliss Cavendar is almost identical to Juno MacGuff (and not just because Ellen Page plays them both), it follows a similar 'finding oneself' story arc, there are eccentric yet lovable parents and it prides itself on the unique dialogue flowing throughout; however Whip It has something up its sleeve to give it its own recognisable edge – roller-derby. Fun doesn't come any thicker, faster or sillier than roller-derbying. Barrymore understands this and appropriately places the underground sport front and centre. The editing is occasionally too quick meaning you can't always see what is going on, but you are caught up in the atmosphere so much it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Beneath the action is a coming-of-age tale that wears its heart on its sleeve and bears all. Despite being slightly predictable and clichéd, real life roller-derby competitor Shauna Cross' screenplay (adapted from her own book) makes up for it with razor-sharp dialogue (""I can grow the balls"") and genuinely intriguing characters. Not to mention the comedy littered throughout; never laugh-out-loud moments but you'll be chuckling from start to finish. The romance subplot could have been left out though, it doesn't hold your interest like the other story elements and feels slightly unnecessary.<br/><br/>Undeniably cute once again, Ellen Page stamps her A-list spot with another splendid, oddly appealing performance. Page's serious acting chops are matched by her superb comic timing as she proves that she is one of the finest young actors coming through today. The huge supporting cast is letdown by no-one; Kristen Wiig the pick of the bunch, her deadpan humour is hilarious and she is surely another actress we will see more of in the future. A special mention to Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern as well, they play Bliss' old folks with warmth and likability, never allowing them to become the typical misunderstanding parents you often find in these movies.<br/><br/>A laugh-a-minute affair with a bigger than average heart. Throw in a terrific little indie soundtrack and you have yourself a must-see movie.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"
"imdb-541-285796","10","39","66","28 September 2009"," Awesome! Drew banged it out with this one...
","Caught a preview of this and was really glad I did. The writing and characters were very genuine. There were lots of laughs and emotion and great moments you can't help but root for the girls. Drew, Ellen, Alia, Kristin, Marcia, Juliet, Eve and the rest just tore it up on the screen. It was nice to see some of these girls, like Drew & Kristin, in roles as real people as opposed to just caricature's. I never knew how roller derby was even played but now I'm gonna look for a local league to go watch - those girls rock! I ended the film feeling like I was best buds with all of them. This definitely shows that Drew will have quite a career directing and that Juno wasn't a one-hit-wonder for Ellen, either. You won't want to miss this one."
"powellk15","8","31","58","15 September 2009"," Great flick - Go see Whip It when it comes out!
","While it's a coming of age story we've seen before the film being set against roller derby makes it's something new and different. I saw this movie yesterday at TIFF and the screenwriter was there for the Q&A. This story is taken from her experiences discovering roller derby and many of the characters are based on real people. The writer is also from Texas and grew up near Austin where the story is set. Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden are excellent and the mother/daughter scenes are very real. Ellen Page did all her own stunts - learning to skate which adds a lot to the movie. Many of the older actresses did many of their stunts as well so the wipe outs and the scrapes and bruises are real!! Kristen Wigg is also great - one of the first times I've seen her be a real person on screen instead of just a funny character."
"imdb-60","9","24","45","28 September 2009"," Bend It Like Beckham on Roller Skates
","Whip It and Bend It Like Beckham are so similar, but so much different. Both tell the stories of teenage girls who sneak away to participate in sports, Soccer and Roller Derby. <br/><br/>Both girls have crushes and relationships with the opposite sex, both end differently.<br/><br/>The main difference in Whip It, which makes the film really stand out, is the relationship with Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) and her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). This is the main theme of the movie and is beautifully developed. Drew Barrymore said she was drawn to the script because of mother-daughter theme. Drew and her mom have had problems and wanted to do the story because of it.<br/><br/>Bliss grows up in a small town (Bodine) in Texas, which is on the outskirts of Austin. Watch for the part when Bliss and her friend Pash dance to the Dolly Parton song Jolene, and change the words to Bodine. One day while shopping in Austin she picks up a flyer for the local Roller Derby team, the Hurl Scouts. Bliss talks her best friend. played by Alia Shswkat, into driving her into Austin to watch an actual game. She is invited after the game by Maggie Mayhem to attend a tryout to make the team.<br/><br/>Drew said she was attracted to the sport of Roller Derby by the crowd. When she attended an event, she looked around and saw yuppies, blue collar workers, teenagers, families, and just a wide range of people. All drawn to the sport of Roller Derby.<br/><br/>The book was written by Shauna Cross who based her experience on her career with the LA Derby Dolls. Shauna skated with them as Maggie Mayhem (played by Kristen Wiig). Shauna was looking for a tennis partner and searched Craigslist for one, and found an ad for Roller Derby, which started her career.<br/><br/>Drew made some additions to the script. A fan of the hockey movie ""Slap Shop"" and the characters the Hanson Brothers, she came up with the Manson Sisters for Whip It. They play silent but deadly teammates on the Hurl Scouts. A little hard of hearing or not caring to, they walk by the white board with a play diagrammed, look, and just keep walking. They are played by LA Derby Dolls skaters Kristen ""Krissy Krash"" Adolfi and Rachel ""Iron Maiven"". Adolfi and Piplica are teammates on LADD's Tough Cookies, on whom the film's fictionalized Hurl Scouts are based. <br/><br/>Landon Pigg goes from musician to his first acting role, as Bliss' love interest. I think this is the only scene of making out under water I have ever seen.<br/><br/>If some of the blood and bruises look real .. they are !! Most of the actors did their own skating and had their share of mishaps. Bliss (Ellen Page) was trained by LA Derby Doll's Axle of Evil. Drew suffered a huge bruise on her thigh while wrestling with one of the trainers. During the training, some of the actors would yell out ""I am hurting"" and the trainers would yell back ""Keep Skating"".<br/><br/>The movie scenes of Roller Derby action look extremely real as Drew used hand held cameras for a lot of the action. A huge crane in the middle of the track took shots from high above and also went down close to the action.<br/><br/>The moral of the movie (per Drew) is finding yourself, to get out there and do things, to improve yourself, and to pick yourself up and keep trying.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to one and all."
"mistoppi","9","5","7","19 April 2016"," Touching, thrilling & delighting!
","I got curious about this movie because I've been interested in roller derby (while the last time I roller skated was around time when I was 7-10, oops), because the movie has so many women on it, and lastly because Zoë Bell is in the film. It's always a pleasure to see her work on screen, whether it's acting or stunts.<br/><br/>While I've never been into sports, or sport films, I loved Whip It! The matches between the leagues were so intense and thrilling! <br/><br/>I'm so delighted because of how many women were in this film, not just the characters but the director and writer as well. And there are so many different kind of female characters in the story, all having their own ideologies, all having different personalities. There are characters who are so typical good characters, but they are still interesting. There are assertive women, violent women, competitive women, mean women, nice women, mothers, daughters... So many different kind of characters. It's almost rare, because so many films have around 80 % male characters. <br/><br/>The structure of this film may be quite predictable, but the other qualities of Whip It make up for that - the story is emotional in many different ways, and it's just fun to watch. And after all, isn't most of Hollywood pretty predictable these days? And the story has many different levels, it's not just about the sport. It's about the main character Bliss growing up, it's about her relationships with her parents, her friends, the friends and rivals she makes while playing roller derby. And while the main point of the film is Bliss finding her passion and what makes her happy, the story doesn't forget all the other details that push her forward or pull her back.<br/><br/>The music was well chosen. It keeps the viewer psyched, and the songs work when you're listening to them outside of the movie. I have several of them on my playlists.<br/><br/>Simply put, Whip It is an amazing movie. It touches, thrills and delights. There's only one thing I'd change, and it would be deleting most of the useless heterosexual romances and add some women loving women there. It would suit the film and make it so much more better, but I'm happy with what I got."

But this film is likable and cute in a very good way. <br/><br/>The story of an off-beat 17 year old, well played by Ellen Page, finding herself by secretly joining the roller derby in Austin, Texas may be clichéd on the surface, but the lovely character detail and successfully offbeat casting make the film a quirky, likable winner. <br/><br/>Not a great film, nor an ""important"" one, but one I enjoyed and was never bored by. And at a time where most Hollywood ""entertainment"" centers around blowing stuff up, its nice to see a mainstream film with rich characters and a big heart."

","This movie was not as good as I thought it would be. Ellen Page is sweet and she is obviously very talented. However, she is starting to come off as a whiner to me. She was not quite as sarcastic, and she did not try to be as ""cool"" as she was in Juno, but she is still a little annoying for some reason. Drew Barrymore's performance was really disappointing to me. I felt she did very little and her role was almost a ""cameo"". She just pops up from time to time, says very little, and tries to act tough. Also, let me ask you this? Does Ellen Page look 21? No, she looks like she is 14. How in the world are her teammates surprised when they find out she is only 17? Also, being a person who has roller skated for over 30 years, I guess I found it hard to believe that Bliss would be the fastest person out there when they were doing time trials. She looked slow and awkward. They guy that Bliss falls for looks like a loser. My wife was like, ""why is she even bothering with that ugly guy?"" I didn't get it.<br/><br/>I hate to bash this movie, because I was really looking forward to seeing it. However, I am finding it hard to say something good about it. Juliette Lewis actually gave one of the best performances in the movie. She is one of the few who actually pulled off the ""edgy, tough roller-girl"" persona. This movie was nothing special, and the box office returns will show it."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Disappointing, yet entertaining film version of the Shauna Cross novel brought to us by first time director Drew Barrymore. I say disappointing because it really looks like they filmed the rough draft of the screenplay. It could have been so much more with a little effort and work on the script. Entertaining for all the other reasons! <br/><br/>First, this is Ellen Page's film ... she not only carries the Hurl Scouts into the championship game, she also carries most every scene in the film. She gets some nice support work from Alia Shawkat as her best friend Pash, as well as the lost Wilson brother, Andrew, who makes for a very interesting Roller Derby coach! Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern star as Page's mismatched parents. Harden is the one time beauty pageant queen pushing her daughter that direction, while Stern is the sports loving dad seemingly stuck with two daughters and a very controlling wife.<br/><br/>Nice to see stuntwoman supreme Zoe Bell get another real acting gig after stealing Tarantino's Death Proof, and Juliette Lewis really chomps down on her role as the jealous oldtimer in the league. Sadly Kristen Wiig has little to do here and Jimmy Fallon is just way over the top as the ring announcer. Singer Landon Pigg has an odd turn as Page's first love interest - mostly wasted screen time that could have been better spent.<br/><br/>Would have really enjoyed a bit more character development as there are certainly no shortage of potential jackpots. Stay for the end and check out the credits ... not sure I have ever seen more individual songs in one film."

","When drama is rushed it can feel like the slowest thing in the world. The characters never get any time to breathe. The turmoil that they go through feels so compact, tidy, and meager that it's like your watching nothing at all. The quest for life's answers in the ""missunderstood teenager"" way, with the mandatory pushy mother and the quiet but understanding father seems like a subject done before. This movie is way too bland, stale, and unbelievable to really find the heart. I compare it to Bend it like Beckham, but without the good, funny or interesting parts. I liked the idea of this film, it had potential. Ellen Paige is great, as always, but the rest of the cast could have been exchanged for puppets and no on would have been able to tell the difference. I thought the ending too obvious and forced compared to the rest of it, and needed a more inspired and extended premise and execution for fullest success. It seemed rushed and inconsistent with the buildup to it. The movie is, too be frank, about a bunch of girl riding around in circles on rollerskating. And just as exiting as that sounds."

In this case, it didn't.<br/><br/>I suffered through more than one hour of this sloppily directed, poorly written trash before deciding not to waste another 45 or so minutes of my life I would never get back. The only redeeming element of this trash can chick flick was the acting. Ellen Page and Alia Shawkat are both fine actresses, and Marcia Gay Harden was good even in her boring, cliché conservative mother role.<br/><br/>Aside from that, there was nothing. Nothing aside from Drew Barrymore trying her hand at being a good indie director... and failing miserably. For chrissake, there's an underwater kissing scene that lasts about 15 minutes set to pretentious indie pop music.<br/><br/>I thought the move was almost over after 2 hours and saw I had only been watching for 1 hour.

","Whip It is directed by Drew Barrymore and adapted for the screen by Shauna Cross from her own novel, Derby Girl. Barrymore also co-stars alongside Ellen Page, Alia Shawkat, Marcia Gay Harden, Kristen Wiig, Juliette Lewis, Jimmy Fallon, Daniel Stern and Landon Pigg.<br/><br/>Bliss Cavendar (Page), is a bored teenage girl stuck in a rut in Bodeen, Texas. Her life consists of working at the ""Oink Joint"" restaurant and entering beauty contests to please her mother (Harden). Along with her friend Pash (Shawkat), she dreams of escaping to a better life. Then one day during a trip out to Austin, the girls get wind of Roller Derby, a sport for girls played on roller-skates. Intrigued they go and take in a match and Bliss is hooked straight away, it's tough, competitive and even edgy. Telling a lie about her age, Bliss decides to try out for the ""Hurl Scouts"" and gets a place on the team as ""Babe Ruthless"". Thanks to her ability the ""Scouts"" start to turn around their season, however, with a new boyfriend on the scene and her parents unaware of her secret life, Bliss' new found happiness could come crashing down around her.<br/><br/>In spite of some favourable critical assessments, Drew Barrymore's directing debut barely made a dent at the box office. Just about making its money back on World gross, the figures would lend you to believe that the film simply isn't very good. Plot synopsis doesn't suggest anything out of the ordinary, yet another coming-of-age teenager picture, and one that is sports based, and even more formulaic than that, the sports team at the centre of proceedings is an underdog too! Throw into the equation that it's a female based movie and it's not really a film crying out for all demographics: or is it? Barrymore herself was very disappointed with the marketing for her movie, the general feeling being that it was sold as a girls sports love story type picture. She's absolutely right, it was marketed badly, and it barely had a run on the big screen in most countries. Which is a shame because Whip It is a smashing film, a picture that's vibrant, funny and not without dramatic worth; and yes, it's accessible for any age, sex or gender persuasion. Cross' script is fresh and free of filler and the cast all turn in jolly good shows; ranging from the excellent (Page/Gay Harden) to the engaging (Shawkat/Lewis/Wiig) and the funny (Stern/Fallon). OK, so it's not perfect, Barrymore is no Tony Scott when it comes to shooting action (some of the actual derby matches are confusing and not flowing), and maybe a bit more back-story flesh for the other ""Hurl Scouts"" wouldn't have gone amiss? But these are minor itches at the beginning of what is hoped to be a long career in directing for Madame Barrymore.<br/><br/>With names like Jabba the Slut, Smashley Simpson and Iron Maven, it's evidently a film full of fun vim and vigour. But as great as that is (girls in skirts on skates belting each other around a track), the coming-of-age drama at its core should not be understated either. 8/10"
"Howlin Wolf","5","3","4","23 October 2012"," Gentle Do-si-do...
","Whip It was a movie I wanted to like more than I did... The storyline was a little bit twee and predictable, with all of the 'small-town underdog' sports clichés... but, on the other hand, first-time director Drew Barrymore's handling of things is as charming as Barrymore herself seems to be... so, if you don't mind predictability, like roller derby, and just want a non-taxing feelgood film, then this could be it...<br/><br/>It has a great soundtrack, too, so that's in its favour.<br/><br/>Barrymore seems to be fond of fairy tales, so if you like miraculous yet never less than wholesome transformations, and inspirational sloganeering such as ""Be Your Own Hero!"", then this will probably suit you a treat... It's not that I'm against those things, it's just that these warm fuzzies sometimes come at the expense of teaching you about the realities of life... but, if you've seen ""Never Been Kissed"" before and enjoyed it, then at least you'll know the type of thing to expect."
"sjupie","5","10","21","15 October 2009"," Usual Ellen Page
","I really wanted to like this movie.<br/><br/>Things I liked: Andrew Wilson, Juliet Lewis, ""Cousin Maebe,"" Marcia Gay Hardin, Kristin Wiig, and Drew Barrymore. Andrew Wilson, the brother of Luke and Owen, is HOT. The whole movie, I was thinking, ""Who IS this guy??"" He acts well, too. LOVE Juliet Lewis. She wasn't too famous to be seen all greasy and trashy. I usually can't stand Marcia Gay Harden (except for her cameo in Law and Order, Criminal Intent), but I loved her in this. She is very believable in her mail carrier's uniform. I like the choice of Landen Pigg as the first love. Nobody's first boyfriend is a confident hunk. Your first love is always a skinny, awkward, average-looking guy. I loved the funny names of the skaters.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: Much like Arnold, Sylvester Stallone, or Tom Cruise, Ellen Page plays the same character in every movie. The I'm too smart for you precocious teenager (""I'm from the bustling metropolis of Bolene, Texas."") Why didn't she have a Texan accent? Ellen's character is supposed to be a super fast skater, but Ellen Page can NOT skate! She looked like she was about to fall down in every skating scene. The food fight scene and underwater scene were completely gratuitous. The underwater love scene seemed like it was done just so they could say, ""Hey. This is the first completely underwater love scene in history."" It was completely unromantic. So much time was wasted on stupid stuff that could have been better used. Eve plays the token black who doesn't get any lines."

The cinematography during the roller derby scenes is spectacular, done in such a way that you can really feel the emotion of the sport. The movie very definitely does not disappoint. i fully expect best picture/director nods for Barrymore, as well as best a best actress nod for Ellen page, and a best supporting actress nod foe Marcia gay harden. all in all this a wonderful film, and is one of the years few must see movies. it is a wonderful story beautifully executed at the hands of Drew Barrymore.

Was there ever a question that she would be allowed to go to the finals? (see Bend it Like Beckham, a far superior film which had the same outcome). And what was that underwater nonsense about? I guess it was supposed to be beautiful and balletic, but left me breathless because I wondered when they'd come up for air.<br/><br/>Although the movie was a C+, I did enjoy Marcia Gay Harden's three-dimensional portrayal of the over-protective southern Mom.

","The best thing this movie has going for it is a phenomenal cast. I know I know this is the directorial debut of Drew Barrymore but it was painfully obvious when watching. This movie should be shown in film school 101 to teach students why they are in film school in the first place. Why blocking matters, why shot selection and story structure is so important and why the movement of background extras should be thought out more than""Hey just stand there and pump your fist like you are cheering"".<br/><br/>The movie feels staged. The directing is amateur, the blocking is poor and the cinematography is unimaginative. The story is simple enough and I hoped would be a unique take on the teenage coming of age story but unfortunately it goes nowhere. This movie relies on clichés and stilted techniques to trod the story along which makes the whole thing dull.<br/><br/>However I will say, if Drew Barrymore studies story structure and directing technique she will become a solid director. Let me put it this way, if this movie was made for $16,000 by a UT film student I would be eagerly awaiting their sophomore film. It wasn't."

"Robert_duder","8","5","12","1 February 2010"," Terrific and entertaining!! A real gem! Way to go Drew!
","The first time I saw a trailer for Whip It I thought it looked decent enough and it could be a fun film. There is nothing better than when a film exceeds all your expectations and really impresses you and that is exactly what this film did. Whip It is in the simplest form is just downright fun. Solid performances (even some by people I don't care for), great characters, and just a fun feel good movie that doesn't hold back. If anything can be said for Drew Barrymore's directorial debut she knows how to put together a good story. I might even go so far as to say that the film is extremely under rated and doesn't seem to appeal to people as much as I would have thought. I can promise you this that if you just sit back and relax and truly enjoy having fun you'll come out of the movie with a smile on your face. My single disappointment with the film was that I expected some really intense emotion towards the end and it never really delivers on that front. I was fully prepared to actually swallow my masculinity and tear up but it was never necessary. So while it might fall short from some great emotion it is still a really amazing fun movie.<br/><br/>Desperately trying to move beyond the just Juno phase Ellen Page plays quirky and quiet Bliss Cavender. She does a terrific job and she definitely has amazing screen presence which she proved when she blazed on the screen in Juno (average movie, amazing role). She is simply watchable and you root for her and she plays the roller derby role like a pro. Two truly outstanding supporting roles to watch for are by the versatile amazing Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern. Harden is terrific as the straight laced reserved mother and Stern is simply amazing (best role I've ever seen him in outside of Marv in Home Alone) as Bliss' loving if not slightly distant father. Both of them have small roles but are truly excellent in their roles. Kristen Wiig is one of my least favorite Saturday Night Live cast members and I just usually can't stomach her performances and yet here she is giving an incredibly serious and really solid performance as single mother and roller champ 'Maggie Mayhem.' Similarly Jimmy Fallon gives a decent, very tolerable performance as roller derby host Johnny Rocket. The rest of the girls are a solid and fun cast including director herself Drew Barrymore, Zoe Bell, Eve and another of my least favorite actresses Juliette Lewis who is also very good in her role. Also deserving honorable mention is a small supporting role by actress Alia Shawkat as Juno's...errr I mean Ellen Paige's best friend Pash. She is awesome and I hope to see her do some really great roles in the future.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore put together a terrific ensemble to rally around a terrific character brought to my life by Ellen Paige. If anything could be said about Barrymore is that she brings the very best out of her cast. She managed to take several rather loud and potentially obnoxious comedians (Fallon, Wiig, Lewis) and gives them a much more serious and toned down persona that shows off their very best. Whip It is an adventure for a lot of people behind the scenes. Barrymore in her directorial debut and the writer of the novel as well as the screenplay Shauna Cross appears to be new to screen writing, and I think the performances in the film are a new style to a lot of the actors too. No matter how you shake it Whip It is just a blast. It's fun and touching and anybody can sit down and enjoy it. See this movie and do yourself a favor. And shockingly enough they do not play the overplayed movie song ""Whip It."" Weird eh? 8.5/10"
"phantom_fan89","5","5","12","20 November 2009"," Don't Count On Wanting To Spend Another Round In The Ring
","The news that Drew Barrymore was about to make her directorial debut was greeted with a fair amount of skepticism within the industry. Her freshman effort however is not the complete clunker predicted by many nor does it herald a highly anticipated new career path for Barrymore. Instead she delivers a predictable and mediocre coming of age yarn that is not worthy of the talent it attracted.<br/><br/>The movie follows the girl to woman transformation of Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page). Forced to participate in beauty pageants by her overbearing mother (Marcia Gay Harden) social misfit Bliss finds herself much more at home in the rough and tumble world of Roller Derby's. Facing strong opposition from her parents Bliss makes it her mission in life to join the local league and become her own person.<br/><br/>Whip It boasts an all star cast, although you have to wonder whether or not they would have even considered the material had Barrymore not been behind the helm. Perpetually misunderstood youth Ellen Page essentially plays Bliss Cavendar as Juno without the confidence (or the pregnancy). Despite this Page is obviously talented and makes the character likable enough, however she is completely upstaged by Arrested Development star Alia Shawkat who completely outshines Page's Oscar nominated behind as her wise cracking best friend Pash. Veteran actors Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern are comically brilliant as Bliss's well intentioned parents with Juliette Lewis making us realise that she's one of best and most under appreciated actors working today as Bliss's devilish rival Iron Maven. Rounding out the supporting cast is rapper turned actor Eve, Tarantino stunt women extraordinaire Zoe Bell, Barrymore herself and the forgotten Wilson brother Andrew.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with Whip It is it's pacing. At times the film seems to drag on endlessly, making you question why a rather simple plot takes almost two hours to unfold. The more enjoyable moments come from the friendship between Bliss and Pash as well as the actual Roller Derby matches themselves. Barrymore succeeds so well in making you feel as though you are inside the ring that you can almost smell the sweat and blood. However these moments are often few and far between and we must instead watch a poorly developed and rather pointless love story unfold between Bliss and local musician Oliver as well as numerous sequences showcasing how 'wild' the derby girls are (they skate and wear heavy make -up, we get it!) Barrymore's direction is certainly not bad, it just comes across as a little schizophrenic. It's almost as though she really wasn't quite sure what the end product should be, as such we are introduced to too many themes and ideas. While no great prodigy she should certainly be given another chance at directing as there is obvious potential evident. Barrymore certainly manages to elicit fine performances from her cast and should be applauded for the fact that she didn't turn Whip It into a self serving vanity project as most other actor/directors have a tendency to do.<br/><br/>Whilst nothing spectacular, Whip It is nonetheless enjoyable fare. Just don't count on wanting to spend another round in the ring. For more reviews please feel free to visit http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/"

","So I watched whip it from 2009, well some think it is good some not so much. Which camp am I in well the not so much one. I really wanted to like this movie, it had hot bad girls in mini skirts (so you can see their panties-what I am a man) being rough and acting tough, a killer soundtrack, an interesting story (based on a real league out of Austin Texas), and good acting, but in the end was just another predictable Hollywood movie for the most part. It suffered from a disease that I find runs rampant in sports films, it involves the main team going from last to first just like that, it involves the rookie sensation going through several personal trials often at the same time, a nasty rival team that shows respect in the end, and the big showdown to end it all. It is systemic and has infiltrated almost every sports flick I have ever seen, it even affects the movies that are spoofs of this very phenomenon. I honestly can't say whether to skip this one or not, maybe if the story had been more simple and had more grit it could have been a great freshman directing attempt by Drew Barrymore, but I was personally left feeling disappointed. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"
"Quebec_Dragon","6","3","6","20 August 2010"," High-spirited and entertaining even for those who know nothing about the sport
","Whip it might actually be more of a coming of age story than an actual sports film about roller derby. A young introverted woman played by Ellen Page is forced to participate in regional beauty pageants by her mother while working part-time at the Oint Joint (a diner) with her best friend. Early on, she goes secretly to a roller derby match and eventually decides to try out for a team which of course accepts her (or there would be no movie ;-). I found the movie, like the sport itself, was charming and appealing but rough around the edges. The introductions of the different players with their kooky names (Bloody Holly, Smashley Simpson, etc) were amusing although most were only nicknames with little or no personality. The Manson sisters (probably an homage to the Hanson brothers from Slapshot) were introduced and then mostly forgotten. I enjoyed the team camaraderie and high spirits. We get why such an activity could be empowering especially for shy women.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you know nothing about roller derby before watching it. They explain the basics and besides the winning or losing is secondary. I knew a little about the rules myself having watched an actual match and they took lots of creative liberties regarding penalties. The actual game is not as violent (although to be honest, nothing too extreme in this movie either) and most of the plays from the coach would be illegal. So it turns out, I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't seen real roller derby before. On the other hand, seeing the movie beforehand might have given me the wrong impression about the sport. The playing shown on the screen is frankly not that spectacular or exciting. There's no real tension regarding the match progression. Seems to me it might be because the players from the main character's team were the actresses instead of actual pro players. Not necessarily a bad choice.<br/><br/>Mainly, we follow Ellen Page's character in her emancipation from her parents through her new circle of friends and first love. Despite the tattoos and attitude of some of the girls, it's really rather tame and politically correct. Even the ""love"" scene in a pool is more poetic than erotic, not even showing actual complete nudity. It reminds me that for the boys hoping for eye candy, the majority of the girls are not that sexy either in looks or outfits except perhaps for Eva Destruction and even then it's tasteful. The character progression of the main character Bliss is gradual and good. The mother/daughter relationship is also nice with a particularly well done dramatic scene on the floor of a kitchen. I think the one-on-one relationship moments between Bliss and various characters are the highlights. Comedy wise, the funny side comes mostly from the antics on the tracks (doesn't go over-the-top ridiculous) and the team players outside. Nothing laugh-out-loud funny but it made me smile a few times. Teenage girls and young women will probably love this film provided they have a little rebellious side to them. There is a satisfying feminist/girl power subtext here. Everyone else, including guys, will probably find it entertaining if they keep in mind that it's more of a dramatic comedy about one girl with a sports theme than a sports drama following a team. Films featuring a girls sports team are rather rare and fortunately Whip it is a pretty good one. Roller derby fans or players will cringe at some of the moves but like the film if they can get beyond that. <br/><br/>Rating : 6 out of 10 (good)"
"colinrgeorge","6","3","6","6 April 2010"," ""Whip It""
","""Whip It,"" the directorial debut of actress Drew Barrymore (""Beverly Hills Chihuahua,"" ""E.T.""), is a film about full-contact women's roller derby, populated by characters with names like 'Maggie Mayhem,' 'Babe Ruthless,' and 'Smashley Simpson,' but is unsuccessful in co-opting the gritty appeal of the lifestyle. The movie's breezy affability and charm are evidence of its artistic shortcomings, and for a film so forward with its girl power, my man-ass could stand to have been more kicked. I should be emasculated. The world of roller derby should feel coarse and uninviting or at best kinkily arousing. Unfortunately, ""Whip It"" didn't really elicit any of those feelings in me.<br/><br/>The film is frilly and formal, with a shopworn foundation that roots the narrative in the clichéd quirk of the modern independent romantic comedy, though the subject matter screams to be a rough-around-the-edges outcast. To be fair, there's a degree of intentional contrast to protagonist Bliss Cavender (Ellen Page, ""Juno"") and her double life--pleasing her mother as a beauty pageant queen, and kicking ass as the Jammer for the last place 'Hurl Scouts.' But the opening scene, where Bliss appears before her mother and a mortified panel of judges with recently dyed blue hair, serves as a perfect metaphor for the film itself, in that its approach to the counter-culture is a surface-level aesthetic rather than a complete attitude. Blue hair is about as wild as it gets.<br/><br/>""Whip It"" does build kinetic energy during its lively roller derby sequences, with fast, free- flowing camera-work that highlights the good-spirited brutality of the sport. Jimmy Fallon is even amusing as commentator 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket. However, the exhilaration of these sequences is matched by the banality of the rest of it: girl falls for lead singer in indie band, has waitress job at quirky small-town diner with quirky shift supervisor, consorts with precocious teens, and comes home to semi-broken family. The Americana is almost suffocating.<br/><br/>But removed from the context of the current cinematic landscape, there's nothing especially wrong with ""Whip It,"" it's just not surprising. Ellen Page's performance is completely earnest and convincing (also not surprising), and the film has the best of intentions. Barrymore proves a proficient if inauspicious director, with enough talent to warrant at least another go around.<br/><br/>Her debut film is well meaning and inoffensive, with the sort of genial conceit that even our enemies aren't so bad, and forgiveness flows as fast and as senselessly between the characters as white water. Even the scumbag indie vocalist whom Bliss believes to be double- timing her may or may not have been guilty, and her reaction to his attempt to make amends is disappointingly timid. The film is intended more as a lightweight, feel-good empowerment piece than a challenging or realistic examination of the subject matter, which frustrates me but may delight some.<br/><br/>It's a movie for modern moms and daughters, which I don't mean to offer as passive aggressive sexism, as the film is perfectly entertaining for a gender-neutral audience, and its flaws aren't identifiable from a male perspective so much as they are from a unisexually artistic perspective. A great piece of art challenges the preconceptions of the medium, which ""Whip It"" decidedly doesn't. Rather, the film celebrates the bond that exists between Bliss and her matriarch (Marcia Gay harden), individuality, friendship, and the classification of family. It's sweet and palatable to both rebellious, headstrong teens and stiff but loving parents, which is an admirable but unambitious accomplishment. If you want to make a genuinely challenging film about gender identification and roller derby however, you'll have to dispense with the niceties and the formula and throw a punch."

","There are no bad movies containing ""Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"" on the soundtrack and ""Whip It"" is no exception. Drew Barrymore, in her directorial debut, has done everything right, right down to correctly showing that roller derby matches are attended by a few hundred fans in some warehouse, not thousands in an arena.<br/><br/>Ellen Page, as the awkward outsider Bliss who finds her inner warrior (her nom de guerre is Babe Ruthless) on the derby track, is luminous. Barrymore's camera is in love with this young actress' incredibly expressive face. ""Hard Candy,"" ""Juno"" and now this. Is there anything this 22-year-old Canadian sparkplug cannot do? <br/><br/>The script also does everything right and gives us characters that make sense. Bliss' mom, played by Marcia Gay Hardin, disapproves of her daughter's choice of extracurricular activity, but is just a worried mom, not some harridan. Her dad, played by Daniel Stern, is henpecked, but ends up taking his daughter's side. Also, it's broadly hinted that mom and dad are not estranged in the bedroom.<br/><br/>Barrymore, who plays a member of the team, could easily have put herself out front, but chooses to stay in the background. SNL's Kristen Wiig is tough as nails on the track, but is also a single mom. And there's grinning Zoe Bell, recently seen flopping on a car hood in ""Death Proof."" <br/><br/>""Casablanca"" was churned out as just another studio product when it was made, but certain stars come into alignment — script, cast, direction, etc., and a classic was born. ""Whip It"" is not in that league, but the same principle applies. Fox Searchlight Pictures was a studio firing on all cylinders when it made ""Whip It."""

"nabatley","8","4","10","9 April 2010"," A joy for feminists
","Righto, yesterday, I saw a cheery film called Whip It, which was more or less billed as Juno (one of my favourites) with less pregnancy and more rollerskates. The directorial debut of ex-wild child Drew Barrymore, it chronicles a 17-year-old Ellen Page, stuck in a small town, working at the local greasy spoon, and pushed into beauty pageants by her mother. One day, whilst in a head shop (I had to look up what this meant), she sees an advertisement for roller derby. For the uninitiated (of which I was certainly one), there is a short explanation of the sport, but it largely seems to involve women elbowing each other in the face whilst skating in a circle, and giving yourself a name like Smashley Simpson (Barrymore) or Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis).<br/><br/>The team Ellen (Bliss/Babe Ruthless) joins is none too good, preferring hot tubs and copious consumption of alcohol to actual practice, but they seem to have enough fun, until their coach, Razor, decides to teach the opposition one of his beautifully crafted moves that his own protégés prefer to ignore. Cue speedy resurgence and the typical sports movie cliché of the big final towards the end of the reel. Of course, Bliss' mother is none too receptive of her new hobby, masqueraded at first as an extra SAT class (SATs aren't as pointless in America as they are here), whilst her somewhat more relaxed father just wants her to be happy.<br/><br/>It's not perfect; the attempt at a love story seems almost half-hearted, and is sort of superfluous, and some of the lines are filled with so many pop-culture references that only the most socially aware can grasp the entirety of the film. The USP though is that it's so much fun. It's best watched in a group of late teens, the demographic it's presumably aimed at. It challenges stereotypes, as Bliss yells at her mother. It shows roller derby as a refuge for punk-esquire women who feel that the rigidly conservative Deep South society (though this is by no means a Texan phenomenon) they've been born into isn't adventurous enough for them, and aren't afraid to act in a way that many may consider outrageous for females. It shows, as Maggie Mayhem says, that you can ""be your own hero"" rather than looking up to people, and it's such a change from all the teen-aimed movies where women are judged (often by other women) for challenging the stereotype that's been lain down on them (anyone who does judge is frowned upon here, as in Juno). You get the feeling that the stars really bonded and Bliss' onstage relationship with her BBF, Pash (rising star Alia Shawkat) seems so real (and it is); it's a really refreshing two-hour bout of entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously =].<br/><br/>Oh, and for guys, there are attractive women in fishnets flooring each other, though this was of course not the only reason I liked it. Nuh-uh."

","This was not a bad movie in the slightest. In fact, it was very good. I guess Drew Barrymore (in her directorial debut) has been around movies along enough that she could eventually try her hand at directing and be pretty good at it. ""Whip It"" is a pretty fun movie, even if you know where it's all going to go in the end.<br/><br/>Bliss Cavendar (""Juno"" Ellen Page) is searching for direction in her life, stuck in a dead-end job as a waitress in Bodeen, Texas, and living under the misdirected beauty-pageant guidance of her loving but dominating mother (Marcia Gay Harden). By chance, Bliss discovers a flier for the roller derby league in nearby Austin and tries out. Much to her surprise (but not to ours), her speed on the track earns her a spot on the Hurl Scouts, who have a reputation for playing hard but also for not having won a single derby match in the entire time that they've been a team. Playing under the derby name ""Babe Ruthless,"" she comes under the guidance of fellow player Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) and Coach Razor (Andrew Wilson), and makes mortal enemies out of star, and rival player, Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis).<br/><br/>""Whip It"" was wicked fun at the movies, made even more fun by its mix of comedy, drama and teen romance, plus its girl-power attitude and proto-feminist undertones. While I'm a guy, some of this stuff may seem lost on me, but I did enjoy myself.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore proves that she's been in show business long enough that she knows her way both in front of the camera and behind the camera; she plays Bliss's roughhousing teammate Smashley Simpson, and I must say that Barrymore certainly knows how to poke fun at herself at great personal expense and take a few for the team. As far as her directing talents go, she could have made ""Whip It"" some kind of little artsy indie flick, but no. Instead, she goes for the gold and makes a fun little sports chick-flick that is confident, assured, emotional and above all, fun.<br/><br/>Page is also quite good, playing almost the exact opposite of her ""Juno"" character, because this time her Bliss Cavendar/""Babe Ruthless"" is somewhat of a dork, quiet, and doesn't give off as much sass. I was able to better relate to her character here than I did in ""Juno,"" even though I really like ""Juno""; I just had a little bit more fun with Bliss than I did with her character three years ago.<br/><br/>""Whip It,"" which was adapted from the 2007 book ""Derby Girl"" by Shauna Cross (also the film's screenwriter), is an astoundingly fun and well-made little feature from Drew Barrymore, one of the industry's most seasoned pros under the age of 40. Since she's been in show business pretty much all of her life, you can guarantee that if she gives up acting, that directing is something that is right up her alley.<br/><br/>8/10"

In her particular role on the team -- to skate fast and score points -- she excels and blossoms.<br/><br/>Alia Shawkat, as her best friend Pash, plays convincingly as a small-town bright kid, wanting to get away to college. She shares much of a well-scripted subplot with Carlo Alban, who plays ""Birdman,"" the manager of the pig-themed restaurant where they all work.<br/><br/>Ellen, through her experiences at the derby, skates on the edge of youth and maturity, and often crashes into the rails of her life's boundaries.<br/><br/>All the performances are well-done. Juliette Lewis as ""Iron Maven"" plays a great baddie with a smirk capable of defenestration. Or at least tossing someone out of the roller derby rink. Marcia Gay Harden as the chain-smoking pageant-obsessed mother, and Daniel Stern as the football-addicted father play convincingly as flawed yet sympathetic role models for their daughter. They gradually overcome their initial portrayals as caricatures to become realistic human characters.<br/><br/>Landon Pigg plays the love interest Oliver, a handsome, laid-back rocker in an up-and-coming band. His actual name would have been perfect for the movie's porcine restaurant setting. Indeed, he eventually he does make a soft landing at the restaurant, where he poetically finds his Bliss. The scenes between these two are mostly convincing, but for some reason I felt a reservation about them as a romantic couple. Maybe Landon was a bit too laid back for my tastes. A bit too disconnected. Indeed, the movie doesn't hinge on their romance so much as the derby circuit, and this entire subplot could actually have been cut from the movie and it would not have greatly changed the plot arc. Still, it is well done, and helps to highlight the alteration and maturation of Bliss during the course of the year.<br/><br/>Finally, it must be said Drew Barrymore does an excellent job both on-and-off the screen, as the constantly-brawling character Smashley Simpson and as the director and producer.<br/><br/>The movie has an excellent range of silly to sincere. It swings from drunken romance to suddenly sobering moments and back again with the ease of a well-working ensemble cast. Most notable of all, it looked like everyone on set was having a blast.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 of 10."

","I think it's important to point out that I am 45 years-old and I am sure my 'advanced age' has a big impact on my vote. Had I been a young hipster (grrr...hipsters!), then I am sure I would have enjoyed it much more--and I realize that I am NOT in the target demographic group for this film. Keep this in mind as you read this review.<br/><br/>Ellen Page plays a high school student whose mother (Marcia Gay Harden) lives out her dreams vicariously through her and her younger sister. It is the mother who wants her daughters to be beauty pageant winners and puts all her hopes and dreams on the girls--even though clearly Page hates the life. But, as her mother is quite domineering, Page longs for a change but will never directly deal with her mom. Instead, she sneaks off and creates an alter-ego, 'Babe Ruthless'--an up and coming roller derby star!! Talk about going from one extreme to another!!! While this IS a truly original idea and hooked me, how it was executed caused a lot of problems for me. I mean absolutely no offense to Miss Page--who is a likable actress and quite reminiscent of MTV's ""Daria"". But, she seems very, very wrong for the part. She isn't pretty in that plastic and perfect way to be a believable beauty pageant contestant. While she is cute, her looks are just not the type for this life. And, as she appears to weigh about 95 pounds, she also is ridiculously cast as a derby participant--particularly since one good hit would most likely kill someone her!! However, I should point out that her character IS interesting. What isn't so interesting are a few of the supporting characters. Her best friend is very, very inconsistent and seemed to need a bit of a re-write. For example, late in the film, this 'friend' sulks off and blames her problems on Page--though this makes no sense and seems more like a plot device than anything else. It's like someone said ""wait...we need some conflict in this film....let's have the two girls have a falling out...and, by the end of the film, they can make up!!"" (also known as cliché #15). And, while I liked some of the roller girls (such as Juliet Lewis and Drew Barrymore), some seemed a bit one-dimensional--such as the two deaf ladies.<br/><br/>Still, while these complaints are important, the film gets a 'see it' vote from me--simply because the movie IS unique. And, also, while not believable, the film is nice mindless fun and can even be enjoyed by a middle-aged guy like me. Plus, I appreciated how Page's character dealt with the boyfriend at the end of the film--and not like some dishrag! Worth seeing but not life-changing."

"Uriah43","5","2","4","21 August 2015"," Lost Its Focus
","All of her life ""Bliss Cavendar"" (Ellen Page) has been pressured by her strong-willed mother to be a beauty pageant winner. She pretty much accepts this primarily because she doesn't really have any other options. Then one day she sees a roller derby game and suddenly knows what she wants to do and subsequently tries out for a team—and makes it. From then on she secretly devotes herself solely to the game and to her new boyfriend ""Oliver"" (Landon Pigg). Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that what starts out with good doses of comedy and action suddenly morphs into a drama (around the midway point) and it's at this time that the film lost its focus and cutting edge. Additionally, although Kristen Wigg (as ""Maggie Mayhem"") seemed to breathe some life into this movie, her comedic talents weren't utilized nearly enough. Same thing with Ari Graynor (""Eva Destruction""). In summation, this movie had some good potential but the director (Drew Barrymore) failed to take advantage of it and as a result I rate it as only average."

","Released in 2009, ""Whip It"" was Drew Barrymore's first and (so far) only full-length film in the director's chair. Drew also co-stars, but she's a side character and non-essential to the plot.<br/><br/>The story revolves around 17 year-old Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), her parents (Daniel Stern & Marcia Gay Harden) and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat). Bliss is involved in the world of beauty pageants due to her mother's obsession, but becomes fascinated by a group of roller derby girls while visiting nearby Austin, TX. She decides to try-out for the the Hurl Scouts.<br/><br/>""Whip It"" starts out slow and only mildly interesting but it ultimately won me over. This is basically a coming-of-age drama using the roller derby as a backdrop and stage. Since Ellen Page takes center focus, and does a great job, ""Whip It"" should appeal to fans of Page. I'm not a fan; I can take her or leave her. Thankfully, there's enough good here to draw in other folks.<br/><br/>I especially like the roller derby girls and their camaraderie & competition. The girls include Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig, Eve, Zoe Bell, Ari Graynor, Eli Bleiler and Sydney Bennett. What I love about these women is that they have womanly curves and aren't walking sticks with big breasts. Take, for instance, the so-called Manson Sisters, played by Kristen Adolfi & Rachel Piplica; both are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous throughout the film and worth the price of admission -- stunning examples of womanhood.<br/><br/>There's a subplot about Bliss falling for a guy in a rock band (Landon Pigg) and there are other characters, like the coach, the derby announcer and the Hispanic manager of the restaurant Bliss & Pash work at (Andrew Wilson, Jimmy Fallon and Carlo Alban respectively), but this is mainly about Bliss, her family, Pash and the derby girls.<br/><br/>FINAL SAY: The drama in this coming-of-age flick is a mixed bag; I found the love story kind of tedious but enjoyed Pash and the family dynamics of the Cavendar household. The best part, of course, is the derby action and the ravishing derby babes in all their glory.<br/><br/>The film runs 111 minutes and was mostly filmed in Michigan with some shots of Austin, TX.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","The first time I watched Whip It about four months ago, I did not really think much of it. I thought it was a pretty good movie that I wasn't going to think about much. However, I watched it a second time about a month later, and fell in love with it. Whip It is a film that is endlessly entertaining. I am serious. You will never be bored while watching this movie. I have seen it six times, and nothing has ever dragged in any of the viewings. Ellen Page, like usual, is exceptional in the role of Bliss Cavendar, a senior in high school whose mom had made her compete in beauty pageants for what seems like her whole life. However when the opportunity arrives for her to join a Roller Derby team, she takes advantage. This is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, and it really could not have gone better. Despite having a lot of sports movie cliches and following a simple formula, Whip It stands out because of the style, the incredible soundtrack, as well as the sport that is being played. There is just something about roller derby that is great for a movie. Also, this film has probably the best romance scene in a non-romance movie ever. Just saying. Critics, audiences, i mean, everybody likes this movie, and it has rightfully developed a cult following after a disappointing showing in the box office.

"frankenstrudel","2","3","8","2 January 2012"," no chemistry
","I saw the names of the actors and had high hopes, especially since I talked with a roller derby skater a few months ago and learned how into the sport she was. I'm a fan of Juliette Lewis and Drew Barrymore and thought Ellen Page was impressive in Juno. All of the acting was good, but how much can be done with a weak script? A food fight straight out of Animal House, with Drew Barrymore (seemingly Animal from the Muppets) shouting John Bellushi's line; an underwater make-out scene borrowed from Children of a Lesser God with 1/10 the intensity; these are homages, perhaps, and that's o.k., but I find it hard to believe that new viewers actually buy these scenes. (In Children of a Lesser God, the female lead is known to swim by herself at night, and the male lead confronts her there after they've had a bunch of serious arguments and misunderstandings. Here, the pool comes out of nowhere. The two sneak in and it's hard not to notice all the paddling/kicking necessary for them to stay under water while they eke out this and that kiss. The food fight scene comes out of nowhere, too.) I can't agree with reviews that call this a feminist film. Seems like every character besides Juliette Lewis is gaga after some guy. Not that lesbianism need be in a feminist film, but it's as if the film wants to pound you over the head with the idea that roller derby is feverishly hetero in every way, and feminism (if that's what this is) seems to be defined as women wanting to be boxers and women having no interest in coordinating themselves (learning plays) until their male coach convinces them they should. Because roller derby is cool and promises to be interesting, you can see why good actors would want to get involved. But there was very little by way of chemistry. Lots of forced scenes: ""You're not getting it. I love this."" Some moments are good, but mostly it's a teenager film, the kind where the 17 year old girl, in addition to being the fastest skater in the league straight after she was barely able to skate, also is infinitely wiser than everyone. A couple of teenagers I saw it with say they liked it a lot, but perhaps they've already put their ratings here."
"ndrw-kass","10","3","8","13 February 2011"," Fun and soulful coming of age film
","You watch a movie about roller derby expecting to have fun. What catches you is the family dynamic, the well-observed friendships and rivalries, and the left turns that go from what could be stock situations to moments that resonate.<br/><br/>The performances ring true. Ellen Page continues to infuse her characters with light and presence. Marcia Gay Harden takes what could be a one-dimensional role and makes it live. And can't say enough about the girls, and the crazy training they all must have done.<br/><br/>The real surprise, though, is Drew Barrymore's artistic eye and gift for storytelling in her first directorial role. The story and the characters are always presented well and the pacing is sure, but there are moments that sneak up and take your breath away.<br/><br/>I saw this with my family, and commend it as a group experience in laughing together and talking about real stuff afterward."
"Ayreesfoxx","5","3","8","31 January 2010"," Whip it: The same style doesn't disappoint every time.
","The beauty of Ellen Page is that she has become an actress that's subtle. Since her 'claim-to-fame' movies like 'Hard Candy' and 'Juno,' viewers are expecting at least a little of a quirky, quick-witted character. 'Whip It' is no different, but that's alright. In fact, this whole movie from start to finish fits in the easy pattern of a woman finding her way. You can call out each upcoming scene and even some of the lines of you think about it hard enough, but still, it turns out to not to matter. By the end of the movie, you had an enjoyable experience and even got to see some women beat the hell out of each other.<br/><br/>The movie is about Bliss Cavendar (Page), who is a high school girl growing up in No-where, Texas being forced to go through the pageant circuit thanks to her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) in her attempt to impart ""1950 ideals of womanhood."" Obviously Bliss wants out, so she finds in Houston the Roller Derby, where she lies about only being seventeen to make it on the team, and thus starts a second, more fulfilling life. <br/><br/>That synopsis alone is enough to give your mind to fill in the blanks and plot gaps, and you would pretty much be right. Bliss begins lying to her parents, changing her schedule and continually coming in late every week, yet nobody seems to care or notice for far too long. She becomes a star in the rink, yet is envied by antagonist Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis). There's the rocker boy love interest, which by the end you can't tell where they stand just because that's how the character is – a woman that takes care of her own – but none of that will really bother or get tedious.<br/><br/>The reason is, the cast of characters and the action that is Roller Derby always draws you back in. The rules are simplified and explained once, then with refreshers as the games progress, just in case you didn't get it with the explanation in the beginning. After that you're watching girls circle a large rink, trying to knock the hell out of each other, block, bump, grind, and any other combination you can think of to score. The teammates on Bliss' team – the Hurl Scouts – add to the mix, bringing in humor and helping Bliss grow in this unique ""coming of age"" tale.<br/><br/>And that's really what this movie is really about. Writer of the screenplay and book that the movie was based on, Shauna Cross, was a derby girl herself, and modeled both by the experiences she saw and felt. Director Drew Barrymore, who has a part in the movie as Smashly Simpson (all derby girls have a nickname, if you couldn't tell), keeps the focus on Bliss and her journey and not on the possible side characters.<br/><br/>""Whip It"" keeps you entertained with its blend of situational humor, sass and a tiny bit of melodrama brings this movie together. And thankfully, this one also has plenty of humor and girl-on-girl fisticuffs to keep everyone happy and involved."
"Quinoa1984","7","3","8","28 January 2010"," spunky little movie about doing what makes you happy
","Drew Barrymore has been acting in movies for a very long time, producing for about half that time, and here she makes her first film as director. How personal a project it was to her I can't say (haven't read or seen too many interviews, and it's based on a book by a real-life roller derby player). But one can speculate that Barrymore, as a free-spirit who's had her ups and big downs in her life (mostly the latter when she was much younger, too young in fact), connected with Bliss' attempt to be happy doing something she wants to do, that she feared her parents would disapprove of, and that Bliss finds another family of friends in the girls playing as the Puke Scouts. Certainly there is one thing at least: she's made a 'Hell yeah' movie for girls, or just anyone, saying that you should do what you like, as long as it's not too illegal and you don't get hurt too badly.<br/><br/>And sure, Whip It has its share of clichés. I imagine Barrymore wanted to be very careful with her first script, make sure she hit all the right beats- or just the expected ones- so she could let her actors have some fun. That is really where the film rests for the most part, outside of its premise being out of the ordinary (when was the last time we saw a Roller Derby movie, a good one, and not a documentary). She makes a very good bet on having Elle Page star who is small- at one point a character even refers to her as 'munchkin'- but has a lot of energy and heart and subtlety that she pours into Bliss. The character shouldn't be anything special, being a sort of typical rebellious seventeen year old searching for something that she can do well, on her own, but Page adds some charm and urgency to the performance, and gives it her all in those Roller Derby scenes darting always to the front of the pack.<br/><br/>And sure, again, some scenes are just outright silly. There's one in particular that might stick in your craw where Bliss and the boy she's pining for, a less than honorable dude in a indie rock band, jump in an indoor pool in the middle of the night and stay under water for what seems like a full five minutes before they emerge with (some) clothes still on. And we can tell what might happen by the end, save for the outcome of the Championship game, which is thankfully unpredictable.<br/><br/>But even if the story is just OK, again, Barrymore proves herself as a very fine actor's director, bringing out some excellent work from her fellow Derby players (Zoe Bell, Kristin Wiig, rival player Juliette Lewis in her best role in years), and Bliss' parents, Marcia Gay Harden and the criminally underrated Daniel Stern (great to see him getting work again). Oh, and Andrew Wilson as the coach hits it out of the park, in a performance that fully distinguishes himself from his brothers Owen and Luke. Only Jimmy Fallon feels kind of like the weak link here, if still amiable and amusing.<br/><br/>All in all, if you have to see one roller derby girl flick (not 'chick flick', it's not that sappy or formulaic) set in Texas and featuring lighthearted spoofs on beauty pageants and very small-town diners that have 3-minute slop-eating contests, this is the one for now. It's a semi-auspicious debut."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","8","16 January 2010"," Cleaner than Disney
","Drew Barrymore's directing debut cum 60th acting appearance (according to IMDb's data bank) is an immensely entertaining movie that is squeaky clean - no swearing, no nudity, no sex (except for the mildest hint), no dirty sports, not even a bad guy! While this doesn't mean one way or the other to this reviewer (thanks IMDb for our recent status elevation from ""commenter""), it may be important to some. In Canada, only the province of Quebec has the sense to rate it G while the rest of the country cautiously deals out a PG. Don't even ask why the US gives it a PG-13.<br/><br/>Where Barrymore succeeded where others may fail is in bringing to this movie a fresh look, with material that is so old and cliché that even Clint Eastwood wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole. Just kidding! Seriously, Barrymore's crisp, unpretentious direction gives just the right touch to theme of century-old domestic generation conflict, with a sprinkle of sentimentality perfectly measured to make the concluding reconciliation fresh as a mint drop. The story: 17-year-old suffocated by mother's beauty-pageant grooming finds her true self, sisterhood and happiness in professional roller derby.<br/><br/>It's the roller derby sequences that will make you want to jump out of your seat and cheer. It's Ellen Page, a different Ellen page from what you have yet seen, that carries this movie to a certain height. It's Oscar-winning Marcia Gay Harden that gives you a three-dimensional mother (sorry, not the Avatar kind) that that makes you appreciate both sides of the generation gap. It's an ensemble of good actors that lifts the roller derby athletes out of mere stereotype. It's an inspired script that dares to rebel from the Vince Lombardi mentality. No more needs to be said.

All the roles were played out extremely well, with the excellent Ellen Page leading the way. Shockingly though, the one other person who really stood out to me was Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem, playing her most refreshing role yet. Of course, all the credit in the world goes out to Drew Barrymore, whose directorial debut is a truly solid one.

I don't remember a movie that missed so many opportunities for laughs then this one. They would build a good scene and a solid set up for the joke...but no punch line. It did this so many times I began wondering if this were comedy at all. Now, there we're some laughs in the movie I wont lie. And Ellen Page was her usual cute and delightful self. But with the opportunity to use one of the funniest female comedians in the world today, Kirsten Wig, I don't know how you only give her one real joke. Even Drew Barrymore felt underutilized.

","Whip It (2009): Dir: Drew Barrymore / Cast: Ellen Page, Marcia Gay Harden, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig: High energy teen flick about goals and risks. Ellen Page plays Bliss Cavendar who works at a diner and subdued to her mother's demands to do pageants. She grows intrigued with female roller derby and faces the bumps to make it. Innovative directing by Drew Barrymore who also appears as Smashingly Simpson. Screenplay begins well but suffers from formula storytelling, repetition and clichés. Page is a sell going from forced glamour queen to a secret rollerblader who is afraid to face her mother. It is obvious that she will score big but thankfully her performance allow this film to avoid being a total miss. With that said, the rest of the cast are weighed down with stereotypes. Barrymore as Smashingly Simpson seems bent on getting into fights but this only positions her as a type not a personality. Juliette Lewis plays the typical rival pushing Page to the edge. Marcia Gay Harden does what she can as the strict mother who will suddenly see the light in the conclusion. Kristen Wiig plays a mother who is part of this group as a freedom. Not a bad start for Barrymore as director who hopefully will discover a more worthy project. The rollerblading element is interesting but unfortunately the screenplay fails to whip it into action.

While not the film would not necessarily fit right into the 'chick flick' genre, the focus on a mostly female cast does a wonderful job of portraying girl power, and emphasizes the fact that females don't need ""that special man"" in their life to succeed or be happy. This hidden gem of a movie is well worth a watch."
"greenylennon","8","2","6","21 June 2011"," In the name of Girl Power
","It is funny to realize how unfair it is that such a gentle, yet unlucky, movie like this has been a failure, while craps like Saw 3D choke up theaters for more than three days. Sweet Bliss, tortoiseshell glasses and clothes only ""Ghost World""'s Enid would wear, lives in a small Texas town, studies at the local high school and works as a waitress in a garish diner together with Pash, her wise and chubby best friend (Alia Shawkat, a freckled face perfect for this slightly unrewarding role). Bliss's mother is a former beauty queen, and therefore carries her reluctant daughter to incredibly poor pageants; but, respect to many movie characters of mothers ready for anything, she's a caring woman, who has probably suffered and who wishes all the best for her children. It's easy to notice that ""Whip It"" is a movie ruled by women, because Bliss, in the attempt to turn her life upside down, tells a lie about her age and enters in an Austin roller derby team. It was only to be expected that Bliss/Babe Ruthless turns out to be born to score points on the skates, finds love in the super-hipster Oliver and friendship in her shabby team mates, but, since we're given an equal quantity of laughters and tears, her choices compel Bliss to neglect Pash and to tell her family too much lies. Plot is more than predictable and follows the structure of sport fairy tales like ""Ice Princess"", but first-time director Drew Barrymore covers everything with a delicate, feminine, graceful spirit, and builds up a delightful leading lady, whose coming of age can be easily enjoyed. Kudos to a perfect Page, that, even in a less flamboyant role than Juno, forgets the sassy lines and plays a shy girl who gets to know herself and knocks down all her insecurities, in the name of Girl Power. Barrymore makes a movie that recalls the sport movies from the Seventies and the girl power from the Nineties, mixed up in a very faithful portrait of the suburbs and of the provincial way of thinking. The atmosphere turns melancholic in the last quarter, when Bliss must pick up the pieces and fix things with her parents, with Pash, with Oliver, with her favorite team mate Maggie Mayhem. The technical aspects are the weak points. Editing is rough and cinematography tends to zoom abruptly, but Barrymore can still improve a lot. Go girls!"
"eddax","10","2","6","6 September 2010"," Drew & her cast whip it good!
","Okay, finally I see why Ellen Page deserved an Oscar nomination for Juno. Her performance in that movie was pretty much obscured by its overwhelming dialogue, but here, she really shines in a similar role of a teenager growing up and discovering herself while facing adversity. It is a lovely story too, how she joins a very physical roller derby in Austin to get out of her little town and makes good friends while she's at it. And it's a nice balance of comedy and drama and action, with just enough of each genre to keep the movie going at a good pace.<br/><br/>There is a great supporting cast in this movie. Marcia Gay Harden is her usual perfection as Page's ex-beauty queen mom. Kristen Wiig gives a surprisingly tempered performance and even has a scene in which she shows that she's ready for a dramatic role. Juliette Lewis is more fun as the villainess than I've seen her in a long time. And Drew Barrymore is charming as usual in an otherwise small role, since she was the director of the movie as well. I hadn't even realized she was the director till the end credits and I was wondering a little about why her part was so small. Great first work, Drew!"

","Drew Barrymore's directorial debut doesn't score points for originality, but her cast is absolutely perfect. Everyone here has a moment or moments to stand out; from Kristen Wiig in a complete 180 change from her SNL-styled performances in past films; to Zoe Bell as a spunky roller-girl. Alia Shawkat finally gets a chance to really shine as what is basically a sidekick, but a well- written one (where are her leading roles???). Daniel Stern has some of the film's best scenes with Page as her father. Overall you know the basic mechanics of Whip It's plot (though there are one or two welcome moments that sidestep or completely change the clichés typically found in films of this genre) but the cast and Barrymore's first-class handling of them make it an incredibly fun and worthwhile ride."
"Likes_Ninjas90","7","2","6","22 October 2009"," Buoyed almost entirely by a sympathetic performance from a very special young actress
","In the suburbs of Bodeen, Texas, a teenage misfit named Bliss (Ellen Page) is forced into beauty pageants by her controlling and conservative mother (Marcia Gay Harden). Bliss is low on confidence and has to work in a depressing diner called the Oink Joint, where she is surrounded by rude and selfish customers. When buying shoes one day, Bliss picks up a pamphlet advertising a women's roller skating derby. Bliss and her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) secretly attend the derby and Bliss is fortunate enough to catch the eye of a young rocker named Oliver (Landon Pigg) and to also be invited to attend the roller derby team tryouts herself. Although she has not used skates since she was small, Bliss has a great mixture of footwork and speed and is accepted into the team, the Hurl Scouts. She is joined by other misfits and extremely tough girls such as Smashley Simpson (Drew Barrymore) and Rosa Sparks (Rap singer Eve). The team is yet to win a game in its history and is regularly overshadowed and taunted by its fierce rivals.<br/><br/>The directional debut of Drew Barry is a very formulaic sports film, but it is elevated greatly by a lovely performance by Ellen Page, who brings a real sense of endearment to the screen. With her drooping body language and tiny frame, Page's character convincingly displays a look of vulnerability and innocence. Small touches, like the cracks in her nerdy glasses and her twisted feet as she stands, add to the believability of her character. She is very obviously an outcast and the way she is pushed around by people including her own mother, warrants our sympathy for her. Although she is again playing a teenager, Page is very far from her role in Juno here. It is as though all of that ultra confidence and sassy attitude has been drained from her. Though Bliss' rise to top form in the ring is certainly predictable, seeing her effortlessly skating in circles, high-fiving spectators and overcoming her insecurities, makes the film a real pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Though the film is quietly funny at times, sports lovers will also be delighted with the competency in which the roller derby sequences are handled. Although this not exactly Million Dollar Baby, the fierce hits, cheap shots and bloody noses ensure that this should not be mistaken for a kid's sports film either. This is an extremely brutal, tough and surprisingly violent game at times. The action in all of the matches throughout is very exciting and Barrymore has done a solid job of capturing the brutality of the sport and the hits from these extremely fierce and brave women.<br/><br/>The film is not without its mistakes though. Some moments, such as a food fight, would seem more fitting in a Disney movie and until an exciting climax; the film feels slightly over-extended in its third act. The relationship too between Bliss and Oliver has been criticised for being seemingly uninteresting. Rather cleverly though, the abrupt end to their relationship actually does serve to reinforce the film with a simple but edgy message. This is not a story about winning people over to one's cause. Rather, it is a film about living in the moment and enjoying what feels right you at the time. Although by the end Bliss' mother still does not approve of the sport and states that it won't last, this does not matter. Bliss is not out to satisfy her parents but to do something that feels fitting for her own persona. She has found something that determines herself as a tough and tenacious fighter and in the final frames she is able to literally stand above the Oink Joint.<br/><br/>Drew Barrymore has made fun and entertaining picture that is buoyed almost entirely by a sympathetic performance from a very special young actress. Without Page, the film would probably collapse under its own predictability. Yet it is Ellen Page's sense of vulnerability and her innocence that ensures that we want to see her character succeed on this journey and when she does it really leaves the audience in a spin. It's a very sweet film."

","Bliss (Ellen Page) lives in the small town of Bodine, Texas, where she goes to high school and works after class at the Oink Joint. Her mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), now a mail carrier, was once a small-time beauty pageant winner and enters her daughters in every nearby competition. Although Bliss does not like the gigs, she doesn't want to hurt her pushy mother and, in truth, shines at the pageants, due to her intelligent answers. Nevertheless, it is only her younger sister who comes home with the big trophies. Their father (Daniel Stern) does not want to cross his wife concerning his kids' extracurricular activities. One day, Bliss and her closest friend see a poster for a roller derby in Austen and, thinking they will meet some nice fellows, make up some fibs to attend. Once there, Bliss is awestruck. Attractive ladies whip around the rink, jostling for points and attention. Could she, Bliss, do this, too? Lying about her age, the young waitress is soon renamed Babe Ruthless and becomes part of the Hurl Scouts team. A very fast skater, her stardom and team begin to rise in the standings. But, since her parents do not know she is not attending the SAT classes she said she was while she is out of the house and with a young rock singer making eyes at her, will Bliss' future be, well, blissful? This is a five star, knockout debut for Barrymore and all of the others. What an intriguing, heartfelt story and homage to a little-known ""sport"" and what an energetic, inventive direction of it by our little Drew, now grown-up. The swimming pool scene alone is worth any ticket price. Then, too, the characters are wonderfully real and touching. Especially admirable is the way conflicts are resolved without shouting and with much love. In the main roles, Page, Harden, Stern, Barrymore herself, Juliette Lewis, Jimmy Fallon and all, all of the other cast members are terrific! The setting in Texas is lovely, the costumes are quite nice and every one of the other production niceties are topnotch. In short, whip out even twelve bucks or more to see this totally winning film. Awesome, Drew and Ellen, simply awesome...you go, girls!"
"eshwarmail","6","1","2","6 January 2017"," Mildly engaging and easily forgotten
","Reviewed May 2010<br/><br/>There is nothing on display that is either new or would impress you as what we expect from a director's debut - fresh ideas. <br/><br/>It follows a template structured narrative style that is visible in most movies of this genre and tries to emphasize similar values as following the passion or about friendship, love lost and gain etc. Just a few working formulas are chosen, a new backdrop picked and hashed into a movie. Out of all these what goes right here is that they don't do a bad job at it. <br/><br/>I have admired Ellen Page's performance in Juno and she is only getting better at it and this movie also features a host of good supporting performances too. The roller derby scenes could have been done a lot better and when I saw that Kiwi stunt woman I thought we are in here for a treat of sequences. There is absolutely nothing from her and overall a bit too disappointing. <br/><br/>It's a movie where you don't get bored and the performances try to connect with you for a bit, but by the end memory of the movie fades away quickly."
"mat-mcnaughton-254-33257","6","1","2","25 December 2012"," Roller derby, eh?
","For every sport there's surely a movie, and that's pretty cool. This movie has the typical ""child wants to do something that parents don't approve of"" plot so I can't really say it's anything new, but it is well-made and has a good cast. Ellen Page is the apex of faux high school actresses, but she gives up here ""Juno"" snark for actual passion (which is quite ironic as Alia Shawkat's character is named ""Pash""). The roller derby is fun to watch, especially with Jimmy Fallon as the announcer. I was kinda ticked to see another movie about beauty pageants, but oh well. Marcia Gay Harden was very good as a mother who wants her kids to be like she was, but I just didn't feel any love between her and Page. Overall, it's an interesting movie but I wouldn't really want to watch it again."
"bazmitch23","1","2","7","4 December 2013"," Sorry Drew
","Every time an actor or actress directs their first movie, they fail. Except for Ben Affleck.<br/><br/>What's wrong with this film: It's just another clichéd sports movie: The main character wants to do a sport but her parents forbid her, so she secretly does the sports behind their backs. The team don't like her and bully her, but warm up to her later. Main character's parents discover she's doing the sport and get her out of the team just when the big championship is coming up. Main character does a motivational speech to make her parents put her back in the team, it works. Main character joins the team just in time to take part in the championship, we've seen this many times.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is the same sarcastic character she always is and Zoe Bell can't act. However, it was nice to see Drew play a different character than the one she usually plays. In this film, she plays a wild woman who's is all brawn but no brain.<br/><br/>And for the hundredth time, we seen the ""friends fall out"" cliché."
"jdesando","Null","2","7","30 September 2009"," Not Raquel but entertaining anyway.
","Ellen Page is not Raquel Welch, but they both have played heroines of roller derby films, the former in the current Whip It and the latter in Kansas City Bomber (1972). Besides the obvious differences in bust line, the two characters are ages apart in age and maturity, Welch's K.C. Carr has two kids to worry about, Page's Bliss has two conventional parents and the boredom of Bodeen (Texas, that is) to escape.<br/><br/>Whip It is a modest tale of a young girl who finds salvation in nearby Austin's women's roller derby. The script is a running cliché from the shy girl becoming formidable to the aggressive girl growing up. So what new director Drew Barrymore brings to this enjoyable little dramady is the fun the Hurl Scouts girls have in their friendships and games, even in their enemies (what's not to enjoy with a 40 something Juliette Lewis hamming up the part of ""Iron Maiden"").<br/><br/>While Barrymore's camera doesn't provide much subtle analysis of the action, it does offer close-ups that help define the many interesting, but usually underdeveloped, characters. As for lead Ellen Page, now there's an actress with a future. Although this role hardly offers the edgy dialogue of Juno or gritty suspense of Hard Candy, she nonetheless makes this roller romp worth seeing.<br/><br/>Although the roller girls sitting next to me at the preview weren't half as glam as the actresses on the screen, I would have liked to hang out with those amateurs because they have the same energy and fun projected on the screen and an additionally tender je ne sais quoi that complements their toughness. Oh, well, I am a hopeless romantic on wheels.<br/><br/>If you have a daughter who needs to find a way to channel her rebellion, you would not do half bad by letting her join the derby or at least see Whip It, where women and girls hold the story better than most of the boy-men I have seen this year on the screen."
"enfant_perdu","7","2","7","27 September 2009"," Thoroughly Enjoyable
","Whip It is a slightly different take on the traditional coming-of-age tale. The story itself would have been pretty forgettable if not for its great cast and the fact that most of the film revolves around the memorable backdrop of the roller derby in Austin, Texas.<br/><br/>We get all of the standard elements of any teenage angst story: the parents who just don't get it, the popular kids who pick on the unpopular protagonist, the well-adjusted-but-equally-unpopular best friend, and so on. The plot itself is fairly predictable. And the ""girl power"" image promoted by this film feels a bit stale.<br/><br/>But Whip It is still a blast to watch, despite these flaws. Ellen Page is a delight, as always (although I fear she's in danger of becoming typecast). The supporting cast members were also enjoyable, especially Alia Shawkat, Andrew Wilson, and Kristen Wiig.<br/><br/>The tone of the film strikes a good balance between light-hearted humor and sincere drama. A few scenes border on being melodramatic, but they don't subtract that much from the overall experience.<br/><br/>The high-school characters in Whip It aren't necessarily the best role models, but their misbehavior probably won't be anything earth-shattering to any of today's high schoolers. At least we're left with a positive message about the importance of getting along with your family, no matter how difficult it can be at times.<br/><br/>And we're introduced to the roller derby culture, which comes off as a unique, entertaining, and inclusive social scene. After watching this movie, I'm tempted to see if there are any roller derby events in my area.<br/><br/>Whip It probably isn't going to win any major awards, but it's well worth two hours of your time, and it holds its own against other coming-of-age comedy-dramas."
"kwmac","8","2","8","26 September 2009"," great acting, excellent soundtrack, but the directing...
","I'm not sure Drew Barrymore's figured out how to structure a movie. The editing felt jagged, which made the story feel undeveloped. On the other hand, Ellen Page was great, and so was Alia Shawkat. And this is really the story of one character: Bliss (Ellen Page). The acting carried the movie, with more than a little help from the music. And the roller derby action was fun to watch. Actually, those were the best-directed parts of the movie. It can be hard to direct sports action, but Barrymore was just fine in that department. If only she'd had help from a more experienced editor, I think this film would have gone from good to great.<br/><br/>Still, it was a fun night at the movies, and I got a free t-shirt (for the ""sneak preview""). Even without the t-shirt, you should certainly go see it."
"bbewnylorac","8","1","3","4 December 2016"," A great movie
","I love this movie because It's full of heart. The world of roller derby itself is very interesting. But Shauna Cross's script is so witty and full of life that even if you don't know much about the sport, you follow the action easily. The cast is outstanding. Juliette Lewis and Kristen Wiig are two of the classiest actors around, and they obviously love their roles as two key roller derby players - very unconventional, gutsy women. Andrew Wilson, who plays the coach, is fantastic. Basically he's the butt of all their jokes, pretending to be tough when he's really a softy. Of course Ellen Page as the naive newcomer, Bliss, is outstanding. Few female actors get the chance to play such a spirited, smart character who goes on a genuine journey of discovery. And Page nails it. And as her very conservative mother, Marcia Gay Harden is great with a character who is flawed in trying to make Bliss something into something she's not -- a straightlaced debutante - but who is also someone Bliss still loves, and who wants the best for her daughter. Drew Barrymore does a great job both as director and as one of the roller derby team. Above all, even while there's a solid plot and lots of drama, Whip It never fails to entertain and make us laugh. And it tells stories about women, front and centre, which is refreshing. There should be more movies like this one."
"milamilaaa83","7","1","3","8 September 2012"," Quirky Comedy is worth the watch!
","Whip It is a movie starring Ellen Page as Bliss Cavendar which primarily focuses on her quest to find herself despite the many inner conflicts being stirred up by her mother. Her mother, Brooke Cavendar, is played by Marcia Gay Harden. Bliss's mother wants nothing more than for her daughter to become a success in the pageant world but it is clear very quickly that this is not the world in which Bliss belongs. Bliss's father, Earl Cavendar as played by Daniel Stern is more lenient and proves himself to want nothing more than for his daughter to be happy. There are several struggles between him and his wife Brooke displayed in the film. Bliss becomes familiar with the world of roller derby when she finds a flyer and somehow makes the team. Roller derby seems to be where she is destined to be and this movie takes the viewer on her journey as she battles with her mother and even some of her team mates to prove herself in this new world of derby. This film also starts some well-known faces including Drew Barry Moore as Smashley Simpson, Jimmy Fallon as Hot Tub Johnny Rocket and rapper, Eve as Rosa Sparks. The film is quirky and although there are some dramatic elements there is plenty of comedy sprinkled in. The film has as elements such as the movie Dogeball from 2004 starring Ben Stiller due to the comedic element and the make character's bought with adversity. The soundtrack to this movie was exceptionally great and with every song playing right on time. The music alone kept me glued to the television screen as I watched this young girl, Bliss, finds herself on this journey. The film was shot in a manner that makes the film seem timeless. The coloring used in the film almost gives the movie an eighties feel. The clothing chosen by the costume designer did not imply a specific era for the movie. The angles of the film during the actual roller derby make the viewer feel engaged and a part of the attending audience. There were some predictable happenings in the film but they were nothing that the unpredictable comedy could not make up for. By the end of the film, the characters become both relatable and likable. This quirky comedy with a classic plot is worth the watch."
"MrGKB","6","1","3","20 November 2010"," She's come a long way home...
","...from the winsome days of ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,"" but Drew ""Poison Ivy"" Barrymore has a much longer way to go before anyone accuses her of being the female Clint Eastwood or Quentin Tarantino. Her directorial chops are far from lacking in this by-the-book debut starring Ellen ""Juno"" Page, but ""Whip It""'s meager performance at the box-office suggests that she either picked a poor vehicle in which to strut her stuff (possible, given the heavy geek factor of Roller Derby), or simply didn't give audiences anything to make them sit up and say howdy (more likely). I'm sorry, but if you're making a movie called ""Whip It"" (about Roller Derby, of all things) and can't manage to work in at least a snippet of Devo's biggest/only hit, there's something wrong.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I don't mean to be too negative. Barrymore's handling of Shauna Cross' adaptation of her own novel is reasonably competent in a journeyman sort of way. I can't argue her ability to coax good performances from the likes of Page (who blessedly takes a distinct step away from her well-established teen-angst-with-worldly-attitude persona), Marcia Gay ""The Mist"" Harden, Kristen ""SNL"" Wiig, Juliet ""Natural Born Killers"" Lewis (slumming in a sadly underwritten support role), and Daniel ""Home Alone"" Stern. Barrymore does well with her cast, no question, even with the likes of relative non-actors like Zoe ""I'm really a stuntperson"" Bell, Eve ""I'm a rapper"" Jeffers, and Jimmie ""I'm a comedian"" Fallon, though admittedly she had no business aping the aforementioned Tarantino by inserting herself into an utterly forgettable ensemble role. Sorry, Drew, you ain't no Q., despite your best of intentions.<br/><br/>Ultimately, and as is almost always the case, the core weakness of the film is the script, with a secondary nod to the casting of Page in the lead. I haven't read the source novel (and likely never will), but I suspect it asked a lot less willing suspension of disbelief. Page as a beauty pageant regular (willing or otherwise)? No one in Roller Derby officialdom checking out her credentials? The miraculous transformation from erstwhile dilettante to seasoned jammer? These are a few of the happenstances that force the audience to turn a blind eye in order to buy into the story.<br/><br/>Back to Barrymore: as noted, the lady wrangles actors well (the one notable failure being the inexplicably cast Landon ""I'm a singer"" Pigg), but her cinematic abilities remain mundane. The actual derby sequences in the film merit some approval, but mostly left me wanting to rewatch Norm Jewison's classic ""Rollerball"" for genuine genre excitement and tension, despite some nice lensing by DP Robert ""Red Eye"" Yeomans. Any number of scenes meant for character development just don't get off the ground properly, a fault of the script again, but also due to Barrymore's irresolute sense of pacing. Everything's just a hair too pat and simplistic (a supposed Derby pro with the fanciful moniker, Maggie Mayhem, invites a frail pipsqueak like Page's Bliss Cavendar to try out?--C'mon!), and it all wraps up far too happily and tidily. It wouldn't take much editing to fit this film into the Family Channel or worse. Barrymore and Cross push all the right faux-feminist girl-power buttons, but really, they don't have much of anything terribly powerful to say. I'm unsurprised that it suffered an indifferent fate in the theaters; perhaps it'll do better on video.<br/><br/>Pretty much routine viewing, in one eye and out the other. I wish Ms. Barrymore well, but also wish she'd picked a better script to cut her directorial teeth upon."

The story is too predictable, and some of the characters came off as somewhat one-dimensional.<br/><br/>While this bothers me, Whip It does come with a few rare moments of brilliance. The mother/daughter relationship especially is great and is what kept me watching this movie to the end. And the most intense moments on the derby-track work well (and knowing that the actresses did their own stunts is always a plus), so this is still very watchable.

Ellen Page is a excellent actress but, let's face it, she has all the sex appeal of a Minnie Mouse or a Holly Hobbit.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a really first rate actress for someone so young. she was near brilliant in the terrific 'Hard Candy', and she was cute and engaging in the funny 'Juno', but i thought after 'Juno' she wasn't going to make anymore kids movies. guess not. her performance in this movie is disappointing. it's dull and immature and lacks any adult sophistication. she is totally overpowered by Juliette Lewis's knock out performance and more interesting character. as a matter of fact, Page was pretty much upstaged by all the actresses. Barrymore and Marcia Gay Harden are pretty hard to compete with.<br/><br/>the total innocuous, harmless of this kiddie flick confused me. i mean it's about the F'N roller derby. it's supposed to be mean and tough not a harmless film for kids. the minute Page falls in love with a boy who looks and acts like James Blunt and they have a mushy puppy love affair it pretty much turned me off to all of this<br/><br/>this is definitely a kids film. mostly a film for little girls. the only problem i could see any parent having with it is probably the drug usage and the swearing. some parents do'nt care about that stuff. as a 49 year old male that stuff doesn't phase me. i suppose if i had a teen age girl i would probably worry about it a little more.<br/><br/>aside from the performances of some outstanding actresses, the best thing i can recommend about this is that it's a good film for young girls. it empowers them and teaches them to toughen up for the hard knocks life can deal you. that's a good message and worth something. let's just hope it doesn't empower them to the point they lie about their age in order to join the roller derby. that or they get a tattoo or something."
"lewiskendell","7","1","4","5 April 2010"," Ellen Page flexes a little muscle.
","Whip It fits comfortably into the mold of many sports movies that came before it. Sure, it puts its own spin on things. The female-centered story and the roller derby were all relatively new to me, but the rest is basically the same themes we've seen before. A protagonist who finds confidence in a sport they never thought they would be good at. A rival who turns out to be not be such a bad person, after all. A conflict between a parent who wants one thing for a child, and a child who wants to go down a different path. These situations show up so often in movies, because they make for an interesting (if familiar) story.<br/><br/>Other than Jimmy Fallon (he's just too annoying for me to handle), the cast was pretty great. I love Ellen Page, so it's no surprise that I thought she was a great choice for the main character. There really wasn't much to complain about with this movie, at all. It may be nothing new, but it's well-done. And I actually know some things about roller derby, now."

","Drew Barrymore's directorial debut has all the makings of a cult classic, from the impeccable indie rock soundtrack to the impressive cast credentials, but unfortunately fails to deliver. Crude, unfunny jokes pepper a storyline chock full of clichés and corny dialogue, whilst the actresses struggle to bring life to the two-dimensional characters they are portraying. <br/><br/>The storyline focuses on a teenage misfit, Bliss Cavendar, coerced into performing at beauty pageants by her parents, whilst secretly yearning to explore the wilder side of life when she discovers a roller derby league not far from her home in Austin. As usual in these coming of age stories, Bliss meets a guy, falls out with her parents and flourishes within a new group of friends after overcoming a number of obstacles. This is all very pleasant but far from original, making it very easy to predict the outcome of the movie. <br/><br/>The inclusion of Ellen Page as the story's heroine is a wise move by Barrymore, fans of Juno desperate to see more of the star will certainly flock to the movie, if only to be disappointed. Despite this, Page puts in a fairly impressive performance, proving that she is a talented actor, even when presented with an average script.<br/><br/>I am sure that the target audience of twelve year old girls will get a lot out of Whip It but I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone else due to its lack of broad appeal. Whip it would definitely pass time during the April showers but I would prefer to get wet than suffer through this pre-teen chick flick once more.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>If you liked this film you will also enjoy these:<br/><br/>Juno, Bend It Like Beckham, The Blind Side and Me Without You"

"Smells_Like_Cheese","Null","1","4","12 February 2010"," When a problem comes along, you must Whip It good
","I saw the trailer for Whip It a few months ago and both my boyfriend and I were kind of looking forward to seeing it. Also to see Drew Barrymore graduate into being a director was something I was curious to witness. But I did have some set backs, Drew isn't that great of an actress, could she not only act well in the film but also direct the film to be good enough for the story line? Also Ellen Page, I loved this girl, but unfortunately, her fame from Juno got me in a tiff as she played the exact same character in Hard Candy, then she played after Juno in Smart People as the exact same character once again: sarcastic, rebellious and does her own thing. It's OK, but if you want your career to expand to something bigger, you have to be willing to show some growth and range as an actor. The film wasn't really around my area in the theaters, so my boyfriend and I had to wait for the rental, so we did rent this and watched it on Friday and all the concerns I had for this film turned out to be all wrong thankfully.<br/><br/>Bliss is a misfit in her small town in Texas and has no idea where her life is going. She allows her mother to push her into winning beauty pageant after beauty pageant, despite having no interest in it herself. She and her friend Pash dream of escaping their small town, with Pash planning to go to an Ivy League School in a big city and Bliss hoping to find something that will help her figure out where she belongs. During a shopping trip to Austin she finds it: roller derby. She and Pash secretly go to the roller derby event in Austin under the pretense of going to a football game. Bliss only wishes to tell the Hurl Scouts that they are ""her new heroes"" and is suddenly thrown into the idea of being in Roller Derby herself when Maggie Mayhem tells her to try out the next week for the team. She makes the team and soon discovers who she is and what she loves, but what she might have to give up and may have to disappoint her beauty pageant crazed mother.<br/><br/>Ellen Page showed a little more range in her character, she is rebellious, but also has a very shy and vulnerable side that I really enjoyed watching. Drew also did a great job considering this is her first time directing. The whole supporting cast is great, of course Marcia Gay Harden always pulling in an incredible performance as this crazy mom who just wants her daughter to be this 1950's step ford wife. There is a scene between Marcia and Ellen towards the end where they're starting to talk about how Ellen wants to go into a different direction in life but Marcia wants her to continue into her way of thinking, but they come to an understanding of each other was a great scene and the best of the movie. I'm also glad to see Zoe Bell get more roles, ever since I saw this girl in Death Proof, I've been dying to see her in something else, she's a tough chick who has a ton of energy and is an absolute delight to watch on screen. Also, is it just me, or does it seem like Juliette Lewis doesn't age? I know this girl has to be in her upper 30's, but she still looks like she's 21 and still has the acting chops. I really did enjoy the movie, even if it was predictable, it was a good time with the laughs and the great acting. I recommend this film if you get the chance, it leaves you with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ssshen7","8","1","5","23 February 2014"," Very Entertaining
","Whip It was surprisingly very entertaining and fun. Whip It is about a small town high school student played by Ellen Page who joins a roller derby team without her parents knowledge. It is a coming of age dramedy with some romance and family drama mixed in. <br/><br/>Going in, I had the impression it was going to be like some really cheesy and poppy chick flick, this being Drew Barrymore's first time directing also didn't help sooth my reservations but it wasn't and I was pleasantly surprised. I actually cared for the main characters and the performances all around are very good. Ellen Page is great and very likable. She carries the emotional weight of this movie. A special mention goes out to Andrew Wilson who was in my opinion the funniest guy in the movie. It was nice to see Kristen Wig playing a real person in this movie instead of some crazy character. <br/><br/>My only complaints are that some of the supporting characters didn't get enough screen time and that the plot is kind of predictable. Whip It is a very impressive directorial debut for Drew Barrymore. It is definitely worth watching even if you normally don't like chick flicks."
"zardoz-13","10","1","5","30 January 2012"," Roller Heroines!!!
","Drew Barrymore made a corker for her freshman effort! ""Whip It"" is all about empowering women and this is the best roller blade movie ever. Everything seems to come together without a flaw as Ellen Page heads up an all-star cast and the casting and performance really make this movie memorable, whether it is Daniel Stern as our heroine's father or Kristen Wigg as Maggie Mayhem, there isn't a bad performance. Ellen Page is terrific as a high school girl who just cannot seem to find her niche in life. Of course, her mom has her sights set on her lovely daughter becoming a beauty pageant queen so she can land a good husband, get into a great college, and enjoy the benefits of a well-earned life. However, beauty pageants are NOT a part of Bliss Cavander's agenda in life. The minute that she spots three gals careening into a thrift/head shop in Austin, Texas, Bliss knows what she wants to do is roller blade. Sadly, this inspirational little sports epic didn't generate stellar box office receipts, but it is worth watching for its oddball characters and its general thematic material. Sport movies fall into two types: those where the team is triumphant against overwhelming odds and those where the team isn't as successful against overwhelming odds. ""Whip It"" occupies the latter category."
"MBunge","5","1","5","9 November 2011"," No bad guys = no movie
","This movie is like that first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Gene Roddenberry was falling all over himself to prove how much better his new show and new crew were than the old one. Part of that was the conceit that by the time of Picard and company, humanity had evolved to a point where no one argued with anyone else. There would be no conflict between any of the main characters, neither a cross word nor an evil eye. T hey were supposed to be above the sort of squabbling we saw from Kirk, Bones and Spock and it was only our excitement over finally having new Star Trek on TV that kept us from realizing how lame that was. A world where no one quarrels with anyone else might be a great place to live but it's a terrible thing to watch. These filmmakers echo Roddenberry's ego with their refusal to let anyone play the bad guy in Whip It. Without a bad guy, though, you not only have no real threat or challenge to your hero, you don't have much of a hero at all.<br/><br/>Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a 17 year old girl in Bodeen, Texas. She works at the Oink Joint with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) and is getting pushed into the beauty pageant world by her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). However, Bliss is hardly some pageant girl. She dresses like she stepped off the CD cover of some alternative rock band and wants something, anything more than the life she feels her mother nudging her into. Then Bliss discovers the world of roller derby and a team called the Hurl Scouts that play in nearby Austin. She lies about her age to join the league and becomes a star, all the while hiding her new hobby from her parents. Bliss even falls in first love with the lead singer of a band. Everything seems wonderful until, and I hope this won't be too much of a shock, it all goes wrong. Her parents find out about the derby, a competitor finds out Bliss is too young to be skating, she finds out her new boyfriend is apparently cheating on her, etc. Don't worry, though. Since everybody in this film is just so darn decent and good and honorable, nothing really bad (or meaningful) is allowed to happen.<br/><br/>Other than far too much of Jimmy Fallon as a jagoff derby announcer, there's nothing else too dreadful about Whip It. Writer Shauna Cross and director Drew Barrymore create some believably funny and human relationships and come up with a surprisingly effective character in the male coach of the Hurl Scouts. Unfortunately, all that good work is undone by this movie's unwillingness to let any problem become too daunting or any person become too much of an a-hole. Let me give you some examples.<br/><br/>Bliss's attraction to the roller derby only connects with the audience to the extent that it's a joyous escape from a miserable existence. If her life isn't miserable, than roller derby can't be anything more than a lark. If Bliss's mother were a controlling shrew living out her dreams through her daughter and if her father was emotionally distant and disconnected, if her job at the Oink Joint or her life at school were especially difficult or degrading, if she was facing abuse or deprivation or rejection or some kind, then you could cheer for her fleeing to the larger-than-life world of roller derby. But Cross and Barrymore go to great lengths to make sure Bliss' mom and dad are shockingly non-horrible in the eyes of the viewer. What little we see of her time at school or work is no worse than any other teenager's. Bliss' 17 year old life is pointedly devoid of trauma or tragedy. And that extends to pretty much everything in Whip It. It turns out the boyfriend she thought cheated on her may not have. The competitor who threatened to turn her in, decides she'd rather beat Bliss on the track. Every single person in this story who could have been a potential antagonist winds up neutered with niceness.<br/><br/>These filmmakers also don't appear to understand that a motion picture is more than a series of scenes. Actions and events and even behavior is supposed to build one upon another until it leads to some kind of climax or resolution. That focus is lacking here. When we first meet the Hurl Scouts, they're a lovable band of losers who couldn't care less if they ever win match. As the film goes along, they become better and more competitive and care about winning. Then when the big championship battle comes against their arch rivals, they lose and suddenly winning is irrelevant to them and, clearly, it's supposed to be equally irrelevant to the audience. And it's not like they lose for a reason, like they decided there was something more important than winning. They just get beat and don't care.<br/><br/>Whip It is a lot of tasty frosting covering a dry and tasteless birthday cake. If you're content to scrape off the frosting and enjoy that, it's not bad but everything underneath will leave you unsatisfied."
"perkypops","8","1","5","17 April 2011"," Drew Barrymore can do so much more than acting....
","When I first saw this film I found it hard to believe it was Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, it is such a very good film in so different many ways. Great story, well told, well shot, and well acted. It has tremendous energy in the action sequences, deals with the underlying ""coming of age"" theme in a way that demonstrates how we have to accommodate change as we come to treasure all those who participate in our journey through life. And Drew Barrymore uses all her personal experience in drawing the best out of Shauna Cross's excellent screenplay.<br/><br/>The extremes at play are the ""Blue Bonnet Pageant"" trophy or a roller derby league in which various 'girls' find something they can really do. And girls at play can be really scary as Drew Barrymore touchingly asks us to remember, as bitchiness enters the pageant scene.<br/><br/>This is a movie that flies past you in a series of well timed scenes, so the almost two hours seems like it is much shorter. And, not one character is wasted on the journey.<br/><br/>Enjoyable and recommended."

","I was expecting to enjoy Whip It, but not as much as I did. My appreciation for it is close to that of Juno (8/10). It's always nice to see my expectations exceeded. It's a charming blend of humor and drama without grabbing for too much of either. I like the personality of the film and how it unfolds.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is quite appealing to me as an actress and a personality. She's the best thing to come out of Canada in, I dare say, decades. Juliette Lewis is very much in her element. It's good to see Zoe Bell of Tarantino fame. I even like Jimmy Fallon who normally does nothing for me. Pash (Shawkat) is a tad annoying.<br/><br/>I'm pleased with every aspect of Drew Barrymore's direction. I'd love for her to direct again if some decent material comes her way. Whip It is a feel good film. When it was over, I felt better about life in general, and not because it was over."
"Tweekums","8","1","5","7 January 2011"," Fine first film from director Drew Barrymore
","Having enjoyed Ellen Page's performances in 'Hard Candy' and 'Juno' as well as liking Drew Barrymore I was keen to see this film even though I don't think I'm part of the target demographic. I was not disappointed; Ellen Page was great as Texas school girl Bliss who is being groomed by her mother to become a beauty queen but discovers her true ambition when she tries out for the 'Hurl Scouts'; a team in the roller derby league in Austin. The team has a reputation for always losing but the girls are clearly having a lot of fun even if their coach wishes they'd try a bit harder. Knowing her mother would not approve of her joining a roller derby team she tells her that she is taking extra classes before sneaking off to Austin on the pensioners' bingo-bus! Once there Bliss becomes 'Babe Ruthless' and with her natural talent the team start to win matches and are heading for the finals; there a few problems though; the final is in the same night as an important beauty pageant and her rival in another team has learnt that Bliss is only seventeen so shouldn't be competing without her parents permission.<br/><br/>This film might not be the best known film of 2009 it is a lot of fun; as mentioned before Ellen Page is great as Bliss and Drew Barrymore did a fine job in her directorial debut as well as playing fellow Hurl Scout 'Smashley Simpson' and Juliette Lewis was impressive as Bliss's rival 'Iron Maven'. The idea of having a losing team get better to reach the finals might not be the most original sporting dramas there was still plenty of excitement watching the matches and when the characters took a blow it did look as if it genuinely hurt. While this film can be enjoyed by anybody I suspect it is targeted mainly at teenage girls who can take away the message that they can compete in sports and they don't need to be dating somebody even if they aren't suitable to enjoy themselves."

","It doesn't take long into Whip It until one knows pretty much how the story will turn out in the end. The story is one that has been told many many times before. The conflict between mother and daughter, bad team that manages to become the best and so on. Still I enjoyed this film so perhaps this kind of plot type hasn't been done to many times yet and not yet with roller derby theme at least. Actually there was maybe one thing that I didn't see coming but it still is not enough to make Whip It it's own kind, definitely not, sadly. This is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut and she has done a very good job. So even though the plot is very simple it is executed greatly. The scenes are brilliantly done both how directed and acted. Ellen Page is great and perfect in the lead roll as the cute shy girl. All the acting is so well performed that one doesn't care that much that some of the stuff is pretty silly overly emotional and way to sweet. There are some scenes were the acting is so hyperactive but still one feels the overacting is meant to be so and not that it's badly done. The music which is a bunch of popular songs by various artists is well chosen for the feel of the film. Even if I get the feeling that the script is kind of thin the characters are really good, which is probably thanks to the good acting. Of course Ellen Page is the one who shines and not just because she is in the main role. The whole tone of the film is kind of hyper but they also manage to create a sense of substance thanks to the strong feeling the viewer gets for the heroine. The humor works well with some really great hints to some classic films that everybody knows. Still I feel the humor doesn't take such a big place, but that is fine because if it had it would risk to take focus away from the other important positive aspects. Whip It is a simple, foreseeable but somewhat funny movie. But I'm not disappointed because for me it didn't seem like a film to have very big expectations on just simple entertainment. After reading some other reviews I found that it had received very positive verdicts but I felt they were a bit overrated, it is good but not that good. Whip It is a fun feel good comedy, worth seeing 6/10."

Drew Barrymore deserves a standing ovation for her directorial debut, and i'm praying she keeps going. <br/><br/>I certainly have a soft spot for Ellen Page. Since i saw her in 'Hard Candy' and 'Juno', i've been intrigued in the work she chooses, and her role as Bliss was just perfect. A total indie rock chick by day, who works at the goofy but classic 'Oink Joint' and wears a piggy apron. But by night she transforms into roller derby sensation Babe Ruthless, surrounded by the equally amazing 'Hurl Scout' team. It portrays the average mother/daughter conflict that most go through well. Both have different ideas regarding Bliss' future; Her mom wanting her to compete in Pagaents while Bliss wants to get out of Bodeen, Texas and get herself a life. Differences which in the end reunites them together. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is fab, fab, fab. Such a mixture; from Dolly Parton to Kings of Leon to Jens Lekman. And each suited the scene so well. <br/><br/>I don't think this film has an age or sex limit. I think everyone can enjoy it and get something different out of it. It also makes you feel DAMN good!

","The teen movie is a genre that has always fascinated me with its ability to give kind of profound insight into what it means to be yourself and the state of humanity. A good teen movie is always a great slice of life for the time and place it is set as it is usually immersed in the pop culture of the time. Look at 80's teen movies, they're like time capsules. Whip It!, for me was a brilliant, brilliant teen movie. It features a complicated heroine, Bliss, who often makes very wrong decisions and who slowly tries to find out who she is and over time, she does. It also features a wide variety of grown-ups with equally complicated issues. Bliss's mom, who is a former beauty queen and still incredibly beautiful but works as a postman in the most unflattering uniform ever invented makes for a very sympathetic villain.<br/><br/>Now, don't get the wrong idea about Whip It! It's not a serious, whingy, moany, emo film, it is the best fun I've had in the cinema in ages. Roller derby! Who would've thought it could be so cool. Hot girls with silly hair, red lips, short skirts and fishnets. I'm mad up for that! OK, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Whip It! is a big girlfest right? Well, technically it is. But I'm one hundred percent sure that if I were a man I'd be just as down with this movie as I am in my current body. Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, it's easy to see what attracted her to the script. In some ways it is as full of clichés as any other teen movie but it sets up these clichés in order to smash them! Ellen Page, is infinitely more likable here than usual because the script gives her more to work with than just quippy one-liners. The supporting cast are also amazing with Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig and Barrymore herself bringing a touch of hilarity and spunk to proceedings. Another thing to admire is the lack of girliness on the roller derby track. The girls are rough, there's plenty of blood and bruises and the stunts are great! Like all good sports movies, the competition sequences were shot with a sense of sweaty mayhem that keeps the audience feeling exhuberant. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I wanna be Drew Barrymore when I grow up! You may call this predictable and formulaic but you can't deny that it is fresh and exciting. The cast are top-notch, the skating sequences are exciting and the script is both intelligent and hilarious at times. Unless you're dead against this type of movie, you'll have a blast!"

","This weekend on a whim I popped in a DVD of Whip It, which is Drew Barrymore's debut as a director. I must say that it surprised me. A movie about roller derby?! Really?<br/><br/>First and foremost, it's a movie about a girl named Bliss who's tired of living her mother's fantasies and is looking for a way out of her small town of Bodeen, Texas. Bliss's mother, Brooke Cavendar, is a US Postal Woman whose days of beauty pageants are long gone. This doesn't stop her from trying to live vicariously through Bliss. But despite doing quite well at these pageants, Bliss is actually a tomboy and indie rock fan at heart and after picking up a roller derby flyer on a shopping trip in Austin, she becomes a roller derby fan as well. After her first roller derby soiree, Bliss is intent on trying out for the Hurl Scouts, but couldn't find the courage without a short pep talk with her best friend Pash:<br/><br/>Pash: But you don't have the balls.<br/><br/>Bliss: I can grow the balls<br/><br/>And she does grow the balls. Bliss takes a bus back into Austin to try out and with her sheer speed she makes the team and an enemy, Iron Maven. Iron Maven is the poster-child of roller derby and is the leader of the Holy Rollers, a gang of bad ass chicks clad in Catholic schoolgirl uniforms. The bouts are tough. The Hurl Scouts fight their way to the top with frequent usage of ""The Whip"" and a slew of ""plays"", which actually means ""beat the crap out of the other team"". The different plays and special moves keep the movie entertaining.<br/><br/>One of my favorite things about this movie is all the creative skater names: Maggie Mayhem, Smashley Simpson, Rosa Sparks, Eva Destruction, Bloody Holly, Iron Maven, and of course Babe Ruthless are fantastic names. I browsed a list of actual roller derby names online, and these are pretty good in comparison. Under these fancy skater names are interesting characters also. Ellen Page fits the role of Bliss Cavendar perfectly. Beneath her shy and quirky exterior lies a great reservoir of spunk, which she unleashes on the skating rink. I also liked Drew Barrymore's character, Smashley Simpson. She's really rowdy. She throws punches first and asks questions later. Maybe my favorite is Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), a skater and single mother who threatens to break her son's legs if he ever lies to her – jokingly of course.<br/><br/>It has a bit of girl-power and a bit of the can-do spirit. If you've ever felt a little bored of your daily life and crave a dose of excitement, then give Whip It a try. It might just inspire you to get off your butt and do something about it.

","Drew Barrymore has seen everything. She's been everywhere, she's worked with everybody; she reached the top, fell all the way to the bottom and, patiently and professionally, tried to climb again. Last year she collected very important awards for her wonderful performance in ""Grey Gardens"", and she also directed her first film, ""Whip it"", which is very much like her: charming, fresh, winning, sexy in that very particular way Barrymore always made us think about 'sexy'. Some friends laugh at me when I say Drew Barrymore is sexy; I know she's pretty, but she's sexy too. <br/><br/>Beautiful and confident as Barrymore, Bliss Cavendar is the hero of the film. She's played by Ellen Page, who reminds us of Barrymore not because of her role choices or acting abilities but because she has that special naturalness: not the one that makes you great (anyone can achieve greatness –something more related to what others think and rarely aware of the truth inside people-, sooner or later, even if they don't deserve it), I mean the naturalness that doesn't question the fact that someone has been born to live on the screen, forever. Barrymore is that someone, and so is Page. <br/><br/>But the hero Bliss is a particular being. Particular because she innerly defies the suffocating nature of a town in Texas named Bodeen. The film's opening scene is the setting of a beauty pageant. While all of the girls look like Barbies ready to be locked in a box, Bliss is in the bathroom with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat, revelatory) resolving a situation involving blue hair, if you know what I mean. And it's not that Bliss isn't beautiful (I said she was, didn't I?) and smart; she can win any beauty pageant but she just doesn't believe in it. Still, she does it because it's important for her mom (Marcia Gay Harden, moving as usual). Also, it's not that she's this rebellious, bright, somewhat revolutionary teen that wants to change the world. She wants to get out of Bodeen, plain and simple; and so does her best friend. Wait, I still haven't mentioned the best part about the main character. Bliss perfectly knows what she doesn't want, but she still hasn't found what she wants, what might –or not- define her in some way. We see her working in a diner, and then lying in bed. We can tell that she isn't unhappy, but she isn't happy either. <br/><br/>As a director, Barrymore is wise enough to present Bodeen not as the dumb little village it could have been presented as. I guess Shauna Cross, the film's writer and the author of the novel it's based on, knows that a town like this is not always as we watch it on film. But Barrymore holds the key card. She's seen enough to understand there are conventional plot developments that can't be skipped. Hell, she even knows that the dad played by Daniel Stern has to be kind of primitive but good-hearted as no other character in the movie. However, she fights. No, not to bring something new (in that case, the roller derby, a sport and main event of the movie, is unexplored enough): she fights for something pure, honest. The transparent connection she's always conveyed as an actress makes ""Whip it"" the movie she would have chosen to make but could never be real until now. Now she's the boss.<br/><br/>That's why the music -by The Section Quartet- plays, mostly, as a silent soundtrack, without talking for the characters. That's why the characters, mostly, don't even talk themselves (there's a beautiful love scene, shot underwater, that begins with pure gestures and concludes the same way, with expressive looks and absolutely no words), except for 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket (played by Jimmy Fallon who, well directed, is actually good, and achieved the best performance of his career alongside Barrymore in ""Fever Pitch""), the narrator of the roller derby games, a necessarily unbearable character that goes against the quiet nature of the film. That's why Bodeen is never really Bodeen and the sermons are never sermons (the conversations between Bliss and her parents, which are many, are short and potent, never aiming for a certain dramatic impact that only occurs –inevitably- towards the end and between the parents, or when the parents are on their own). That's why there's a character that sings played by a singer, Landon Pigg. <br/><br/>I mean I might be exaggerating but I think Drew Barrymore is probably the only person who can gather a supporting cast that includes a female stunt double (Zoe Bell), a rapper (Eve), a SNL comedian (Kristen Wiig), two probable skaters who never did a film in their lives (Kristen Adolfi and Rachel Piplica), a relatively unknown comedian (Andrew Wilson) and an Oscar nominated actress, among other things. Of course Barrymore plays a role, but a very little one, graciously exaggerated to the point that the viewer is never waiting for her appearance. Even when it's impossible to miss a moment created by her, entirely for her, in which she shouts ""food Fight!"", the Barrymore that directs also proves to be selfless and lets her actors shine. <br/><br/>Oh, yes, they shine, in the never-ending tale about finding yourself. The moment in which Bliss meets three roller derby players, something cracks; in her and in the movie, who makes way for one of its few slow-motion shots. When you know what you want, that's when you become sexy. The thing with Drew Barrymore is that she knew it all along."
"aefrench","7","1","5","22 April 2010"," Welcome to the world of roller derby!
","""Whip It"" takes you into the sport of roller derby, which can be quite intense for the participants, and for the spectators. However, the movie is more than that. <br/><br/>Ellen Page is likable as Bliss Cavendar, a seventeen-year-old who is a regular at teen pageants in the state of Texas. While her mother (Marcia Gay Harden) and little sister enjoy the pageant circuit, it is not for Bliss.<br/><br/>One day, the trio are at a store, and as Bliss pays for a pair of shoes, she sees three women come in, all on roller skates. They leave behind fliers for a roller derby in Austin. Bliss and her best friend Pash go to the event, and Bliss is immediately interested in the sport. After the match, she meets one of the skaters, Maggie Mayhem (SNL's Kristen Wiig, who does a good job with the role). Maggie tells Bliss she should try out, despite the fact that Bliss has not skated in years. Bliss says she'll attend the tryout, lying about her age during the conversation (the minimum age to participate is twenty-one).<br/><br/>Bliss returns home and starts skating. She shows up to the tryout, and earns a spot on the Hurl Scouts team. The trouble is that the Hurl Scouts are the worst team on the circuit. Bliss also makes an enemy in the form of Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis, who was well cast), the obligatory arrogant athlete who also happens to be the best on the track. In her debut, Bliss, who is now Babe Ruthless (you have to love the name), draws praise from her teammates, and the head coach, Razor (Andrew Wilson, who is a crackup in this movie).<br/><br/>Time passes, and Bliss gets better at roller derby, and so do the Hurl Scouts. While this is going on, Bliss has a developing romance with Oliver, a musician. <br/><br/>The Hurl Scouts continue to tear up the circuit, reaching the title game to take on the team led by Iron Maven. What will happen?<br/><br/>This was Drew Barrymore's first film as a director, and she deserves praise for the job she did. Drew also deserves a nod for her turn as Smashley Simpson, who is the goofiest member of the Hurl Scouts. The movie works as a comedy and drama. It is really a coming-of-age tale, and it is a good one. I recommend that you watch ""Whip It."""
"neil-476","9","1","5","7 April 2010"," Highly enjoyable
","Ellen Page is Bliss Cavendar, a 17 year old who spends much of her time reluctantly participating in beauty pageants for the vicarious enjoyment of her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). And then one day Bliss discovers roller derby, and everything changes.<br/><br/>For a small movie, Whip It touches on some fairly heavy issues - families, friendship, fulfilment, fidelity, and various other things beginning with F (and some which begin with other letters). But it touches on them deftly (and, sometimes, a little glibly), and always entertainingly. This is a very enjoyable script with many smiles in it.<br/><br/>Th roller derby sequences are well staged, if a little obviously protective of the tiny Miss Page. The film is well cast, with Kristen Wiig and Daniel Stern being particularly appealing.<br/><br/>But, again, Ellen Page claims the film, with a performance which is funny, perceptive, touching and sexy."
"creamsodafilms","8","1","5","14 October 2009"," Whip It is for everyone!
","I saw this film on a date night with my wife and found it to funny, well-written and well-acted. It is so much more about life than it is about Roller Derby, but those scenes are fun to watch as well.<br/><br/>The most surprising aspect of this film to me was the superb acting. Ellen Page delivers a humanity to this film that takes it to another level. The scenes between Ellen Page and Marcia Gay Harden (who plays Ellen's mother) are the most poignant. Jimmy Fallon is surprisingly funny as the Roller Derby Announcer, while the ""other"" Wilson brother, Andrew, plays a passionate yet tender Roller Derby coach just perfectly.<br/><br/>In a scene where Ellen's character is confronted about her Roller Derby escapades by her mother and father, the acting is of such a high quality, one feels like they have been thrown back into their own childhood, coming home to that disappointed parent.<br/><br/>Juliette Lewis is also such a wonderful villain in this film. It really shoes that she had fun taking on this roll. She is the only character in the film that moves the story forward every time she is on screen.<br/><br/>This was a great flick whether it was meant for the 13-24 female demographic or not. It deserves to be seen by people who can appreciate excellent acting and a great story. I highly recommend it."
"chas437","9","1","6","4 November 2010"," Original Plot?
","Don't get me wrong, this is a kick ass movie but anyone notice the plot is essentially identical to ""Bend it Like Beckham""? <br/><br/>Also, while I love Ellen Page and think she her future is limitless, her character in ""Whip It"" is just a bit too similar to her character in ""Juno"". Getting type cast at an early stage in her career is a something she should consider in future roles. That said I think she is probably the most talented actress in her age group and that she will expand into other types of roles with great success. She exudes intelligence, wit and confidence.<br/><br/>I really love the modern spin on Roller Derby. I think the revival of the sport began in San Fransisco in the early 2000s and spread to places like Seattle, Austin, etc. I hope we get it in my town soon! The culture of neo-roller derby probably doesn't appeal much to the old-school feminist paradigm, but see it as very empowering to women."
"Michael Fargo","8","1","6","2 October 2009"," Usually...
","...movies don't get better as they move along, but here's one that really flowers in the second half. The first half is rickety and blunt. But as these very strong performers (particularly the supporting ones) garner more time on the screen, the more you fall for them.<br/><br/>Ellen Page is a little too winsome for my tastes. She's beautiful and brings a persona that's fresh to the screen, but I always feel like her performances are rehearsals and she needs one more take to nail it.<br/><br/>But once the second half of the movie arrives (after a party where she connects with a guy), I really fell in love with Ellen Page. The film builds to a choice her character has to make, and while it's a little generous to think a young kid would make the choice she does, it's very heart-warming. Her scene with Marsha Gay Harden sitting in front of a refrigerator is one of the nicer pieces of acting this year. And all of that is boosted by a sensational performance by Daniel Stern as Page's Dad. He epitomizes great screen acting.<br/><br/>The roller derby team which Page's character joins is likely the reason most of us bought a ticket to see this movie. It's an eclectic bunch and everyone fulfills what we like to think roller derby mama's might be like (always happy to see Zoe Bell doing ANYTHING on the screen). Unfortunately, Barrymore bit off a little more than she could chew in making the roller derby sequences coherent or exciting, and that drags the movie down. Even the crowd scenes feel hollow, and at least we can still look forward to that great roller derby movie in the future.<br/><br/>But Barrymore does make the heart of this movie both touching and fresh. Since it's like a hundred movies we've probably seen, that's quite an accomplishment. We know where the movie is going, and Barrymore keeps steering just slightly off course so we don't anticipate too much. I look forward to a quieter, more intimate film from her, since I think that's where her talents really lie.<br/><br/>Just to mention: We get to see a great deal of Juliette Lewis in full roller derby scowl. I couldn't wait for her character to reappear and each time she does, the movie lights up. More, more, more (please)."
"erikbramsen","Null","0","3","21 November 2011"," Meh!
","I'm a fairly recent convert to roller derby having found it an excellent spectator sport: simple rules, fast pace, exciting showdowns and a good balance between grace and power. So I was really looking forward to this movie and it took me some effort to get my mitts on a copy.<br/><br/>And it's not actually bad as such; Ellen Page is cuter than a thousand Ewoks, the score is good and Barrymore is always a treat. I don't even mind the utter predictability, that's just how some movies roll, no pun intended.<br/><br/>But it never really gripped me. The comparison to a masterpiece like Bend It Like Beckham may be a bit unfair but it's inevitable as Whip It is an almost 1:1 rip-off. But where Jess is a plausible footballer, Bliss (""Bliss""? Really?) is just not believable. She never makes us understand why she's attracted to roller derby, except as an escape from her over-the-top horrible parents and she never really manages to make the transition from meek mommy's girl to bad-ass rollergirl, not even when she pulls the ultimate empowerment trick and takes off her glasses. Her nick, Babe Ruthless remains a joke.<br/><br/>It also remains a mystery how she suddenly becomes the fastest thing on eight wheels. There's no Rocky theme, no real struggle, it just happens. One moment she Bambi on roller skates, the next she's flying like the wind. Same thing with her team. One moment they are losers, the next moment they are kicking ass. How did that come about? Oh yeah, they suddenly decide to listen to the weirdo posing as a coach.<br/><br/>So, at least this movie has some smoking derby action? Well, not really. I've seen more exiting footage on my local team's website and without the fistfights and the gutter moves too. And I'm from Copenhagen, for heavens sake!"
"freemantle_uk","8","0","3","30 October 2011"," 'We're number two, we're number two'
","Ever since childhood Drew Barrymore has been seen as one of the wild children of Hollywood and struggled to find her right calling. She has been in some good films like Donnie Darko but with Whip It she has shown she is a very capable director. So much so Barrymore has been linked to the Twilight series and already done a really good music video with Chloe Mortez.<br/><br/>Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a Texan 17-year-old who is unhappy with her life: her mum (Marcia Gay Harden) has been forcing her to enter into beauty pageants and all she want to do is escape her small town life. She gets an opportunity when in Austin she stills some roller derby girls and she tries out for a team in the local league. Bliss discovers she is a fast roller skater and with her abilities the worst team in the league start to win. But along the way Bliss falls for a local musician, Oliver (Landon Pigg), forms a friendship with her captain Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wigg), forms a rivalry with the star power of a rival team, Iron Maven (Juliette Lewis) and has to hid her new activity from her parents.<br/><br/>Whip It is both a sports film and a coming-of-age story and Barrymore and her writer Shauna Cross was able to balance both elements perfect. Tone and style wise it was very much like Juno (and not just because Ellen Page is starring in it). The dialogue is funny but unlike Juno it is more grounded and realistic and combined with the performances of the cast it was all very natural. The cinematography and the music was also very much like Juno, the music being a mix of old indie and rock and fitting to the setting. Barrymore also delivers some real strong set pieces, using hand-held cameras during the roller derby to follow the action and showing an underwater romantic scene. Barrymore was able to mix the comedy and drama to great effect, being funny with dialogue and physical humour whilst allowing Bliss to grow from an unhappy girl to a self-confidence young woman who finds her scene of belonging in the world.<br/><br/>I am personally not a fan of Page, but I think in Whip It she delivers her best performance so far. Whilst I question her being a beauty queen because I believe Page has a more of a girl next door look about her; but her character was more likable then in Juno, someone who more believable then the cocky, sarcastic creature in that other film. Barrymore forms a strong female cast, Wiig plays a very straight role as a mentor to Bliss and Lewis is a typical bully, picking on someone she thinks is weaker then her. Harden starts of as a typical pushy parent but she too also grows and is given more depth then we usually see. Alia Shawkat plays a loyal friend really well and her friendship with Page was a believable typical teenage friendship. Drew Barrymore also has a small role, a character who is either hurting people or getting hurt herself: it was good that she avoided the self-indulgence of giving herself the mentor role. Out of the male members of the cast Andrew Wilson was very funny as the coach of the team and Daniel Stern is a typical supportive dad. For a man who has not acted before Pigg was also a very competent performer.<br/><br/>One little bit of nicpicking I have is for a film that is set in Texas most of the cast talk in normal American accents, not Texan actresses. If they were going to speak in their normal voices why not set the film in another state like Kansas, Colorado or Arizona.<br/><br/>The way Whip It plays out it feels very believable, a story that could actually happen. It was a natural little film."
"hall895","7","0","3","16 July 2011"," Director Drew does very well
","Having been involved in movies all her life Drew Barrymore finally gets the chance to direct one. And she does a very good job. Whip It is not any kind of all-time classic movie. But it is very entertaining and enjoyable. Barrymore draws out excellent performances from her cast, most notably the undisputed star of the show, Ellen Page. With Page in the lead role there's a temptation to call this Juno on Skates. But while Whip It does at times have an unmistakable Juno vibe this movie manages to differentiate itself, to stand on its own two feet. It has an energy all its own.<br/><br/>You have to give Barrymore credit for the way she immerses us in the rather bizarre roller derby world. Maybe most people are aware of roller derby but how many people really know anything about the sport, how it even works? Barrymore quickly makes sense out of the chaos, explaining the rules of the game without dragging the movie to a screeching halt. And once we actually understand what's going on the fun can really begin. And there is plenty of fun to be had in this story of the rollicking roller derby girls and the newcomer to the sport who is determined to be her own hero.<br/><br/>While Barrymore deserves due credit for her directing work the movie is largely Page's to carry and she is certainly up to the task. Sweet young beauty pageant contestant Bliss Cavendar, who shows up to roller derby tryouts in Barbie skates, is transformed into Babe Ruthless, star of the Hurl Scouts. What a thrilling journey for Bliss and Page captures the character's evolution perfectly. For as good as Page is you do wish we got to spend a little bit more time with some of the other roller girls. Eve and Zoe Bell are given practically nothing to do with their roles. Barrymore understandably was focused on her work behind the camera but that means her on-screen character, Smashley Simpson, gets a bit of the short shrift. Smashley seems to have great personality, and great potential as a character, but we only get fleeting glimpses. The only one of the Hurl Scouts aside from Babe Ruthless to get any significant attention is Maggie Mayhem, played by Kristen Wiig. She acts as somewhat of a surrogate mother to Bliss whose real mother, though well-intentioned, leaves much to be desired in the way she raises her daughter. Marcia Gay Harden plays Bliss's mom and she has some very good moments along with Daniel Stern as the dad. There has to be a roller derby villain and Juliette Lewis does very well with that role. Alia Shawkat as Bliss's best friend and Jimmy Fallon as the wildly enthusiastic derby announcer are also very good. And perhaps the best supporting performance comes from Andrew Wilson as the exceedingly eccentric coach of the Hurl Scouts. Who even knew roller derby had coaches?<br/><br/>From Page on down everyone in the cast plays their parts very well. You have to credit Barrymore for that. Then again, she should know acting right? But she also shows a keen visual sense, especially when she gets us right up in the middle of the thrilling derby action. At times the movie seems very predictable. You've seen plenty of coming-of-age movies like this one. You've seen plenty of sports underdog movies like this one. But while the movie does play out in an at times very familiar fashion there are a few curveballs, some pleasant surprises, thrown in. You may think you have the movie completely figured out but maybe you don't. All in all, it's a very promising directorial debut, a movie which leaves you with a smile on your face and looking forward to what Barrymore might do next."
"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","8","0","4","20 April 2011"," The plot is clichéd, but everything else is fresh
","WHIP IT is Drew Barrymore's film debut, and stars Ellen Page in a film about roller derby, a sport that I was beforehand unfamiliar with. To the point- the plot of Whip It is one of clichés, and it comes across as formulaic. But unlike She's The Man it doesn't make feminist points yet give us stock characters, Whip It remains fresh by giving us characters that seem interesting, develop and make the film more entertaining. It's a hard film to dislike, and that's probably because it is so charming, even in its most clichéd moments. It never feels dumb, it never feels like it is trying to please, it never feels tired, it never feels boring- in short, Whip It is a great film that should and deserves to redefine movies aimed at teenage girls. This film is a bit of relief for those who are sick of teenage movies that are vapid in both its aims and execution. And the way it uses 'Girl Power' isn't something you'd find in a Prue-teen magazine, more of a realistic way. An enjoyable film that I recommend to anyone who wants something a bit different from their teen movies."
"ajs-10","8","0","3","16 April 2011"," A little rough around the edges, but still, pretty good...
","I have been wanting to see this one for a while; I was interested to see just how Drew Barrymore's directorial debut would turn out. Not too bad is the answer, a little rough around the edges, but not a bad first effort all in all. It's entertaining, very funny, in places, and I found it a laudable effort. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please lace up those skates while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Bliss Cavendar is a teenage girl living in Bodeen, a small town in Texas. Her mother, Brooke, encourages her to take part in beauty pageants, but you can tell her heart isn't really in it. She works at a diner with her friend Pash and one night they decide to go out to a Roller Derby in Austin. They discover the team are having try-outs and so Bliss decides to give it a go. She's under age and so tells them that she's 21. At first, she's not very good, but with practice she gets better. Of course she has to lie to her parents about where she's going and what she's doing. All the players have pseudonyms and Bliss chooses 'Babe Ruthless' as her moniker. She eventually gets good enough to take part in a match and, after a baptism of fire, she soon finds her feet. Their coach, Razor, discovers that Bliss is a very good player; she's small, agile and can score them lots of points If only he could get them to use his play-book! Eventually it comes down to the play-off game and Bliss must face her nemesis, Iron Maven. Add to this the turmoil at home and a love interest, a boy from a band, Oliver, (of course there's got to be a love story) and that's a potted version of the film. No more, or the Spoiler Police will be after me.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this one, yes, it's a bit rough around the edges, but you can see they had a lot of fun making it. The performances are all very good, especially Ellen Page as Bliss and Marcia Gay Harden as her mother Brooke Cavendar, both were very good. Both Kristen Wiig as Maggie Mayhem and Drew Barrymore as Smashley Simpson did a good job as Bliss's teammates. Also Juliette Lewis put in a good shift as Iron Maven. Honourable mentions go to Alia Shawkat as Pash, Jimmy Fallon as 'Hot Tub' Johnny Rocket, Andrew Wilson as Razor and Landon Pigg (great name!) as Oliver.<br/><br/>Credit goes to all the stunt people, this must have been a tough one to pull off, but they did a very good job. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, some good tracks are used, mostly indie stuff, but if you include 'Sheena is a Punk Rocker' by The Ramones then you're always going to get my vote! It's not prefect, as I've already mentioned, but I did find it pretty entertaining, and so Recommended.<br/><br/>My Score: 7.9/10"
"Gordon-11","Null","0","4","26 March 2011"," Action, emotions and dreams all in one
","This film is about a small town teenage girl who pursues her dream in professional roller skating without her parents' knowledge or consent.<br/><br/>""Whip It"" is a familiar story about a girl who struggles against the tide to achieve her dreams. The story telling and pacing is not bad at all. I like the emotional subplot of Ruthless' parents expectations and dreams towards her, and how the parents change their attitude in the end. I would like more character development of the teammates though, it seems they are in the film only to make up the number needed for a team.<br/><br/>As Drew Barrymore's directorial debut, it shows that she is capable of more than looking pretty in a romantic comedy. Let's hope her next project can maintain this standard."
"alexandrajade","7","0","3","5 January 2011"," All hail Ellen Page
","In many respects, ""Whip It"" is not that great a movie. It's horribly predictable, both in plot and pacing. The supporting characters (Bliss' parents, best friend, rival pageant queen, some of the other roller girls, the love interest) are drawn staunchly from stock. There's some pretty bad acting, too (Juliette Lewis is downright cringeworthy, and Drew Barrymore's funny but more than a little over the top).<br/><br/>Really, it all comes down to whether we, the audience, care about Ellen Page's character Bliss. And the tiny Canadian shines. It's meaningless and banal to directly compare one performance to another, but I'll say that this performance of Page's is as impressive and engaging as any in her career, and certainly made me an (even bigger) fan of hers. She succeeded in creating a character around whom the story really works well.<br/><br/>There's other good points, to be sure. I enjoyed Kirsten Wiig as Maggie Mayhem. Andrew Wilson as the 'zen master' of roller derby and play-by-play man Jimmy Fallon were both an absolute stitch. But without Ellen Page, this movie probably falls flat on its face. And with her, it's a good, solid 7/10."
"lee_eisenberg","7","0","3","25 December 2010"," let the good times roller derby
","Drew Barrymore's directorial debut looks at a Texas girl's aspirations of joining a roller derby team. The unfulfilled Bliss is a role that Ellen Page was born to play, and the same goes for Marcia Gay Harden as Bliss's overbearing mother. But the best parts of the are the skating scenes. The team members have satirical names (Bloody Holly, Rosa Sparks) and spend the roller derby brutally shoving each other off the track. But more than anything, one gets a sense of how miserable it must be to live in the backwards town like the one where Bliss lives, especially with her mother pushing her to be a beauty queen. I should say that ""Whip It"" isn't a masterpiece, but it still does a perfect job showing Bliss's strength and resolve to achieve her dream, along with the occasional bumps along the way. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Also starring Daniel Stern, Alia Shawkat, Jimmy Fallon, Kristen Wiig, Zoe Bell, Eve and Juliette Lewis."
"MovieSonic","9","0","4","17 December 2010"," So much better than the plot description
","I had no intention of watching this at first because it looked like a typical 'girl from nowhere becomes big star' type of film.<br/><br/>And roller blading?

The actual plot itself is clichéd at times but when it is, it's still executed extremely well.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed (interestingly) is that this is possibly the first time I have watched a chick flick where none of the jokes fall flat...really.<br/><br/>In fact, I even laughed out loud - really hard - quite a few times.<br/><br/>I ultimately decided to watch it because I am a huge fan of Juliette Lewis and have never seen her in anything bad, I typically enjoy all of Drew Barrymore's films (even the ones that aren't exactly classics) and Ellen Page is someone who's star is rising so I couldn't imagine she would sign on for a bad script at this point in her career.<br/><br/>There are only a couple of moments where the script becomes a little obvious but clearly with this genre of film, a couple of hokey lines here and there are acceptable.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film mainly because it is hugely and consistently entertaining throughout, it genuinely had my adrenaline going during the inevitable 'big game' and the lead doesn't get everything she wants which is very refreshing (and rare in films such as these).<br/><br/>Whilst Whip It clearly is a chick flick; it has more than enough substance for a much broader audience to enjoy - don't let the naff plot description put you off!<br/><br/>9/10"

","Right. It's light, it's a simple operatic plot, it's got relationships, it's got girly playfulness, it's got boy-girl issues, it's free-wheeling; no great complexity, no ethical conundrums, no earth-shattering moral crises.<br/><br/>But what it has, it has in a deeply human way, thanks to the loving (yet artful) care obviously lavished on the acting, direction, and over-all production values. It's probably another case of a movie ably carried to a satisfactory culmination by dint of sheer artistic moxie.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, and be ready to laugh from the very pit of yr gut, and have a hankie close at hand."
"zulus88","8","0","3","3 July 2010"," Teenage girls can kick-ass too.
","Every entry in an already tired indie formula, brings us closer to actually returning to the age of teenage-hood. Reverting mentally to the point where we were desperately seeking of our own, repressed inner-selves. Whip It does something differently though. It sparks a frightening nostalgia for that flaming youth that actually, might be still buried deep within and provokes a thought: why I don't remember my teenage years as being so much fun?<br/><br/>It might be a rite of passage, coming of age story in its purest form and Bliss (Ellen Page) is, inevitably, a troubled and too often embarrassed, teen stuck in Boden, Texas. She struggles between satisfying her demanding mother (Gay Harden) and managing a straight face in a pink apron of a diner where she works. It all changes when, god given, she attends a women's roller derby and joins the worst team in the league. Beauty peagents, she is forced to attend are replaced with bruises, sweat and, well...tight, green uniforms. But only until Bliss' parents learn of her daughter's new hobby.<br/><br/>Ellen Page, as you would expect, channels a lot of her Juno stamina here. And it's definitely a kind of a cocky and bright performance you would expect. But with Bliss, Page manages some new depths. This time around script allows her not to outwit everybody: 'Are you alternative now?' asks her bitchy, school nemesis. 'Alternative to what?'. This wonderful disillusionment and total confusion about one's place in life makes Whip It so special and so darn cute. Bliss is forced into her cynicism by her ambiguous habitat but she manages a believable vitality. Page's charisma grinds on both her skill and script's natural humour. Whip It's greatest strength lies perhaps in the way all of the characters come together. Juliette Lewis, Zoe Bell (of a Death Proof fame), Eve and Drew Barrymore herself in supporting roles, make this film feel like a genuine fun. Girl-power chemistry they spark, create a ground for unbelievably enjoyable story where nothing can really go wrong. Barrymore's début might often be formulaic but it never loses its charm. She firmly holds all the strings together and its difficult not to cheer those lousy skaters on. Once the competition reaches its climax it is your purest, edge of the seat, nail-biting drama.<br/><br/>It's ultimately a shame that Whip It never aspires to anything bigger and bolder. It's so good in its own game and Barrymore such a promising new-coming director, that you'll regret that she never tries anything more adventurous. Ultimately, the only other complaint is purely technical and if you're already planning to skip on the sports-induced excitement in favour of the spiritual journey, even irrelevant. But camera work way too often seems to stay well behind Page and other skating girls in the derby sequences and you might find yourself lost.<br/><br/>True, a lot of Whip It will sound like a broken, old record and parts of it reek of clichés. Bliss' strongly polarized family often balances on the edge of a ridiculous emotional mess that's just a tad too stereotypical even for an indie taste. And a rock-band singer love affair could be skipped altogether, without any harm to the film's outcome. But Barrymore approaches Cross's script (adapted from her semi-autobiographical novel) with a tenderness and adolescent wit. In the end it sounds real and is warm-hearted but is also pulsing with a rock'n'roll energy.<br/><br/>Verdict: Whip It might be of small proportions but highly substantial and thoroughly entertaining. Even if it won't make you grab your old skates and go embarrass yourself, it will definitely provoke a smile of deeply grounded satisfaction. Barrymore's follow up to this début is now much anticipated. Whip It in a tagline? Juno on skates. With a kick-ass boost.<br/><br/>4/5"
"TxMike","Null","0","2","3 June 2010"," Coming-of-age story facilitated by Roller Derby.
","First off, this movie set in Bodeen, Texas was filmed entirely in Michigan. Second, as far as I can figure, there is no town in Texas called Bodeen.<br/><br/>On the surface this would seem to be a movie with Roller Derby as its theme. I always figured Roller Derby was entertainment in the same way that professional wrestling is entertainment, and the movie pretty much depicts it that way. While the women may look mean on skates, off the rink they are just a bunch or ordinary, friendly ladies.<br/><br/>Ellen Page as Bliss Cavendar finds herself drawn to the sport, when she makes an unrelated trip to Austin and sees a poster. She goes back, not telling her parents the truth, and inexplicably gets urged by one of the players to come back for try-outs.<br/><br/>Bliss has two big problems. First, she can barely skate. Second, her mother, Marcia Gay Harden as Brooke Cavendar, grew up in the beauty pageant circuit and expects Bliss to follow in her footsteps. Bliss has done that, so far at 17, but her heart really isn't in it. She wants to get out from under her mother's stifling influence. She ends up claiming she is 22 to get a try-out.<br/><br/>So Bliss learns to skate well and, even though she is very small, turns out to also be very fast, so small and fast is perfect to break through and circle the track to score points for her team. When her mother and father finally find out about her Roller Derby passion, the ""comng-of-age"" discussions begin.<br/><br/>The ladies on the team, mainly in their 30s, turn out to be good friends to Bliss and help her see a part of life that she had not been exposed to in her small town. They are played by such actresses as Kristen Wiig (Maggie Mayhem), Drew Barrymore (Smashley Simpson), Juliette Lewis (Iron Maven) and others with such monikers as ""Rosa Sparks"", ""Bloody Holly"", and ""Eva Destruction"". <br/><br/>It was good to see Andrew Wilson, older brother of Owen and Luke Wilson, as the coach, ""Razor"". <br/><br/>So, while there is a strong Roller Derby theme, it is just there as a vehicle. The movie is about Bliss, her friends, and her family coming to terms with what is really important in their lives, and what they really want to do. Good movie."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","3","21 May 2010"," Barrymore and script's nuances impress despite minimal humor and sports clichés
","Everything about ""Whip It"" screams sports movie clichés. Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) lives in small-town Texas and lies to her parents, namely her mother who has stuck her in beauty pageants her whole life, and sneaks off at night to Austin where she's becoming a roller derby phenom. She even meets a cute boy during her rule-breaking excursions and she may well betray her best friend in the process.<br/><br/>Yet despite the way Shauna Cross has pumped her story full of these overused story component, she does so with the intention of giving them the middle finger by the end of the film. Drew Barrymore also adds a sensitive touch in her directorial debut, along with some gravity to the story. That and it's about roller derby -- not football or basketball -- which helps tremendously.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few wisecracks and a quick shot of her chugging a gallon of milk, Page has created a character much different from her title roll in the hit ""Juno."" With her looks and style of comedy, it's easy to get thrown into a Michael Cera-type corner, but she plays Bliss with an appropriate sense of high school naiveté in addition to strong inner- willpower. She skates between cliché: the extremes of the girl who gets picked on who proves everyone wrong and the one-girl wrecking ball that leaves destruction in her path in terms of personal relationships.<br/><br/>At the same time, ""Whip It"" unravels like a sports movie through and through. It's warranted considering most people have no idea what roller derby is, but it doesn't change the dynamic of the those scenes showing action and then cutting to the scoreboard along with some kind of personality (Jimmy Fallon) giving commentary. Fallon, by the way, manages to keep all the laughs for himself. Other than the derby names the women have (Rosa Sparks, Bloody Holly, Smashley Simpson -- and Bliss is Babe Ruthless), that's the extent to which ""Whip It"" is laugh-out-loud funny. Otherwise it's just cute laughs because of the relatable nature of the story.<br/><br/>Structurally, ""Whip It"" imitates countless films before it, but the compensation comes from the story's ultimate resistance to that structure. Barrymore, though I can't say all of her angles are well thought-out in certain basic scenes, provides some nice touches. When Bliss and her best friend Pash (""Arrested Development's"" Alia Shawkat) are in a fight, instead of the expected shot of her running out to help her with some trash she's throwing away at work, Barrymore cuts to her dumping the trash and when it's in, we see Bliss on the other side. Same message, no cheesy running-to-help shot. It's minimal, but these things get noticed when similar films usually don't bother with them.<br/><br/>Cross and Barrymore serve the end without cheese too, but still promote the positive themes and messages than run beneath every true sports and finding-yourself movie. ""Whip It"" feels stale but tastes impressively more genuine than it is thanks to the talented ladies on all sides of the camera.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site, moviesmusereviews.com"
"MetalAngel","7","0","3","16 May 2010"," Thoroughly entertaining!
","Who thinks Drew Barrymore could direct a film? I used to ask that question to my cinephile friends and the room would fall under a sepulchral silence, complete with the chirping cricket in the background. I mean, some people are simply BORN to be type-casted into their roles...like Drew Barrymore usually is- you know, the cute, cuddly girl with the wide smile, inviting eyes and somewhat childish personality. She's always being the character who begs to be hugged. What it boils down to (and this is the answer I used to provide to my own question) is that Drew Barrymore can act acceptably well but could never direct so much as a Care Bear commercial, because she just wasn't born for it.<br/><br/>Well, yeah, I was wrong... After seeing her directorial debut ""Whip It"" I found myself choking on my own question. I mean, sure, it's not an incredibly good movie, but it is far more exceptional and intelligent than the mediocre crap Hollywood dishes out nowadays and contains a few scenes that I just KNOW I won't forget. Now, for your information, this film isn't about cute and cuddly creatures or a flower-hearted, martial-arts bounty hunter employed by a sultry man named Charlie. It's actually about womens' roller skating derby and the thrill that it is. I know, it's SO un-Drew-Barrymore-ish but that's where the wonder comes from...it's not expected and the surprise you get is a really good one.<br/><br/>So! The movie follows Bliss Cavendar, a seventeen year old girl from a small town few people have heard of in Texas. The role is played by the incomparable Ellen Page, whom I've learned to respect and admire after her miraculously flawless work in ""Juno"" and ""Hard Candy"". Here, she plays a milder version of her ""Juno"" character (the same rock-hard personality but will less sass and irony), a girl who's being smothered by her mother (played to comical perfection by Marcia Gay Harden). She's the weird kid who walks around in dark attire, wears unappealing glasses, has only one friend in the world and is THE rebel and free-thinker against a town of retreads who strive to keep an image of 1950's Southern perfection amidst their sexually active, brain-dead teens. Her mother forces her to go to these Blue Ribbon contests where she's to demonstrate what a prim, perfect belle she is. (The other contestants are all dressed in demure, charming gowns and praise the Lord and their deceased ancestors; Bliss appears with spiky, blue hair and praises Amelia Earhart among a disgustingly shocked audience. Yeah, it's THAT kind of town) One day, Bliss sees some derby girls handing out flyers at the mall in Austin, and finds herself awakened to her true calling: skating with the roller-skating derby girls. Now, the derby is a new sport for me, we don't have that where I come from. At least it WAS new for me before watching the film. Bliss escapes to Austin to watch the derby, falls in love with it, signs up for practice with the derby girls and ends up being one of them on account of her blinding speed and her capacity for taking hits without complaining (the roller coaster derby is a brutal sport, you know? It's all about skating fast, blocking people and kicking and slamming them until they've got huge bruises, a hemorrhage or a broken bone).<br/><br/>In plot, it's your typical sports film where the main character is a teenager who's unhappy with the society and family she lives in (though Bliss' family is actually an exemplary one; her mother is just too overprotective and demanding), engages herself in the sport, gains nationwide attention, falls in love with a cute guy, strives to find the recognition of her family, etc... It has the necessary plot twist where everything goes wrong in her life, but then (through a clichéd make-up with her team members, family, best friend, etc.) everything is right again and it all ends in a big match.<br/><br/>The good thing here is the way the movie is crafted. The dialogue is amazingly good and it sounds as real as it gets; while the plot is clichéd and flawed beyond repair, the dialogue is a breath of fresh air that softens the rank odor of the plot. The performances are very good, indeed, and there are those moments I mentioned above which you just can't get out of your head. There's Marcia Gay Harden, naively admiring the ""lovely vases"" in a store, when they're actually bongs. There's a musical interlude, where Page and her love interest dive into a pool and kiss underwater in a family-friendly sex scene. And there's the scene where Bliss is receiving some advice by the derby team leader Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig), which is poignant in its simplicity and powerful in its directness.<br/><br/>Talking about Maggie Mayhem, aren't those names the derby girls get simply hilarious? I mean, Bliss' team members are called Smashley Simpson, Rosa Sparks, Bloody Holly, Eva Destruction, etc. I read in Roger Ebert's review that it's quite usual for derby racers to choose witty pseudonyms such as this, and I can fully believe; the film IS based on Shauna Cross' novel, after all, and SHE was a derby racer back in the day. Also, most of these wittily-named characters are mostly played by real derby racers, and it makes up into a sports-accurate film.<br/><br/>Is there a flaw? There are many! For some reason, the dialogue and the performances are the only good things about the movie- its saving graces. Whenever there's no dialogue the film seems to lag and to lose its point. Also, like I said, you know what's gonna happen from minute one until the very end because of its recycled plot. But...how can I convey the fact that, even through all the flaws, the film is quite enjoyable? It's good, and it's one of the most entertaining sports film of the year."
"DICK STEEL","8","0","3","4 April 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Whip It
","Drew Barrymore can be considered quite the feminist when it comes to stepping behind the camera. She's got producer creds for her alpha-female Charlie's Angels, and now adds the directing feather in her cap as she helms Whip It, a sports film with a strong female flavour, based upon the novel by Shauna Cross about a group of gladiatorial styled athletes who don roller skates, outlandish outfits, makeup and scary name in an effort to showcase girl power.<br/><br/>Ellen Page continues in her stereotypical role as the misfit teenager Bliss Cavendar, whose mom Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden) forces it upon her to enter beauty pageant after beauty pageant, after all, what's a small town girl gonna do if not to emulate her mother in her success? But of course being stuck in the small town of Bodeen, Texas doesn't mean that one cannot have other dreams of success, and while wondering what her calling is, Bliss discovers the beauty of a sport known as the Roller Derby league, where contestants seem to be larger than life in a rink where they outwit and outpace each other's teams to score points.<br/><br/>Like any growing teenage story, one would expect the narrative to be filled with the usual plots of the pangs of first love, and doing something major behind the backs of one's parents. However, Ellen Page delivers once again as the street-smart teenager who knows the right buttons to push to get things down. Having done most of her own skating stunts also adds a sense of realism to her character's involvement in the sport as she learns the ropes from her colleagues and foes who don't give a chance, and what more when they boast names like Smashley Simpson, Rosa Sparks, Iron Maven, Bloody Holly and Eve of Destruction?<br/><br/>Comedy is steeped in the film, though I prefer its presentation of its major theme here. It is always easy to judge others based on what we see on the outside, and it is often the eye that presets our feelings and verdict on a particular person. We are always quick to judge on what we see, rather than to make an effort to understand what goes on beneath. For all the gung- ho-ness of her sporting peers, the journey Bliss takes allows us to go behind the scenes, and realize that sport is sport, and beneath the steely demeanour still lies ordinary folks who are still challenged by what is being posed through everyday life, that as a team and a sport, they provide an avenue of get together, camaraderie, and stress relief. It is precisely this subtleness away from the obvious sport glamour and big talk that I appreciate in the film a lot more.<br/><br/>Though this is Barrymore's first feature film attempt at directing, you feel that this was instead directed by an old hand, and I guess given her many years in the industry, her experience counts in knowing what works. Having a minor role in the film herself – which I think she'll find it difficult not to have anything to do in front of the camera given its fine casting and physicality of the sport – she does go to show that she's becoming quite the all rounder in the industry, having her hand in many pies already, and like the character of Bliss, is probably just about to find her own calling and talent. I hope this is not a one-off film project, so let's see if Barrymore has what it takes to go behind the camera like what Clint Eastwood had managed to do, successfully."

"MatthewLong23","9","0","3","15 February 2010"," Great film very entertaining
","Whip It is just a plain fun movie to watch. It tells the story of Bliss who's mother wants her to be in beauty pageants just like she was when she was younger. The mother does not have much going for her and she lives her dreams through her daughter. Bliss does not enjoy the beauty pageants and soon discovers a roller derby woman's league and falls in love with the idea of it. The team she ends up on sucks and she ends up being their best player and brings hope to the team. ONly problem is she is too young which predictably becomes a problem just as the championships happen. The film tries to bring the message that you can be who you want to be and you should do things that make you happy. The message gets through with very comedic results."

","I really did enjoy this film. The entire premise and plot is hokey as hell but there is some chemistry or je ne sais quoi that makes it work.<br/><br/>From the silly ass team names to the sophomoric player names, the busted-ass restaurant and that pathetic restaurant manager there should be non-stop reasons to hate this film. I don't. Sometimes art just lives of it's own accord.<br/><br/>Kudos to Barrymore, obviously the most talented and intelligent of the entire Barrymore clan.<br/><br/>I don't like Page but I have to admit that she did grow on me through the escapade. Would I be a hack if I thought the best line not delivered in the film was when Harden asked Page if she was really doing the pageant for herself and Page could have said, ""I wish it was for me."" Too much? I dunno.<br/><br/>Give it a watch."
"socrates99","8","0","3","30 January 2010"," Surprisingly entertaining -- even for a guy
","Brought the chick flick DVD home for my ailing wife and was happily surprised it was good enough to sit through and enjoy. I thought I'd prefer to miss an Ellen Page movie, she's a been a bit unnerving in the past, but in this case she was quite central to the movie's success. The whole movie's mostly a presentation of Ellen's performance, which would be no problem at all except that I would have enjoyed seeing more of Drew Barrymore and Juliette Lewis; their nicely turned performances seem oddly curtailed. But Ellen has a very low key presence and I'm not sure she could have managed to retain the film's focus without everyone else toning down theirs. We thankfully do get a bigger slice of Kristen Wiig's performance and also both Jimmy Fallon and Andrew Wilson add substantial substance to the film and are memorable. All in all hardly a waste of time and I can't help thinking the IMDb rating is unreasonably harsh. This movie has a lot of heart and I'm guessing Drew has a future as a director far beyond what the rating here indicates."

","So after i saw how this movie performed at the box office, i really didn't thought that it would be this good. well it proves me wrong. because this is probably my favorite movie of '09 and definitely one of my favorites. So the plot may not be such an interesting one but this movie is so fun, touching and honest that it would make you want to see it over and over again. Ms Ellen Page keeps showing her stellar talent on the role of the misunderstood Bliss, a girl so bore and asphyxiated by her life that couldn't find a shelter..... until she finds the roller derby. I seriously think that this is even a better role than Juno it's just so real and heartbreaking. kudos for her. Also for Drew Barrymore because she decides not to direct a Hollywood-esquire movie and choose this one. Every one from the cast did a great job. So after seeing this movie i asked myself: Who bad can be the future of the industry? i said it because if movies with heart like this underperformed at the box office and Couples Retreat did zillions of dollars at the B.O ( Probably one of the worst films ever made....... bad as Catwoman ). This is definitely a must see."
"Siamois","6","0","3","4 January 2010"," Whipping familiar ingredients together
","With her debut, Drew Barrymore plays safe as far as the story is concerned, but a lot of heart goes into the movie and she proves more than capable as a first-time director.<br/><br/>Whip It goes through the list of clichés of coming-of-age and sports movies. The disapproving parent who's got other plans, the older veteran threatened by the new rookie, the witty girl that wants to get out of town and her somewhat witty best friend. The list goes on and some characters and scenes are homages to past movies (The Manson sisters are basically the Hanson brothers from Slap Shot) or some would say, rip offs.<br/><br/>With the adequate pacing, solid acting and derivative story, this film would normally be worth a 4 or a 5 but what puts it above the average movie is all the conviction put into this. For starters, Barrymore does not go for quick editing tricks in order to cheat on the sports sequences. Instead of going for .5 seconds shots, the camera often sticks to these girls for a few seconds, making the film less flashy but much more organic. The film crew and especially the fantastic cast deserves all the praise they will get here. I cringed thinking of the beating these actresses were willing to take.<br/><br/>These long shots also pay off when it comes to other scenes, such as the underwater sequence which is very lovely and comes off as authentic yet was no doubt the result of some serious work. There is also nice photography and a nice use of music. All these little things added together with interesting casting choices and some cachet make you think Drew Barrymore could have an even more interesting career behind the camera as she's having in front of it. <br/><br/>You'll recognize also a lot of ""Barrymorisms"". Slightly odd characters, hints of girl power, a love for 80s teenage culture (We're talking about a girl who wore a Judas Priest t-shirt in the blockbuster Charlie's Angels and produced Donnie Darko in all its 80s glory).<br/><br/>I wish the characters had more meat and the story didn't take the easy way so often. I also think the film is light-hearted yet lacks humor. More laughs would have definitely helped this become a classic. <br/><br/>But as it is, it already beats most of the formulaic sports film out there, even if it doesn't bring new ideas to the genre. A final minor point is, I was under he impression Barrymore was constantly flirting between making an all-ages movie or a PG-13. Some scenes come off a little Disney-ish, while others are slightly more adult. Going firmly one direction or the other could have helped. <br/><br/>But a well-deserved 6, close to a 7 for me."
"Ric-7","7","0","3","21 October 2009"," Fun to make, mostly pleasant to watch
","It seemed that the cast was having a great time making this film, and I enjoyed it. The film recycled quite a number of themes from earlier films (otherwise known as clichés). A child entering a profession which a parent will find hateful? You can find a source as far back as silent film. Plus escape from a small town, disappointment in first love, losing local sports team turning things around.<br/><br/>Maybe the novel made all of this fresh and vibrant. I don't care. I enjoyed watching this film, despite the lack of fresh insights or new situations.<br/><br/>Ellen Page continues to delight. This performance is not much of a contrast from Juno, but I think: why shouldn't she do as many troubled/wacky juvenile roles while she still can? She can play Lady Macbeth later.<br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harden seemed to be a bit over the top. She is an excellent actress, and I am afraid that the director's inexperience allowed her to settle for stereotype rather than the creation of an actual individual. She was good, but could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Pash and Birdman were very pleasant and amiable, but never really became interesting. Oliver, the first love, was a total blank. No advance indication of his true feelings, and no later confirmation. So that swimming pool scene was not love, just foreplay? My opinion of Oliver is based upon what I have been told to believe, not on what I have seen.<br/><br/>Coach Razor (Andrew Wilson) was fascinating. Here is a real person rather than a stereotype. What was his sexuality? Straight? Gay? Undecided? It doesn't matter at all to the plot, and my fascination is probably due to the lack of stereotype being used here.<br/><br/>""Iron Maven,"" the antagonist. I did not review the cast list prior to watching the film. During the course of the film, there was a reference to ""she-males"" being the Derby stars. At a point in the film, I actually believed that ""Iron Maven"" was a transsexual with perhaps a dubbed-in voice. Yikes! It's Juliette Lewis! Doing a fine job.<br/><br/>And that's the irony of this film: the director, Drew Barrymore, started as a child actor and became a director with this film. Juliette Lewis (who has a monologue about age and accomplishments) also began when she was a child and her major accomplishments were a number of years ago. And the star is Ellen Page, whose current fame is her ability portray adolescence. Time, time, time, see what's become of me.<br/><br/>This film will exit the theaters very soon. I think it will be a worthwhile rental, or PPV choice. It has its shortcomings, relying too frequently on stereotypes; but I liked it a lot, and maybe you will, too."
