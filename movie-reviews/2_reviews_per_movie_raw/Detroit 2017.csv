","The facts, not alternative facts but the facts. Once you have that then the artist comes and tells us, dramatizes, enlightens without distorting the facts. I was sweating when Detroit ended but I needed to go back and check the historical records of the events. The movie is a faithful depiction of the facts with the artistic eye of the amazing Kathryn Bigelow to illustrate them. The film will make you mad, it will desolate you and anger you and force you as an American to ask yourself, how can this possibly be?
Detroit as an artistic venture is a marvel with a cast of fantastic actors. Bravo!"

","I was hoping for more. The movie was long, but I felt like the emphasis was on the wrong things. Motive was glossed over. Torture scenes were drawn out. Why were the cops so evil and the detectives ""enlightened""? Having lived through those times and knowing public servants from that era, I think they way things were portrayed was not true to form. The acting was strong and the content was emotional, but here in Detroit this case is still hotly debated and I am not sure the filmmaker captured how it is seen here."

","The poster of Annapurna's newest film, Detroit hangs at my local theater like a provocation. A thin blue line of police officers struggles to hold back angry black protesters as big bold letters are scrawled along the side. The tagline reads: ""It's time we knew."" Those words, along with the required ""from the creators of..."" accolades are the only things on the poster that aren't sideways.<br/><br/>They might as well be though, considering the 1967 Detroit riot is about the only thing about Detroit most Americans know. And I'm sad to report that while the film does a good job of filling the screen with a few powerful moments, it never provides much insight into the ""untold"" story of the Motor City or how its story fits into the larger context of modern racial relations.<br/><br/>After an awkward Jacob Lawrence inspired history of the Great Migration, the film captures the precipitating actions of police that turned the city's long sitting racial resentments into a lit tinderbox. In a hybrid of dramatization and archival footage, Detroit then glosses over the actions taken by the state to subdue tensions before setting its sights on a host of singular stories. It becomes high noon at the Algiers Motel where unarmed black teens face off against white police and National Guardsmen. Then comes the trial.<br/><br/>All of these events could have been their own movies and delved into deeper depths as to the cause, devastation, aftermath and public perception of what was later dubbed the black days of July. Yet because Mark Boal's screenplay is so laser-focused on documented events and momentary minutia, everything is squished into an off-kilter collage of well-meaning but superficial docudrama. One whose central story, the Algiers Motel incident, is treated more like a genre horror film than either a granular traumatic event or police brutality in microcosm.<br/><br/>Detroit basically pulls a Dunkirk (2017), building unbelievable tension while giving us the bear minimum in character. It's all about the situation and the situation only. The recreation of which is beyond reproach. However, Detroit's grand design creates a narrative dissonance. One in which the individual experiences of real people just don't translate all that well.<br/><br/>The problem is compounded further by Barry Ackroyd's unvarnished cinematography which cuts between extreme closeups of wounded faces, voyeuristic overheads and wide shots of crowds angrily gathering in the streets. The lack of establishing shots, aerials, use of recognizable landmarks etc. hammers home the idea that something like this can happen anywhere. But the question, why can it happen anywhere, remains illusive up until we here the words ""police criminality should be treated the same as criminality."" By then it's too little too late.<br/><br/>Luckily director Kathryn Bigelow is very adept at inserting humanity within the margins saving Detroit from being just another Patriot's Day (2016). She finds a particularly redemptive subject in Algee Smith as up-and-coming Motown singer Larry Reed. The young actor displays an emotional intelligence well beyond his years, formulating a character that starts out with youthful swagger, ends with a shaken core, putting you in his head-space at all points in-between. Additionally, while most of the films attempts to color opposing forces with shades of grey fall flat, Reed's arc feels tragic but sadly understandable given the circumstance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for both Bigelow and the city of Detroit, Detroit's script casts too wide a net to be especially impacting. It's procedural approach stifles the emotional stakes and its over-arching theme is turned in with much less humanity and passion than is deserved. Even with a towering performance by Algee, and the inclusion of Will Poulter who plays menacing/in-over-his-head real well, Detroit just can't transcends its trappings. To add insult to injury, the film itself was shot primarily in Boston...so there's that..."
"rleach2000","10","105","171","6 August 2017"," Great Filmmaking with a Point Of View
","Unless you believe the Black Lives Matters movement has unanimous appeal, do not expect the reviews of Kathryn Bigelow's ""Detroit"" to garner universal praise. By no means does this movie play it safe and, for that reason, it does not seek or expect mass appeal. I suspect that the film will unleash fierce critics of ""Hollywood Liberal Bias"" and generate howls from those who want to remind us that most cops really are good as well as others who are equally vocal and can't stomach seeing more non-threatening citizens brutally murdered by policemen of a different stripe.<br/><br/>""Detroit"" is a movie that is set in 1967 but it is a statement about the type of policing that continues to occur far too frequently in many African American communities. Just as it is not possible to talk about the recent events in Ferguson, NYC, Minneapolis,Baltimore, Chicago, Charleston, Cleveland etc., etc. without expressing a particular point of view, ""Detroit"" will also reveal many pf our biases as we process the portrayal of the searing events as they may have occurred at the Algiers Motel in the midst of a race riot.<br/><br/>""Detroit"" will also force us to talk about our preferences for films that move and disturb us over those that simply entertain and the amount of ""historical accuracy"" we expect to see in non- documentaries that are set in earlier times. <br/><br/>Bigelow shoots the movie with an unflinching eye and her point of view is obvious. She errs on the side of the cringe worthy and outrageous when depicting evil and the actors are committed, inspired and superbly directed. <br/><br/>""Detroit"" is a film that is as difficult to watch as any two hour merciless tragedy involving people we know and care about and it is deeply stirring as it incites (if not assaults) our emotions. This is a stunning film but well crafted art, like our own reflections in the finest of mirrors, isn't always pretty. <br/><br/>""Detroit"" intends to upset, provoke and unsettle and, by that account, it is an unmitigated success."
"PotassiumMan","6","32","49","12 August 2017"," This film beats you over the head until you cry ""uncle""
","This dramatization of a major incident of police brutality that took place during the 1967 Detroit riots starts off strong. It has great period detail in recapturing the Motor City in its roiling state of anxiety and resentment- an image of a great city on the verge of combustible catastrophe. A growing sense of anger and lawlessness is well-captured here. Furthermore, the film boasts vivid performances by an exceptional ensemble cast. Will Poulter is a standout as a violent, psychopathic police officer who cannot subtract his personal prejudices from the line of duty. John Boyega is also effective as a private security guard who makes a good faith effort to keep the peace but soon finds himself questioning his own judgment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, where the film goes wrong is its decision to have a key police interrogation and torture sequence go on so interminably and so relentlessly that ironically the film loses its power and emotional grip in the process. The evil that is portrayed here goes from convincing to almost cartoonish. A viewer might be forgiven for no longer having their head in the film once the narrative finally moves on. Although no one can accuse this film of having the wrong intentions, it becomes so overheated in its depiction and so didactic in its approach that it becomes a textbook example of cinema where less could have been more. Perhaps less hand-wringing and more tonal balance would have made this a more potent film. But subtlety is not the word here.<br/><br/>This is not to say that all was lost. The film goes on to have quite a heartfelt, anguished conclusion and offers a cautionary word that the law and not reason is sometimes the biggest weapon. However, a better work would have left some room for debate instead of trying to pound its audience into submission. Not recommended."
"Jared_Andrews","7","48","79","10 August 2017"," Nails the What But Leaves Out the Why
","Director Katheryn Bigelow does a wonderful job of creating a great deal of tension. She does so by cutting from one tightly framed slightly wobbly shot to the next. Each character's face floods nearly the entire screen after each of these cuts. This makes the movie deeply personal and almost claustrophobic at times. The slight wobbles of the camera as it focuses on a face, adds to the uneasiness and unstable nature of the situation.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is the movie is expertly directed. That's evident early on and remains that way throughout. The issue holding this movie back from becoming one of serious best picture caliber is the writing. The story felt a bit underdeveloped.<br/><br/>The brief on-screen text explanation of the tension between the Detroit Police and the city's black residents could have served as a helpful addition to a setup that followed in the movie. I would have had no problem with that. But after the movie plays for 20 minutes or so, I realized that the text was the sole source of setup.<br/><br/>That's a classic case of telling instead of showing. Movies are a video medium. Use that. Don't casually display the text on screen. This choice may have been made for the sake of time, but I think the filmmakers would have been wise to focus more on the setup aspect. The text explanation felt like an inconsiderate means of storytelling.<br/><br/>After the opening text, the movie meanders for a while, eventually introducing the key characters and providing an appetizer of their personalities, foreshadowing their upcoming behavior.<br/><br/>Moments like these showcased strengths in the writing. The writing did not completely ruin the movie; it simply was not an Oscar-contending performance, like Bigelow's work.<br/><br/>The movie overall is well made, thanks in large part to Bigelow's deft direction, but it's not without flaws. One that I already mentioned is that I wanted the actual movie (not solely text) to better set the stage of this city that's on the verge of riot.<br/><br/>The second criticism ties into the first. Because of the lack of stage setting, this becomes a movie that expertly depicts the what, but fails to fully deliver on the why.<br/><br/>I see the riots. I see the emotional toll that police misconduct had on the abused citizens. I see the guilt that certain uniformed personnel felt for standing by and allowing the abuse to take place. What I didn't see enough of is why all this happened. I wanted a more personal detailing of what led up to the night shown in the movie. The actions are clear and powerful, but the motivations are vague and weak.<br/><br/>I came away from the movie wondering what message the filmmakers hoped to convey. While the title is Detroit, the story has a much narrower focus. Were the clear majority of Detroit City Police Officers upstanding in their behavior, with only a few tragic bad apples? Given the choice focus on only a few officers and a select group of citizens, should I assume that these officers' misconduct was the norm or the exception? <br/><br/>Perhaps it was not the filmmakers' intent to answer these questions. Maybe they only wanted to tell this specific story, without greater implications, which is fine. I just personally wanted to see a broader depiction of the city's atmosphere leading up to, during, and following the riots."
"CANpatbuck3664","9","44","73","7 August 2017"," Detroit Packs a Powerful Punch and Leaves You With an Ugly Lasting Impression
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* After the animated introduction (which I won't spoil the content of) Detroit begins in the city of Detroit, 1967. A party is being held at a backroom bar for the return of a Vietnam veteran. The cops break up the party but a crowd gathers of mostly African-Americans. The cops are almost exclusively white but all the patrons being rounded up are African-Americans. Instead of trying to explain their actions, the cops are quick to move on from the scene. Someone throws a bottle at one of the cops and the looting begins. Unfortunately, the 12th street riots are underway.<br/><br/>Even having watched some really gritty movies lately (Shot Caller and Dunkirk) I still had to admire how Detroit drops you right in the middle of this tumultuous period of Detroit's history. The action is in your face and they don't shy away from the brutality. Although Detroit feels firmly grounded in reality, the movie does have a sense of style. The beginning has an animated segment that isn't pretty and they use it to drive home the hopelessness of the situation. It certainly does the intended job. While the action does hit home, the shaky cam did push the envelope and there were a couple of times I wish they had stayed a little more static. There were some quick moments where the camera could cause a little motion sickness.<br/><br/>Addressing the elephant in the room, Detroit was given the green light because a lot of these issues are still stuff many people grapple with on a daily basis. Its not something that people like to discuss but that doesn't mean that it doesn't take place. One of the things that surprised me about Detroit is that they don't force a ton of comparisons to the present day upon the audience (Free State of Jones was an example of something like that). The horror of the material speaks for itself and they didn't need to jam metaphors about how times haven't changed down our throat. These problems do exist and hopefully this movie will help some people come around on those issues but the story is completely self contained and I actually appreciated it for doing that way. They trust the viewer to draw their own connections and it isn't common to take such a mature approach.<br/><br/>Detroit dips its toes into a couple of different genres but where it works best is when its in the thick of this terrible situation. It is an engrossing and tense thriller. This movie is so hard to watch, a couple of people left the theatre and I honestly couldn't blame them. Things get downright brutal and where some stories play with some of the characters having ambiguous motives, this is not one of those. The villains are disgusting and their behaviour is downright heinous so there isn't a question of who your rooting for. Every turn the story makes, things get nastier but you can't turn away.<br/><br/>Detroit's cast is well rounded and there is definitely some excellent acting from everyone involved but 1 person kind of steals the show. Will Poulter is the villain of the piece as Krauss and he puts on a show that rivals Michael Fassbender in 12 Years a Slave. This feels like a coming out performance for him, his character is so detestable but I have to tip my hat to him. John Boyega gets top billing as Dismukes and he handles the material well but this was more of an ensemble. I was also surprised that Anthony Mackie made an appearance, he's one of the more accomplished actors in the cast but he's in a supporting part. He acquits himself well though. Algee Smith and Jacob Lattimore are both excellent as Larry and Fred. Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever are also really good as Julie and Karen respectively.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint about Detroit (other than the fact that the subject matter is super depressing) is that by the time you get to the end of the movie, it does begin to drag. This is a long movie and I get why they had to include so much but I was hoping for a quicker resolution when we got past the 2hr mark.<br/><br/>Detroit was always going to be a controversial movie but the movie steers into the skid. I more or less fall on the critics' side, this movie has a tight story that is more topical than we would like to admit. I can't verify if it's 100% historically accurate, there's been some debate in the other user reviews and I'm willing to concede that they probably took some liberties with it. But judging it as a movie, I was shocked yet I couldn't turn away from Detroit. I would applaud Kathryn Bigelow for handling this touchy issue so well and despite the length I would recommend giving this a chance."

","(Mild Spoilers)<br/><br/>The Historical Context Surrounding the 12th Street Riots is set Aside for the Brutality of the Moment in ""Detroit.""<br/><br/>""Detroit"" could have been a powerful allegory for police violence against African Americans using 1967 Detroit as a real life example of how police abuse minorities to protect white privilege. Instead, ""Detroit"" is an over-indulgent orgy of violence that barely addresses the historical context in which the riots arose. <br/><br/>The precipitating event for the Detroit riots of 1967 was the violent police raid on an unlicensed bar. The film reenacts this raid and shows the police overreacting and abusing the black revelers. The violence escalates and riots ensue. This is true to accounts of the time, however, the focus on that one event gives short shrift to the years of abuse blacks faced at the hands of a 97% majority white police department in a city that was 40% black in 1967. <br/><br/>By not giving enough historical context to police abuses and degradation of the black populations, the film works in a vacuum where a few police go rogue and the blacks should have just cooperated more. In fact, it was a whole system dominated by whites that allowed this abuse to occur by participating in, encouraging or ignoring the abuse.<br/><br/>The deeper, long-term causes of the riots barely appear in the film. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, ""The deeper causes of the riot were high levels of frustration, resentment, and anger that had been created among African Americans by unemployment and underemployment, persistent and extreme poverty, racism and racial segregation, police brutality, and lack of economic and educational opportunities.""<br/><br/>There was a brief mention of the white flight and the loss of industry in Detroit at the beginning of the film, but nothing about unemployment, a history of racism by the police, or racial segregation. <br/><br/>The plot doesn't stand scrutiny. There was a storyline about a gun, and the police who assumed that they were fired upon. The police used suspicion of violence coming from the Algiers based on flimsy information as an excuse to enter the hotel in Detroit and abuse its occupants. When those detainees were questioned by the racist police officers, none of them came forward with information about the gun that would have exonerated them. Their silence was illogical in the extreme, and the script makes no attempt to explain why they didn't mention the gun. <br/><br/>The nine black men (two who were later killed) and two white women who were detained could have also laid the blame on a man that had been earlier shot and was dead. Why they didn't do that is another mystery. Is this true to history? I found no information supporting this account of events. <br/><br/>What the film does discuss at the beginning is the Great Migration to the north of African American to Detroit after WWI. However, not enough emphasis was put on how that demographic change lead to an economic downturn of the city due to the money moving to the suburbs and the loss of jobs to other regions of the country. <br/><br/>""Detroit"" uses historical footage and a cinéma vérité style reenactments. The mixture works seamlessly throughout the film. Too bad the writing didn't create a more coherent picture of the time period. Statistics of unemployment, arrests of African Americans, a rising black prison population, would have helped create the setting in which the riots occurred. <br/><br/>The film fails to show how the riots were a watershed moment in the history of Detroit, how everything afterward became worse economically for the city and where that left the city today. Near the end of the film, ""Detroit"" goes from civil rights drama to procedural drama and completely loses its way. Certainly, presenting what happened to the three white officers charged with murder was worthwhile, but that could have been done in a paragraph as an epilogue. <br/><br/>The film was way too long. Some of the elements distracted from the story of the collapse of a modern American city and harm it caused the inhabitants and some of it was played out too long after the point was made. The detention scene in the Algiers Hotel could have been half the length once the point was made about police brutality and racism. I wouldn't call it ""torture porn"" as other critics have, I would call it bad storytelling. Moreover, the court scene at the end could have been cut entirely.<br/><br/>Rating: Rental There is some great acting in the film. Too bad the directing and writing don't support the performances to make a film worthy of the theme."
"trublu215","7","69","126","31 July 2017"," A Taut Yet Overlong Drama
","Detroit is the latest addition to Kathryn Bigelow's lengthy filmography and it is the most Bigelow-esque film you'd come to expect from her. The film displays raw realism with the actors looking very real and naked from their famous personas. The story is jam packed and while I think this source material would have made a much better miniseries, Bigelow makes the story work with sacrificing some facts for the sake of cinema. The big question is: is it as good as the critics say it is? The answer: No. Not Close. But with that being said, it is a damn good movie that is definitely worth seeing.<br/><br/>Telling the story of three murdered African American men in a motel in Detroit during the city's infamous riots and civil rights movement, Detroit stars an all star cast that is certainly better on paper than they are in this film. John Boyega, Will Poulter, Jason Mitchell, Anthony Mackie, John Krasinski, and on and on-but none of them are really served as a main character. Bigelow is so determined on telling the facts of the case that she sacrifices good performances in order to give us a slice of reality. The film plays out like the most expensive reenactment of a tragedy on Investigation Discovery and, when looking at the facts of the case, this is the best compliment I can give the film. It sounds back handed but it is extremely informative even if it is picking a side in all of it. The one thing Bigelow does best is showing a true story like it is unfolding in front of you. She does it brilliantly in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, but Detroit is where it is to a fault. <br/><br/>With a 140-plus minute running time and a gaggle of characters to keep track of, the story is just too big for a feature film and requires patience. Despite this, Kathryn Bigelow does her best to tame Mark Boal's bloated script to a digestible film and the results are mostly good. The performances from the actors are real, raw and authentic in every aspect but never enough to burst off the screen. Bigelow lets the events unfold and do that for them. Overall, Detroit is certainly a good film in need of an audience just a very patient one."
"gortx","Null","26","44","16 August 2017"," 'True Story' yet feels false
","I don't criticize the movie on PC or 'racial' grounds, but, on how it works - doesn't - on screen. Unfortunately, the backlast TO the backlash paints just about anybody who doesn't like DETROIT as being PC. I strongly support Bigelow and Boal's 'right' to make any movie they want, but, it's also a person's right to disapprove and not have one's motives questioned. My full take:<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's THE HURT LOCKER and ZERO DARK THIRTY are two of best movies of the millennium. Because of that, it is doubly difficult to write that their current effort, DETROIT is such a disappointment.<br/><br/>The movie takes place during the Detroit riots of July 1967. It begins with a wider overview of the situation, complete with archival news reports, photos and audio.* Interspersed are a few on the ground perspectives of various characters. It's not terribly involving, but not bad. Some of these characters begin to gather in and around a motel. At that point, it becomes clear that the events at that motel will become the centerpiece of the movie.<br/><br/>Those events became known as the infamous and horrific Algiers Motel Incident, complete with a contemporaneous best-selling book of that name by John Hersey. It is here where the movie failings emerge. If there is one thing that the various witnesses can agree on - is that there are few things they can agree on. In addition to the book, there were several investigations, court cases and a myriad of stories written and recorded over the four decades since. Bigelow and Boal said they did not use the book when making DETROIT.<br/><br/>However, the movie-makers made the decision to depict a single narrative viewpoint as if it were ""the truth"". While the incident may not have exactly been a Rashomon situation, it was certainly a chaotic one where no one person was witness to each and every event that happened along the way. That is Bigelow and Boal's artistic decision. But, it becomes disastrous if not downright distateful on screen. For, despite fine performances and strong production values, the sequence never quite rings true. It seems Written. Directed. Coerced. Co-Opted. Manufactured. It's a 'true story' that feels false. Without truth. Without insight. The brutality and inhumanity is so unremitting that it takes on the feel of an exploitation movie. I fully understand that exploitation was the last thing on Bigelow and Boal's mind, but the screen does not lie. Yes, these incidents did happen, but did we need to see all the blood,bruising and nudity? It further complicates things that DETROIT's narrative of the events is contradicted by much of the sworn testimony of the witnesses - both at the time and subsequently**. Again, Bigelow and Boal's artistic perogative, but to what end if not to further belief in the portrayal of events??<br/><br/>DETROIT's last act is a long protracted court-room drama. It's supposed to bring context and some closure to the events, but, like the bulk of the movie it feels wholly unsatisfactory and unfullfilling. Whenever a 'true story' about barbarous events is brought to the screen by such a clearly talented cast and crew the term ""powerful"" is often used (indeed, there were several audible gasps in the screening I attended). But, a production can be both ""powerful"" and ""empty"". DETROIT, unfortunately, ends up on the lower end of that scale.<br/><br/>* Kudos to Bigelow for preserving the proper aspect ratio for the vintage footage<br/><br/>** Without getting into spoilers, I will just mention a relatively minor example. The musical band portrayed in the movie, The Dramatics, are depicted as newbies who are seeking a first break. In actuality, they had been together for four years and even been a recording act for at least two years Prior to the events in DETROIT. I don't criticize Boal & Bigelow's movie because of a few fudged facts, but, because it undercuts the drama even further, making it feel false."

There are many critics of this film that claim its not ""historically accurate."" Baloney!! Three unarmed young men were found shot to death in a location that was not involved in the rioting at all. The only people in the hotel with guns...were cops. Detroit homicide detective and the DA thought these cops were guilty...otherwise they would not have been brought up on charges. Those are the ""facts"". It's odd to me that the ""not historically accurate"" criticism is being played here. Dunkirk isn't historically accurate, Gettysburg wasn't historically accurate..and so on.

","It's a nazi prison guard film about race relations? It comes off sensationalist to the point of parody. I was going with it until they let the 'already murdered a guy' cop lead the charge for the second killing. Then he becomes this vile and evil caricature while everyone including military personnel just stand around letting this teenager go on a power trip. I have far more faith in the military and police and don't believe a thing on screen. I suspect they wanted Bigelow's war film background but with an 'in Detroit' hook, and all her attention to detail, cinematic mastery of space, image, and immersion, is used in full effect to terrorize the audience. She is a director's director, and one of the finest we have; some may not know how difficult and how much attention such a work would require to pull off so effortlessly. You could say Detroit presents a distortion of the cinema gift, a masterful thriller and film craft used to ensure its political message. The film presents it as a true story, and so it plays almost as if the Nazi war criminals were let off after Nuremberg, it's really enraging stuff. Then you understand why they preceded that with the most evil rendition of events. Flashes of Boyega's expressions of conscience and humanity resonate the most. The film is extreme in tone, hopeless, the villains win and you feel awful by the end of it, but I'm mixed on it, I admire Bigelow's great power of filmmaking, but I question its authenticity and tone."

","The city of Detroit is in a tough position. It was once a vast metropolis with several factories calling it home, making it a mecca for families looking for a quality and a safe security. Things changed when many of those car factories either closed or moved, turning a vast city into a ghost town. It's still standing and has plenty of people, but it now exists as a shadow of its own empire. Politicians and companies are in the middle of getting back a state of industry, so who knows what the future holds. It holds a lot of history, both good and tragic.<br/><br/>In the late 1960's, race relations were at the brink of an explosion as African-Americans were crippled by poor living conditions in cities and were being provided little help from the government. While white Americans were enjoying a better life in the suburbs, the cities continued to unofficially segregate blacks into the urban environments. This anger eventually erupted in a series of riots that provided fuel for the media on the troubling issues for African Americans. Though each city riot had their fair share of casualties and damage, the one in Detroit was said to be the worst. It has been recreated in the Kathryn Bigelow film, Detroit. <br/><br/>On the July 23, 1967, an unlicensed club was raided upon and shut the party down. This triggered a mob to start throwing rocks at police cars and they would later loot and set fire to various buildings. This was considered the start of the Detroit City riots. The second day is more of the same, except officer Phillip Krauss (played by Will Poulter) guns down an unarmed looter. Though he's told he'll be investigated on possible murder charges, he's not taken off the force. The riots become so violent that the governor approves the National Guard and the Army to provide help.<br/><br/>On the third day, the Dramatics, an R&B group's performance is canceled when the riots come close to the theater. They try to leave the city, but lead singer Larry Reed (played by Algee Smith) gets separated and makes it to the Algiers Motel, hoping things will cool down the next day. <br/><br/>A prank goes bad when a blank gunshot is confused for a sniper attack, causing the police to arrive quickly to find the shooter. Officer Krauss leads everyone down, including two white girls, a recent Vietnam veteran Lou, and Larry Reed for brutality-like interrogation. Though security guard Melvin Dismukes (played by John Boyega) is there to witnesses it, he watches as he tries to ensure everyone will leave alive.<br/><br/>Taking an entire city based riot and putting it into one film cannot be an easy task, but Kathryn Bigelow developed Detroit into a magnificent, very tense look into events that identifies a lot of problems that are not only historically significant, but could be examined in a modern subtext. I love how the story is set around the tragedy of the Algiers Motel incident, which could be seen as the heart of the darkness. <br/><br/>The script is great, the direction is great, the pacing is great, and the acting is all great. Every single person is the right choice for their character, especially to the big three, Will Poulter, John Boyega, and Algee Smith. Their performances had my eyes straight ahead to the screen as I was always curious to see what happens. I felt every emotion go through my body as I succumbed to the events projected, dragging me into the riots and of Detroit.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten Dramatic albums out of ten. I can say that Detroit is a frontrunner for the Oscars in a lot of categories. Is it better then Dunkirk? Hmmthat's hard to say as despite both movies portraying major events, they feel different, which should say a lot about the importance of film as an art. We'll just have to wait for the end of the year to find out where it places on my scale. I can say that this is an engaging movie that completely sucks you into the madness.

","The movie ""Detroit"" doesn't accurately reflect the 1967 accounts. It begins with raiding the Blind Pig (an illegal operation) and arresting patrons. It then shows rioters throwing bottles through police car windows. What it fails to show is why. As patrons were arrested, they were brutally beaten, and women were sexually accosted by police. <br/><br/>Innocent teens were also brutalized by police, with 3 murdered at the Algiers hotel. What it didn't show was the sodomization of these teens by police. Two were only at the Algiers hotel to avoid the curfew violation. Sadly, the police walked away scot-free because the ""sodomization"" wasn't allowed as testimony during the trial.<br/><br/>It shows the Dramatics' first break at the Fox Theatre Motown Revue, and also shows them singing ""Whatcha See is Whatcha Get"" during this period. The Dramatics began releasing music in 1963 with ""Toy Soldier"", and 4 songs between 1963 and 1967. The song ""Whatcha See is Whatcha Get"" wasn't released until 1971."
"AlsExGal","6","9","13","19 February 2019"," True story suspense drama that is entertaining enough
","It's 1967, and rioting and looting has broken out in the city of Detroit, with buildings being burned and shots being fired. The situation has progressed to the point that National Guard troops have been mobilized in the streets, and no one is safe. It's with this setting that the main story unfolds when shots are reported fired from a hotel, and police and troops converge on the building, leading to tense situation that leaves several people dead. The cast includes John Boyega as a black, uniformed security guard who gets swept up in events; Will Poulter as the leader of a trio of beat cops who take things too far; Algee Smith as an aspiring pop singer who has the misfortune of checking into the hotel; Anthony Mackie as a recently discharged Army veteran.<br/><br/>This seemed like the kind of film to ignite a firestorm of controversy, with its setting of racial unrest and us-vs-them police misconduct coming on the heels of the recent incidents across the country, from Ferguson to Baltimore. Maybe people were exhausted from the news, or perhaps other current event spectacles rendered past injustices as moot points, whatever the reason, the film flopped at the box office although the critics enjoyed it. I liked it as well, but not as much as they did. Bigelow and Boal previously collaborated on the superior The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. They attempt a ""you are there"" cinema verite style that uses a lot of handheld camera and very little gloss or overly stylish cinematic tricks. They also made the wise decision to cast relative unknowns so as not to distract from the story, with the biggest names in the cast (Mackie and Krasinski) in lesser roles.<br/><br/>There's quite a bit of build up before the movie gets to its main focus, but that may have been necessary to explain the actions of those involved when things finally hit the fan. Running just under 2 and a half hours, I found it a bit over long, and could have seen at least 15 minutes trimmed away. The performances are good for the most part, but I'm not too fond of Poulter. This isn't a bad movie at all, but it is hardly a stand-out in Bigelow's catalog of films."

","How can a movie as confusing as this be considered Oscar material. This is nothing like Bigelow's previous superb movies with its jumbled story and outright fiction presented as ""truth"". The screenwriter admits to ""a self-imposed rule to never stray from what I understood to be the underlying truth of a scene or an event"". What he termed poetic license, is nothing less than a license to lie. He also updated the dialogue, to what, modern terminology or assumed modern attitudes? Probably both.<br/><br/>Bigelow uses a broad brush dipped in the slime of three corrupt cops as an indirect implication projected 50 years later on today's police a la BLM hate. Just casting Will Poulter, who oozes bully/evil, as a cop, is pejorative. And yes the black victims deserved focus, but not to the point of marginalizing the massive violence, looting, vandalism, riots and murder. A major flaw was the fact that the victims stood up to the beatings and apparent/actual murder of some of them, rather than give up the dead moron in the parlor who had fired off a starter pistol in the middle of a riot. This is a canyon sized plot hole.<br/><br/>And in another piece of complete idiocy, one of the black singers is made to complain that Motown's music is just for white people. Ga! And yes it was an all white jury, but they found the black security guard to be innocent in like 8 minutes. But the white judge, who was later found to be personally corrupt, instructed the jury to either convict the cops on 1st degree murder (which was not the case), or render a not guilty verdict--2nd degree murder or manslaughter weren't options. Chalk another one up to the establishment, so of course none of that was mentioned.<br/><br/>What in the hell happened here? Was Bigelow found to have been too conservative in her previous efforts and forced to make a propaganda film, or is this her true self? Her emphasis can do nothing here but stir the rabble rousing pot which is already at the boiling point. So I guess yeah, it is Oscar material."

","Detroit is a movie that is based around the events of the Algiers Motel Incident during the African American rebellion. During that incident, a group of African American males and two white females are taken in as victims who threatened police officers at the Algiers Motel. When the incident unfolds, the men and women involved would have their lives completely changed.<br/><br/>For what this movie is, it's fine. It's executed well enough even if it isn't completely historically accurate. It does have its intense moments, mainly towards the second act and the movie is very well acted. Algee Smith does a fantastic job with his character, Larry especially. Larry, admittedly is the main highlight of the movie for me. He is able to show so much through just his facial expressions and gestures, and I really admire Smith for executing that so well. There is a lot of political talk throughout this narrative. Some viewers may not understand all of it.<br/><br/>Either way, my main issue with the movie is that it feels like it drags on for too long. This movie is almost two and a half hours long, and I feel like the running time could've been reduced by about 15 minutes. I mean, the majority of the first act does do a good job at setting up the catalyst of the plot, but since this movie is about Detroit's Algiers Motel Incident rather than simply the fall of Detroit itself, I feel like there's a good chunk in the beginning that could've been taken out.<br/><br/>Even though Detroit feels like it drags on for too long, it's still a well acted and well written telling of a tragic event that took place in the city of Detroit.

The Color grade, Casting, and lack of soundtrack was also very good. What was bad was the childish script which was filled with cartoonish stereotypes from every class, gender and color. I found myself cringing at how awful some of the dialogue was and the direction was pretty much a complete mess.<br/><br/>Anyone that is a fan of Bigelow's films knows that at some point she goes off on some tangent for 15 minutes but them usually rights the ship back on course. This entire film was off course from the opening 15 minutes which is just disarray (which I understand is part of the point) that goes on way too long and we learn nothing that drives the narrative along. The beatings were like seeing the equally awful Passion of the Christ... You get so desensitized by the constant beatings that you really don't care any more. The tacked on Penny Marshall-esque ending was filled with so much saccharine it could have induced a diabetic coma and did a complete injustice to The Dramatics. It was sad because I was really hoping for this to be an important film especially in the timeliness of this decade but instead it became a Lifetime Movie with over the top violence.<br/><br/>In the end I could have lived with the direction if there wasn't such a laughable script.

The movie was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and it was written by acclaimed journalist/screenwriter Mark Boal (the duo also performed the same duties on both 2008's Best Picture winner 'THE HURT LOCKER', and 2012's Best Picture nominee 'ZERO DARK THIRTY'). The film stars John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith, Jason Mitchell, Jacob Latimore, Hannah Murray, Kaitlyn Dever, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, John Krasinski and Anthony Mackie (who also costarred in 'THE HURT LOCKER'). It's received almost unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be extremely well made and involving.<br/><br/>The film begins with a police raid of a private party, in 1967 Detroit, which then resulted in multiple days of rioting. The story then centers on a police raid of the Algiers Motel, on July 25th, where police believed a sniper fired on them from. The raid resulted in the terrorizing of several black suspects, and two white women, and the deaths of some of those involved. The story then shifts to the court room battle that followed the incident.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting, and pretty intense, from pretty much the opening scene until the last. All of the performances are good in it as well, and of course Bigelow's direction is almost flawless. For me the film was also very educational, as I knew very little about these events in history (prior to seeing the movie). I think the film is yet another great example of what a talented filmmaker Bigelow is, and obviously her and Boal make a great team together too. It's also cool to see Boyega in another strong starring role; a 'STAR WARS' actor that's actually making a name for himself (outside of the franchise) is always good to see.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/W6So6Kz52VQ"

","Let me be very clear; the actors in this film are top-notch, but they were directed and handed scripts by amateurs. The writing is horrendous, and as another astute reviewer noticed (Mr. Crowford), this film was not realistic in the time frame it was supposed to be in. In addition to the authenticity issue, I found the stereotypes of whites in the film to be offensive, although mildly amusing. Of course, we are used to seeing stereotypical black characters portrayed in several films, and we usually recognize them when they appear. One token ""good"" police officer does not get the job done for accuracy. There were several dozen white (and black) officers hurt during these riots; not one of their characters were examined.<br/><br/>The actors do the best they can with the very shallow script, and I was impressed with several of them, but they sounded like kids at a high school play in several scenes because of the script and indecisive directing.

"dave-mcclain","6","19","42","31 July 2017"," enlightening, but frustrating
","Long before the 1992 L.A. riots that were sparked by the Rodney King verdict, in 1967, the city of Detroit endured riots depicted in the historical crime drama ""Detroit"" (R, 2:23). The two uprisings were separated by a quarter century, but the underlying causes and results were very similar. Back in 1943, in the middle of World War II, Detroit had previously been the scene of major rioting. Those two Detroit uprisings were separated by nearly a quarter century, but the underlying causes and results were very similar. The riots of '43 were an expression of frustration by the black community over poor economic conditions and abusive treatment by police. Some of the police committed additional abuses while trying to put down the riots, while some of the rioters took advantage of the chaotic situation to loot business, destroy buildings and harm people who had nothing to do with the problems in their communities. 24 years later, many of the same conditions and frustrations still existed in Detroit's black communities and in July 1967, in the middle of the Vietnam War, tensions boiled over again, with similar results. Almost exactly 50 years after those riots, Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") chronicles what happened during that week in Detroit and, in particular, tries to clarify the still somewhat murky story of what took place on the night of July 25-26 at a motel called the Algiers.<br/><br/>In 1967, Detroit's inner city was a tinderbox of racial tension and social unrest, needing only a spark to make it explode. This film starts by showing the incident that provided that spark – and depicts the explosion that followed. Late Saturday night / early Sunday morning, July 23, 1967, police raided an unlicensed drinking establishment on 12th Street. The police, who were almost all white, arrested everyone who was in the club, all of whom were black. A crowd gathered outside began harassing the police and throwing things, forcing the police to withdraw as soon as their raid was complete. Emotions were running high and the crowd began looting nearby stores, beginning what turned out to be about five days of riots. Police tried to restore order, but weren't supposed to shoot looters, although that's exactly what we police officer Phillip Krauss (Will Poulter) do. As the violence continued, public events were being cancelled, such as a concert where the up and coming singing group The Dramatics was just about to take the stage. Instead, the guys hopped a bus and tried to make it home, but the chaos of the ongoing rioting led them to take refuge in The Algiers. Very close to that motel was black security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) who got called in to help protect his boss' grocery store from looters. Dismukes makes nice with the National Guard troops who take up a position across the street by bringing them coffee and chatting them up. And so the stage is set for the Algiers Motel Incident.<br/><br/>The Algiers was filling up fast with people seeking safety from the ongoing riots. Almost all of the Algiers' guests were black, but there were two 18-year-old white girls there (Kaitlyn Dever and Hannah Murray), visiting from Ohio. They are approached by one of the guys from the Dramatics, ""Cleveland"" Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend, Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) and the four of them get friendly, hanging out by the motel pool. Later, they go up to the room of Carl Cooper (Jason Mitchell), where there is a small party going on. As Cooper is messing around with one of his friends, he fires off a starter pistol that others think is a real gun. Soon, the sound catches the attention of people outside who now think there is a sniper shooting from the Algiers. National Guard troops, Michigan State Police and Detroit police, led by officer Krauss swarm the hotel, some of them literally shooting first and asking questions later. Dismukes ends at the Algiers too, but Krauss takes the lead. He and his fellow cops spend the rest of the night terrorizing, threatening, abusing and eventually killing motel guests, at first trying to find out who the ""sniper"" is and, later, covering their tracks when things get out of hand. Krauss struggles to orchestrate and continue the cover-up as he, two other officers and Dismukes stand trial for murder.<br/><br/>""Detroit"" is a strong and valuable dramatization of historical events, but falls short of its true potential. As Bigelow directs the script by Mark Boal (with whom she also collaborated on ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty""), she tries to do too much. She shows scenes of the 12 Street Riot without really setting up the vital historical context or effectively portraying its development. When she gets to what she really wants to focus on, the Algiers Motel Incident, she allows to hang over those scenes the question as to why the people who knew that Cooper only had a starter pistol never said so while the police were brutally interrogating them. And then the courtroom scenes are so short and tightly edited, that they don't really tell us much. By trying to tell two stories – the general story of the riots – and the specific story of the Algiers and its aftermath, the film doesn't tell either of them especially well. However, Bigelow does present images of 1967 Detroit that look so authentic, you'll almost think you're actually there, and she gets excellent performances from all of her actors, regardless of their varying levels of experience. The two main things Movie Fans will learn from this movie regarding race relations in America (especially with stories like this one regularly echoing in the news) are how far we've come, and far we have yet to go. To be sure, both are important lessons, but ""Detroit"" could have accomplished so much more. ""B"""

","*** mild spoilers ***
1960's Detroit is in a state of utter chaos. Police and military swarm the streets in an attempt to control rioting, violence and looting that has ravaged the city for days. Some people are partying in a motel not doing any harm and one guy decides it would be funny to shoot several rounds (just sound generating blanks) of his starter pistol out the window in the direction of the squad of soldiers/police across the street. The police storm the building trying to find the ""shooter"" and in the process shoot and kill the guy that had shot off the starter blank rounds.<br/><br/>I laughed uncontrollably at how idiotic this moron with the starter pistol was and how hilarious it was that the writer decided that he be the one killed as the police raided the building. It could have been anyone else that decided to do a rabbit run and subsequently got killed by the trigger happy police.<br/><br/>What follows is equally comedic when you watch the remaining party goers submit to assault, torture and torment by the police as they attempt to discover who it was that was shooting at the police. No one will admit that yes, one among them was shooting but it was only a blank shooting starter pistol and that in fact the guy that did the shooting was already dead on the floor.<br/><br/>If they had simply explained this then the entire interrogation/torture event would have been over. You could have wrapped up the film and rolled the credits. To me this was hilarious. Why would they not simply explain this, tell the cops where they thought the pistol was and be done with it.<br/><br/>The writer chose to have the characters all remain silent in spite of the threats and beatings. It makes no sense and this is the basis for comedy. <br/><br/>In addition to this obvious error in screen writing the cinematography is just terrible. The camera jumps around incessantly regardless of whether the characters are motionless sitting in chairs or whether they are running frantically down the street. Zooming is excessive and random. The shot will suddenly show part of someone's foot, then the side of a head, then down at the floor, then an overly zoomed shot of a wiener cooking in a fry pan... etc etc. Was the camera man ON DRUGS ??? Why didn't the director control him ?? The entire affair makes you sea sick. Its a cheap, unprofessional, grade C effort. The budget of $34 million posted on IMDB makes no sense. This film has the look of a 2 million dollar effort.<br/><br/>Overall I must admit that I did get some laughs at how absurd the story was, how pathetic the characters behaved and every time the camera man suddenly zoomed way in on some random object or part of someone's body it made me smile. So I'll give it a 4/10 which meant there was some entertainment value but overall it bothered me more than not.<br/><br/>Yes, yes I know there is supposed to be a message about some social/political issues here but that message is utterly lost in the crappy delivery style of the film."

When the movie gets going, an unlicensed club is raided by the Detroit Police, and it's not long before the mostly white cops beat up the mostly black patrons of the club, Things get out of hand pretty fast after that, and before we know it, the city is ablaze, the National Guards are called in, and a state of emergency is declared...<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest film from critically acclaimed director Kathryn Bigelow. I adore her most recent work (The Hurt Locker; Zero Dark Thirty), and hence had high hopes for this movie. Here, working from a scrip by frequent collaborator Mark Boal, Bigelow intends to bring us what happened during the riots in Detroit exactly 50 years ago. For sure there were a lot of things that went wrong, on both sides, and hence these are important social issues that merit, indeed need, attention and discussion. It is then all the more regrettable that Bigelow chose to make the film the way she did. Almost from the get-go what we see and experience on the big screen is an incessant use of hand-held cameras (and shake them a bit for good measure). That, in combination with the all too frequent extreme close-ups, make for almost impossible viewing over an extended period of time. Let me just admit it right here and now: I made it through half the movie (70 min.). Realizing that yet another 75 min. was to come, and that I had a headache induced by watching the film, as well as possible motion sickness, I simply could not carry on and bailed.

","There are many different ways to see Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, ""Detroit"". The odd thing is that the audience may not be the only ones asking that question. From what the trailer conveyed to me, it is the story of the horrible tragedy that took place during the riots in the city in 1967 at the annex to the Algiers hotel, but from the first twenty minutes it felt like more than that. As the film kicks off, an off-hours club is raided by local police for not being licensed properly by a police force that is seen as corrupt and overly forceful. As the rioting escalates, Patrolman Krauss (Will Poulter) decides that he needs to take matters into his own hands to an extreme. After he is put through an investigation for shooting someone he decides is a looter, he responds to a call of a possible sniper at the Algiers, sparking a night of terror for the people staying in the building. From two young free spirited ladies (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever) just wanting to have a good time to aspiring singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his best friend (Jacob Latimore) and a Vietnam veteran just trying to get back to normal life (Anthony Mackie), the night gets worse as it gets longer.<br/><br/>Even after the incident completely unfolds, there is another thirty minutes that deal with the legal fallout from that night followed by other ancillary stories that I could see as trying to tell the full story, but at almost two and half hours, it just seemed like it was never really sure which path it wanted to follow. I felt like the events leading up to the main story could have been trimmed back, and even some of the third act as well. The second act is so emotionally draining that anything that came after really did not give me the chance to catch my breath so I could digest the aftermath. I guess the slow pacing that book ended this film combined with the meandering story in those areas are what really took me out of it, which is a bit of a shame given some very powerful performances here from some great actors like Poulter who is so convincing that I fear that there are some out there that will have difficulty drawing the difference between the actor and the character; this performance is THAT good. Mackie is also very good in his limited screen time, but Smith absolutely brings an amazing emotional gambit to the role of Larry. Only having seen him as Ralph Tresvant in ""The New Edition Story,"" this role gave me a whole new respect for him as an actor, and I look forward to where his career goes from here. John Boyega also has a great turn, but I really thought there would be more from his character within the story than there was. If there is one character I would have like to have seen more fleshed out by trimming more from others, it would have been his.<br/><br/>Given that ""Detroit"" is a late summer release as opposed to an October or November release raises some questions as to the general perception of its award potential given the principals involved (I would like to see Poulter at least get recognized as well as some technical awards like sound design). I cannot say that this is in any way the worst film I have seen this year or even in the bottom half; what I will say is given the keys myself, I may have approached this story differently while making sure its message and heartbreaking story stayed intact."

","Kathryn Bigelow is known for her documentary-style camera-work and the creation of an intense atmosphere. This can be seen, either from the early work like Near Dark and Point Break, or from her more recent films such as The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. In one word, she is a good director for thrillers.<br/><br/>But Detroit is not a pure thriller. It is more like a period drama. On the one hand, the interrogation in the motel is the thriller part of the film, and without any doubt, it is brilliant. The audience keep wondering what would happen next. On the other hand, the film as a whole is mediocre in story-telling and character development. The setup for the interrogation is unnecessarily too long. Also, the courtroom process after the interrogation is too short. For more than once, Bigelow just simply displays lots of texts on the screen to make up for her unbalanced story-telling. John Boyega's character could have been the most impressive because he is the most struggling one in conscience. Yet it turns out to be untrue due to the limited time and space given to the character. <br/><br/>Overall speaking, Detroit could have been a thought-provoking classic, but it lacks depth in the end. There is no deeper discussion on the cause of the injustice or the impact it is could bring to real life. One real classic period drama is Spielberg's Schindler's List. In this aspect, Bigelow is still one step away from being a great director. <br/><br/>One more thing, Will Poulter deserves a nomination for Oscar best supporting actor, whose performance is the key to the success of the thriller part."

There had been several riots that had erupted over the inequalities that divided the country and it often erupted in violent confrontations with police and resulted in significant amounts of violence and damage. In the film ""Detroit"", Director/Producer Kathryn Bigelow looks at a disturbing series of events that happened during 1967 during a riot in Detroit.<br/><br/>Using news footages and images from the event to open the film, the audience is seen how a largely white police force often resorted to brutality to bring suspects of color into line and would often harshly prosecute minor infractions.<br/><br/>With the National Guard and police at a severe state of tension, a suspected looter is shot in the back by a police officer named Krauss (Will Poulter) and later dies from his injuries. The fact that he shot an unarmed suspect in the back twice does not sit well with his superiors and Krauss is informed that they will form an investigation and they are suggesting that murder charges be filed against him. At the same time, security officer Dismukes (John Boyega) is called into work shortly after he returns home from his main job. He is being tasked to protect a store and sets up shop with his partner in an area that is being occupied by the National Guard.<br/><br/>The film then shifts to a group of musicians who are about to have their big break by appearing onstage at a Motown showcase. Moments before taking the stage they are informed that the riot is encroaching upon the area and that they along with the mostly white audience need to evacuate.<br/><br/>Disappointment turns to terror when their bus is attacked and the group takes refuge in the Algiers Motel. It is at the hotel that the band meets two white girls who dabble in prostitution while trying to get their careers off the ground.<br/><br/>There is some tension between the band and some of the residents at the hotel for the attention of the two ladies and one individual attempts to pull a prank feigning being shot with what turns out to be a track pistol.<br/><br/>After the others have gone back to various rooms, the person pulling the prank decides to fire his pistol at the National Guard who will scatter thinking they are under fire.<br/><br/>The prank backfires when the National Guard and Police storm the hotel to find the sniper. Things get worse when one of the band are found in the same room as the two white girls which outrages Krauss and his fellow officers.<br/><br/>What follows is a very dark and disturbing series of events where the suspects are physically and mentally assaulted and denied their basic civil rights. As tensions mount, mistakes happen and people end up dead. <br/><br/>The film follows how events rapidly spun out of control and how tragic events happened and were covered up. The film then moves to the aftermath of the incident and the trial that followed as well as detailing what became of the key individuals after the event. The film is a masterful and powerful film that shows that Bigelow is one of the most gifted Directors out there. She gets a masterful performance from her talented cast and does not pull any punches in bringing the events to the screen as best as they were able to reconstruct. The film is a serious Oscar contender and underscores the duality of how far we have come as a society in terms of social reforms while at the same time, illustrating how little many things have actually changed.<br/><br/>""Detroit"" is simply the best film I have seen this year and is not to be missed.<br/><br/>5 stars out of 5"
"bob-the-movie-man","8","14","35","9 August 2017"," Bigalow's latest is a film of its time... and unfortunately still current.
","Katheryn Bigelow's new film should make you angry. It made me angry. As this year's Selma (on steroids) the film is an ode to how incidents can get out of hand: at a macro level we see how a stubborn chained door triggers a series of riots 50 years ago that reduced the 'Motor Town' to a war zone; at a micro level we see how a childish prank turns to a terrifying ordeal for the guests of the Algiers Motel.<br/><br/>While I was aware of the historical context of the Detroit riots, the Motel incident was new to me. How accurate is the film? Not very, from the many comments made online and from diversions in the story to what's reported on the 'official' wiki page. But what's clear is that the facts of what occurred have been refracted through the multiple lenses of the police, the victims, the state police, the troopers and the legal teams arguing those facts. So no one can be sure anymore. <br/><br/>Bigelow - particularly as a white women - is brave to make this film. You would like to think that, after 50 years, American society has 'grown up' somewhat but, after the recent police-on-black incidents in places including Ferguson, Baltimore and Charlotte, that is clearly not the case. So this is a rather incendiary picture: as a white liberal, I was angry; as a black person I would be furious. This hardly pours 'oil on troubled waters'.  <br/><br/>But enough of the political context: what's the film like? The answer is tense: very tense!<br/><br/>The riots are wonderfully staged with masterful cinematography (by Barry Ackroyd, ""The Hurt Locker"", ""Captain Phillips"") that blends filmed footage with documentary footage (cleverly upscaled for the big screen) such that you often can't see the seams. Once in the annex of the motel the film becomes grippingly claustrophobic as the racist cop Krauss (Will Poulter) becomes the king - no, the dictator - of all he surveys. Here the film editing and sound design is superb, and it would be astonishing if these disciplines are not up for Oscars for this work. <br/><br/>It is difficult to single out specific acting performances, since this is a fine ensemble performance (a One Mann's Movies award prediction:  the The Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture). But I will reference a few: unknown Algee Smith owns the role of Larry Reed - lead singer of Motown group 'The Dramatics' - showing how the events of the night sapped his enthusiasm for life; Jack Reynor extends his impressive CV (after ""Sing Street"" and ""Free Fire"") as the most hapless of Krauss's cronies; and John Boyega (""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"") delivers a Poitier-level of screen presence as fish-out-of-water security guard Dismukes. A mid- film twist in the film concerning his character (at least as written and portrayed) delivers a powerful kick to the gut that Boyega acts beautifully.<br/><br/>But the starring role goes to Poulter as the malignant police officer Krauss. With a resume as diverse as ""Son of Rambo"", ""We're the Millers"" and ""The Revenant"", Poulter is making it into the top tier of young movie actors. As Krauss he is 100% believable.<br/><br/>I loved the first two thirds of the film: gripping, thought-provoking and scary, but with entertaining elements of the Motown scene, through the eyes of 'The Dramatics"", thrown in to add humanity and context. If it had finished then, I would have been happy:  10*, no problem. Unfortunately Bigelow and her standard screenwriter Mark Boal (""The Hurt Locker"", ""Zero Dark Thirty"") rather over-egg the pudding in the final reels, making the film over-long and undoing some of the previous good work. The film sprawls into multiple different areas including courtroom scenes, mourning  families (introducing brand new characters), a Larry Reed story and related Dramatics fall-out, with only the latter storyline being really welcome.<br/><br/>This is an important film, and will no doubt feature strongly in the Awards season.  It is also, notwithstanding its flaws, a very good film that was a hard watch but impressive. Recommended.<br/><br/>(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks.)"

","The super cinematic duo of Director Kathryn Bigelow and Writer Mark Boal have constructed an impactful, passionate project in the film ""Detroit"". Rev up your Detroit Pistons, because this one is riveting. It is based on the true story of the 1967 Detroit riots centered on the police brutality travesty that happened in the city's Algiers Motel. Bigelow helms the movie in a masterful manner that magnetizes the viewer into the action, especially in the film's brawny second act. Boal scribes up a script as sturdy as a Detroit Tiger. The film's acting ensemble assembled roaring performances as loud as a Detroit Lion; including John Boyega, Algee Smith, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, Anthony Mackie, Hannah Murray, and Kaitlyn Dever. But it was Will Poulter as the savage, racist cop Krauss that was the standout here and should be ""red winging"" it to a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. ""Detroit"" is one of the best films of 2017, and should be seen as soon as possible in your motown. ***** Excellent"

","Art is not always easy to swallow. However, some art is essential. This is a story that needed to be told.<br/><br/>Oscar winning director Kathryn Bigelow has knocked it out of the park once again with Detroit. Once again, Bigelow takes on delicate subject matter with the expertise of a great filmmaker. The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty are good films in their own right, but this is far more affecting and heart-wrenching than either of those films. <br/><br/>Detroit is filmed wholly hand-held, and the shakiness that comes along with that direction choice is extremely effective. Before the riots even start in the film, you will be set on edge by the shakiness of the camera and jarring cuts. This alone creates tension that is only ratcheted up little by little as the film progresses. There are many scenes, that because of the tension created with the camera-work, along with the terrifying nature of the situation, feel like something out of a horror film. <br/><br/>Every actor here gives a near flawless performance. While John Boyega is being marketed as the star of the film (which, duh, he was in Star Wars), this is actually a film without a standard Hollywood- style star. These actors—even the bigger names—are treated as equally important details in a larger event. In fact, despite the presence of Boyega, Anthony Mackie, and Jason Mitchell, I was blown away most by the lesser-known Algee Smith. The performances here are emotional, powerful, but most of all, real. None of these actors feel like they are acting for an Academy Award, instead each actor embodies the real life people that lived through these events.<br/><br/>The shocking nature of this film is all thanks to the film's subject matter. But I'm not here to critique subject matter. Detroit, from a purely narrative standpoint, is brilliantly written—jumping from characters and timelines until all roads meet at the film's crescendo. Instead of the route Dunkirk chose—throwing you right into the fire with characters you don't know—Detroit instead gives each character scenes that let you get to know them as people, allowing you to genuinely care about them.<br/><br/>While this is a great film, it is a hard watch. This is an emotionally grueling film in the same way 12 Years a Slave and Fruitvale Station are. With that being said, the two and a half hour run time of this film is exhausting. There is not much that could be cut out of this film, but the length is something that can really work against this film.<br/><br/>Detroit is a poignant film, not only due to the masterful direction and performances, but because of it's relevance in the world we live in today. This is an unflinching, timely achievement—and may be Kathryn Bigelow's magnum opus."
"M_Exchange","3","14","36","7 August 2017"," I love the D, so I hate that I disliked this film.
","People are writing that it's mostly fictitious, which actually makes sense because the fact that so many people were remaining silent and taking a beating for a moron who caused the incident and was already dead was absolutely baffling.<br/><br/>I'm white and from the Detroit suburbs. I've lived in L.A. for the last ten years. I know that this film is about a tragedy that occurred during the '60s (when I wasn't even alive), but I want to state that the Detroit and Michigan police in general--black, white, Asian, etc.-- were FAR kinder to me and much more scrupulous than the scum who patrol the streets in Los Angeles (almost totally white and hispanic), which is another thing that annoys me tremendously-- the racism of assuming that American white cops are supremacists who never abuse white citizens.<br/><br/>This film is also obscenely long. I have made several short films, so I knew precisely which parts should have been cut out-- everything from meaningless shots to forced acting.<br/><br/>Will Poulter is a remarkable actor, though. He was great in The Revenant, and he steals the show in this film. Anthony Mackie is an awesome talent as well.<br/><br/>But overall, I just couldn't justify sitting in a theater for almost 2 1/2 hours while I and everyone around me had the same thought during 2 of those hours-- JUST TELL THEM THAT THE DEAD IDIOT DID IT."
"dpkutilek","1","10","24","17 July 2018"," Should have been titled something different
","This movie has about as much in common with the Detroit riots as the rapper Krispy Cream has to the evolution of the hip hop industry. Quick disclaimer there were some racist cops involved in the Detroit riots but not comparable to the insanity in the south.
1) focuses on an incident at a motel rather than the riots as a whole. Keep in mind that horrible actions that these police officers took were in part true. Next look up the white girls in the motel they were both prostitutes and had a boat load of felony charges against them prior to the incident. Then look up the people being accused of shooting at the cops with a ""toy gun"" (starter gun which can be used as an actual weapon) one of the assaulted a teacher violently.
2) that horrible cartoon at the beginning. They might as well have started back in the 1400s with this one. Massive propaganda and promoting fear for whites.
3) over all just a smear towards the law enforcement of America. Absolute disappointment I could go on for hours.
1/10 if you found this movie appalling and horrific and that everything was true in this film then I've got another great suggestion for you it's called Lord of the Rings because the reality of the events portrayed in this film are borderline fiction."

","Detroit<br/><br/>The movie is a 10 and achieves that rating primarily from the middle section of the movie that takes place at the Algiers Hotel. The beginning and end of the movie was very watchable and made the movie whole.<br/><br/>As I was watching the Algiers Motel events (once the police had arrived at the hotel and lined the patrons up against the wall) I knew I was watching the creation of an icon movie scene that will forever be remembered.<br/><br/>In terms of intensity and drama think of movies and scenes such as: The Deer Hunter/The Russian Roulette scene, Silence of the Lambs/The night vision scene, Saving Private Ryan/the opening D-Day landing scene, Jaws/on the boat once the attacks begin, Alien/The escape shuttle scene at the end of the movie, Jurassic Park/The kitchen scene<br/><br/>The intensity of the acting by the three Detroit cops and the men and women against the wall was truly breathtaking and unforgettable. The fact it holds the intensity for 40 minutes is remarkable. <br/><br/>Add to the intensity mentioned above: the subject matter, the fact it was based on a true event and relevancy to life today, and it makes the film an instant classic and Oscar material.<br/><br/>The Algiers Hotel scenes from Director Kathryn Bigelow were truly impressive and lived up to her well-earned reputation for an ability to capture intensity. What was truly remarkable was the capability of actors so young to deliver that intensity. All in their 20's, and some as young as 20 year old Kaitlyn Dever and Jacob Latimore, and 22 year old Algee Smith. They truly have bright futures ahead of them."

"trevor-82944","8","15","41","4 August 2017"," The Most Important Study of Our Own Failure
","Before my screening of Detroit played, the trailers shown beforehand featured these dumb action movies with bad CGI, you know, the ones expected to score box office success. Boy did it feel refreshing to see what I went to the theater for: a thriller based on a thought-provoking true story about how little has changed since the incident at the Algiers Motel.<br/><br/>First, a stylized prologue educates us on the public 1967 mindset by painting out the prior 100 years of racial history. The colorful film reel fit for an elementary classroom then time-warps us into the riots stirred up by Civil Rights, no sugarcoating included. The Black community embraced unlicensed after-hours club for the initiators of violence. The White police officers reacted to the rebellion by scaring them with death games. In any other director's hands, this project would have turned out as hate-fueled anti-White propaganda much like The Birth of a Nation or Get Out; rather, director Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) and her team made great strides to tell the real story of what happened in Detroit.<br/><br/>Everything within the first charcoal-tinted twenty minutes brings sense into Detroit's economic structure of the time. With each bike stolen, with each fire set ablaze, with each fireman injured by a thrown rock, with each Black woman sexually harassed by an officer, with each piece of real historical news footage, the attention closes in on the personal conflict within the riot rather than the spectacle itself. Although the usage of religious institutions deserved stronger prevalence across the entire runtime to match the moral strife of the time, the big picture still explodes with a great undying flame.<br/><br/>True to Bigelow's traditional style, a documentary approach records the dramatized events. Despite an unnecessary musical score by James Newton Howard (The Fugitive, Michael Clayton), a grainy Steadicam stressfully complements the sudden edit cuts, transferring the 1967 motion sickness into your own eyeballs.<br/><br/>The tension really sets its spark ablaze during the entire middle chunk: a motel-set interrogation in search for a blank-loaded gun aimed at the police outside. These victims, two of them Ohio-local White prostitutes, the rest young Black men, face the worst of Detroit's hate over the next hour and a half. The one holding the gun is shot dead, nobody knows the gun's whereabouts, yet the cops only see an easy chance to humiliate the weak one by one.<br/><br/>Every performer gives their greatest effort, the most impactful being a respectful Army Veteran who to the police is no different than any other negro. But Larry, a struggling musician also harassed that dreadful night, adds the most soul to our soulless history. The two whores receive the same poor treatment as their Black companions, lovingly supporting each other even after one gets stripped nude by a cop. While their stories lack their full potential, standing more as victims than empowering female role models, their sentimentality despite their destructive lifestyles make it easy for women to connect with. As with the other Black victims, none of them were motivated enough to cheer on, yet you can still tell them each apart simply by looking at their wardrobe.<br/><br/>By now, I believe screenwriter Mark Boal (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) just proved himself to be the most underrated writer in Hollywood today, as he achieved great heights to the artform by writing under a variety of styles, including courtroom drama, real time, and visual storytelling. His intense dialogue helps us to physically feel the situation without coming off as one-sided. He structures the multiple events so that every death hits you hard in the right timing, as true to the expressed motives we learn about each character, whether Black or White.<br/><br/>The issues seen here at Detroit looks upsettingly familiar to the anti- Trump riots we see today, almost normalized on a daily basis as it was back then. However, hope manages to lie within its social message: no stereotypes raise their ugly head, not all Blacks involved in the riots are mean spirited, and not all cops are racists. The different social groups stand up for one another and some even stand up for the other side, in a story everybody over the age of eighteen needs to know at once, especially now during the summer season.<br/><br/>So bottom line, this history lesson matters to you: Black or White, male or female, young or old, innocent or guilty!"
"iamjacksmoviechannel","8","18","53","1 August 2017"," Will Poulter here is....just wow
","""Detroit"" is a brutal piece of documentary-cinema from two people who have kinda taken over the mantle Oliver Stone used to have all wrapped up, at least in my eyes, as political activist filmmakers. <br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal are now moving away from the war on terror and looking at a war here at home which has unfortunately been going on forever between the police and black people. This particular incident is without question the one of the most brutal and egregious, happening in 1960's Detroit. <br/><br/>It is something else to see the National Guard just rolling in to a U.S city, really on edge and ready for battle. Like one character says, it seems ""like Nam"". And also like Nam, the civilian casualties really leave you pressed against your seat in horror. <br/><br/>This is a response to all out riots which go on for several days, as a result of black people being rounded up and beaten by the police. Even black service men are treated abysmally. <br/><br/>One thing I wish this movie would have done more with is what is the driving point of wanting to destroy one's home in order to attain social justice? The movie tells us black- owned businesses wrote 'soul brother' on their windows in solidarity with the protesters but they were still ransacked just as hard, but that's all the info we're given.<br/><br/>But regardless of that, Boal and Bigelow have set up a clear bias that the cops consider blacks less than by the time we get to the real heart of the story, and what comes next proves that they were just getting warmed up. <br/><br/>We've seen something like this before and the real tragedy is it always starts with something very small that snowballs into a living, breathing nightmare. We're looking at men being lined up at gunpoint and shot, beaten, women molested, there's more, it's horrible.<br/><br/>This is a horror movie. I've seen ""Annabelle: Creation"", that's horrific but it's fun. This is the type of horror movie that really does leave you feeling the world is a messed up place. Bigelow really couldn't do a better job of setting this scene. You hear the cracks across the face with the gun, she focuses in on shaking and holding hands for support. <br/><br/>And that cute kid from ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Maze Runner"" has this whole other side to him where he can seem like the biggest racist, psychopathic cop among a sea of other racist psychopathic cops. Honestly, I kept looking for a white cop in this movie who seemed somewhat solid in his decision-making and there's maybe one. <br/><br/>Will Poulter is so good in this movie that everyone else kinda seems less than. John Boyega is here as a guard whose just trying to survive the night and pacify where he can, but in the end I thought he came off just as ineffectual as his character does. <br/><br/>Like there is this whole thing in the end of how his character received death threats after all this and really had a tough life but it tells us this in text at the end of the movie and doesn't show. Also the last 40 minutes or so I thought felt like a bit of a slog as Bigelow just seems to be quickly brushing over the outcomes of all this in general. <br/><br/>In the end I liked the movie but felt it could have gotten a bit closer to most of it's characters and given us more insights into those struggles characters faced following this event. <br/><br/>But this really is one of those points in American history where you just leave ashamed to be white; not to say that is the film's purpose cause it's not. It's eye-opening though because ""oddly enough"", this is a situation where problems concerning race were not fixed and 50 years later, they're still not fixed. <br/><br/>All we're doing is celebrating wins on either side which is ridiculous. People are still happy about O.J. for Christ sake. A guy who knelt during a football season and gave millions to charity still can't get a job.<br/><br/>So I give it an 8 out of 10.

"Ramascreen","10","23","75","28 July 2017"," One of the most important films you'll ever see
","Even if Kathryn Bigelow's #Detroit movie may not purposely intend on pointing out the continued failures of our justice system with regards to police crime in today's world, it succeeds in doing exactly that. This is a raw and disturbing depiction of an even more disturbing true story that for one reason or another had been stuck as some kind of historical footnote for the past fifty years but it is timely as ever and it's one of the most important films you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The director who gave us ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" proves once again, with ""Detroit,"" that she is not one to run away from controversial subject matter. Written by her frequent collaborator, Mark Boal, ""Detroit"" is set during the most terrifying civil unrest that rocked the iconic motor city in the summer of 1967. The story zooms in on the Algiers Motel incident involving the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people including two white women.<br/><br/>Bigelow and her crew apply the famous cinema verité style of filmmaking that allows you to feel like you're there in that hallway with those victims as they're hands and heads are up against the wall, as the cops are beating on them. It doesn't get more visceral and up-close than this, the cinematography that is in constant motion elevates the intensity because it engages you the viewers and never lets go. Everything about this film is meant to create a sense of discomfort in addition to its trying to also reach some kind of authenticity that comes across as thoughtful and respectful. It's very hard to watch, definitely not a film for everybody.<br/><br/>Bigelow knows the importance of setting up the context and so the film comes with a prologue that briefly explains the history behind the migration and also the transfer of wealth away from the neighborhood and how pressure cooker builds up, how the events culminate into an uprising and ultimately this collision between a few racist cops and a few unfortunate young folks. So that way you get a better understanding as to why the collision got to be as violent as it did.<br/><br/>In the roles of the villains, actors Will Poulter, Ben O'Toole and Jack Reynor give performances unlike any other corrupt cops we've seen before. Poulter in particular, perfectly embodies what a person would do when he's on an absolute power trip. Poulter is a remarkable young talent with skills beyond his years. Equally impressive are Jacob Latimore and Algee Smith who play characters traumatized, physically and mentally affected by the incident. Rising star John Boyega plays an African American security guard who's unwilling to speak out but doing his best to keep anyone from getting shot. Some might see it as complicit or cowardice, he might see it as surviving.<br/><br/>By the way, even though the film's focus may be on this motel incident or on this Detroit riot, screenwriter Mark Goal manages to make it also be about these individuals, and so you fear for them every passing minute. The production design and the combining of archival footage and photos from that night make it seems like you've been transported to 1967, this is a film that pays attention to details and goes the distance and does whatever it can to convey what I think it tries to impart to the audience and that to me is the relevant theme indicating that if you think our criminal justice system is broken and messed up, if you think inequality is bad today, imagine the cruelty and the unfairness they had to live through some fifty years ago. We as a society have still got a long way to go.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"

"travishouze","8","16","49","31 July 2017"," ""Detroit"" is Haunting and Still Relevant
","The complication about making films where we as American's show our mistreatment of black people within our own country is that too often these are the few times we see a mostly group of people of color in Hollywood films. As these films have become more financially successful, we have been able to expose the world to lesser known stories (for example Hidden Figures and this film Detroit). <br/><br/>Detroit takes place in 1967 during the midst of the riots after a black owned Blind Pig bar where patrons were kicked out due to lack of liquor license and eventually leads to the towns people rioting and destroying the nearby businesses, even with tags of ""Soul Brother"" as a way to try to protect their black owned business. However, most of the film centers around the several young men and 2 women staying in the Algiers Motel as Carl Cooper had a starter pistol and shot in the air, as police mistaken it for a sniper, and begin to surround the Algiers and harass and intimidate the guests beyond recovery.<br/><br/>What the director Kathryn Bigelow (Zero Dark Thirty) is create a consistent tension when seeing the scene in the motel play out, and lets the viewer view helplessly as they see the psychological harassment these young people faced against police and even marshals not even stepping in. The acting is very solid across the board, particularly Algee Smith (Ralph Tresvant in The New Edition Story) and Will Pouter (We're the Millers & Maze Runner) as a racist cop that Will performs almost too hauntingly well and could argue a Best Supporting Actor award for his performance.<br/><br/>The film also includes Jacob Lawrence's Migration series, a 60 panel epic from the 1940's in a 3D esque animated way to explain to the audience how things got to where they area, however, I don't feel stylistically it was the right case for this kind of film narratively. The Jason Bourne-style shaky cam gets VERY jarring at times and hard to digest given there is very few moments when the cameras still, even in the quiet developmental periods. Also there's a scene early on involving Will's character with a decision he makes and how the characters handle his discipline that feels like a glaring flaw of how he could be allowed to progress in the story without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Detroit is not a easy film to watch, nor does it desire to be. While it can serve for a good introduction for people who never heard of the riots, the film was better titled Algiers Motel as the riots is more of the backdrop and less of a history lesson."

","While sitting through the new film, Detroit about the Detroit riots from 50 years ago and also what happened afterwards at The Algiers Motel, which could be described in no other terms than extreme police corruption, intimidation as well as flat out abuse of power and racism, it left me pondering as I sat in my theatre seat about how exactly I would rate this new film in my review for it and what also I would say about it. The problem proves to be a perplexing one because as one who reviews films would know, you basically have to review a film on a number of different levels and looking at several sections of criteria and merits within the film to give the film a proper rating and overall review. If, I was to look at this new film as someone who is overall judging the technical achievements, or faults within it when it comes to things such as direction, writing, cinematography, acting and just overall how this new movie was made I have to say with great and precise determination and praise that it far excels in each and every one of these levels of craft and overall filmmaking. There really is no weak link here because everything on a technical as well as skilled level is just done so well here and everyone both in front of and behind the camera has achieved true greatness with this film and I think however you felt about the film after you came out of viewing it, I think few people could say that it was poorly made, or even the least bit amateurish because nothing could be farther from the truth. It is probably the most skilled and polished piece of work I have seen thus far this year as far as sheer craft, technical ability and overall filmmaking talent goes. So why am I hesitating and not just singing the film's praises repeatedly over and over? My main problem lies not so much with the film's subject matter, or what it is about, because even though I am sure that there was much fabricating and the writer and director took a certain amount of liberties when telling this true story and even within the end credits it admits that some, or maybe more than we think of what we saw was up to the writer and director involved because some things that would make the film more coherent, or just that much more effective as far as storytelling goes was added, or dare I say made up to make things a bit juicier, or probably the best word I can use here is 'shocking'. I realize that to make a film powerful and overall to have a great affect upon it's audiences you have to leave your viewers sometimes with strong emotions, or a sense that what they just saw was powerful, or moving, or whatever adjective best suits the film in question. This is a story that definitely needs to be told to shame both the police force and attitudes of the law enforcement in this particular situation, but also raise questions about one's own moral duties, or questioning inwardly about what we ourselves would do in these particular situations. To film a story like this, I realize that to capture it authentically you do need to show some violence and brutality up to a certain point as well as both scare and perhaps even provoke your audience into some kind of fear, or tension to really get the mood across about what you are displaying on screen. On the other hand, I felt that while this film needed to be forceful with it's approach that it crossed on my levels what is appropriate and after awhile the language as well as the violence seemed to not just border, but over engulf itself by being far too excessive with it's use of screen violence and language that at times it was not only a turn off, but also quite unsettling as well. I realize the filmmakers really wanted to pack a punch with this story and the overall product and they certainly achieved that, but perhaps going to this far an extent was not necessary in my opinion and I feel that in the meantime they are going to turn off many potential viewers of this film and may even cause more sensitive audience members to leave the theatre in disgust. I feel that to make a film effective you do not need to resort to these type of tactics to get a response from your audience and again here it feels excessive and almost like it was trying to attack and manipulate the audience. However as far as technical achievements go this far far surpassed all my expectations on that level, so I am giving it a perfect rating for that alone as well as the fact that this is a story that needs to be told even if it would have been just as effective, or preferable if they toned down the brutality a notch. Overall you be the judge, but be forewarned."

"dermobreen","9","8","21","6 August 2017"," A difficult film to watch and a lesson for today
","Time magazine described Kathryn Bigelow's 2008 film, The Hurt Locker as a ""near perfect film"". It's hard to disagree as it went on to win six Oscars including Best Picture and Best Screenplay for Mark Boal. Bigelow and Boal went on to collaborate again for 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, again receiving critical acclaim and one Oscar. So it was with excitement and goodwill that I went to see Detroit to see if the dynamic duo of Bigelow and Boal could work their magic again.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Detroit is a superb piece of story-telling with incredible editing by William Goldberg who picked up the Best Editing Oscar for 2012's Argo. One often forgets how an editor can influence a film; it's feel, look, pacing, etc. We know Goldberg is no stranger to action, tense editing plus the interweaving of actuality in to his editing. For Detroit, he scores again. Forgive me for focusing on editing, but for me, it was one of the successes of the film and should not be underestimated or under-appreciated. This is a strong contender for another Oscar for Goldberg.<br/><br/>Based on actual events and people, the film tells the story of how a police raid on an after-hours party in Detroit in 1967 resulted in one of the largest race riots in United States history. The story is centred around the Algiers Motel incident, which occurred on July 25, 1967, during the racially charged 12th Street Riot. It involves the death of three black men and the brutal beatings of nine other people: seven black men and two white women. Fro the initial police raid through the build-up of the riots and the looting, to the actual events at the Algiers motel, to the subsequent charging and trial of three police officers, their acquittal and the after effects on the lives of the key characters, this is a troy that needed to be told. It is painful, nay difficult to watch in places. Bigelow does not shy away from putting the heart-wrenching, visceral brutality and naked racism right in front of our faces.<br/><br/>John Boyega, keen to shed any hint of Star Wars typecasting, gives a powerful, if muted performance as a local security guard who gets embroiled in the events at the Algiers Motel. He goes from advocate to helpless bystander and ultimate patsy, upon whom the Detroit police try to place the blame for the murders carried out by their own officers. It is a measured performance and identifies him as a singular acting talent of a new generation.<br/><br/>Anthony Mackie also gives a stand-out performance. Known for playing Falcon in the Marvel films: Avengers, Capt America: Civil War, etc. I had placed him in a box of competent but not an actor of note or substance. I was wrong. His performance here is worthy of a supporting actor nod at next year's Oscars.<br/><br/>English actor, Will Poulter plays the villain of the film, if there is such a thing in a city so demonstrably racist. Poulter's unhinged performance is magnificent as he unashamedly displays his racist attitudes, through his brutality and subjugation of the victims in the Algiers Motel, right up to his realisation he may have over-stepped the mark and his subsequent attempts at cover-up is the locus of the film. Poulter carries it off and Bigelow's close-ups of him as he displays his bigotry are breathtaking.<br/><br/>I could write a lot more about this film: it's cast and crew, the plot, the pacing, the moral but I will, uncharacteristically, leave it there except to say that it is a difficult film to watch, but necessary. In these sexist, misogynistic, racist, Trumpian times, films like this deserve to be shown to everyone, nay everyone should be made watch and feel uncomfortable.<br/><br/>A staggering film. 4.5 out of 5. My highest rating so far this year."

","Another of the ""outraged"" African-American driven films that are wildly overpraised... I guess the story is an important one (even though things like this, especially at the time portrayed in the film, happened frequently everyday... all over the world, not just in downtown Detroit)... so it would follow that the story deserved a much better screenplay then the one this film received.<br/><br/>It wasn't terrible... just boring... lifeless and drab.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I may agree with that... often in cases like these, the team of cops were ready and prepared to deny basic rights and inflict serious violence (usually with impunity) to victims such as these. At the same time, I'm a little surprised that the film shows the reason the cops showed up to begin with... one of the victims recklessly (and idiotically) fires an extremely loud cap-gun out the window, where teams of cops and army (the presence due to martial law being declared) would obviously hear it and respond. It almost gives credence to the actions of the cops.<br/><br/>What irks me most is the pretentiousness of the film... it has the feel of Kathryn Bigelow (and the others involved) trying to compare this travesty/tragedy to ""The Passion Of Christ"" (the story in general, not the film)... but that story has incredible ""Human Condition"" life-lessons, while ""Detroit"" feels more like a random act of police brutality that I'm sure felt more like an ""everyday occurrence"" then a ""world changing travesty""<br/><br/>Overall, a decent film... but should have been a lot better."

","""Detroit,"" is based on the true story of the 1967 12th Street Riots and Algiers Hotel Incident in Detroit and is brought to us by the writing/directing team of Mark Boal and Katheryn Bigolow, who brought us ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" two admittedly overrated movies but two that are still very good in their own right. If there was a team to adapt this true story this is the team to do it. ""Detroit,"" isn't the best of the trio, nor is it the best movie of the year, but it is up there in my top ten.<br/><br/>The performances were really good in this movie. John Boyega gives another really great performance in the movie, as Star Wars has really launched him into stardom and he continues to shine in everything he has been in. Anthony Mackie was also really good in his short amount of screen time, as he has been good in all his other previous performances as well. The standout here is Will Poulter as the head police officer trying to ""control"" the situation in the hotel, and my god, was his performance Oscar worthy. He captured evil, vile, vicious, and violent nature of his character who is a total racist prick. After seeing him in a handful of other movies, i really made nothing of his acting talent but the guy has a strong potential, and easily gave one of my favorite performances of the year (though I DO NOT condone anything his character did). <br/><br/>The entire second act of this movie, an hour long sequence inside the Algiers Motel, was one of the most intense, gut-wrenching, shocking, and haunting things I have ever seen. Even though there isn't much in the way of character development for this film, you really feel for the characters regardless. It is a terrible situation that these victims were put into, and it makes you disgusted as a human being to watch another human being do this to another human being. It speaks volumes about the consequences of racism not only in past society, but in today's society as well. <br/><br/>The minimal musical score and camera-work really add to the realism of the entire situation and gives the viewer the sense that they are right there, watching the situation unfold right before their eyes, unable to do anything to prevent the said events from happening. It's harrowing, dark and disturbing. The camera work is all hand-held, and the editing is pristine that when the camera starts to get shaky it is edited in a way where you can still understand what is going on, similar to the style of filming in ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty."" For almost the entirety of the runtime, there is no musical score. <br/><br/>The first act felt like it could have been a tad shorter, but at the same time it provided background for those viewers, like myself, who were unfamiliar with the situation so that viewers could get a better sense of what was happening in the city of Detroit at the time.<br/><br/>My only major complaint with the movie is that it feels a little too dragged out at the end. It has the ""Return Of The King"" ending, and could've honestly been 15 or 20 minutes shorter. <br/><br/>This is a movie that impacted me deeply, made me disgusted as a human being that racism was and still is a prominent problem in society today. It was a dark and disturbing portrait of a terrible moment in American history. this is a movie that will spark conversations about the entire situation and the consequences of racism long after credits, in a manner similar to how ""American History X"" made you think after the credits.<br/><br/>I am going to give ""Detroit"" an A.<br/><br/>For a further in depth analysis of the film check out my review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAIMbghP7BA"

","I was a child during the hell on earth Detroit summer of 1967. I don't remember it. Acclaimed Director Kathryn Bigelow has done one helluva job recreating the powder keg that exploded over a half century ago in the based-on-actual-events drama ""Detroit"". <br/><br/>It is profoundly difficult to process that a human being could be as recklessly racist as these rogue cops are. Will Poulter is particularly chilling as the brazen ring leader. That these white officers of the law could treat mostly black suspects as lives that scarcely matter is sickening. <br/><br/>Yet, as the disturbing courtroom scenes reveal toward the end of the film, how do we know?"
"JasonR77","10","7","20","4 December 2017"," Don't believe in white privilege?
","Don't believe? Don't think that racially motivated police violence is a thing? Then open your eyes and see this movie. White cops terrorizing black civilians has been a problem for decades, not just with Rodney King, not just the incidents that have flooded social media since Trayvon Martin. This sort of thing is embedded in America's history.<br/><br/>I am a native of Detroit, and even I had never understood the severity of this incident, and the depths of racism within the Detroit Police Department back then. Real life incidents in the modern south mirror exactly this sort of situation. Each of the officers involved in this situation was acquitted multiple times, and walk free to this day.<br/><br/>Is that justice? In many ways, the timeliness of this movie makes these modern incidents impossible to ignore in a discussion of what it depicts. Justice is not seen for victims. They suffer and die and have no recourse.<br/><br/>And as is seen in this film, there are no heroes. There's nobody standing up for the victims in the Algiers. There's nobody walking in to save them from the oppression they're facing. There's only the cops wielding their power with impunity, vengeance ahead of justice. Anthony Mackie and John Boyega play two tremendous pop-culture heroes, but neither one of them is rising up to stop the madness in this film, because it didn't happen. Only other situations saved these people from further embarrassment, injury and death.<br/><br/>The film is buoyed by amazing performances from its principal actors, and under Bigelow's stark, realistic direction, we can see the gritty hours of danger that these people lived through, and can empathize with those who had to endure it.<br/><br/>It is a hard film, a difficult subject to tackle for a crew, and even for the audience to watch, as it is easy to become uncomfortable watching these events, knowing they really happened. It is almost like watching the SS terrorizing Jews in Nazi Germany. But it is a viewing that should be undertaken, because the understanding and clarity that a viewer can get out of it can change a person's entire perspective on race and police violence.<br/><br/>Will this movie change he country? Probably not. But if it opens even a few eyes to what our society is and has been, its job will be done."
"jadepietro","10","8","24","5 August 2017"," Law and Disorder
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: A- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Kathryn Bigalow creates a searing docudrama about racial unrest in America.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The Detroit riots of 1967 serve as the backdrop for a vicious attack on some party-goers by some police officers.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: We see it on the news...police officers being secretly photographed using excessive force to arrest a possible lawbreaker, or the opposite viewpoint, an average citizen choosing a violent act of aggression against the police force. It's seems to be an everyday occurrence in our 21st century. Hate speech and violent actions are rampant these days, and with that comes the issue of poverty, crime, and racism underscoring the rationale. 50 years ago, that same savage behavior happened sporadically, or at least, not to our knowledge in this age of social media. Intense, manipulative, and uncompromising in its vision of racial unrest in America, Kathryn Bigelow's film, Detroit, is a harrowing look into our nation's class divide.'<br/><br/>Just as Ava's DuVernay's epic 2015 film, Selma, looked to the past to show our present, so does this equally fine film. Yes, there will be a backlash against the film's liberal bias, or its ugly view of police brutality, or the fact that a white female director has chosen to tell this tale. But those are smoke and mirrors deflecting the real message of the film. Its social conscience prevails, even if its story is told in black and white (or black vs. white), with little gray to be seen. Both films show that black lives rarely mattered during the turbulent sixties and not much has changed with law enforcement or the court system from then to now. And that is the most telling fact, sadly proving that history continues to repeat itself.<br/><br/>A city is a microcosm of its inhabitants. Using the Detroit riots of 1967 as its backdrop, this docudrama incorporates real life characters and events to convey its human drama. As the film begins, it's summer in the city. Temperatures are hot with no relief in sight. The police raid an unlicensed bar and its patrons are being ridiculed and threatened. A rowdy crowd gathers to watch the proceedings and a mob scene erupts in violence. The riots begin and grow over three nights. National guard troops are called in to ""calm"" the protesters. <br/><br/>In Mark Boab's exceptional screenplay, we focus on a human drama that tragically plays out during one of those nights: In a small hotel room, some friends gather to party and forget about the turmoil that surrounds them. Stereotypes abound. The angry young Negro. The bigoted cop. The righteous African-American police officer being falsely accused (John Botega, being the heart and soul of the film). All are thrown into this melting pot called America and the hatred and prejudice boils over in the most unsettling of ways. A starter pistol goes off, bringing the police to the premises. Lead by a sadistic officer named Krauss (a menacing Will Poulter), the stage is now set for repeated acts of inhumanity and sadism.<br/><br/>This hostage situation sequence, which becomes the riveting section of the film, includes scenes of psychological torture and brutal violence which go on for too long, making the film squirm-inducing and quite disturbing to watch. This confrontational scene is in-your-face cinema verite that engulfs the moviegoer to witness acts of cruelty that go unpunished. This is serious filmmaking about an all-too-serious subject, and the director never shies away from the events, although she does take some creative leeway with the facts to dramatize her narrative.<br/><br/>Ms. Bigalow's direction is brilliant. She layers her narrative with such clarity and insight, establishing the incident and creating many memorable characters that are caught in the crossfire. She mixes newsreel footage with her reenactments of the crimes in such a subtle and forceful way. Production design by Jeremy Hindle, Barry Ackroyd's photography, and the editing by William Goldenberg and Harry Yoon captures these grim times vividly. The filmmakers create a realistic war zone and fill it with images that depict the conflict between races<br/><br/>The film has one of the best ensembles of the year. Algee Green, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, and Anthony Mackie are terrific. Also providing excellent support are Hannah Murray, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, and Kaitlyn Dever. The aforementioned Mr. Botega and Mr. Poulter are outstanding in their roles and should be garner many well-earned accolades this award season.<br/><br/>Detroit parallels a nation at war with itself, and though the message is often preachy and overstates its position too often, the overall impact is thought-provoking if disheartening. Ms. Bigalow's tale of law and disorder will upset and stun you, but it just might open up a needed discussion about the taboo subject of racism in America that is still infecting our country today...50 years later."
"joshbarton15","8","7","21","9 August 2017"," Start and finish are good but the middle act is sensational
","Racial tension always has the potential to reach boiling point and Hollywood hasn't shied away from depicting such a thing happening over the years in films such as Do the Right Thing and Selma, neither being afraid to show just how ugly things can get when they go beyond the boiling point, often making for quite tough viewing. Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit is certainly a film that shares a lot of similarities with those two films.<br/><br/>The Detroit riots led to days of violent public disorder back in July 1967, leaving parts of the city destroyed. During the riots, three African American men were murdered at the Algiers Motel. <br/><br/>Bigelow's film opens with an animated prologue that explains the ethnic situation of Detroit in 1967 and wastes no time by getting straight into the matter of how the riots broke out. It's from here that Detroit took me by surprise a little, Bigelow choosing to spend the opening act of the film stringing together a number of sequences depicting crowd violence and police brutality, filmed almost in a documentary style. <br/><br/>It feels as if there is no real narrative at this point however, I do like how it gives some context into how bad things got in the city throughout the riots. We are introduced to a number of characters but these introductions aren't drawn out at all, purposefully by Bigelow as she wants to focus more on the violence on the streets.<br/><br/>Then, suddenly, the characters we've had brief introductions to are thrust together in difficult circumstances and this is where both Detroit and Bigelow are at their best. The central act of Detroit takes place within the Algiers Motel and it makes for one of the most intense and brutal sequences of film so far this year, the aforementioned tough viewing well and truly coming into effect. It's a bit of shame that what comes before and after doesn't feel of the same standard though otherwise we'd be talking about film of the year material right here.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Detroit sees two exciting young British actors work together in John Boyega and Will Poulter however, the writing doesn't really allow both men to get a chance to shine. On one hand, Poulter is absolutely brilliant as Philip Krauss, a Detroit policeman who uses and abuses his position of authority to intimidate and humiliate those he comes across in the Algiers Motel, in a performance that will leave you seething with rage. Then there's Boyega as Melvin Dismukes, a security guard who tries to defuse the situation, who feels rather wasted which is annoying because Boyega is such a talented actor. He just doesn't really get anything to sink his teeth into, Poulter instead revelling in the chance to play such a vile character.<br/><br/>Bigelow's Detroit is an important film, elevated by a tight central act, that feels a little underwritten in other places compared to her other work. That being said, it's still a very good film that you should see, even if you just go to witness Will Poulter's superb performance."

","​'DETROIT' - 2017<br/><br/>Directed by Kathryn Bigelow <br/><br/>Starring John Boyega, Will Poulter and Algee Smith<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​In the summer of 1967, rioting and civil unrest starts to tear apart the city of Detroit. Two days later, a report of gunshots prompts the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Army National Guard to search and seize an annex of the nearby Algiers Motel. Several policemen start to flout procedure by forcefully and viciously interrogating guests to get a confession. By the end of the night, three unarmed men are gunned down while several others are brutally beaten.<br/><br/>It's hard to review a film that is so harrowing and depressing. Such a barbaric and disgusting event requires the utmost of a care and compassion and empathy, and I think that Bigelow nails it. Detroit is such a hard to watch and upsetting film, that I couldn't watch it multiple times but that shouldn't represent the quality. It is a truly amazing movie that deserves the Oscar buzz it's getting. I definitely recommend it, just be preferred to squirm. <br/><br/>Representing such a tale on screen in a semi-entertaining way(I don't mean fun) while simultaneously being respectful and poetic to the night's events is a very difficult task. And honestly, the movie may have worked better as simply a documentary. But we got a movie, and it was really good so I'm not complaining. The story for this movie is a very harsh and upsetting one, and Bigalow/the writers deal with it in the most perfect way possible. I agree with the criticism that they don't delve into WHY it happened, but I'm just happy this event was brought to modern day audiences, and those of us in the UK, who didn't study this event(not myself but others I know). Great movies that are hard to watch are things of rarity. I'm not talking about 'Saw' or whatever, that's just disgusting and hard to watch. I'm talking films that make you uncomfortable for watching them purely because of the sadness and barbaric nature of the events. That sums this movie up. I rarely squirm or avert my eyes in a film like this but for sequences in this movie, I found it challenging to not do so. Watching is difficult for points in this movie but I think that should merely serve as credit for what Bigalow has created. <br/><br/>Now, for the performances. This movie is an ensemble cast and every single main performer does a fantastic job. Most notably, however, would probably include the likes of John Boyega, Anthony Mackie, Will Pouler and Algee Smith. While every single actor does an amazing job and draws you deeper into the world(that is unfortunately ours) that Bigalow has 'created', these four were the main ones that stood out and were memorable for me after the movie had gone of. <br/><br/>This is pretty much the first movie I've seen that features Boyega(because I don't like Star Wars. This review'll get marked down purely for this comment I guarantee it) and after seeing him perform, I'm shocked he's not in more movies. The man was excellent in this movie. <br/><br/>Anthony Mackie, who is perhaps most well known as 'Falcon' from the MCU, shows a different side of him that I hadn't seen before and does it masterfully. He provides such a deep and harrowing performance that I very much so hope that he appears in more dramatic roles, and doesn't get stuck in a 'Goofy sidekick' typecast. <br/><br/>Will Poulter, formerly known as 'Eye Brows Kid', is also in this movie as a corrupt cop. And corrupt is the key word. Poulter is despicable, disgusting and destructive in his role as Krauss, and that really just shows how remarkable the performance is. I hated this guy from second one and he doesn't disappoint that initial expectation all the way through the 2 hour run time.<br/><br/>And then there is Algee Smith. The performance Smith gave was exceptional. I mean exceptional. The man stood out among everyone else and delivered a powerful performance. I commend the performance and truly believe that he should be given a round of applause because he was so, so good in this film. <br/><br/>The cinematography and editing are also excellent in this movie. It is a very good looking movie. I love the grittiness and grimness that make it feel like a dystopian future, which is what it was for African-Americans at the time. I do love how Bigalow has directed this movie.<br/><br/>As for flaws, I'll say that the opening third of this movie drags on way too long and is very dull. The setup for this film is done for what feels like an eternity and they REALLY could have cut chunks of it out. That is honestly my only flaw with the movie because, apart from that, it is pretty great. I can definitely recommend it but be prepared to feel uncomfortable. It's not for the faint of heart. I'll rate Detroit 9/10."
"makleen2","9","6","18","7 August 2017"," A Gripping Historical Drama
","Detroit (2017), written by Mark Boal and directed by Kathryn Bigelow, dramatically recounts an incident in which three black men were allegedly murdered by police at the Algiers Motel during the 1967 Detroit Riot. Detroit grabs you and never lets go. Unfortunately, its subject matter might be a little too weighty for summer movie audiences. Bigelow, whose other films include The Hurt Locker (2008), K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), and Zero Dark Thirty (2012), set out to make a film critical of white privilege, so certain elements have been changed to conform to this perspective. In some ways the actual events were much worse than depicted.<br/><br/>First, some context. In 1950, Detroit was a diverse, prosperous, and culturally significant metropolis of 1.85 million people. It was arguably among the greatest cities in the United States. By 1967, Detroit was 40 percent African American, but its police force was 95 percent white. Migration to the suburbs had already caused significant population decline. The 1967 Detroit Riot (also known as the 12th Street Riot) began around 3:15 a.m. Sunday, July 23, 1967, after police raided an illegal after hours party in the office of the United Community League for Civic Action at 9125 12th Street.<br/><br/>The riot lasted five days, ending on July 27. Michigan Governor George W. Romney sent in the National Guard and President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions to help restore order. When the dust settled, 43 people were dead, 1,189 injured (including 493 police, firefighters, and National Guard members), and 7,231 arrested. 2,509 stores were looted or burned, with an economic loss estimated at $40 to $45 million.<br/><br/>Three men, Aubrey Pollard (Nathan Davis Jr.), 19, Carl Cooper (Jason Mitchell), 17, and Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore), 18, were killed at an annex of the Algiers Motel, 8301 Woodward Avenue. Pollard was killed by Detroit Police Officer Ronald August (""Demens"" – Jack Reynor), Temple was killed by Detroit Police Officer Robert Paille (""Flynn"" – Ben O'Toole), and Cooper's murderer remains unknown. Police officers involved in the incident were acquitted by reason of self defense at trial, so their names were changed for the film.<br/><br/>Two 18-year-old white women, Karen Malloy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Juli Hysell (Hannah Murray), were also present at the Algiers Motel that night. Detroit shows Officer Flynn accidentally tear off Juli's minidress just before releasing the two into National Guard custody. In reality, according to John Hersey, author of The Algiers Motel Incident (1968), police officers stripped both women naked and called them ""n----r lovers."" Filmmakers probably changed this scene in order to show Karen and Juli being given preferential treatment at the hands of white police officers.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn Patrolman Philip Krauss, played by Will Poulter, is a fictional ""amalgamate"" character (based on several people). Poulter, who played Kenny Rossmore in We're the Millers (2013), disappears into this role. Everything from his hairstyle to his facial expressions makes him look like he stepped off the pages of a mid-20th century yearbook, as if the bully from A Christmas Story (1983) grew up and became a racist cop. Chilling.<br/><br/>Powerful images dominate the film. When a security guard named Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) is taken into an interrogation room, you can see a handcuff dangling from a pipe and a discolored stain on the wall at the same level as his head. The movie doesn't have to show violent interrogations took place–all it needs is this one brutal image. Boyega has been criticized as playing a flat, emotionless character, but I think Melvin was just a good guy trying to survive an incredibly dangerous situation. Real-life Melvin Dismukes told Variety the movie is 99.5 percent accurate according to his recollection.<br/><br/>While the filmmaking here is masterful, its message is less encouraging. At the end, Detroit reinforces the negative stereotype that being successful is somehow less authentic for African Americans. After the incident at the motel, Larry Reed (Algee Smith), member of soul music group The Dramatics, leaves the band after refusing to perform for white audiences (the United States was 88 percent white in 1967). Instead, he finds solace in performing worship music at a local all-black church. While there's nothing wrong with community and religious service, it hints the answer to Detroit's racial animosity is to withdraw further into racially segregated communities. We all know the tragic end of that story.<br/><br/>Despite some creative license with characters, events, and dialog, Detroit feels authentic. The settings, dress, and documentary style transport you back to that time, and not in a clichéd, feel-good way. Although Detroit doesn't disguise its message, it isn't entirely one-sided, showing the destructiveness of the mob and the efforts of some white policemen and authority figures try to combat the excesses of racist officers. It's by far the best historic drama of 2017."

","DETROIT (2017) *** 1/2 John Boyega, Will Poulter, Algee Smith, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, Hannah Murray, Jack Reynor, Katilyn Dever, Ben O'Toole, John Krasinski, Anthony Mackie, Nathan Davis Jr. Compelling and all too relevant historical account of the 1967 race riots in the US, namely in the inferno of the titular city where one hellacious night became a nightmare for a small group of hoteliers caught up in madness involving the local police and the Michigan National Guard resulting in the murder of three young men. Filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow give it her all in vividly recalling the era's look, feel and eliciting some truly incredible performances from her relatively-unknown young cast running the gamut of emotions and turmoil amidst the heated strife between the ensuing chaos and inner hatred exploding on the city's streets to no end in sight. Screenwriter Mark Boal's difficult chore of balancing fact from fiction finds the right chord with well-developed characters and plotting as the endless evening unravels."
"krocheav","4","3","7","31 October 2018"," Detriot - An Unpleasant Revisitation
","Director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal's 'Detroit' is a gruelling watch, not just for the fact it's based on shockingly violent, and tragic events in modern USA history but because the screenplay interferes with certain facts for the sake of 'entertainment'. While it may be the screenwriters task to 'dress-up' the content of a movie it's not their task to pad it out with violent falsehoods till it begins to lose sight of its fact-based situation. Many scenes tend to play out as unnecessary, and often they are. The main story line focuses on the deadly 1967 race riots that already feature enough tension and brutality to sustain viewer concern.<br/><br/>It's uncertain what moviemakers feel they can add to these terrible events decades later - within an artificial re-enactment (maybe a quality documentary would have been a better medium?) But, it's doubtful any good might come from this re-hashing of yesterday's hatreds - especially given the present climate of extreme 'identity politics' causing division between all races - this in itself, comes across as exploitative 'activism' pushing suspect negative agendas. Sometimes, revisiting certain ugly historical events can offer a moral compass - even giving us warnings signs if they are thoughtfully analysed (as with 'The Free State Of Jones' in '16) - While others, simply fuel more contempt and distrust, feeding increased hatred. Looking at the financial returns for this movie, its possible many prospective patrons may have had the wisdom to see this offering as unfortunately, one of the latter variety."
"markgorman","9","6","19","22 September 2017"," Kathryn Bigelow is on a roll. Three classics in a row. This may be the best.
","It's fair to say that Kathryn Bigelow is on a roll.<br/><br/>Her last three movies (Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and now Detroit) have been gut busting horror shows about the human condition.<br/><br/>I love that Kathryn Bigelow sits in the 'male' directors' chair. I love hat she must be and should be a feminist icon, because she does the sort of movies that she makes much better than most men make them.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow likes an explosion, a gun, a death. But her female perspective on this raises it from guts and gory/glory into something higher. Something more profound.<br/><br/>Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker both took on war as the subject matter. This does too, but it's the war of the races. The war of oppression by white men upon black in the Summer of Love.<br/><br/>Ironic, because this is a film about hate. Racism. Supremacy.<br/><br/>It opens with a short animation that perfectly encapsulates America's fundamental tic. The thing that won't go away. The displacement of race. From the displacement of American Indians to the displacement of Africans to the slave plantations of the Deep South and latterly their displacement into the Northern industrial cities like Detroit.<br/><br/>This displacement, in fact, displaces the white ruling class into the suburbs and that's the start of deep tension and resentment.<br/><br/>We have witnessed this in the UK too, as gentrification of once unfashionable districts has displaced both black and white working classes into modern day ghettos. And it ain't stopping any day soon.<br/><br/>What Bigelow achieves with this movie is a political calling cry to any liberal minded decent human being, regardless of colour or creed. It vilifies the atrocious white police force of late sixties Detroit (Yet, I don't think Detroit itself was much different from other places – there were riots in Harlem for instance and we all know about 1980's LA).<br/><br/>She creates an almost documentary feel that is more 4D than any of the 4D Sh!t you'll see in multiplexes. Because this is for real.<br/><br/>Apart from the relatively well known John Botega (brilliant thank you) her massive ensemble cast is star-free. That's kinda how she rolls.<br/><br/>But each and every one of the 20 or so leads (yes 20) will have had life-affirming, and early career defining, roles in this epic.<br/><br/>But one stands out above all else in this majestic movie.<br/><br/>Will Poulter.<br/><br/>The actual devil incarnate.<br/><br/>Were he real, not an actor, he should rot in hell. But he's only an actor and his performance is surely Oscar worthy. You simply despise this evil racist bastard. And he is unflinching in his evilness. The smirk at the end of the movie almost gets you out of your seat.<br/><br/>This is a truly great movie. A movie that should be syllabus material on any High School history course.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow and her team (especially writer Mark Boal) deserve all the awards that this movie will hopefully receive."

"CineMuseFilms","6","4","11","15 November 2017"," gripping drama but poor history of the Detroit riots
","All filmmaking is exploitative. Whether it is fair or not will depend on many things, one of which is the respect shown for the film's subject matter. Many movies are marketed as fact-based but really only exploit history to create entertainment. This is the case with Detroit (2017): a gripping drama but a poor historical account of the worst public disorder in the US since the Civil War.<br/><br/>Understanding the broader context is important. The Detroit race riots were part of a national wave of civil unrest that swept America in 'The Long Hot Summer of 1967'. There were 159 documented riots across a nation mired in a long history of slavery and systemic discrimination against its African American population. Detroit (2017) compresses the painful history of American racism into a few minutes of simplistic animation followed by archival footage of widespread racial unrest, burning buildings, mass protests, and police confrontations. Most of the two and a half-hour film then presents a prolonged dramatisation of a single episode of police brutality that occurred after the raids that triggered the riots.<br/><br/>The early part of the film shows a number of sub-stories coming together as a result of the raids. In the midst of the chaos a group of fleeing African Americans are detained and interrogated in the Algiers Hotel after what was believed to be sniper fire on police and national guards. The handful of police are led by officer Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) who is already under threat of a murder charge after shooting a looter. He is sadistic in his methods. The suspects are kept facing a wall while one by one he applies terror tactics to make them inform on the so-called sniper, even staging fake killings to maximise panic. It is an agonisingly long and repetitive process, during which deliberate and accidental fatalities occur. The film concludes with a brief account of the courtroom drama in which the white officers face a white jury for a predictable outcome.<br/><br/>Viewers hoping for a balanced picture of the Detroit race riots of '67 are unlikely to be satisfied. Instead of looking at the climate of hatred for black people, the film presents a 'bad-apple' account of one psychotic policeman with a taste for torture. The portrait of cruelty is performed to perfection. Poulter fills the role with callous indifference to pain or fear and it is his cold- blooded performance that drives the tension curve to its inconclusive finale. While there are many strong performances by others, this is virtually a one-man tour-de-force portrait of right- wing white supremacy.<br/><br/>This film is entertaining if you have a taste for prolonged violence. Others may feel that the Detroit riots are being exploited and that racism deserves more respect than a tale of a lone psychotic. A redeeming feature is its timing. It arrives half a century after the depicted events, while alt-right forces of the world are again on the march. Detroit reminds us how ugly civilisation can be."
"CinePendejo","6","4","11","8 August 2017"," Incredibly solid but frustratingly narrow
","DETROIT is one of those movies so hurtful to critique harshly that I almost wouldn't bother and have other sites to take my word instead. On the one hand, I would love to see a movie - specifically a button-pushing procedural about the 12th Street Riots and the Algiers Motel incident - that slams subtle racism, abusive authority, and the overall spectrum of ignorant white man that continues to swarm our great country under the election of Drumpf. But on the other, it led me to wonder how much my wishes, and ultimately the final film, would compromise in the process. It was until I finally conclude that, no matter how much it seems ""right"", my aspirations feel misguided. In simpler terms, DETROIT is an expertly crafted, visceral, and well-intentioned movie that doesn't do much justice. It's a film that shows no mercy in depicting the unforgivable acts upon the black people that may still persist to this day without considering the proper perspective of the blacks beyond the surface level and the overdone.<br/><br/>But before I get ahead of myself, lets dig deep in the positives. For one thing, its NOT mainly an action war movie set in the riots. Director Kathryn Bigelow understands that the riots themselves was anything but ""thrilling spectacle"" so it's played sparse, gritty, and grounded. Thanks to Bigelows additional talent of pseudo-veritee, each scene with the riots and the Motel incident feels and looks real and unflinching. Almost feeling like a torture montage, we witness every hit, every shot, every scream, and every shed of tear in each frame as if we are in the moment ourselves. Along with the shockingly great talent on hand to portray these roles, its probably one of the most harrowing film I've seen since DUNKIRK.<br/><br/>Which ultimately disappoints me to say that the rest of the film feels too narrow and underdeveloped. First off, the black characters are deeply underdeveloped. As I watched the, admittedly horrifying, almost repetitive Motown scene in the second act, I noticed a weird overemphasis on developing the supposed white asshole cops rather than the suffering blacks. Sure they may have affected family members and backstories that get wrapped up rather neatly, but they only serve to both witness and endure the harrowing pain among the systemic racism at the time. John Boyega's black police character does barely a thing in this movie, serving as a POV to all of this brutality without much insight. The actors playing a Motown band only once speak up against the matter, but never do anything beyond that. Meanwhile, all the white actors - like the otherwise revelatory Will Poulter as a complex cop - get to be both the menacing and the sympathetic characters with more agency. And to my money, considering how it ends in a depressing ending in which the bad guys get away with 3 murders and 9 abuse charges (shut up, it's not a spoiler. Look it up), that's a huge miscalculation. It winds up in the typical ""have its cake and eat it too"" scenarios that sadly renders the black people as passive martyrs rather than real people in their own f-ing movie.<br/><br/>There's a boatload of think pieces about whether white filmmakers have any right to depict other cultures without their mindset. And while I admittedly have no objective say on the matter – since I'm white/Hispanic and not black – I also know that there's a fine line simply by experience. When I see movies like SELMA, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, or the latest TV show masterpiece DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, I commend their efforts to delve into how much systemic racism strangles our social climate to this day. But what makes these special stems from growing beyond that, offering new insight to the issue that never sacrifices the identities or humanity of black people affected by it. And the secret to that comes from a full black perspective that feels appropriate to their stories. Not to discredit Bigelow's talent or ambition, but it's one thing to sucker punch this issue in hopes for a change, but its another to exploit black pain to wake up white people to do so.<br/><br/>Which is ultimately a shame because I can recall Bigelow doing much more than that. HURT LOCKER revolutionized our perception of war fatigue and the human condition during battle, ZERO DARK THIRTY was both a metatextual distillation of depleted post-9/11 American morale amongst multiple dead ends and the ultimate catharsis of the same. And let's not mention how f**king awesome POINT BREAK was. But Bigelow seems out of depth here. For all the hype and stupidly dense runtime, she cannot escape the ingrained distance from the proper way of telling this.<br/><br/>Overall, DETROIT isn't bad but it stops short of being great. The riots are nasty yet alive, the acting is magnificent, and it damn near rejects the otherwise tone-deaf war epic alternative by being more grounded. But it stops dead to reach more than that, thinking it could be the definitive movie to ""get people woke"" without noticing the dozen other movies that did it better. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, and I hope the otherwise dreadful Trump administration would promote others to stop meandering and do better.<br/><br/>Check out my letterboxd account for more reviews: http://boxd.it/k9td"

It tells the story of police brutality, racism and riots, all of which happened much too often during this time period. John plays a security guard that gets involved with local police, state police and the National Guard in a shooting incident that happened at the Algiers Motel-it was an eleven dollar a day motel so most of the clients were hookers or drug dealers. The local police-mostly white-had just raided a bar and arrested almost everyone there-mostly black. This led to riots throughout the city, which led to the Algiers incident. Will is the racist white police officer that leads the charge on the motel after hearing gun shots-he thinks it's a sniper-and rounds up the occupants-mostly black with 2 white females. Kaitlyn is one of the females. Anthony plays a returning war vet that was in the motel. If you are unfamiliar with the incident, it had several deaths, brutal police beatings and a trial. Oh yeah, they never found a gun. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 23 minutes. I don't think I would buy it on DVD.

"littleging12","9","4","12","11 October 2017"," American Horror Story: Detroit
","Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, Detroit, recounts the chaotic 1967 Detroit Riots as well as the following incidents at the Algiers Motel. To say the film is not for the faint of heart is a massive understatement. Detroit unapologetically personifies the horrors of racism, bigotry, and cruelty. From the opening frame to the last, Detroit is a masterclass of unnerving, riveting and downright horrifying cruelty. It's as important of a film as its cry out for change.<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigelow seems to have found her niche with real life dramatizations of American history. With this film, she reaches the heights of Paul Greengrass (Captain Phillips, United 93) in the art of creating tension and sustaining it. She masterfully captures the intensity, frustration, and chaos of the riots. The riots feel so tangible it's as if Kathryn Bigelow walked in on a riot and started filming. She displays the same skill with the Algiers scenes except with much more precision. The whole second act of the film is more terrifying, intense and horrific than most horror movies. It's so well done you don't even notice that it takes up the majority of the film's long runtime. Bigelow even keeps the film rolling through scenes (particularly at the end) where other directors may have stumbled. Bigelow, with Detroit, succeeds whereas Christopher Nolan, with Dunkirk, did not. Bigelow captures the tension early on and doesn't let it leave her grasp while Nolan undercut the tension and didn't get it back again due to his compulsive need for complexity, and incoherence.<br/><br/>Detroit may be a masterclass of tension but it also features an exceptional performance from Will Poulter. Will Poulter shines as the racist cop Krauss, and completely shatters his image of creepy virgin eyebrows kid from We're the Millers. From the get-go you just couldn't take your eyes off this monster. His unrelenting ferocity and devilish hatred towards his victims makes your skin crawl in fear. This is an excellent performance that deserves Oscar attention (though may not get it due to how controversial his character is). Another standout was Algee Smith who may make a name for himself, maybe even as a singer. John Boyega (Melvin Dismukes in the film) was good even though Mark Boal (the screenwriter) may have forgotten about him as Boyega just stood by as if he was a ghost. Another hiccup that the screenwriter never addressed was why didn't the civilians at the Algiers just blame the dead black guy (played by Jason Mitchell) for shooting at the police and hiding the gun, especially since he was the shooter. Maybe a case of don't talk to the police or they're honoring their dead friend, but some clarity to this would have been more appropriate. <br/><br/>Some of the biggest complaints about this film is that like The Passion of the Christ it focuses on the violence in favor of a deeper meaning. But the violence in Detroit and in The Passion both serve a purpose. They do not glorify their brutality but they show the audience the true horror of that brutality, and what had to be sacrificed for a greater change. Another popular gripe is that the film is historically inaccurate. The filmmakers even displayed a subtitle stating that they had to dramatize certain events and fill in the blanks since some things are still clouded in mystery. Even the real life Dismukes said in an interview that the film is 99.50% accurate. That statistic should also silence any haters calling this film SJW propaganda.<br/><br/>Detroit is an absolute must watch. It's THE best film of the year, thus far, and due to its relevance should be a definite Oscar contender. Kathryn Bigelow has made her best movie here and has established herself as one of Hollywood's most prized directors."

","As a dark account of a tragic and cruel set of events during the race riots of Detroit in 1967, Detroit offers a terrifying view of the harsh reality of racism in the police force and the effects of it felt by the black community. The gunshots are loud; the cries and screams are distinct and piercing; the blood flows, as vindictive Will Poulter along with his twisted sidekicks murders and abuses innocent men and women. With desperation and fear honestly painted on the faces of both white and black actors, this is a harsh and sobering film, detailing the shocking events and crimes committed in a dark period of the US' history."
"paulmcuomo","8","4","12","30 August 2017"," A lot of positives from one of the best films of the year (so far)
","Detroit is the latest in Kathryn Bigelow's unofficial ""trilogy"" into real world crime/war stories, that she has produced alongside screenwriter Mark Boal, alongside The Hurt Locker, which I didn't see but hear amazing things about, and Zero Dark Thirty, which I really enjoyed for its scope, intensity and bittersweet conclusion.<br/><br/>Detroit, unlike those films, is very much shot in a documentary format and look i.e. with the way the frames come up with the filters, the shaky cam kind of style, and the very continuing shots that obviously go on for a long time without stopping. I've always loved this about Bigelow - she's very much the American, female Paul Greengrass when it comes to this.<br/><br/>In terms of the cast, the film has very much an ensemble feel, with not really one central character; we follow the actions on the night by Desmukes, a security guard played by John Boyega, a soul and R&B singer Larry Reed played by Algee Smith about how him and a friend took refuge at the Algiers Hotel on that night, and the actions of the Police Officers led by the brutal Phillip Klauss played by Will Poulter before, during and after the night. There are also really great and brilliant supporting bit roles by Anthony Mackie and Jason Mitchell, also with Hannah Murray among others.<br/><br/>This film, much like Nolan's Dunkirk, wastes no time in throwing you right into the havoc - in many ways you can say that this film is very structurally similar - just before the credits roll, you see a news scroll of all the events that happen over song, before a lingering close-up of one of the main character's faces, or as close to with an ensemble film. Also, like Dunkirk, the film is incredibly tense with its action and focus, and the way in which it very comfortably covers the whole battle/riot very continuously. The character's are a bit more spread thin than in Dunkirk, with the notable exceptions of Klauss and Reed, both of which I will talk about in a moment, but ultimately works in its favour. Where the film differs from Dunkirk, and by extension Zero Dark Thirty, is the unrelenting bleakness of the whole film; it's no secret that whilst no-one knows for sure the events that took place that night, it's well acknowledged that Police get away with the brutality that took place that night, and that those practices, whilst immoral and disencouraged, still do happen.<br/><br/>The cast is probably the films most obvious strength - no-one feels like a actor, even though they've been in Game of Thrones, The Avengers and Star Wars among others - and the continuousness of takes, really ramp up the threat level. My only complaint with the film in general, aside from an occasional lack of music, is that the lack of a properly POV character does make the film a bit too hard to invest in; it does have a villain, but not really a hero, although that may be symbolic of the fact that there isn't really a hero.<br/><br/>In terms of the characters, they are quite uniformly appealing, with the main two standouts being Algee Smith's portrayal of the R&B singer who loses his best friend on the same night that he witnesses some truly ugly stuff, and comes out of the event with his perception and personality altered, with a really great emotional through line of optimistic about his music career, to scared for his life, to anger over his friend's death and the subsequent lack of justice, to new found contentment in leading a church gospel band. It's a great performance, especially from an actor as new as him. And then there's Phillip Klauss, played by Will Poulter, who really is amazing in his. Klauss is such an interesting villain, in that overall, he is just a cop; a very violent, means-justifies-the-end type of cop, but he's still a very low rung officer. Poulter has kind of got a reputation for playing soft characters, such as his role in We're The Millers and The Revenant, but in this is great as his menace maintains, to the point you're gutted with his lack of comeuppance. Him and Smith are very much Best Supporting Actor contenders in my books. John Boyega is good, but to be honest he's not in enough of the film to really talk about.<br/><br/>This is an important movie, that talks of a contemporary topic, and remembers to be good. I really enjoyed this movie, so go and check it out."
"MOscarbradley","10","4","12","25 August 2017"," Bigelow's masterpiece
","I've said it before and sadly I have a feeling I'll be saying it until the day I die but there are times when I've felt ashamed to be white, ashamed to belong to a race that over the centuries have felt they are not only superior to people of other ethnic backgrounds but have a right to kill them as well. Racists may be in a minority but in the overall scheme of things they represent a large minority and rather than stand up to them, often a blind eye is turned. Silence, tragically, gives consent.<br/><br/>Watching ""Detroit"" I felt ashamed and at times I felt physically sick. I was upset and I was angry. Kathryn Bigelow's magnificent new film is not specifically about the Detroit riots that occurred 50 years ago; the riots form the backdrop to a film about one incident when three racist white police officers shot dead three Afro-Americans in a motel. It's a film that doesn't hide its anger; about as even-handed as Bigelow gets is in showing that, while the riots themselves were the direct result of racism, particularly on the part of the police, both sides were culpable in the outbreak of lawlessness that followed. But then Bigelow gets down to the business of showing just how one-sided the events that occurred at the motel were. The police, and one officer in particular, (Will Poulter in Oscar-worthy form), are clearly monsters and the victims wholly innocent. The National Guard are bystanders who don't want to get involved while John Boyega's black security guard is caught helplessly in the middle, (at one point he's described as an Uncle Tom; he doesn't object).<br/><br/>Tragically, ""Detroit"" is not about events that just happened 50 years ago but which have been happening throughout America on a regular basis ever since, so Bigelow can't be accused of simply opening up old wounds. Still, there will be people who will say she should have left well enough alone and will ask if we really need a movie like ""Detroit"" at the present time. Unfortunately I believe we do and until such time when this kind of racism is totally eradicated we will always need movies like ""Detroit"".<br/><br/>Will it draw an audience, both in America and internationally? Will the prize-givers award it with the Oscars it so richly deserves? In a just world, and we know this isn't, Bigelow, scenarist Mark Boal and cameraman Barry Ackroyd would all be honoured. In the end, of course, it hardly matters, (though I would like to see the film get the audience it deserves); that it was made at all speaks volumes and gives credence to mainstream American cinema. ""Detroit"" isn't just the best film of the year; it's also the most important."

","I saw this movie about a week ago, right after the events that took place in Charlottesville. I think that certainly added to the visceral and emotional reaction I had while watching Detroit. Bigelow made a really smart decision in containing and isolating the story. I thought this movie would be covering the entire Detroit riots, but instead it focuses on one individual experience. This allowed me to become very attached to these specific characters, and to feel the true weight of this one experience. And this one experience really does help define and give context to not only these riots, but to the formation of such things as the Black Lives Matter movement that is happening today. This was a really smart direction to take the story in, and it absolutely pays off. The performances are all fantastic. Algee Smith and Jacob Latimore are actors I'm not very familiar with, but they did excellent jobs leading this movie. I thought John Boyega would be the lead, and he's not. He takes a much more subdued role, but it works in that it allows Smith and Latimore to really shine. Boyega is good in this, but I don't think he was given enough to do for us to truly see just what he's capable of as an actor. I'm glad he's getting roles outside of Star Wars, but I still think we have yet to see the full extent of Boyega's acting capabilities..."

","Detroit (2017) is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, director of The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, and revolves around the Detroit riots in 1967. Tensions between white and blacks has reached an all-time high, and the film follows a hectic and violent incident between white police officers and black men at the Algires Motel one night during the riots.<br/><br/>Detroit is a bleak, depressing and brutal depiction of a group of racist police officers and how flawed the American judicial system was in the 60's. Kathryn Bigelow paints a nightmarish picture that grips you from beginning to end, it's intensity basically radiating from the screen. <br/><br/>All actors give 110% to their role, and praise has to be given to the main racist cop, played by Will Poulter. He plays the part excellently, and one can only imagine how difficult it was for him to act this way in front of the camera. Next to the cops, the black victims were also played flawlessly by a various cast. <br/><br/>The film begins at a brisk pace, thrusting you right into the brutality of the impending riots. However, the majority of the film is set in the Algiers Motel, telling the violent incident in graphic detail. The film never had me bored; however, the run time is definitely its main flaw. <br/><br/>The film drags on for far too long. There are many moments where I thought it was going to end, but it continued to run. Not saying the subsequent scenes were bad, but the film had me checking my watch a few times towards the beginning of the third act. <br/><br/>Despite its overdrawn length, Detroit still provides a very down-to-earth and intense experience, definitely worth seeing."

","In short, the film was far from a masterpiece. With that being said, it certainly contained an phenomenal amount of tension throughout, and managed to stop my eyes from wondering about the movie theatre. <br/><br/>The reviews that shun the film for being historically inaccurate are completely unfair and some of the points made in them should not even be paid attention to because of how ridiculous they are. In fact, the film specifically states how scenes have been dramatised due to lack of evidence or knowledge in certain scenarios that occurred during the periods portrayed. <br/><br/>Some of these members are rating this film one star, simply based on the historical inaccuracies, but is that the only thing to base such a narratively-rich film on ? What about all other components that should be analysed when reviewing a film ? <br/><br/>A 7 out of 10 is a fair score. Without giving anything away, you will be able to get through this film quite comfortably, maybe finding that it does drag a bit and some scenes could have been shortened (especially the first half of the film).

"jakob13","9","5","17","7 August 2017"," A clinical autopsy of a riot 50 years later
","'Detroit' won't be a money maker, judging by the poor receipts after opening in America. Worldwide it may do better. Katherine Bigelow is a creative film maker and 'Detroit', her cinematic homage bears this out. Teamed up again with writer Mark Boal (Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty), she, at 67, shown she is the leading woman director of her time. Working against a handicap: the estate of John Hersey who wrote the best seller 'Algiers Motel Incident' who wrote strongly of the incident in July 25-26 1967 that occurred during the rioting that rocked Detroit and many say hastened the decline of city during the sinking fortunes then of America's car makers, during the declining fortunes of an America engaged in a failing undeclared colonial war in Vietnam. Bigelow and Boal and their team of researcher performed a yeoman's task of researching, rummaging archives, finding old photos and newsreel footage, and more than that finding the people--police and victims--of the incident at the Algiers Motel. And from that intense labor of 'love', they made a powerful film of police brutality and the craven behavior of the Michigan and National Guard sent in to quell the riot. Not only that, they assembled an ensemble of black and white actors that breathe life and tension and energy and artistic passion into top shelf acting that they might not of had, especially the black actors. John Boyega gave a nuanced, sturdy performance of a security guard who looks to save black lives until the safety of dawn; Anthony Mackie is no stranger to Bigelow films, and Algee Smith whose career and life the riots sent into a direction he least expected and ended his dreams of a singing career on the Motown label. The undisguised racism of the police force is not varnished in the least, The young British actor Will Poulter gives an over the top performance of a racist cop with a taste for brutality and murder. And 'Detroit' cannot have come at a better time in today's America where the president encourages police violence against dark skinned Americans and sojourners; where the incidence of police killing blacks with impunity have engendered the 'Black Lives Matter', to protest the endemic, seemingly pathological torrent among the police who can shoot, kill and main blacks and other minorities and whites who challenge authority. 'Detroit' resonates to that condition which is being pandered to by a Republican administration, an administration that seeming reimposed old rules and behavior that draws sharply between citizen and second class citizens, which the country had thought had been put behind it. But how fragile it the illusion, especially the ill will and outright hatred of Obama, the first black president. And the Republicans openly playing the racist card as America slouched to a more open society demographically and racially. And yet the violence and brutality Bigelow's camera captures, left this review ice cold. It was as though I was witnessing coldly and clinically a medical examiner's autopsy of a corpse. And yet, I would recommend this film highly. Many won't see it--too violent they might say. But they must, turning one's eyes away won't make the systemic police and racial ugliness disappear. Of course at Oscar time, 'Detroit' will receive nominations but hardly garner a statuette. Too bad."

","Factually, I hear a ton of debate. Honestly, whether or not it's accurate makes little difference how I rate the film (though it dramatically affects my perception of the director and writers). In my honest opinion, it felt like a little bit of race baiting. Note though that I don't consider all movies about racial topics as race baiting. 12 Years a Slave is my prime example of a movie that was not race baiting, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The camera in this film detracted so drastically from its impact. I get it that shaky cam can add to dramatic scenes, but I found it way over the top and extremely obnoxious. Many of the closeup face shots were utterly wasted, because they were used at poor times (sort of as filler) and when actors really weren't very convincing. This film was riddled with these. 
That leads into my second point. The performances. It was so disappointing to see a film with so much potential being dragged down by people that looked like they weren't even trying. There were moments with some great performances. But these felt like rare exceptions. 
One of my biggest issues with this film is the writing. Every time I felt myself feeling for the characters, I realized it was because I know they're human, not because the film earned it by building the characters. 
My last main complaint is with the pacing. There were some scenes that seemed to drag on, and at their end I found myself wondering why the film spent so much time on a particular aspect without a better payoff."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>July, 1967. The small town of Detroit in Michigan has erupted in a fireball of chaos and violence. In the middle of all this, a group of young African American musicians are hoping to get their moment in the spotlight and perform to a crowd at a local music venue, only for their show to be cancelled and to be forced home by the police like everyone else. They find themselves holed up in the Algiers hotel, but after a reckless shot is fired from a window, they are all rounded up by Officer Krauss (Will Poulter) and his men, in a bid to ascertain the shooter that leaves three of them dead by the end of the night. It's up to Officer Raymond Dismukes (Will Poulter) to keep the peace and prevent any further loss of life.<br/><br/>One of only a handful of female directors in the Hollywood sphere, Kathryn Bigelow has a distinctive style that she's established as her own. Whichever project she's brought to life on the screen, you know it's one of her films you're watching when you're right up close and personal in the action, fully immersed in whatever dramatisation is unravelling on the screen as though you're one of the characters sharing the events. Here, she's shone a spotlight on a particular incident in America's heavily fractured racial history, occurring at the height of the Civil Rights movement and massive social upheaval and change. The tensions of the time elevate the material to an even higher level than it's already managed.<br/><br/>It's a depiction of events that occurred fifty years ago, and the half a century mark might have had some impact on Bigelow's decision to bring it to the big screen. But it's a quirky kind of fate that such a historical event is being portrayed at a time where racial divides seem to be springing up again, whether imagined or factual. But unlike the phoney grievances spouted by the likes of the militant, lawless BLM and ANTIFA today, this comes from a time when the AA population really did face massive prejudice and discrimination, and really did have a fight on their hands, and it's to Bigelow's credit that it doesn't feel like she's forcing any leftist narrative down our throats, and lets events unfold as she's interpreted them.<br/><br/>Performances wise, as the bad guy, Poulter does look a little too baby faced to be taken entirely seriously in such a serious, commanding role, but that's not to say his delivery is without impact, showcasing a hot headed, bigoted lawman who knows he's got authority and abuses it to out-pour his controlling, bullying nature. The rest of the main cast, made up of a raft of current, trendy black talent, including Boyega and Anthony Mackie, are the cowed, powerless rounded up suspects, with the exception of Boyega, as the level headed lawman who must keep his cool in this tough situation. It's from a different time, one most of us can only imagine, and go by what we've learned. And hopefully, we all have. *****"

"zkonedog","6","2","5","16 April 2018"," Curiously Lacking A Clear Focus
","When I started seeing promotional material for ""Detroit"", I thought that it really had the chance to be something special. It is very timely in today's social/political climate, and director Kathryn Bigelow always takes such care in her films to portray the truth. While this seems to indeed be the case in ""Detroit"" as well, the film comes off as lacking a clear focus in terms of what it wanted to accomplish short of ""showing the facts of what happened"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Detroit"" tells the story of the 1967 race riots that tore through the city of Detroit, MI. While the first half of the film looks at the riots as a whole, the second half focuses in on one specific incident where the Detroit PD roughs up a group of African American men (and two white women) in trying to find a weapon that was fired from that location. The shocking brutality and subsequent trial are all chronicled in the back half of the film.<br/><br/>There are two things that I really wish ""Detroit"" would have done different:<br/><br/>1. It almost seems to be two different movies, and I wish Bigelow would have stuck to the first one, so to speak. As I've mentioned, the first half is really gripping, showing the beginning of the riots and what they might mean for everyone. I was really ""into"" this movie, as it truly does parallel many similar themes and problems even today. When the film switches to the one Algiers Motel incident, however, I felt like it bogged down and never really recovered. Perhaps had the film focused on that single scene from the beginning it would not have been so jarring of a switch, but as it stands I didn't like the focus going from wide-angle to pretty strict zoom.<br/><br/>2. I know that Bigelow likely wants to remain a-political in her filmmaking (from what I remember, a similar thing happened in ""The Hurt Locker""), but I also feel like this isn't a story that can be told without taking a bit of a stand. That doesn't happen here, though, and the movie has less of an impact because of it. Instead, this is very much a ""just the facts, ma'm"" approach that, at nearly two and a half hours, becomes hard to get through.<br/><br/>There is enough in ""Detroit"" to make it a watchable movie, as the acting performances are great and the general atmosphere of the whole piece is pretty chilling. Plus, Bigelow does a great job of subtly showing how similar race issues continue to plague black/police relationships. Basically, it does a great job of showing how the problems often remain even after the actors change.<br/><br/>So, while not a bad movie by any stretch, ""Detroit"" is one that I was quite underwhelmed by. I wanted a more consistent storytelling approach and a bit more of an impactful, articulated message within it. It's worth a watch if you are interested in the type of topics it delves into, but it likely won't vault to the top of your best-of lists."
"Quinoa1984","8","4","15","7 August 2017"," gritty, in-your-face, hard to watch as it should be.
","With Detroit, ostensibly about one night of terror that cops bring on a group of black men (and two white women) after a toy gun goes off as tensions are high during the 67 riots, Bigelow returns to the horror genre. The vampires are gone - you cant compare them to cops. It's shot in a documentary style, but its content brings it into a realm of the visceral disgust of the and in the human spirit. The cast gets to show themselves as human beings before the living nightmare takes hold - even, to the extent the movie can allow Will Poulter, who is the quintessential young-racist cop devaluing his position to that of a terrorist after realizing he won't get support from his superiors (when we first see him he shoots a man stealing groceries in the back, killing him) - so that only makes it much worse.<br/><br/>It's showing the dark side of the American character; Night of the Living Dark Thirty (it also seems like an unintentionally poetic irony that it's the Algiers motel, ala the Pontecorvo film, to which Bigelow and Boal owe a debt). Like their previous 2012 film, it looks at torture and justice, but here its less ambiguous where its intentions and spirit lies. It may not be subtle, but this subject isn't supposed to be, and there's no such thing as indifference when it comes to the shock of oppressors and the oppressed. Like Romero's film, it's intention is to make you feel like there's not a moment of breath to be had. It's a reality that provokes with the underlying point (especially at whites): what the hell is going to be done about this?<br/><br/>One fault: its too long. Or, more approximately, it almost feels like the movie is over by the time its at the last 20 minutes. We know where this train is headed because its the same goddamned train American police have been riding on in the courts when it comes to violence and murder. Trim maybe 15 minutes and it could be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>As it stands its really good and perhaps so strong a tonic that its hard to see wanting to experience more than once. At the same time I can understand it rubbing some as too much; the review on Rogerebert.com went as far as to say it was not right for a white person/white people to make it. I totally get this being upsetting - but I put it to you (and I know I started this review comparing it to other works by Bigelow, notably her breakthrough Near Dark but that's just me): if you didn't know it was directed by a 65 year old white woman and written by a white (former) journalist, would that stand out? Does it truly make a mark against this all? I don't buy it."

"oOoBarracuda","9","3","11","13 August 2017"," Detroit
","The summer of 1967 brought not just the sweltering of the summer heat, but also a wave of unrest. One of the largest race riots in United States history came to a fever pitch in Detroit in 1967. Detroit had begun to rebel in response to the racial tension between the city's largely African American population and the white police and their brutal treatment of the citizens of the city. Kathryn Bigelow helms an exploration of one evening in the city at the Algiers Motel which resulted in the deaths of three black men and the savage beating of nine others. The true story took place 50 years ago and one could only hope that would exist as a black mark on our nation's history and a past that we have learned from. Unfortunately, however, civil unrest and racial tensions are at an all-time high. This time, we also have a president who refuses to condemn the hateful actions of the individuals perpetrating such hate. Especially in the wake of the hate riots in Charlottesville over the weekend, it doesn't take much to realize that the united states are not as far removed from the tensions of 50 years ago. Not only are racial tensions at a tipping point in 2017, but so are religious tensions. I feel as though I am watching the world in a pre-WWII state. Islamaphobia is at an all time high, and with white supremacists canvassing the streets carrying flags with swastikas and giving the heil Hitler salute, it's certainly not a comfortable time to be a Jew. This bit of commentary is far off from the film Detroit other than to serve as a sad reminder that we no longer have to wonder what it was like to live in such volatile times because we are still experiencing them.<br/><br/>Detroit opens with a history lesson told with an artistic touch of stop motion animation which covered hundreds of years in the span of minutes, a superb way to introduce the film. Blending actual footage of the time and footage filmed for production, Detroit packs a heavy punch giving audiences a dramatized understanding of what happened, while still providing an actual look at the historical context. Much of the filming is achieved using hand-held cameras which go a long way to add to the disorienting feeling of a time which so much carnage and turmoil took place. The audience is placed in the heart of the narrative giving the feeling of watching the documentary which is completely necessary in order to understand the struggle as much as possible.The true strength of this film lies in its narrative structure. Clear moods are established in each act of the film. The first act is made up of a largely episodic narrative in which we see many struggles across the city without one protagonist being clearly identified. This structure allows for both the idea of togetherness and isolation. You see how different people are affected by the same racial unrest which goes to show that every citizen was vulnerable and each person of color a target. You also see just how isolated the city is from the rest of the world. When the National Guard is called in and you see even federal agents stepping aside to let them deal with their ""state issue"" one can truly see just how helpless the citizens were. The frenetic camera movement and drastic angles lend to the desperation in the atmosphere at the time. A minor detail is the excellent attention paid to period detail throughout the film. A film as strong and important as Detroit is certainly going to be remembered for other aspects than this, but it does excel in period design. My only complaint is that the film is a bit heavy-handed in some of its symbolism, I much prefer the subtle touch, and trusting the audience, but this is a small quibble in relation to the film. My only other complaint is that the film was a bit long and could have benefited from more aggressive editing, some nightmares are best- shown bits at a time in order to drive home the impact, and the systematic killing that took place in this film is one such nightmare. Audiences need to know that this happened, and I'm not suggesting to spare us from the truth, but some cutting could have better painted the picture. Detroit is my favorite film to come out of 2017, and I despise making such statements with so much of the year left, but Detroit is a film that should not be missed."

Arguably it's not an enjoyable experience, but it's so powerful and unique that it's anything but masterful.<br/><br/>Considering the context of the film and the injustice it presents the viewer for white treatment of African-Americans, it very appropriate that the film comes across this way to the audience.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a highly provocative movie experience, I'd highly recommend you check 'Detroit' out.

The rioting itself was just background to the goings on at the Algiers Motel, which mainly the whole movie is about.<br/><br/>I will give them credit for almost seamlessly integrating real footage with that shot just for the purpose. There are some factual errors and some anachronisms, but mostly they wouldn't be noticed except by someone my age.
I have to admit to being somewhat disappointed by the amount of attention given to the events at the motel, not to say this wasn't important, and the acquittal of the police involved had very dangerous consequences.
 
But I still would have liked more coverage of the riots themselves, being as it was the worst racially fueled conflict in the country up to that time. <br/><br/>So, although I appreciate the effort that went into the making of this, it could have been much better."

Better this is a feature and it receives public attention, I hope it finds its way into university classes. It deals with an issue that has been present in society for a long time and it continues today. No matter where you are, police brutality is one of the least scrutinised areas of crime in the world. It has triggered riots all over the world and has been used to calm peaceful protests time and time again. Yet it seems that police, to this day, can do almost as they please with innocent, non-violent individuals. <br/><br/>I feel it be of the utmost importance that people should watch this, you feel the fear of the victims of the horrible crimes committed by the police.

","The thrust of this movie is contained in the lengthy second act within the Algier's Hotel where the Detroit city police confronted several kids with tragic results. There is a third act that follows the legal consequences of those in charge. However, the power of this film is found within that second act. There are some incredible performances from Algee Smith and Hannah Murray (two of the kids in the hotel) and Will Poulter (one of the city policemen). For those, this movie should receive Oscar attention early next year. In addition, the cinematography in many places effectively puts you as the viewer in the middle of the riots helping to build the tension. No doubt, there is a message being sent by this film.<br/><br/>However, it is not a perfect film. The beginning was sluggish to the point of misdirection. It takes a good 30 minutes to engage a few of our main players in the critical phase at the motel. Perhaps, the intent was to build-up to this. It is true, thrusting us into the middle too soon would be equally disorienting. But if you choose to view this film, recognize that much of what you see early on isn't fully needed to pay off the thrust of the film. Secondly, despite my accolades on the acting performances above, some of the dialogue didn't feel natural, but rather somewhat clichÃ©d especially from our city cops attempting to resolve their dispute with the people in the hotel. And lastly, the slow moving and predictable courtroom drama was more than the movie needed. <br/><br/>I was asked by someone as we left our viewing...""Did you enjoy it?"" To which I answered...""No, I don't think I was meant to enjoy it...but it is a good movie."" It is riveting. It is compelling. It is sad that this history happened as it did. However, there are many times that we may not enjoy something we need to see/hear. Perhaps this is one of those things.<br/><br/>As a post-script--there are some who will say that Catherine Bigelow shouldn't have been the one to tell this story. I am not going to argue that point. I am glad someone did and I DO think she presented a movie that effectively tells a story of our history. I would entertain a different version should that be given to us in the future. Also, there is likely some question as to the portrayal of some of the key players here. Were they accurate to history? Even if not fully accurate, it may very well present a perception of what some have. And perception can and often does become one's reality.

","""Detroit"" is disgusting--and not only for the racist Milgram experiment based on the real incident at the Algiers Motel--but for how director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal exploit the events for their morally-dubious depictions of torture continued from their last collaboration, ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), which depicted so-called ""enhanced interrogation"" in the lead up to killing Osama bin Laden. Well, whereas Bigelow and Boal controversially thought it fair to suggest that torture was useful for that purpose; in ""Detroit,"" they seem to entirely reverse coarse. The only consistency is the cinematic exploitation of racial others being traumatized by sadists with guns--or, rather, cameras. Such exploitation is much easier to overlook when those being interrogated are terrorists and when gruesome scenes are kept brief, or when the revulsion remains the domain of fictional horror flick scenarios, but ""Detroit"" is based on a real tragedy, involving racist cops murdering innocent Black men and sexually and otherwise physically assaulting two women, and it goes on for a long time--seemingly longer than the already-lengthy runtime would indicate.<br/><br/>It would be one thing if this sequence were brutal only to authentically depict a historical tragedy, or to relate it to the more recent context of police killings, the unrest in Ferguson a few years prior to this movie, as well as the Black Lives Matter movement and preceding the current protests and violence of 2020, but ""Detroit"" doesn't serve that function. The picture's prologue, going so far back as titles explaining the Great Migration and segregation, to the 1967 Detroit Riot, and the picture's third act, which mostly focuses on a farce of a courtroom drama at the expense of following through on tracing the survivors living with the trauma they endured (only the singer receives any justice in the latter regard), are completely blundered. We see one of the cops murder a looter early on, which is never followed up on, either. It's just another scene for the filmmakers to perversely demonstrate a simulated lack of respect for Black lives on par with its villains. Sure, it's hackneyed screenwriting foreshadowing that a character is a sociopath, but it also foreshadows the sickness of Bigelow and Boal's torture porn to come and the by-large removal of the same agency of its Black characters as done by the picture's villains towards its victims.<br/><br/>As pointed out by film critic Mike D'Angelo, one of the most glaring indications of this picture's problems here is in the editing of the death of Aubrey Pollard. Unlike the pretend executions that the police enact in their perverse game, the picture cuts away from the room where this one takes place, as we hear the shotgun blasts, only to learn shortly thereafter that the cop really murdered Pollard--seemingly unaware that his fellow officers were only playing a twisted game aimed at manufacturing confessions. That is not how you film a docudrama. It's a shameful folly of suspense filmmaking. It's intended to be exciting and thrilling, and that's shameful.<br/><br/>One silver lining of ""Detroit"" is that it's masterfully photographed and even the editing and cutting back and forth between characters is effective for its intended purposes, misplaced and hostile as they may be. The shaky, darting camerawork especially works well at affecting a spectatorial participation in the hectic events. If only such stylistic competence were in the hands of filmmakers who also had the compassion and understanding of how to depict such a tragedy."

","Detroit is an intense & heartbreaking drama, that is terrifyingly timely right now.<br/><br/>Opening with an animated sequence of Jacob Lawrence's 'The Migration Series', Bigelow skilfully uses this as a storyboard to contextualise historic events & illustrate racial tensions.<br/><br/>The raid of a speakeasy by the police erupts into civil unrest, sparking protests, looting & fire-bombs. During these scenes, a hand held camera is used & real news footage is interwoven - creating a very realistic and immersive experience.<br/><br/>Amidst all of the chaos, we are introduced to Dismukes, a security guard & friends Larry (lead singer of The Dramatics) & Fred (their manager) as they all find themselves at the Algiers Motel. From here, Detroit hones in on three white policemen, Larry, Fred, Dismukes & other residents at the motel - during a night long heart-pounding, torturous episode of abuse (the lingering shots of eyes filled with tears & lips whispering prayers was extremely difficult to watch).<br/><br/>I was blown away by Will Poulter's acting (having only seen him in We're the Millers). Playing Krauss, a bigoted and callous police officer with a penchant for violence & mind games, Krauss and his fellow officers' deep intolerance for Black people; and indeed white women mixing with black men is both terrifying & idiotic. I haven't watched a film for a while that has been so infuriating.<br/><br/>The emotion Algee Smith brings to the role of Larry Reed is sublime. The aftermath of the tragic night at the Motel stands out as the most heartbreaking part for me personally.<br/><br/>John Boyega was excellent as Dismukes, a man who tries to mediate the situation - gaining distrust from both sides as he tackles with his race, his uniform & fear. Jacob Latimore as Fred was also tremendous, and his end was truly unjust.<br/><br/>From state troopers/national guards that turned a blind eye to the abuse happening at the Motel, to the ""death game"" - I think what's spine-chilling about this film is that the events depicted are real & these issues are still relevant 50+ years later."

","This is my first review. Not because I feel the movie was exceptionally good or bad, but because I feel like critics and reviewers appear to miss the main objective of this story.<br/><br/>Complaints about a lack of context are all over the place. The officers' motives & the real reason for the riots in general; those 2 aspects seem to iritate people greatly. Although I have to agree that these could have been worked out better, I don't feel like this was the movie's purpose. The story doesn't want to go too deep into the whole civil war that was going on in those times. It doesn't need to tell the story of how corrupt & unjust the force of law was back then. There are more recorded cases, movies, series & songs then we care to admit that factualize these terrible times.
It simply serves as a base for a much more personal, much deeper story concerning that specific night and that specific place.<br/><br/>This movie is not about Detroit, or the riots. It's about what happened to those people in that motel in those couple hours. It's an emotional rollercoaster and a look in the minds of the victims as they went through hell and back. And once you realise this you'll find this is an excellent motion picture, with good acting, solid writing and directing and the capability of leaving you feeling empty, powerless and even ashamed.<br/><br/>That, to me, is a great movie.

","Out of all the film's that were largely ignored over the recent awards period rush of late last year and early this year, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty follow-up Detroit is one name that stands out above the rest as perhaps the most curiously overlooked of the lot.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, featuring an up and coming cast of recognisable faces and touching on hot-topic issues that remain prevalent and in the public conscious of America to this day, Detroit had all the hallmarks of a critical darling and awards season contender that instead faced a rather bleak box-office and audience reception despite many critics hailing Bigelow's realistic and confronting direction as some of last year's best filmmaking.<br/><br/>There's certainly no faulting Bigelow's directional style that she harnessed with The Hurt Locker and established further with Zero Dark Thirty, as Detroit well and truly feels like a documentary as the talented director melds together archival like footage of the Detroit race riots of 1967 and her narrative take on a particularly shocking incident involving a collection of Detroit police officers and their treatment of a group of predominately black locals but there's something hugely amiss in Bigelow's scope and decision making.<br/><br/>Firstly, Detroit is far too long at 140 minutes plus and while the film's opening half is strong and involving, an extended hotel segment that anchors the whole film is repetitive to the point of infuriation while the film's final 30 or so minutes is hugely misguided and uninvolving making Detroit feel far too often like a chore to sit through.<br/><br/>The other key element to Detroit's disappointment is in its lack of audience involvement with the characters within Bigelow's feature.<br/><br/>There's fine work by performers like John Boyega, Will Poulter and Jack Reynor but there's nothing tying us to these characters emotionally despite the trauma and experiences they are going through and while Poulter makes a mark as the detestable racist cop Krauss, all other performers feel like passengers to a narrative that is saying a lot, of which much is important to say, but delivering it in a heavy handed and increasingly uninvolving fashion as Detroit's promising and confronting beginning gets lost in its repetitive nature and overdrawn nature.<br/><br/>Final Say - <br/><br/>There's some great moments within Detroit and there's little doubt that Bigelow's particular style of filmmaking is in a league of its own when it clicks but with a failure to create an emotional core and with a an unnecessarily long and repetitive approach to one particular event, Detroit peters out too a mere flicker, instead of lighting a burning flame.<br/><br/>2 ½ church choirs out of 5"

","Race tensions are running high in 1967 Detroit with the National Guard joining city and state police in trying to quell riots and looting. The sound of shots result in the police bursting into the Algiers Motel, killing one man, and subjecting a group of others (including two white girls) to an ordeal including constant imminent fear of death. Most are beaten, one of the girls is stripped, and two more men are killed. In the aftermath, three police (and an innocent black security guard) are tried for murder.<br/><br/>Katherine Bigelow has made a dense, gripping and eye-opening drama from a an incident which actually happened, but where the details are dependent on trial transcripts and recollections. What we see on screen is representational rather than literal. This dilutes the dramatic impact a little, since you can't be confident that this is actually what happened. It does seem likely, though. <br/><br/>It is harrowing stuff thanks to Bigelow's direction, a fine script (Mark Boal), and superb performances from all concerned, but especially young British actor Will Poulter as out-of-control cop Krauss. This young man has got better and better in everything I've seen him in, and this film must surely see him nominated for an Oscar.<br/><br/>This is neither a short (143 minutes) nor an easy watch, but it is a film I'm glad I saw."

","Just finished watching this amazing film by the director who also legitimised torture in her previous film. Perhaps this is her attempt to redeem herself.

As a film it takes your breath away with the suspense that just keeps building. As a portrait of 1967 USA, it also seems on the money ( though that is hard for me to judge other than from what I happen to know of history).

","Detroit is not an easy film to watch, lots of violence and racism with certain scenes that will make you blood boil. It is a very gripping viewing experience despite the film being over 140min long. The acting from everyone involved was commendable as well.<br/><br/>Racism and police violence in Detroit at that time are a fact and there is no point denying that. Everything reached a boiling point with the riots. Looting and destroying public property is not the right answer, neither is the inappropriate response from the police. Detroit shows a specific event during the riots. The white police officers are shown as cruel and terrible people and black people and two white girls are the victims which is absolutely correct in that case. It is important not to fall under the influence of stereotypes or generalisation when watching this. Some will say Detroit tried to show white police officers too negatively. The ones in this film rightfully deserved it. Despite some dramatisation, it is the truth. Detroit is not trying to generalise here, the race does not define whether a person is good or bad, that is within people, no matter what they do or where they come from. But in the event shown in the film, white did abuse the black, racism was present in those times and is still present today all over the world. There is no use in pretending otherwise.<br/><br/>I would recommend the film but see it with an open mind."

","There are far too few female film directors and probably none as commercially and artistically successful as the American Kathryn Bigelow. Her two previous works, ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"", were both outstanding and showed men in uniform under pressure. <br/><br/>""Detroit"" has the same essential theme but, as the title makes clear, this time we are on Bigelow's home territory of the United States. Indeed we are in the midst of actual events, the race riot which took place in one of the country's major cities over five days in July 1967 when 43 were killed, 1,200 injured, 7,000 arrested, and 2,000 buildings burned down.<br/><br/>As the film unfolds, the focus constantly narrows, starting with a quick animated history of black migration in the USA, moving on to the rioting throughout the 12th Street area of Detroit, then closing in on the Algiers Motel, and finally remaining in real time in an annex to the motel where we find ourselves in a kind of horror movie. <br/><br/>This is a long film and the final segment jumps forward a couple of years, with glimpses of the court case where all the accused were acquitted, to conclude with short text advising the viewer on what happened to the chief characters in the incident.<br/><br/>If this is a cinematic tour de force by Bigelow, it is a tribute too to writer Mark Boal and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, both of whom she has worked with before. The inter-cutting of contemporary news footage and the use of hand-held cameras mean that the viewer is drawn into a seamless exposition that, from the beginning, induces anxiety and, during the interrogation sequence, is some of the most uncomfortable viewing outside of the horror movie genre. <br/><br/>The acting is excellent across the piece, but the stand-out performances come from two British actors: John Boyega (""The Force Awakens"") as the black security guard caught up in the events and Will Poulter (""THe Revenant"") as the white Detroit cop who orchestrates the whole macabre, and ultimately murderous, shake-down<br/><br/>I saw Bigelow interviewed about her latest movie on ""The Daily Show"" and it is clear that she regards ""Detroit"" as not simply a 50th anniversary commemoration of a dark period of American history but a call to today's America to recognise that race is still a bitterly divisive feature of society that continues all too often to witness young black men being shot down by white policemen who are rarely called to account at a time when the current occupant of the White House is adding by word and deed to the already toxic atmosphere."

","As a child, you are told that the police are there to protect you. If ever you should find yourself in a sticky situation, calling the police is the safest option as there is always an obvious line between the good guys and the bad guys. Upon closer examination however, this isn't as true as one might hope. As part of the civil rights movement, blacks demanded justice in reaction to incidences of police brutality targeted upon members of their race. Many whites turned a blind eye as experience told them that only the guilty fear the police or are arrested. When police brutality began spilling into the public eye and into the suburbs- their suburbs- deniers were finally exposed to the reality of police brutality.<br/><br/>In the fifty years since the 12th Street riot and in light of events in recent years, the viewpoint that police are not to be trusted has not disappeared. Riots in response to police brutality still happen. Innocents are still slaughtered by prejudiced and violent psychopaths in police uniforms. Helpless and frightened, victims in Detroit are just a few of the many that police have lashed out against without provocation. When it comes to a bad cop, they will opt to ""protect and serve"" themselves first no matter how innocent those they interact with may be. Over the course of a near two and a half hours, Detroit brilliantly depicts this as black men and white women are violently tortured by white and black cops alike, all the while other officers extend a helping hand in the midst of the darkness. It is a surprisingly balanced and reasonable approach to such a hotly contested issue, yet it never shies away from showing the truth in every bloody detail.<br/><br/>Read more: https://cineccentric.com/2017/08/19/detroit/"

","I sat through a long 2 hours and 15 minutes to watch Detroit because I'm a Kathryn Bigelow fan and was in the mood for a hard core drama. Neither of them disappointed. <br/><br/>Detroit is excellently directed by Bigelow once again, and the drama doesn't get any grittier than this. After a somewhat slow introductory 30 minutes, once the main story gets in gear, it is riveting.<br/><br/>However, for me, the film fell short as a whole. It is a movie that without doubt will attract award and Oscars buzz, and perhaps as a work of art, deservedly so. But I must say that I don't think this is the time to release a film like this. It felt like it was ill timed with the material, and I don't think that it's a time to relive these events. <br/><br/>I say this because clearly it's a story Bigelow wanted to tell and delve into the topic. I just don't think this is the time to do it. In fact, the story is basically a semi- step by step retelling of the more recent LA riots- particularly the Rodney King story that started it. <br/><br/>Personally, I also did not like Will Poulter's performance. I can tell when actors are imitating other actors rather than just doing their own take,, and it seemed like he was doing his Matt Damon+ Mark Wahlberg impersonation to play the head cop (or is he somehow related to them?). I just couldn't help but think the role was written for one of those two, who have played bad cops before, but they probably didn't want racist language attached to their star so Poulter got the part. He's good, but I felt like that role could have been played even more convincing by a different actor. <br/><br/>Look, this is a good movie, and at times it is truly incredibly powerful. I almost called it a flawed masterpiece because a good portion and majority of the film is masterful and masterfully directed, but as a whole, it just didn't totally hold or add up. It's just not a movie I'd want to watch again, but for a one time viewing, I'd recommend a look.

","This film propels Kathryn Bigelow to the forefront of American directors. It is a powerful, superbly constructed, insightful and circumspect demonstration of today's most tragic truth — what we hoped was Obama's post-racist America turned out to be neo-racist America. <br/><br/>Though it centers on the 1967 Detroit riot and police abuse of African-Americans, seeing it after Charlottesville makes the film sadly prophetic.<br/><br/>As Christopher Nolan did in Dunkirk, Bigelow thrusts us into the action pell-mell, shooting everything in frenzy and close-up, not pausing to explain or reframe. Again we feel the impossible confusion and suffocation of war. What the dialogue tells us is less important than our visceral experience of the victims under siege and the police scared into brutishness. <br/><br/>The film frames that tumultuous action with calm stills. The prologue is artistic renderings of the history — paintings of the southern blacks' movement north for civil rights and jobs and the whites' consequent evacuation of the cities for the ostensibly purer suburbs. If they escaped Jim Crow the blacks couldn't escape the prejudiced legal and social systems. <br/><br/>The epilogue states the fates of the various characters. The whites escaped conviction. That's what white privilege is all about — they win the loopholes. The blacks found what compromises their conviction allowed, like the brilliant singer who skips out on his group's Motown success to sing in a neighbourhood church choir. The civil courts give token acknowledgment of the guilt and justice the white legal system denied. <br/><br/>None of those consequences erase or forgive the arrogant and sadistic bigotry of the white crop Krauss. He is just a boy, trigger happy, but with centuries of racism in his veins and culture — and the confidence the colour gap bequeathes him. In an early conversation in the police car he seems to understand and sympathize with the blacks' predicament — but then he gets the chance to shoot one. The die is cast. <br/><br/>To Krauss the torture of his prisoners is a game. Sadistic and brutal but a game, the way a toy gun in the minds of the frightened National Guard and police swells into a mortally dangerous sniper, to be caught and punished at all costs — especially to the innocent blacks. One cop hasn't learned the ""game,"" though, so he kills instead of just pretending to. That's what happens when a game is played on people to whom it is far from a game. <br/><br/>So far this is the best American film of the year — and by far the most important. I would say that even if Charlottesville had not happened last weekend and President Trump had not been exposed as the personification of American racism, hypocrisy and ignorance. All that only validates Bigelow's vision. <br/><br/>But all the Oscars of the eve won't amend America's racist history and its continuing choke-hold on the nation. That will take a wide and profound social reform of which America has yet to prove itself capable — or even willing."

"coreyjdenford","8","2","8","25 August 2017"," Riotously epic
","This review of Detroit is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>DETROIT IS PERHAPS the boldest title for writing-directing duo Mark Boal and Kathryn Bigelow's latest, re-enacting the true history of one of the darkest chapters in American history - the summer riots of 1967 in Detroit, Michigan. When forty-three people were killed, 1,200 were injured, 7,000 were arrested, 2,000 buildings were torched after a police raid on an unsuspecting African-American group which then broke out in a five-day civil rights war and it became the biggest race riot in modern history, as Motor City was left in a smoking husk. Sure, Zero Dark Thirty was intense but this is perhaps Bigelow's most gripping film to date depicting real images of torture and a brutal re-enactment of the famous Algiers Motel war, in compelling form.<br/><br/>Over the last few years Bigelow has proved that she is the master director behind time bomb cinema from action, Point Break to its tick-tocking rhythm with Strange Days and The Hurt Locker. This kind of filmmaking proves to be no stranger here as her latest erupts from the opening reel. After a timely scattering of news archive footage, you're plunged into a fiery recreation of history. As the city's people congregate in the dark streets, anger ensues as objects are thrown, gun shots are heard and a volcano of smoke flying into the air. Bigelow effectively introduces her different perspectives; firstly there's Will Poulter's introduction shot and chase at a rioter, secondly Larry (Algee Smith) the lead singer of a Motown group, third is Greene (Anthony Mackie) a Vietnam War veteran and lastly there's John Boyega's young convenience store guard Melvin Dismukes. <br/><br/>The riot is into its third day when these perspectives converge in the Algiers Motel – used as a refugee camp for those who want to get away from the burning streets, perhaps in a hideous twist of irony, becoming the dark backdrop of the brewing massacre about to erupt. There are bullets coming through the walls, in an attempt for the police to track down a sniper. The motel is raided – violence, terrorisation and torture initiate as people are tied against the wall in a vicious interrogation section led by Krauss who does anything to get information from the guests in the motel.<br/><br/>Graphically recreated in real-time it's an hour-long section which you will remember for days, perhaps weeks or maybe decades it's enough to make you shudder. Bigelow's directing isn't exactly easy on the eyes either, it's sometimes gruelling as men and women are tortured for information, they're beaten and constantly threatened by the police in the building, it's nightmarish too, the deafening gun shots are enough to haunt you. However it's always on edge, always moving and a gripping almost real-life re-enactment of modern history. This is closest to the horror of Near Dark, were as that's fantasy the horror of Detroit has a sickening flash of reality. Backed up by Boal's tremendously researched screenplay it pulls all punches. Filled with brutal, yet stunning imagery of events gone by, deafening shouting from the police which fills the entire bleak atmosphere of the motel and phenomenal performance as all players are on top form. As the night of torture erupts around the building – its Bigelow's casting of Poulter that shines here, he's unflinching, unhinged, and unchained as you wouldn't expect beneath his baby faced demeanour is something vicious, yet in every moment he's fantastic.<br/><br/>After this gruelling, yet breathtaking center-piece the film sighs for a breath of fresh air when the third act rolls in. As the city-wide riot comes to a hasty close there are many court cases involving the police, news stories and a chance to re-build the burning city skyline. Inevitably, this falls short of perfection, granted it's a well-made section filled with Boal's exceptional writing, flawless performances, and Bigelow's incredible hand in direction but it's often left gasping for air. Still, this is an utterly compelling riot epic that's always moving and will effortlessly stay with you well after the credits end.<br/><br/>VERDICT Gruelling, nightmarish, yet always an utterly compelling and moving riot epic thriller one that expertly and unflinchingly recreates one of the darkest chapters in American history."
"tadpole-596-918256","8","2","8","16 August 2017"," For anyone who's been waiting to see the True Facts about Detroit's 1967 Riot . . .
",". . . DETROIT is NOT your movie. However, if you want to see the finest example yet of the dangerous Alt.Left Propaganda Machine (about which Leader Trump warned us during his Trump Tower News Conference yesterday, 8/15/17), DETROIT is your ticket. There's about a 50-50 chance that Director Kathryn Bigelow's False Flick will inspire the Third Major Detroit Riot in 75 Years this summer. A well-known national corporation recently assigned me (due to my Rep for fearlessness) a trouble-shooting task involving me driving down literally every inch of paved street contained within this so-called city's 39 square miles. Soon my catalytic converter was sawed off my vehicle while parked on Seven Mile Road in BROAD DAYLIGHT! When I stopped for gas nearby a little later that afternoon, a loitering thug (who looked like one of the lead cast members of DETROIT) threatened to kill me as I tried to Pre-pay while he was urinating on the OUTSIDE of the station's front wall! That was just Day One. (I'll probably write a book about the rest of this assignment soon.) Arson and looting remain the Primary Occupations of many if not most Detroiters, and Detroit's local Metro Times newspaper documents a populace continuing to seethe with the Seeds of Violent Insurrection being stirred up by Alt.Left screeds like DETROIT. Director Bigelow inexplicably tries to Fan the Flames of Civil Unrest by cherry-picking a few historical facts and Detroit Landmarks to sprinkle into her made-in-Boston concoction of Disinformation. (Obviously, SHE thought that HER personal safety would be compromised IF she kept her cast and crew among the Ruins of Today's Real Life Detroit, losing THEIR catalytic converters and being threatened with THEIR own deaths by thugs urinating on the fronts of businesses in broad daylight!)<br/><br/>The opening minutes of DETROIT are chock full of factual errors, giving perceptive viewers a clear warning that whatever follows is a collection of Fake News and Misinformation diligently massaged by Director Bigelow and her Hench People to rouse up, bamboozle, and exploit the Young, the Prejudiced, and the Ill-informed. For instance, Bigelow indicates that a Detroit Tigers home baseball game is taking place on Day Three of the Riot (that game was actually postponed). She also pictures the Supremes performing at Detroit's Fox Theater that same night (patently Untrue!). Bigelow flagrantly invents scenes showing BOTH Michigan's State Police AND America's National Guard fleeing Detroit's Algiers Motel as yellow-bellied cowards in the face of a single Detroit rogue cop. She besmirches the esteemed memory of U.S. Presidential Candidate and Michigan Governor George Romney by editing an archival footage clip to make him sound like a total idiot. She shows John Conyers, a Rabble Rouser in Congress from Detroit Then and Now, but neglects to reveal that it was bozos such as Big John that forced Michigan to carve itself into unwieldy jigsaw puzzle piece Congressional Districts to minimize that harm done to America by Conyers and his ilk to just one-third of what DETROIT's deplorable demographics would otherwise produce.<br/><br/>You've got to give DETROIT director Bigelow kudos for so effectively stirring up the Alt.Left by ripping apart the scar tissue over old wounds. It puts one in mind of that Great Propaganda Piece by ANOTHER female movie director, Leni Riefenstahl (aka, ""Hitler's Videographer""). Though Ms. Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL set new standards for epic film-making, it also started World War Two, resulting in 100 million deaths (including those of 6 million Jews). Hollywood doubtless will shower its Alt.Left darling Ms. Bigelow for her Racist Hatchet Job with a slew of Oscars. Let's just hope that DETROIT's death toll does not surpass the tally racked up by TRIUMPH OF THE WILL."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","2","9","27 November 2017"," Makes you sad and angry
","Very moving and shocking film about the Detriot riots. A film that makes you think a long time after seeing it. I had some issues with the first 20 minutes or so because the film lacked getting drive but after that it really turned out to be a truly great movie that perfectly mixes elements of drama, thriller, mystery and pure horror until it turns into an even more shocking court room drama. Why shocking? Because of the way the people thought in the late 60s. The acting was good and constantly strong. Algree Smith is the great new discovery of this film. A strong performance from the beginning to the end with an excellent character development that is very well handled. Also Will Pouter was excellent. Less character development but pure menace. A huge step up from his usual performances and he really played excellently against image. While the character on paper is rather one dimensional the performance he brings out is he best of the movie. John Boyega is doing the right decision in-between his ""Star Wars"" films. The performance was very solid and I really loved his character. The interrogation scene was excellent. Good support by Jason Mitchell, who once again proves to be a versatile actor to look out for and Anthony Mackie who really held himself in the background and let his new comer co-stars the show. I didn't like th shaky camera too much, was not needed in my eyes. The screenplay was good and it left me with sad and angry emotions."
"sirwillisiv","9","2","9","18 November 2017"," Intense and provoking...
","Detroit powerfully dramatizes the harsh realities and racial tensions of the 1967 Detroit riots with skillful direction and grounded performances, Will Poutler's being particularly fearsome and newcomer Algee Smith generating a lot of sympathy. However, I wasn't a fan of the act structure as it seemed episodic. The third act focuses on the legal results of the riots, which felt like a completely different film compared to the distressing sequences before it. I'll give it minor leeway for it's historical context, but the Algiers Motel act was strong enough to be it's own picture and could've done without the bloated first and third acts. Not an easy watch, but it's essential cinema and another milestone for director Kathryn Bigelow. Intense and provoking. One of 2017's best."
"alindsay-al","8","2","9","6 September 2017"," A great gripping film
","After seeing the trailer and hearing about the premise for this film I knew I had to see detroit and I have and it is a really good film. The premise of the film is set in the detroit riots and sees a white policeman using questionable methods to try and find a sniper. John boyega plays a security guard involved with the incident and he is really good in the film. You see how he is just an average guy who doesn't really take a side in the conflict but tries to do the right thing. You care about him and want to see him sort this situation out. But the best performance in this film has to go to will poulter who plays the white police officer in charge of the investigation. He sells the brutality of the situation expertly well and he owns every scene that he is in. Anthony mackie is in this film in a smaller role and he does a really good job in the role adding to the believability of the situation his character is put in. Everybody did a great job in this film from the victims to the police officers all give great convincing performances. The story in the film is very simple but effective, seeing this mystery going on is interesting and obviously the racial tension brings conflict. But I also feel especially for the first act of the film it tries to set up a lot that didn't make me care more about the characters at all. Also I think the films ending is a little too long and drags on. The script has some really good dialogue in it mainly of the dramatic persuasion which helps add to the tension that that is built in the film. The style of the film is really gripping, the brutality of some of the actions is horrifying to watch at times but it is effective. However, sometimes the saying less is more is effective too and I feel like at a point in the film that it was getting a bit repetitive that you just instinctively lose interest the more you see it which was a problem for me with this film. Overall detroit is an important film and if you can handle it, this is a must watch."

And its sad to see times hasn't changed that much! Police Brutality has never ended! The thing I didn't like about the movie was how one of the main characters gave up his singing career to join a church. It seems every black movie has black people riding god the whole time!

"swilliky","6","2","9","8 August 2017"," A horrifying story that is approached with distance
","It has been clear long before I was born that something is wrong with the country and the souls of those in authority are corrupt. Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit exposes another terrible chapter in dramatic fashion that feels a bit off in its depiction of horrific violence. The story gives a brief background of the tension through a cartoon that feels far too simplistic for a nuanced view of a centuries old struggle and growing corruption in law and order. There is a short scene that plays no real significance in the rest of the film except to introduce the supposed cause of the riots but then it jumps to the major characters of this sickening story. <br/><br/>The character that is most interesting and takes the role of protagonist in this harrowing tale is Larry (Algee Smith), a singer whose attempt at fame and a chance at the stage for his Motown group is cut short due to the riots. He and his friend Fred (Jacob Latimore) flee the angry police and raging fires to hide out the night in the Algiers hotel. Dismukes (John Boyega) works private security for a grocery store trying to help black men escape the brutality of the patrolling officers and national guard. Krauss (Will Poulter) is a racist police officer whose trigger happy nature with a shotgun earns him a homicide investigation before the events at the Algiers hotel. Larry and Fred flirt with two white women Julie (Hannah Murray) and Karen (Kaitlyn Dever) who bring them to meet some friends. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","3","28 February 2018"," Detroit is yet another hard hitting factual based drama from Kathryn Bigelow.
","I'm starting to fall in love with her. Zero Dark Thirty is one of the best films of this century and does not get enough credit. Detroit, although not in that league, is still absolutely powerful in every aspect. A film that both informs and thrills the audience of the 1967 Algiers Motel raid in Detroit. An event that is not talked about much, documents and footage of the raid have been scarce and so consequently there are scenarios that are dramatised. This added drama is what prevents Detroit from being a documentary reenactment. It's a clear three act narrative. The first act plays out like a documentary, educating viewers about the riots of Detroit. The second act is the genre shift to a thriller, the motel raid. The third act is the courtroom drama that deals with the legal aftermath. Sure, it's mechanical...but Bigelow directs the heck out of this which is why it feels so raw and powerful. Her directing style is frantic. Constant shakiness and zooming, it involves the viewer...draws them in. An event like this cannot be handled with care and fluffiness. No, it needed to be brutal and Bigelow was the perfect choice. If a film dealing with racism and/or segregation makes me angry inside, it's done its job. If the film does that and engages me throughout its run time...well we have ourselves a home run. Aside from Bigelow being a standout, Will Poulter deserves a lot of recognition. He's come a long way in recent years and believe this is his best performance. John Boyega also gives an understated performance. The violence is savage, but it needed to be. Someone gets hit, you are also going to feel it. My only one criticism is that the ending dragged. When your second act is a thriller, your third act consequently will slow down in pace and unfortunately it slowed down too much. Still compelling, just more at ease. I suspect Detroit will be overlooked during Awards season. It's a shame because this is a powerful important film that has outstanding direction and some strong performances."
"deloudelouvain","8","1","3","11 February 2018"," If you're not a racist and don't like police you will get mad watching this good movie
","Detroit is a story from 1967, but it could have been from today or tomorrow because nothing really changed or will change. There is still as much racism, if not more, then in those days. Now it's just a bit more concealed, even though with Trump as president, racism is now more in the open again and more tolerated. Detroit is a hard movie to watch, aspecially if you are a normal human being that has issues with racism, police brutality, and injustice. It won't give you a good feeling, on the contrary, it made me mad and sad. Unless you're one of those dumb racists, then you will probably get a kick out of watching innocent minorities getting beated and killed, and all that unpunished. The arguments will be of course that they got it coming and so on, the typical narrow minded racist nonsense. It's a fact that black and other minorities still not have equal rights, and that police still can kill innocent people without getting any convictions. There is a law for the rich, and a law for the poor, a law for the whites, and a law for the minorities. But Detroit is a really good movie, hard to watch but well made, with an excellent cast. They couldn't find anybody better than Will Poulter to play the racist officer. He has already a natural face of a coward, if you could put a face on a coward. He was perfect for this role. Very well acted even though I felt deep hatred towards him, but that's only credits to his acting. You hope of course for a good outcome, but it's based on true facts, so you know that the outcome will be outrageous and unfair. That's not even spoling anything about the movie, that is just life like it was then and like it still is now, nothing changed."

This is a film that shows the inhumanity within us, who need a reason of color or power, to expose their real ugly side. Bigelow, a master at her craft, brings us a story that needs to be watched & condemned, no matter what maybe the color of your skin! And very SADLY enough, this might be a little relatable story to those living in the U.S now, given the current president, who preaches disparity on people based on their race.<br/><br/>Mark Boal's Screenplay is fantastic. The Writing is gut-wrenching & asks you to think. This is one of the strongest Screenplay's from 2017! Bigelow's Direction is marvelous. She's in top-form! Barry Ackroyd's Cinematography is excellent. William Goldenberg's Editing is perfect. James Newton Howard's Score is superb, as always.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Will Poulter is incredibly menacing.

","I still haven't seen Near Dark, but have been really wanting to do so. I will say this though, Bigelow's Strange Days is amazing. In recent years Bigelow has shifted focus to more politically-war themed films. With Detroit, Bigelow brings attention to the Algiers Motel Incident which occurred during a race riot in Detroit. Her past two Academy Award nominated efforts made it seem like Detroit would be a contender this year. Overall, I am quite disappointed with this film and I'll tell you why.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier Detroit depicts the real life event at the Algiers Motel, where black men and two white women were rounded up and humiliated by cops because of gun shots fired towards police during a very heated riot. The film enlists the help of John Boyega, Will Poulter, Anthony Mackie, and an impressive Will Poulter. I did really enjoy seeing Hannah Murray in a film as well, she's a cutie. I thought Poulter was a perfect casting in this role. He impressed me, and now that I think about it his Pennywise from It may have been an interesting but successful casting if it panned out.<br/><br/>The film mainly suffers from being too long. The incident itself, while interesting does not need to be padded. The events of the night are portrayed for far to long, and the aftermath itself loses steam fast. The performances are good but there's a real sense of just showing the story without portraying it in an impassioned way. Obviously the events of the film still resonate today and should have really rallied a reaction but the film just falls flat.<br/><br/>I do like Bigelow as a filmmaker but she takes a misstep by recreating the events for this film. I don't expect this film to make any real splash awards season because its actually far from good. Poulter or maybe even Boyega may have an outside chance of a nomination but I don't see this film staying in memory for very long. Disappointed, but I know Bigelow will bounce back.<br/><br/>6/10"

"thiknes","Null","1","5","12 August 2017"," How do you start a riot!?!?
","How do you start a riot? Detroit gives the answer, literally, when a small group of evicted partiers toss rocks through a storefront window. And it's on. We're in the middle of the riots of 1967, where many were killed including 3 innocent black teenagers, who I think were the intended focus of the movie. It's awkward though, as a stone through a window may start a riot, but it's hardly the spark of one. Perhaps emotional fury in the wake of torture and injustice is? But you wouldn't know it. Beneath all the jolts, the looting and the foreign objects, the streets are a personality vacuum, bereft of conflicts or occurrences non-physical. The effect is amniotic. At roughly 30 minutes, chaos' persistence becomes droll.<br/><br/>It's reenactment footage you might see if you canceled your cable and started watching antenna TV murder mystery channels (Like Escape, channel 68-4).<br/><br/>So aloft is the riot sequence that it refuses to get bogged down in establishing a protagonist (A bro or chick to identify with in the story). It's pretty phenomenal. But not in a good '96 Travolta way.<br/><br/>Then it happens: we are introduced to a person. He's a young guy (who looks like evil Matt Damon) in a difficult job, with his city on fire, facing intense pressure from the powers that be. He's frustrated, he wants order, he wants advancement, and he's not that great at his job. In short, he's identifiable. He's got a plight! He's also a homicidal racist. And his job is Police Officer. This is the only discernible character created within the narrative, and I noticed a perverse thing happening: within the confines of fiction, brains are exceedingly vulnerable to traces of humanity, however thin, whether it be Tony Soprano (a racist criminal serial killer), or Phil Krauss, the racist cop in Detroit, we default to whatever character is available.<br/><br/>During the major incident of the film, inside the Algiers hotel where the police held the innocents captive, an officer, an apparent idiot, mistakenly shoots and kills a victim who he was instructed only to scare. The pickle that the filmmakers create – him being unfunctionally dumb, unable to effectively absorb instruction, then taking decisive action with potentially enormous consequences, both moral and legal – is attractive in terms of it being a lone sprout of observable conflict within the story. I could feel an insipid grain of pity growing in me for this murderous racist. The filmmakers enliven the point-of-view, however unintentionally, of the police. It's hard to overstate how big of a moral failure that is.<br/><br/>By pairing an unflinching, literal depiction of the ""Action,"" as it's portrayed, with the police perspective, the movie weaponizes the binary structure of film against its own audience. Black characters and, indeed, the actors portraying them, are turned into dart boards in a prolonged torture-porn sequence reminiscent of The Passion of the Christ, the end result of which felt disturbing for all the wrong reasons. <br/><br/>As a consolation, Detroit did reaffirm the awful power of the cinema – perhaps the last bastion of binary visual storytelling wherein people actually voluntarily admit themselves into a black hole where cell phones and chatting are forbidden, even shamed (how long can this last?). Without ability to swipe the screen or fall into a Youtube sinkholes, or meander through Netflix, we are at the mercy of what's in our face. I can almost hear Alex Delarge, bound and wailing for it to stop, trapped inside of a film that itself wonders: why do some people get off on violence?"

"ReganRebecca","7","1","6","22 August 2017"," Bigelow gets it wrong
","I'm a huge fan of director Kathryn Bigelow and when I heard that she was making this film and when rumours leaked out that it was going to primarily be focused on the Algiers motel murders I was more excited than ever. It seemed like the perfect project for Bigelow to tackle. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the result is a messy, gloopy, half-committed mess and Bigelow never quite succeeds at bringing to life a half-baked script.<br/><br/>Now to start off the film is not solely focused on the Algiers Motel incident. It's a film in three parts, the first dealing with the start of the riots in Detroit, the second zeroing in on the terror at the Algiers, and the third showing the trial that happened as a result of the Algiers murders. <br/><br/>Right away Bigelow gets it wrong. The rioting that took place is poorly explained and she and writer Mark Boal actually mostly shows the start of the riots from the perspective of the police, bizarrely making it seem like rioters were just interested in looting despite the fact that there were multiple reasons why they were angry and lashing out. As a result the first third of the movie is just like a noxious clash of violence and terror as Bigelow introduces and obliterates so many characters, the violence seeming random and unending and not in a good way. The final third of the movie is similarly sloppy; I've seen court room dramas handled with more grace, and subtlety on Law & Order. <br/><br/>However the middle section, at the Algiers, is where most of the pieces come together. If there's one thing to trust Bigelow on it's scenes of torture and she spares nothing when it comes to these scenes. Now I've heard criticism saying that these scenes amount to torture porn and I disagree, the violence in this section is necessary to show just how brutal what happened was. Bigelow isn't glorying in the moment but she isn't flinching away from it either. This happened and she wants her audiences to know it and understand it and feel angry and hurt and ashamed because of it. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the rest of the movie just doesn't rise to the level of the middle section leaving the film as a half-baked mess. Only because Bigelow is such a talent is the film still somewhat worthwhile to watch because despite everything there is much to criticize and some to admire. <br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are the cast (almost uniformly stellar but Anthony Mackie, Algee Smith, John Boyega and Jacob Latimore are standouts) and the costumes. There may not be many speaking roles for women in the film but there were a lot of women extras and the clothes they wear are FANTASTIC.<br/><br/>A missed opportunity from Bigelow."

","From the creators of The Hurt Locker & Zero Dark Thirty comes another sharp-edged thriller that's brutal, violent & unsettling from start to finish. Encapsulated with a volatile atmosphere, unfolding with raw intensity & overflowing with charged emotions, Detroit takes hold of the viewers attention within its first few minutes and doesn't let go until the very end.<br/><br/>Based on the infamous Algiers Motel incident that took place during the 1967 riots in Detroit, the film re-enacts the fateful night that saw a group of police officers stepping out of their line of duty when they responded to an earlier complaint with retribution rather than justice on their minds and went further than just beating up the nine residents that they rounded up.<br/><br/>Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, Detroit finds the esteemed filmmaker employing all her trademarks to capture the chaotic aura of the story's provocative content, and she manages to keeps things tight & tense at all times. The drama is gripping throughout and doesn't dial down on violence while the grim mood is further amplified by its frenzied camera-work & slick editing.<br/><br/>The Algiers Motel setting is finely detailed and the entire riotous ambiance is effectively recreated. The performances are no slouch as every cast member contributes with an emotionally compelling input and play their part as per the scene requirements. The strongest act comes from Will Poulter who sells his racist cop character so aggressively that it overshadows the other actors' inputs.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Detroit is a nail-biting dramatization of a historical tragedy that may not be as accomplished as Bigelow's previous two directorial efforts but it is a sturdily crafted period piece that shares much similarity with the current climate of racism in America and shows that not much has changed in the last 50 years. Brought to life with cut-throat fierceness & further strengthened by solid performances from its cast, Detroit comes thoroughly recommended."

"Anyanwu","8","1","7","21 August 2017"," High mark for exposure.
","SPOILER ALERT: Saw the film opening weekend. Had to, I'm from Detroit. Gave it an 8 on IMDb just for exposing the story to the general public. The actor that portrayed Officer David Senak, the main racist officer, may get an academy nomination. My understanding is that he was played close to the real man. He shot 5/6 people during the riot. My understanding is that the guard, Dismukes, played by Boyega actually brutalized some of the teens. He is portrayed as a hero but was the opposite. Those who testified specified that HE tortured THEM, so there is not mistake about that. It was he that was a consultant to the film therefore him coming out as he did, as a hero trying to help, makes sense. The main issue was there was no context of how this came to be. The revolt came as a result of...? No context of the buildup and no context of what happened after regarding the Algiers. There were people's trials, as I understand, at the Shrine of the Black Madonna, where people where packed in to address the situation. So the revolt just shows the audience people stealing etc etc. So no context of the rebellion, the security guard took part in the beatings and did not testify at all. That being said, having been around the film industry, I'm guessing this played out one of two ways. Filmmaker is a women. She wants to make this film about 1967 Detroit. Studios will not give her money to do a complete story as it was, Oscar or not. She's still a female filmmaker. So you do this movie. OR she just wanted to tie in current events with this film and only focus on how things have not changed. Showing... the audience what you see now is no different than what it always has been. DETROIT is how it has been. In cold blood. The Detroit police, was, ""the gestapo"" and that's what they did. They killed. Bigelow just wanted to focus on the complete racist, and evilness of the Detroit Police specifically Officer Senak and how what he did at the Algiers, killing those teens, is not any different than the police brutality now."

It ran longer than it could've but it held my interest. the acting is spectacular, especially Poulter's performance. Directing and cinematography were good too, but keep in mind this story is impossible to depict because the events that took place in the motel were only seen by the people who were in it; they could only resemble the the scenes in the motel based on the victims' perspectives and a few documents.

"Rendanlovell","5","1","7","19 August 2017"," An hour too long.
","'Detroit' is the latest from award-winning director Kathryn Bigelow. As the poster indicates she's helmed such films as 'Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'. Which are pretty solid war flicks. So, naturally, this film had my interest. An Oscar-winning director taking on a film about the Detroit riots in the 60's? Count me in. However, this film is her sloppiest effort yet. If I was to go into this film unaware of who was behind the camera I would be shocked to learn that she has an Oscar to her name. This mainly stems from the structure and characters of the film. Because there really isn't any. But before I go to into that, I should say right off the bat that this is not about the Detroit riots.<br/><br/>This is an isolated event that happened during the riots. Which is the most frustrating part of this movie. There is a solid, sharp, tension filled 90-minute film in this 150-minute exercise. This should have just been about the Algiers Hotel and what happened in it. Get rid of all the Detroit riot stuff, get rid of the fake character development, and focus on this hotel incident. <br/><br/>Instead, it shoves in a near pointless opening act and a completely useless closing act. It opens showing the riots are in full swing. People are throwing cocktails, looting buildings, and setting fire to anything they can get their hands on. It conveys this with a bizarre back and forth cutting between the film and real footage. What's the point of that? If you're going to make a film, make a film. If you're going to make a documentary make a documentary. <br/><br/>Cutting back and forth between real footage and ""dramatized"" action just makes for an incredibly confusing start to a film that is ultimately not even about this. So why include it at all? This is the very definition of filler and it's completely baffling. However, the confusion comes to a head in the films final act. There are roughly thirty minutes of character arcs that literally don't serve any purpose to the film. <br/><br/>What's the point of learning that one of the black guys turned as racist as the cops that beat him? Why should we care about these characters that are hardly fleshed out? What's the literal point of pretending that anyone actually cares about these flat, boring plot devices? If this film opened and closed with the events that happen in the Algier Hotel you don't even need to try and give the characters arcs.<br/><br/>Instead of giving this jumbled, sporadic view of the events focus on one character. Make John Boyega the main character and only show us what he see's. It's literally that easy to fix. Cut out all the unnecessary fat. Instead of making this about five people make it about one. If you do, the event suddenly feels more personal and tense. If all you know is what the main character does then there would be palpable tension because you wouldn't know who to trust either.<br/><br/>Aside from these complaints, I can say that this film isn't bad. The 90 minutes in the Algier hotel are all great. The camera work, costumes, and acting is all pretty much great in this situation. If I were to simply judge the film based on this portion I would be coming across far more positive, but since there's another hour to this film I can't help but feel underwhelmed. The film isn't what it promises to be and has in an unnecessary amount of filler that makes a lot this film boring or uneven. It's not a film that I can call bad but I still don't like it."

Only about 10% of the movie involved the riots itself. The rest was about the police brutality, including the State police and national guard. Justice gone terrible wrong. Lots of violence and some profanity. The movie was very riveting, and I never lost interest while watching it. Keep in mind that the movie is based on fact, and what you see really happened the way it was portrayed on screen. It was a time in our history when good people went bad. Those of us, like me, who were here in Michigan and lived through the 1967 Detroit riots ( which also spread to Pontiac and Saginaw) will get more from this movie then those who were not there.

","It's quite common for a film to be released just as the political environment fits its underlying story.

A laddish prank leads to a unit of militant and aggressive white policemen doling out their brand of abusive 'justice' to a group of young black men and their two white lady companions in a hotel.<br/><br/>It's an uncomfortable watch. Filmed mostly in a hand-held and documentary style (without any amateurism) we feel like one of the bodies on the ground as we watch the policemen way overstep their line, and sadly there is no hero to fly in to save anyone.<br/><br/>The story is an indictment of the US justice system at the time, and covers many different aspects, however there are too many underlying themes that are best left for a more appropriate forum.<br/><br/>If there is a criticism, and it's fair to raise the point, then it is that the film is very partisan. Going by the high level notes, we can't disagree but rights & wrongs will have been done on both sides, but that does not in any way condone the actions of the policemen in this story.<br/><br/>We have a myriad of characters, with Will Poulter at the lead policemen in the unit standing out as the racist, angry and brutal aggressor. The whole set of supporting actors perfectly fits this harrowing story.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this, when it comes to award time this will stand out for various reasons. Should hopefully help to ignite some good discussions too."

","To be honest, when I saw the trailer for this film, I debated whether or not I wanted to see it in the cinema, or if I could wait for DVD, but I went with my gut and went to the cinema, and I'm glad I did, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty). Basically it is July 23rd, 1967, an unlicensed club is celebrating the return of black veterans, the Detroit police stage a raid on the club, while arrests are taking place, a riot soon breaks out, with a mob throwing rocks at officers, looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the 12th Street Riot. Civil authorities, elected representatives, and emergency services are unable to maintain any semblance of order, the Michigan National Guard and Army paratroopers are authorised by Governor George W. Romney to enter Detroit to assist. On the second day of the riots, a looter is being pursued by two cops, officer Philip Krauss (Will Poulter), against orders, mortally wounds the man with a shotgun, but he is allowed to remain on active duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges. Professional black R&B group The Dramatics are hoping to score a recording contract in Detroit, but seconds before their music hall performance, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city, and en route their bus is attacked by rioters. The group subsequently splits up, lead singer Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) rent a room for the night at the local Algiers Motel, while there they meet two white girls, Julie Ann (Hannah Murray) and Karen (Kaitlyn Dever). The girls introduce Larry and Fred to their friends Carl Cooper (Jason Mitchell) and Aubrey Pollard (Nathan Davis Jr.), Carl and another friend play a prank using a starter pistol, this upsets Julie and Karen, they move to the room of Vietnam veteran Greene (Anthony Mackie), while Larry and Fred return to their room. Private security guard Melvin Dismukes (Star Wars' John Boyega) is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters alongside the Guardsmen, Carl sees them across the street, he decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in their direction to frighten them. The troops mistake the blank shots for a sniper attack and open fire on the Algiers, a detachment of police arrive, led by Krauss, who guns down Carl trying to escape, and he plants a knife next to Carl's body as he bleeds to death. The police, accompanied by Dismukes and some Guardsmen, round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, they demand to know who was shooting, while searching Dismukes fails to find a weapon. Krauss orders several suspects be taken to different room and subjected to mock executions, part of a ""game"" to terrify the others into confessing, most of the Guardsmen and soldiers are unwilling to get involved and leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse. Julie and Karen are taken upstairs and begin screaming, Julie gets her clothes are torn off, Dismukes and a Guardsman are disgusted and manage to get them released from custody. Aubrey is killed during his interrogation by one of the remaining Guardsman, who was unaware that earlier executions were fake, Krauss fearing arrest permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear not to say anything to anyone, Greene and Larry agree to do so, but Fred is refuses and is shot dead. The riots start to die down, while working his other job in a factory, Dismukes is arrested, charged with murder, after Julie identified him as being present at the Algiers, Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, everyone except Krauss confesses. Larry's singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, he is a summoned to testify as a witness, the judge ultimately decides not to accept any of the confessions as evidence. Without a solid case, Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendants are acquitted of all charges by the all-white jury, Dismukes confronts Krauss with he truth, but he is powerless to get any justice for the victims. The film ends with explanations of what happened next: Dismukes moved to suburbs to escape death threats and resumed his job as a security guard, Krauss and his remained on the force but never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer, he never returned to professional music, in the present day he still lives in Detroit. Also starring John Krasinski as Attorney Auerbach and Jack Reynor as Demens. Boyega is good as the straight forward security guard, Smith is likable as the ambitious soul singer, but it is Poulter who stands out as the aggressive racist white cop, it is unconventional in its approach to the real-life events, the city is in turmoil, which we see some of, but the horrific events in the hotel overwhelms the majority, the film is claustrophobic and disturbing with the treatment of African-American people in the time it is set, it certainly delivers the ""Black Lives Matter"" message, all together it is gripping and provocative period crime drama. Very good!"
"Skaigear","8","1","8","18 August 2017"," Enthralling, powerful, and at times hard to watch
","Detroit is a historical drama thriller directed by Kathryn Bigelow, based on true events during the Detroit riots of 1967. Knowing next to nothing about the infamous Algiers Motel incident, I was still excited to see it based solely on how intense and gripping the trailer was. It would be a very interesting movie even if the story was completely fictitious, but knowing everything actually occurred in one form or another really added an extra ounce of gravity to the experience. In fact, the script was pieced together using real-life testimonies and court records, and Bigelow even invited living people from the incident as consultants on set during filming to ensure accuracy. End result is a movie that is not only entertaining, but also relevant and keeps you cognizant of issues in the real world.<br/><br/>What I really like about Detroit is how it goes about its business in a very a matter of fact manner. Even though there are a lot of racist white characters in the movie, it certainly does not present the black individuals as completely innocent, which is heartening as reality is not always black or white, but instead shades of gray. The meat of the story is a hostage situation at the aforementioned motel, where three demonic white cops terrorize a group of people, trying to force a confession out of them for a crime they did not commit. The performances are all stellar, especially Will Poulter as the head of the racist cops and John Boyega as the security guard who witnesses the entire event. The acting in the film really helped ground the story in reality, making scenes of sudden violence all the more shocking.<br/><br/>The film does drag a little bit outside of the motel confrontation. It could have removed the historically contextual, but cinematically irrelevant back stories of the characters and just drop us right in the middle of the main conflict at Algiers. I feel it would have made the movie tighter and less bogged down if it sans the onus of attempting to cover the entire riot. Regardless, Detroit is an enthralling, powerful, and at times hard to watch drama thriller that really stays with you after viewing. Even without knowledge of history, it is still a very enjoyable film in its own right that deserves your time at least once."

","""I don't wanna get involved in any civil rights mix up."" This quote from Detroit is actively denied at every turn. An incredible film not just for its actual merit, but also for the shocking lack of justice, and the film's refusal to ignore it. It's not an easy movie to like, though it's easy to recommend. That's the problem. The sad prescience is a large part of its success, seeing how little has changed in 50 years. An eye-opening and in-depth vision of the black experience that's unflinching, empathetic, and well-rounded. In 1967, during a time of civil unrest in Michigan, a trio of police officers wreak racial terror on a house of mostly young black men after mistakenly thinking they have a gun. It's told in a potpourri / cinema verite fashion, with a collection of smaller stories all feeding into the larger narrative. At over 2 hours, some of the smaller moments up-front are weak, but once we get into the actual house and the ensuing legal battle, we're hit with the brutal intensity and infuriating horror these people were forced into through no choice of their own. It's all so overwhelming, it would be difficult to believe if not for all the proof we see on the internet every day. Unfortunately, this happened before there was a camera in every pocket and on every eye. Bigelow gives us a view we couldn't have had, showing every angle with dogged specificity. It's far from the best racially charged film we've gotten recently (odd tonal shifts, on-the-nose dialogue, easily fixed miscommunication), but its whistleblower mentality brings a brutal honesty to an all-too-current topic."

","Anyone who knows anything about Eminem knows that Detroit is an American state that is pretty f*cked up. The state has been known for its constantly turbulent financial situation, and even going bankrupt in recent years. However, one of Detroit's most notorious moments in history is arguably the race riots of 1967, to which Kathryn Bigelow's new movie takes place. Finishing off her unofficial gritty war film trilogy, Bigelow brings the war to the streets, focusing on one particular night and event during the 1967 Detroit race riots, the Algiers Motel incident. Bigelow delivers on her unflinching, documentary/ Paul Greengrass style of filmmaking, in what is probably her most traumatic film to date.<br/><br/>The film begins with an animated montage of exposition to explain how black people came to live in Detroit, and why they eventually rioted. At first, I thought I was watching a short film before the actual film started, as the colours and animation style completely clash with Bigelow's gritty directing style and tone. Alas I was not, the animation was the intro to Detroit and immediately got me thinking ""this could've been done better."" The animation, although good, doesn't fit and is far too short to really deliver on the exposition it aimed to convey, leaving me still unaware as to why the riots actually started. We then cut to a celebration at an all black, unofficial bar, to which gets raided by police and riots soon ensue. Further research revealed that this bar was created due to the poor treatment of black people in normal bars, so they made their own, and when that got shut down it became the straw the broke the camels back. Detroit could've and should've introduced the film this way, with the facts behind how the riots started. What we get is a nice animation, but one whose purpose is rather weak, and Bigelow can do better than what she offers here.<br/><br/>We are now thrown into the riots and lives of people within Detriot, both cops and citizens. Bigelow has an obvious bias towards African Americans, and against the police in this film. This bias has been seen to be rather unpopular and controversial, but Bigelow is no stranger to making controversial statements in her films, 2013's Zero Dark Thirty heavily suggested that the American military used torture as an interrogation method during the hunt for Bin Laden. In Detroit, the actors who play black citizens are presented as everyday people, while the cops are presented as horror villains/monsters. Bigelow's direction, as well as Mark Boal's script, brilliantly portray the cop characters as evil, frightening and inhuman beings that even you are fearful of. Ultimately, I attribute the scare factor of the cops to the actor's outstanding performances, especially Will Poulter who utterly shines in this film. The entire cast is excellent as an ensemble, John Boyega, Algee Smith are also outstanding, however, it is Will Poulter as the racist brute, Krauss that steals the show in this film. Having previously made a name for himself in comedy with films such as We Are The Millers, seeing Poulter in such a disturbing role excellently exhibits his acting range with this extremely drastic juxtaposition of roles.<br/><br/>The film mainly revolves around an hour or so long sequence, the Algiers Motel incident. Bigelow cranks up the tension in this film and does not turn it down, with help from a script that feels, for the most part, natural, and an absolutely astonishing cast. Bigelow's documentary style makes you feel you are actually watching this horrific event happen, that coupled with some of the most uncomfortable acting to ever witness, Detroit feels less of a cinematic event and more of a traumatic one, to which this was back in 1967. You feel this has been documented and not filmed or particularly staged, as what you witness will disturb you and leave a lasting imprint, I have to say that the one word that best describes this film is; traumatic.<br/><br/>Although Kathryn Bigelow is a great filmmaker, she does tend to overuse hand-held camera in her films, and Detroit is possibly Bigelow's worst use of the technique. The technique is again overused and so too is zooming, which are not film techniques held in high regard. Detroit reaches stupidly bad levels of shaky cam and zooming as some shots, albeit very few, literally lose the subject of the shot altogether, take note of the Fred going to work scene. As well as this, John Boyega's character seemed almost fictional as he simply does nothing in this film, however, due to the reality of his character, I can understand this is probably close to what actually happened.<br/><br/>Finally, the film's biggest issue lies in its lack of context and general information. The film offers a very obvious and strong bias, hell the script even features ham handed dialogue from other cops saying things like; ""Who could do something like this?"" when we all know it's the Detroit police. Alas, this film has some rather large plot holes and/or areas to question. The film even states at the end that they don't know for sure what happened, which feels like the film is chickening out of it full on onslaught of Detroit's police force. The film does pick up on enough evidence that would convict these cops in today's far less, openly racist society, however, it equally has enough holes within it to get that evidence dismissed. Although I personally believe this film is close to the truth, if exaggerated, you can't however, ignore the flaws.<br/><br/>With excellent acting, a decent script and great directing, Detroit is an unflinching and frankly, traumatic film. Detroit does have its flaws and plot holes, but so too did people's recollections of the Algiers incident. This film will enrage you, but that reaction in itself proves the film has serviced its purpose, to provide a form of justice for the people who got none."
"jdesando","Null","1","11","7 August 2017"," Hyper-realistic, depressing, engrossing docudrama.
","""Sniper in the window."" National Guardsman, right before the window and the little girl were fired on.<br/><br/>The Detroit racial riots of 1967 have often been described as a war zone, and that's what director Kathryn Bigelow has done in her docudrama Detroit. Just as in The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, she has taken strife-ridden history and recreated it on the screen to such a degree of terror realism, almost hyper-realism, that ""based on a true story"" is too tame to do justice to her reenactment.<br/><br/>That she is a Northern-California woman depicting a seminal black experience is both problematic and astonishing: ""What better way to use your white privilege than to undermine it, raise questions about it, leverage it on behalf of black and brown people who usually don't have a voice in the matter at all."" Bigelow <br/><br/>The operative motif for me is the music hall, where, after riots were fomented by a gratuitous police raid of an unregistered black club, Martha and the Vandellas sing No Place to Hide and a young male foursome called The Dramatists wait to go on stage. The promise of the young group is shattered by police clearing the hall for safety's sake. The disintegration of social opportunity and the danger of modern racism is the heart of the unrest.<br/><br/>The overly-long sequence at the Algiers Motel is the central violent piece, where black men and white women are rousted from the hotel, and three men are murdered by a rabid group of Detroit police with the National Guard acquiescing. The police's torture of these benign revelers, albeit one has shot a starter gun at the police from a window, looks as if the cops will eventually be exonerated of their crimes because of the riotous circumstances.<br/><br/>More importantly, the next 50 years will be fraught with such white violence against blacks that we can all wonder what we have learned, if anything.

","I can't breath! George floyd
July 23, 1967, May 25, 2020, 8pm. Fifty years later, racial discrimination and violent law enforcement by some police have not changed much. What we see is not hope but despair.
If weapons are the tools given to the police to defend justice, the violent law enforcement is indeed the trigger to turn the police into criminals. The history of racial discrimination accompanied by national development has long been deeply rooted in people's minds.
Movie art comes from life but is higher than life. I did not deliberately choose this film for ""Detroit"", but as I gradually went deeper, the atmosphere of despair and suffocation made me truly understand the horror of racial discrimination and violent law enforcement. The separation between the film and reality is gradually being broken. With the wave of anti-racial discrimination in the United States, maybe those criminals were not brought to justice 50 years ago. I hope that this kind of thing does not happen today.
I hope everyone understands that racial discrimination is all harm and no benefit. Whether it is white, black, or yellow, we are all human beings with basic human rights, freedom, democracy, and fairness, which have been universal since we were born. Power. And this problem is not just a national problem, it is a problem for all of us. I know that if you don't act, the change will never come, but this change should not be to fight back with violence. This world may be so real and desperate, but I hope to quote Mr. Martin Luther King:
I have a dream today.
I dream that one day, the valley will rise, the mountain will fall, the ups and downs will be a smooth road, the Holy Light will reveal, and the world will be full!"

Boyega is dynamite, his raw, bare constraint as an actor and his character's struggles moving me to tears throughout.
Bigelow's camera is always motivated so despite the film's length, you look away and you're likely to miss something. The disconnect and then sudden connection between stories has a classic movie feel, more than any Bigelow, Detroit is an underrated masterclass of editing.

Because the characterizations are so defined by in-the-moment action and individual-as-community representation, there isn't always a sense of background and internal motivation that might have explained specific behavior, reaction, attitude or accountability; the audience is forced to make their judgments based on knowledge of historical context and personal opinion.

","1967. The police and black inhabitants of Detroit seem perpetually in a state of conflict, largely due to the police's biased, heavy-handed attitude towards African-Americans. This comes to a head when the police raid an unlicensed black club, causing the local residents to riot. The State Police and National Guard are called in and Detroit starts to resemble a war zone. On a fateful night, the local police round up some suspects at the Algiers Motel in connection with (what they believe is) sniper fire. The police handling of the situation soon gets out of hand.<br/><br/>A thought-provoking drama, directed by Kathryn Bigelow (The Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty) and based on a true story. Shows quite well how police can abuse their power and not treat citizens equally, fairly or civilly. A great exposition of police brutality and racial prejudice (and, to a degree, injustice - more about that later).<br/><br/>However, not perfect. The scenes inside the Algiers Motel are drawn out to the nth degree. The point of the scenes was made quite quickly and drawing it out just seemed like it was drawn out for the sake of it. It became rather cartoony after a while, especially the way the cops behaved.<br/><br/>All the characters also seem so one-dimensional, either being ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"", rather than having some characters who are just going about their jobs and lives. Some of this seems to be Bigelow trying to balance the actions of some individuals with those of others within the same group, as is to say, ""Hey, they're not all like that"". For example, after escaping the Algiers Motel a black man is confronted by a police officer who turns out to be helpful and nice - too nice.<br/><br/>With less time spent on the incident and more on the court case we could have had an incredibly powerful drama on injustice (in addition to covering the themes of racial prejudice and police brutality). Instead the injustice seems like an after-thought, with the police brutality the main focus. It would also have made for a better-paced movie - instead of the slow-fast-slowish we ended with."

","Detroit is a dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past, a provocative period piece.

Any viewer aware that the film takes poetic licence will have some doubt what is true and what isn't.
It's an immersive experience which places the viewer at the heart of the unfolding chaos. The cinematography is brilliant. Vintage lenses are used to capture multi-angle digital footage interweaving seamlessly with archive material. However, there isn't an authenticity of dialogue, a charge that the screenwriter accepted. 
John Boyega gives a careful performance as the security guard who is caught between his race and his uniform. Will Poulter succeeds in characterising a corrupt, racist cop, 'Officer Krauss', a fictional character said to be a combination of a number of different officers from the Detroit Police Department who were present at the Algiers Motel that night.

The way that the film manages to have such great characters with individual story arcs makes them all the more sympathetic and their motives all the more clear and logical.

","During one of the darkest nights in U.S. history in July 1967, a group of young black boys and a couple of white girls lived their worst nightmare at the Algier's motel in Detroit. The day ended up with three dead bodies lying on a bloody floor after being shot by ruthless police officers of Detroit Police Department. The DPD was by that time 90 percent white and most of them with anti-black prejuices. The Detroit riots terminated 47 lives during five obscure days of fires, looting, burglary and violent doubtful police reactions.
'Detroit' begins with the DPD intervening one of those unlicensed afterhours bars on the infamous 12th street, where a big group of black people are gathering to celebrate the safe return of two Vietnam veterans. While the police puts everyone under arrest in the back of several vans, a mob of furious neighbors starts to form, challenging the police and throwing stuff at their cars, which triggers the riot with a violent confrontation and the later burning of several business.
However, Director Katheryn Bigelow, in a successful attempt to put the feet of the audience in the shoes of the innocent people of Detroit (and pretty much everywhere you can find black communities), chooses to follow Larry (played by Algee Smith), the lead singer of an uprising music band named 'The Dramatics'. After a concert is cancelled due to dangerous conditions, two of the musicians take shelter in the peaceful and chill Algiers Motel, where a safe atmosphere will keep them out of any trouble. 
Before that, Bigelow already makes a statement that Detroit was a city at war, and police were not giving any break to anyone who looked suspicious and/or black. That is exactly how the movie works. By hand-holding the camera most of the movie with close-up shots appearing on the frame very often, the viewer can experience what was that night like and get immersed in the challenge of being black during the civil rights movement in America, where you could get shot under 'self defense' claims that usually no one could prove anyway.
This is a movie that reminds us that race has always been an issue in the American reality and that it has been closely tied to its history. There is no American history without slavery and race issues. Bigelow wants to make the viewer rethink and wonder how much have we really gone forward in terms of civil rights. How much can police brutality overpass the law and how far can 'self-defense' be believable as a reason to fire a gun to kill."

We don't need an hour or more of back story before the main incident takes place. The script is middling and fails to make any of the characters on either side very distinctive, and the emphasis in the advertising given to John Bogeya's superficial and minor role is a surprise. The black characters are sympathetic but they're given very little to work with other than to be victimised, although the actors including Anthony Mackie are fine.

The central set-piece - and even, to a lesser extent, its much slower aftermath - is compelling, vigorous stuff that's unrelenting in its tension and urgency, though. It never just feels like one race against another, but rather humans placed in a situation where good and evil are shown in shades of grey. If you're even remotely human, the brutality and oppression of the piece will make your blood boil and the flick pulls no punches when it comes to the injustice on display. The lack of any comeuppance almost feels like a lack of narrative closure - you truly want to see the perpetrators punished, and this alone is an achievement - but instead it simply emulates the messy and unfulfilling way that life often works. While the story mightn't be entirely accurate to the real-life scenario (the events of which were never accurately established in court), it does work as an examination of what could have happened in a terrible situation that took the lives of three young men, one which is still scarily relevant today. 7/10"

","A diehard fan of Bigelow, I really expected more here. <br/><br/>The story, like so many others, tells a tale of true life back in a dark time in our history. It helps us not forget the evil which lies in man's soul, as well as brings us happiness knowing and observing how far we have come and evolved since that time. <br/><br/>Bigelow does the story well, although there are partings here and there from fact. The musicians, for instance, are cleverly tweaked chronologically to play into the story. However, none of the departures from truth negatively (in my opinion) effect the overall story. <br/><br/>The cinematics (and this is from a Bigelow fan) were not her best work. Recognizable landmarks placed into the script could have helped the viewer become closer to the story being told. Instead, it felt like stock footage instead of actual eyewitnessing. <br/><br/>The theme is where it got very confusing. Although the purpose is obviously to tell a story which happened long ago, the viewer is left with wondering what the producer's purpose was here. <br/><br/>In today's society, the public is overwhelmingly fatigued from the cries of wolf every time force is used against differing colors of men. The news media succinctly adds to this by mentioning races in use of force reports. Even the Black Lives Matter movement, whose byline of ""Hands Up Don't Shoot"" is founded and based on the Ferguson shooting, adds to this by continuing to use a byline and message found to be false by the Justice Department's investigation and the fifty-three independent witnesses in that incident. Continuing and never-ending screams, most often accompanied by violence, of mysterious ""systemic"" or ""institutional"" racism (aka ""ghost hunting"") is what kills any hope of the message being meaningful and fatigues society to ignore that one-in-a-million legitimate causes for complaint. <br/><br/>So was the message from the producer to add to the pile of today's faux-outrage? If so, it was not clear. Or is the producer's purpose to draw a distinction between the TRUE racist behaviors and assaults and deaths of the 1960s, thereby highlighting in contrast to today's cries of racism with, if ever, little fact and at best circumstantial opinion used to levy such great claim. Again, it is not clear. <br/><br/>For myself, I got the message that the producer was trying to highlight what it TRULY means to have racist cops compared to today's complaints of the same never coming close. As well, the message I saw was celebratory in how far we have evolved and how, minus a couple of drops in an ocean of policemen, we do not have that problem today. If this was truly the message, this movie would have been well done and truly a ""thinker"" - something to ponder - if the message was indeed as such and was strikingly clearer. For now, one must wonder because that message isn't clear enough to determine either way. The message you see may be completely different than mine."

","""Detroit"" seeks to reconstruct the July 25, 1967 murders in the Algiers Motel during the heart of the summer riots in Detroit. Because the facts of what happened in the motel were skewed during the show trial of three Detroit police officers, the filmmakers have attempted to interview eyewitnesses in order to reconstruct the sequence of events at the Algiers Motel. The film largely succeeds as a quasi documentary presented as a conventional Hollywood feature film.<br/><br/>The film presents essential background about the Great Migration of the turn of the twentieth century in which as many as six million African-Americans moved to the northern industrial cities in search of work and the American Dream. But in Detroit of the post-World War II years, which was the fifth largest city in the nation, there was a mass exodus to the suburbs, primarily of the white middle class. The Detroit of 1967 was a highly segregated metropolis with a total African-American population of 40% and a police force that was 95% white. This was the backdrop for the riots in the boiling summer of 1967.<br/><br/>From the historical and sociological perspectives, the trial scene was the most important in the film. In an outrageous miscarriage of justice, the three Detroit police officers were found not guilty of the murders of three men at the Algiers motel. It is mind-boggling to contemplate who the all-white jury members believe killed the victims? In one of the best lines in the script, the upshot of the trial is that ""police criminality needs to be treated the same as any other criminality."" After the passage of fifty years, the same question might be raised in the American court system in 2017.<br/><br/>In its aesthetics and construction, ""Detroit"" was not a perfect film. The close-ups and the hand-held camera eventually lost their impact due to over use. A number of the characters and situations were underdeveloped. For example, what were Julie Ann Hysell and her friend Karen doing in Detroit at the heart of the riots? Hysell even appears in one of the bonus segments of the DVD, yet does not fill us in on this basic exposition. One of the young women was apparently the daughter of an Ohio judge. Yet it was never clear what motivated them to visit the heart of Detroit in the summer of 1967. <br/><br/>Another poorly constructed plot strand concerns the film's principal villain, the racist cop named Krauss. Early in the film, Krauss shoots and kills a man who was looting groceries. Krauss is called in to the office of his supervisor, Detective Tanchuck. The detective advises Krauss that he will be facing murder charges, but chooses not to suspend the officer, sending him right back on the streets to the vicinity of the Algiers Motel. The murder charges for the first killing are never raised again in the film. Did Tanchuck simply bury his report? The film never explains.<br/><br/>1,100 National Guardsmen were called into Detroit in the summer of 1967, along with special combat units. Tanks were lined up and down 12th Street. The film is successful in conveying a major American city as a ""no-man's land."" Decent citizens like Melvin Dismukes were caught up the terror of racist cops in the City of Detroit. As indicated on one of the excellent bonus segments on the DVD, it was suggested that all police trainees today should view this film. And they should also follow the advice of a kind nurse in the hospital who offered good counsel to the visitors of one of the victims of the riots: ""Be gentle."""

","For her latest feature, following 2008's Oscar winner The Hurt Locker and 2012's Zero Dark Thirty, visionary director Kathryn Bigelow takes us to a different war-zone altogether, the 1967 Detroit riots. While it lacks the nerve-racking tension of the Iraq-set The Hurt Locker and the engrossing detail of the hunt for, capture and execution of Osama bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty, Detroit lays bare police brutality and civil unrest with all the discomfort of a well-made horror movie, as the paths of various characters caught up in the chaos sweeping the city lead to the Algiers Motel, where many are about to experience the most traumatic experience of their lives, and for some, the last experience they will ever have.<br/><br/>Bigelow attempts to contextualise the central incident by depicting the roots of the rioting: An illegal blind pig in a black Detroit community is raided by predominantly white police, who take an unnecessarily heavy-handed approach to rounding up the bar's inhabitants. A small crowd quickly starts to gather outside, and soon enough the police are being driven out of the area, and neighbourhood shops are being destroyed and looted. Both the Army and National Guard are brought in to bring the troubles under control, while Detroit police hunt down any looters hoping to go unnoticed in the crowds. It's a good thirty minutes before we reach the Motel, and this time is spent establishing the various characters who will become major players later on. These characters are painted in broad strokes, but it's effective enough in establishing the kind of world they inhibit, and why they have good reason to fear the sight of a policeman, innocent or not.<br/><br/>At the film's heart is Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega), a security guard caught somewhere in between two worlds. He is a figure of authority and takes his job incredibly seriously, but he's also black in an institution made up of mainly white folks, so he finds himself also having to toe the line when dealing with officers clearly harbouring racist feelings. There's also Larry Reed (Algee Smith), the lead singer of R&B group The Dramatics, whose big-break concert is cancelled because of the riots. Larry takes his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) to the Algiers Motel to lay low while the riots calm down, and the two pass the time by chatting to two girls (played by Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever). The girls are actually prostitutes, and the group wind up caught up in a prank involving firing a blank-shooting starter pistol at the police through the window. Believing to be under attack from a sniper, the police and National Guard storm the Motel and begin a night of humiliation and terror for those simply caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>At the Motel, cop and baby-faced bigot Krauss (Will Poulter) starts to systematically strip away the humanity of the residents, using everything from intimidation, violence and mind-games to find the lethal weapon that doesn't exist. Flanked by Ben O'Toole and Jack Reynor, Poulter is magnificent, digging deep to somehow find a shred of humanity in a character so inherently evil. As is Boyega, who manages to hit you with a gut-punch during the final act as the seriousness of the situation - and his role in it - suddenly overwhelms him. The film goes on to detail the immediate aftermath and the subsequent trial of the three police officers, bringing in an unnerving slimy John Krasinski as the defence. At just shy of two and a half hours, Detroit feels overlong despite Bigelow's best efforts to keep the film moving at a pace. The final half hour could have been wrapped up in text, but it does pay testament to the survivors, some of whom were left with mental scars from which they would never fully recover. Detroit's real power stems from the harrowing, maddening centrepiece at the Algiers, a terrible abuse of power not terribly different from some of the news stories we still hear about today."

","It's 1967 Detroit. A police raid escalates into a full blown riot. National Guard is called in. The local police is dominantly a white force. A black singing group is forced to cancel their show and they spend the night at the Algiers Motel where they meet a couple of white girls. Policeman Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) shoots a man in the back who manages to escape. When the man is later found dead, murder charges are recommended against Krauss. Despite that, he's allowed to continue his patrol. Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega) is a grocery store security guard trying to keep the peace when a National Guard squad arrives. Sounds of gunfire from the Algiers put the group in heightened fear as everybody descend on the motel looking for a sniper.<br/><br/>This is a harrowing true tale directed by Kathryn Bigelow. John Boyega and his character is great. Baby-faced Will Poulter delivers a compelling villain. His partner is more the traditional greasy haired racist. The band is solid with a great lead performance by Algee Smith. I do have a problem with Carl who plays the clown very broadly. I have some issues with certain moments but the whole night is a harrowing tale well told. Dismukes being arrested is a great sequence. However, the trial can get a little repetitive. I prefer the ending to wrap up quicker. With such a tough film, it's hard to sit through the extended closing act."
"wackywhovian11","6","0","1","22 December 2017"," Crooked A-- Cops!
","Detroit is based on a true story about the 1967 riots and how these white cops treated these black kids in a hotel and all over Detroit. Will Poulter plays one of the crooked a-- cops in the film. Oh my God this guy was rude to not just blacks but everyone whites, black etc. John Boyega plays a security guard who was just trying to help out his fellow black citizens and got mixed up in a sick mind game with the Detroit PD who terriozed these kids who didn't do anything but be at the wrong place at the wrong time.
 That's basically it. A movie for me was a bit hard to watch because I'm white it makes ALL white people look bad. NOT all white people go around being rude, hateful and racist to other minorities. Should you watch this film well I will admit their are a lot of language, violence and images that might be too much for some people but it's based on true events so they had to do that to tell the story. I rented it from Redbox so it was only a dollar so not that big of a loss if you don't care for it. I gave it a 6 out of 10 because I did like the acting and the music in the film but that was about it."
"cruise01","8","0","2","21 December 2017"," Intense and edge of your seat with a couple of narrative perspectives of the Detroit riot.
","Detroit is an intense crime drama film that holds you to the seat to the final moments of the movie. Being based on a true story during the Detroit riot in July 1967, when the African americans were rising up against the police when they are mistreating them. <br/><br/>The action begins when a police raid stops a party for a returned veteran. And from there are a couple of narrative stories one about a lead singer from the group called The Dramatics. When their concert was interrupted from the riots, they hold up in a hotel for the night. Then, there is a security guard Melvin (John Boyega) who is protecting a store from being attacked from the riot. When he hears gunshots leading to the hotel. He goes to check it out. Along with three officers Philip (Will Poulter), and two others. Philip and his two other officers try to hold up the hotel were there is nothing but African americans and two girls Julie (Hannah Murray) and Karen (Kaitlyn Dever). Philip and his two men hold up the people in the hotel and beat them down until someone gives up the suspect that shot a gun out of the hotel window. <br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow does well building up the suspense. She did decent with The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty. Detroit starts with the intense build up with the few narrative stories that eventually connect when they meet up in the climatic hotel. The emotionality with the characters to see innocent lives getting harassed and beat. It is a tough film to watch. John Boyega plays Melvin a guy that is for hire as a security to protect shops from being vandalized. A guy that holds his emotions when he sees people being mistreated horribly. Will Poulter playing an officer that is on the urge of hunting down any one he sees. As we see him in the opening sequence with his officers chasing a guy down, who was just carrying grocery bags for his family. The tone and direction says it all with these characters and how brutal they can be. <br/><br/>The climatic sequence when these characters are being forced to face against a wall, as one by one are being interrogated with brutality and fear. It is an intense sequence, but well done with the direction and intensity. <br/><br/>The couple of things I felt like it did not work with the film is after its second act. The film slows down and never gets back up. It goes through the court scene and some aftermath of the lead singer from The Dramatics having trouble and being shaken up from the treatment. Also, I felt like they could have trimmed and edited down like 20 minutes or so. Some scenes felt like they have been playing for too long like a long monologue singing sequence with the singer. <br/><br/>Overall, Detroit is a good crime drama film. The direction built up the suspense for the first two acts of the film. And it never slowed down until the end. The actors were great. The plot was brutal to see with the events of the riot but true. <br/><br/>I rate the film 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend checking the film out if you care about historical true stories."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","2","17 December 2017"," Gripping, powerful, and hard to watch.
","I can definitely see why the critical reception wasn't higher than it was (not that it wasn't favorable). I think the beginning and bookend portions of the film are flawed. I appreciate that Boal/Bigelow wanted an epilogue, I just wish it had been executed a lot better. Other than the section of the film that is the main event, it's a little clunky and messy. Still, the majority of the film is gripping, powerful, and heartbreaking. It's definitely not going to make for a super fun and light Saturday night, but I do think the film has gotten a bit lost in the shuffle among all the other Oscar contenders, unfortunately. This is definitely one of the best ensemble casts of the year, with everyone delivering really strong work. It's great to again see Jason Mitchell as a stand-out."

"burlesonjesse5","7","0","1","13 December 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Detroit
","Detroit is my latest review. It depicts Motown's 12th Street Riot from the summer of 1967. The movie also hones in on the Algiers Motel Incident where three denizens were beaten and killed by the city's finest.<br/><br/>So yeah, I may have been born and raised in Michigan. In spite of this, I'm just now learning of these true events in the form of two hours and twenty-three minutes. 2017's Detroit is quite the eye opener.<br/><br/>For much of the way, Detroit is a crippling film to watch. It feels like the poster child for police brutality, the poster child for racial rigidity, and the rightful epitome of near torture porn. You the viewer, never feel totally safe while taking in this vehicle (no pun intended to The Motor City).<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow gives Detroit a shaky cam feel and a slight, documentary style. With Zero Dark Thirty, The Hurt Locker, and now this current release, Bigelow can aptly be called the female Paul Greengrass or maybe even the harder-edged version of Steven Soderbergh.<br/><br/>Detroit in fits and starts, almost veers completely into ""popcorn"" territory. Bigelow uninhibited, lets the violence spill onto the screen. The barbaric images rendered, are sensationalized, nearly for show, and nearly in the form of carnival antics. So OK, they might be pertinent to Detroit's mosaic storytelling. However, this still kept me from saddling the film with a four star rating.<br/><br/>Certain flaws aside, Detroit has an overwhelming sense of time and place which is a strong point. Kathryn Bigelow works well with a huge cast (John Boyega, Anthony Mackie, Algee Smith), a vast canvas, and an unsteady lens that is always peeking in. Heck, Detroit the movie feels like real life.<br/><br/>Bigelow also provides some archive footage on the side, some war zone residue, and a constant sense of danger to her proceedings. Detroit the city, is made to look like Iraq or a medium-sized village during the Battle of Guadalcanal. Talk about unsettling.<br/><br/>In conclusion, would I put the paranoia-laden Detroit in my top ten via 2017? Possibly. I'll know come January of next year. Detroit's rating: 3 stars."
"powermandan","7","0","1","5 December 2017"," Adequate Recreation For A Dark Time.
","There's been lots of movies as of recent about racial equality. All their hearts are in the right places, but none are really great or come out at a high degree. 'Detroit' doesn't either, but it comes the closest.<br/><br/>'Detroit' was released fifty years after the riots in 12 Street in Detroit. Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow brings this time to the screen in a riveting fashion. Although not as good as her 'Zero Dark Thirty' or 'The Hurt Locker,' 'Detroit' does show that she is one of the best directors working today.<br/><br/>This movie deals with a mob of black people from Detroit that riot the streets to make a statement against racist police brutality. As a result of the riots, police get worse and so do the riots, so the vicious circle of violence is plunging the city into the ground. The first 20 minutes or so is just showing the web of violence with no development, just war on the street. Bigelow's two big films are war movies, so it was only natural to try to use her specialty in a different light. I found it unnecessary. I understand that the riots were basically wars on the streets, but riots tend to feature a great sense of brutality and unease. The movie doesn't get deep enough into the horrors of the riots.<br/><br/>After awhile of seeing the violence in the streets, the movie finally switches gears and finally introduces the audience to characters we can root for in this awful time. Developing characters is key for the audience to get a real sense of danger they face. At the centre of it is the R&B group The Dramatics. They want a record deal and for the violence to just stop. They wind up at the Algiers Motel where they meet up with a couple of white girls. Having a good time, one of them has a toy gun that looks real and scares everyone. It's pretty funny. The gun can use blanks and shoots it as a joke to show how insane the police force has gone. The police arrive thinking there's snipers and violently raid their room. The room is far too big to be a motel room, so I didn't buy it entirely. The police violently scare and abuse each person into making them confess to where the gun is. This second act is pretty similar to Truman Capote's 'In Cold Blood.' If you are familiar with 'In Cold Blood,' you will likely appreciate the seemingly coincidental parallels between the two. This large chunk of the film works so well because Bigelow pulls no punches and really tries to evoke emotion though great movie-making and accuracy of police horror. Will Poulter is at his most vicious as the lead cop that terrorizes these innocent people. The 'In Cold Blood' aspect takes up the majority of the film over something trivial. But cops really were like that. The gun was never found, the cops get off scot-free, and no one knows exactly what happened.<br/><br/>Here's why it will always remain a mystery of what exactly happened: the cops were brutalizing these people, keeping them in one position so they could not see everything that was happening. And the cops just stick with their story.<br/><br/>After the 'In Cold Blood' chunk of the film, it sumps into a generic courtroom drama. The first and final acts are too generic to make the movie as a whole live up to its potential. It's similar to 'Cast Away' in that respect: people only want to see Tom Hanks on the island, before and after that are boring.<br/><br/>The cops are one-dimensional and the character development is not very high either, so the overall value does not reach its potential. And two of the three acts are average. Saved by a great middle, 'Detroit' is an adequate movie I recommend to be watched.<br/><br/>3/4"

","I just finished the film & my stomach is still taut . The performances were engrossing & I was repulsed by the behavior of the cops but could not turn away from the portrayal. I liken this to watching Mississippi Burning .....it conjures up all types of emotions. Several people have written that the story tells of what happened but doesn't delve into the why of it. I think that the purpose was to just tell the story of what occurred. The why would take a lifetime to try & explain."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","30 November 2017"," Bigelow and Boal deliver again
","""Detroit"" is an American 2-hour-and-20-minute movie from this year (2017). The director is Kathryn Bigelow and her writer is once again Mark Boal. And while this duo taught us about military life in enemy countries in their last two efforts, this one here is entirely about domestic issues. It is set in the city of Detroit back in the 1960s where serious riots got the entire place out of control. Of course, the issue was race conflicts and the Blacks living in the city center (with the Whites leaving to the suburbs) went to the streets to fight for their rights and against discrimination. Let me say a few things here: I am all for equality, but if you are indeed stupid enough to set your own houses and neighborhoods on fire hoping somebody else will build them up for you again, stupid enough to violently attack peaceful fire fighters doing their job, then you deserve all that's coming your way. Same goes for looters. You rob a place, you risk getting shot, no matter if by security, the store's owner or police. So my sympathy with these people is basically non-existent. That doesn't mean that a cop shooting a criminal in the back should go free of course. On the contrary, but he also should not be tried for murder.<br/><br/>With such a complex movie about so provocative issues, it's tough to stick to reviewing the film only without getting in one's own opinion, but I will try to be neutral now. I personally would say this was better than The Hurt Locker, but worse than Zero Dark Thirty overall. Bigelow got in actors at the Oscars with both previous films, but it doesn't seem too likely here. Will Poulter deserves it though, he was pretty amazing and carried a large part of the film mostly on his shoulders. This includes the magnificent middle part too, easily the best of the movie and that was definitely better than a ***/*****. I am of course talking about the escalation inside the house after the long introduction to the political situation back then and before the interrogations and courtroom scenes. The latter, i.e. the third chapter, was also fairly good and it was all better than the early parts that had me scared a bit indeed that Bigelow may miss out this time. Also about the amazing middle part, it needs to be said that it was a psychological thriller situation as good as it gets and the racism factor was really unimportant there, even if the lead cop played by Poulter may have been a racist. I think he was much more of a sadist to be honest. He respected the Black guy from the army a bit, but he would have shot the two girls like everybody else had had there been no consequences for that.<br/><br/>All in all, this was certainly a good watch. Maybe this film will not get the same amount of awards attention like Bigelow's two previous, but that doesn't make it necessarily worse or anything. Technically and as far as the thriller elements are concerned, it was really top-notch and it almost never drags despite the gigantic runtime of almost 150 minutes, which also says a lot. This is a film from back in the day when racism truly was a problem still, even if tolerant Whites were also common. Just look at the two young women. People comparing the racial tensions to our time don't understand a thing and they really should be grateful they were not living back then because you really cannot compare these eras. I mean right now we live during times in which we had a Black guy as President and he got re-elected too. Tolerance is everywhere in the civilized world. Don't even try to say otherwise. Yes racism still exists, in both directions actually, but hate will always exist and it exists at least as significant in other areas like religion and terrorism, a far bigger issue these days that needs addressing now and with all means that help stopping it. Anyway, back to the film: I was a bit surprised how insignificant Boyega's character was really because he seemed major from the title. The music component also didn't do too much for me either, but I can somewhat see why they included it due to the real life references. But the violence as explanation for him never playing in clubs again is honestly fairly shoddy. But these cons are just minor for sure and the positive was more frequent than the negative. This is a film that will have you on the edge of your seat at times. Go see it."
