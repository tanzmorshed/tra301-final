","What more can be said of Raimi's legendary cult-classic that hasn't already been beaten to death like a puss-oozing zombie that crosses paths with Ash? Possibly nothing, but I'll try. <br/><br/>Before Spiderman and before the countless spin-offs of this movie were made or even conceived, Raimi and friends decided to make a low budget zombie flick mainly for fun, and surprisingly it has become a masterpiece of shock and horror. Possibly a perfect example of how to make an entertaining film on a shoe-string budget, The Evil Dead delivers what it promises, the ultimate in grueling horror. Even with it's mild budget and sometimes shaky acting, TED shocks and spooks the audience through chilling atmosphere and some of the most violent effects ever put on film. Those who are squeamish need not apply. As a matter of fact, just run for your girly life.<br/><br/>There are several reasons this film succeeds. First, Raimi's camera work is truly masterful. By using fast camera work and aggressive shots, Raimi has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. His style from behind the camera is absolutely unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the beginning of the film, where the camera alone creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your nails in suspense of what's to come. You feel at any moment someone is going to get their neck chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. One of the most impressive openings I can think of, perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even better once the action starts. Some shots hold for a seeming eternity, and part of you wishes for it to stop for it's unrestrained gore and violence...but the other part of you is getting a sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive shots is where the darkness from the trees begins to chase people, knocking any tree or obstacle down that happens to be in it's way. Truly magnificent technique, however they did it. <br/><br/>TED also succeeds because it's self-aware of the fact that it's a simple zombie movie and never takes itself too seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to do so either. It's meant to be campy, cheesy, revolting and chilling at the same time. There are moments in the film where it seems to be making fun of itself and the genre in general. For this fact alone, one cannot hold certain things against it such as sometimes questionable acting from the supporting cast and sometimes the downright implausibility of certain situations. If you can accept this and you're not put off by mannequin ultra-violence, then you should find yourself on the supporter's side of the fence. I think some don't like it because it can be ridiculous and cheesy in parts, although it was meant to be. Even with the fact that it's sometimes cheesy, there are some downright chilling moments in this film that most horror films nowadays cannot begin to muster. Case in point, the zombie screaming from the cellar door. The zombie growls and howls themselves are enough to send shivers up one's spine. And let's not forget the unforgettable tree love scene, ridiculous and hilarious simultaneously.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least: Bruce Campbell as Ash, the badass of all zombie films. Campbell is Ash, period, and always will be.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is by far the best of the trilogy, and although there could have been more of the chainsaw, this is the definitive zombie film and probably always will be. I feel it succeeds over it's sequels due to it's increased violence and lack of humor in comparison. It's blood, gore, camera work, and shock factor are still formidable even today and are what make this such a cult classic. If you've ever liked any horror film, this is an absolute must-see.<br/><br/>Love or hate it, there it is."
"baumer","10","230","303","10 July 1999"," The ultimate in terror
","It's the early 80's, what do you expect?  This is a scary scary film.  And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead.  And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original.  That is the bottom line.  Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.  You may never look at the forest the same again."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","67","84","11 May 2007"," You don't need a big budget to make an accomplished film
","Sam Raimi's feature length debut ""The Evil Dead"" is truly one of the greatest horror films of all time and the start of a magnificently entertaining trilogy of hilarity and some real scares. Made on a budget of only $375,000, the film is surprisingly accomplished on a technical level. The effects, although they do look fake by today's standards, hold up a lot better than you might have expected, and the stop motion sequence at the end, which looks a lot faker than anything else in the movie, was accomplished for its time and budget.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" is about a group of young adults who travel to a cabin in the woods and discover a 'book of the dead'. No prizes for guessing what happens next as each character is possessed (except for Ash) and disposed of via an intriguing variety of methods. Considering its budget, unknown director (at the time), and typical slasher plot ""The Evil Dead"" would almost certainly seem headed towards forgotten B-movie status, and yet it has stood the test of time and remains one of the most widely acclaimed horror films of all time. Why? It's simple. Although ""The Evil Dead"" is nowhere near as funny as its sequels, it's still a humorous self-satire while also being terrifying despite its age. This odd combination (only perfected in this film's sequels and ""Creepshow"") works because Raimi crafts a tense and moody environment, puts his characters in there, and then ruthlessly disposes of them, sometimes doing so several times for the same character. What's worse is that there's nowhere to go. Raimi creates a claustrophobic feeling in anyone watching, he wants you to think about being in a situation where you're trapped with nothing but death and destruction surrounding you. For most people, he probably succeeds. As far as acting goes, none of it is really very good but Bruce Campbell is instantly likable as Ash, who just has to be one of the most memorable horror film characters of all time.<br/><br/>Gory, desolate, hopeless, and still funny, ""The Evil Dead"" is a horror masterpiece that isn't quite the strongest entry in the series, but is shockingly accomplished and entertaining despite its low budget and inexperienced cast and crew. This is a film everyone must see, along with its sequels. <br/><br/>9/10"
"yucel81x","Null","129","169","5 February 2001"," Interestingly good...
","For a film that was made on a budget that would make Steven Spielberg die laughing, ""Evil Dead"" was one for the most interesting pieces of horror cinema I've ever seen. I watched the series backwards, so ""Army of Darkness"" was the film I saw first, then ""Evil Dead II."" While ""Evil Dead II"" is probably still my favorite, it was interesting to see where it all started.<br/><br/>
The camera work is incredibly good, and the fast motion sequences showing the demon's approach was pretty well done, if not completely original. Though also interesting, and kinda funny to note is that we see the characters running away, but when the camera switches away from the demon's view, we don't see the demon, and that seems like a touch of genius...we know it's there, but we can't see it, and while it probably was a limitation of the budget, it actually proved to be a great method of suspense.<br/><br/>
The special effects are as laughable as they were in the rest of the series, but there's something to be said for a film that takes its chances and goes to the extreme in lieu of lacking resources. People complain about this a lot, but I have to say to them ""get a sense of humor."" The whole point of the ""Evil Dead"" series was to mock horror films and show how campy they were and that they could get even worse. It's humor is in that the film tries to take itself seriously, but the lack of a big budget makes this not only impossible, but even funny in spite of the fact that it could conceivable be a serious film.<br/><br/>The acting is also terrible, but again in that way that it's so obviously bad that it's hard to tell were the actors just plain bad or were they doing that deliberately to serve the purpose of mocking the genre. Bruce Campbell's introduction into the world of abused heroes is interesting since his character is actually less of a chauvinist in this one than he ultimately became famous for. But it works, and the horror on his face when his friend has no reservations about chopping up his possessed girlfriend is actually believable.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a great piece of cinema. It's humorous, but serious as well, and its greatest strength is its ability to draw the line between being part of the genre and mocking it. There are plenty of moments of original horror (I don't think anybody could keep their composure during the ""Tree Rape"" scene, which they repeated to lesser effect in ""Evil Dead II,"" but let's face it that movie was supposed to be a rehash and extension). Give the film a chance and don't take it too seriously. Otherwise you're missing the point."
"Coventry","10","168","235","10 September 2003"," A movie everyone should respect !
","A few nights ago, a couple of friends and myself watched The Evil Dead again. It was like the 68th viewing for me ( I think...lost count somewhere around 50) but it still only means one thing to me: PARTY !! Many feeling can occur when watching this delicious masterpiece by Sam Raimi. You can either adore it, be frightened by it or be disgusted by it. But it always leaves a big impression on you and I can't imagine anyone would hate it. <br/><br/>And there is ONE feeling that everyone should have towards this movie...RESPECT ! Mostly respect regarding the achievement of Sam Raimi. This guy was 21 years old when he made this film and that's impressive to say the least. I'm around that age at the moment and I sure as hell haven't pulled it off yet...I strongly doubt I ever will, actually. No, when you're able to come up with such an original and dared idea for a horror film, you belong to the greatest minds in the film industry. Sam Raimi did it and his further career only confirmed his status of being a genius with every single movie he directed afterwards. Tons of respect towards Bruce Campbell as well. Sure his performance in this movie is far from great, but at the time, he did it because of his friendship with Sam Raimi. And because The Evil Dead became a big hit, his career was launched too and he certainly grew as an actor. Bruce Campbell is now in the favorite actor-list of many B-movie fans...And I'm one of them.<br/><br/>Then there's Tom Sullivan...responsible for the make-up. What a fine job he did. The Evil Dead gave a whole new meaning to the word ""gore"" and we have this man to thank for that. Most nowadays horror films still can't live up to the standard of Evil Dead...not even close. <br/><br/>The plot of this film is as simple as can be...but it works. Five friends drive to a small cabin in the woods to spend a small vacation. They find a tape recorder with a message...Out of curiosity, they play it and pure evil is rised in the woods. One by one, they become possessed and turn into horrible demons who try to kill those who're still alive...That's it !!! And that's all there is needed to create a fun and very original horror movie. The same story already came out in 1978 as a short film called ""Within the Woods"". It was meant to fund money for this film and it's great B-movie fun as well. If you're a big fan of The Evil Dead trilogy, it's certainly worth searching for.<br/><br/>Anno 2003, Sam Raimi has grown out to one of Hollywood's favorite directors. He became immortal in the eyes of the big budget audience with his movie Spiderman. The sequel of that one is in production while I write this. I'm sure it will be as decent as the first Spiderman was, but I'd still prefer to see Evil Dead 4 coming from the brain of Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>A fun trivia element to finish this review with : If you're watching the end credits of the Evil Dead, you'll see Joel Coen is credited as Assistent Editor. Coen now is a famous director as well and may be considered as the best director alive. Back in 1981, he and Sam Raimi were close friends and even shared a studio when they were in collage. Joel Coen made his debut in 1984 with Blood Simple. One of the best cult movies ever made...<br/><br/>Join us...."

I suppose when it was first released this movie would have been cutting edge and the ultimate horror flick. But I got that bored feeling in my stomach that I get when I'm reading a really boring book that I can't wait to finish so I can start the next one. It was all so repetitive. One demon possessed person attacks and then another and then another and then another. there was nothing new here and it's all been done before.<br/><br/>The acting was okay but a bit hammy and the special effects ( although probably brilliant in 1981) showed their age.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 6/10 but my teenage self would have given it much more."
"Infofreak","Null","86","122","8 July 2002"," An indisputable horror classic, still as fresh and frightening as the day it was made.
","Sam Raimi is currently getting a lot of attention and acclaim for directing the over-hyped blockbuster 'Spider-Man'. That movie has introduced him to mainstream filmgoers, no bad thing in itself, but to many of us Raimi is already a legend, because he created 'The Evil Dead', without a doubt one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Made on a shoe string budget as a labour of love, it still remains Raimi's best movie. He has subsequently worked on bigger projects with bigger names but it is arguable whether he has ever surpassed the invention, thrills, energy and sheer fun of this. And why Bruce Campbell never became a genuine movie star after his debut here, and not just a much loved cult figure, is a complete mystery to me. 'The Evil Dead' is a modern horror classic and absolutely ESSENTIAL viewing for any self-respecting movie buff! It doesn't get much better than this!"
"KUAlum26","9","24","31","31 October 2009"," A marvel what some college film students can do on a shoestring budget
","SPOILER(S) POSSIBLE<br/><br/>The first ever full-on film project by budding filmmakers Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert(then called Bobby Tapert)would prove to be a work of endurance and love and also one of the more entertaining horror films made in the eighties.<br/><br/>The plot is painfully simple: Five young adults from Michigan drive off into the woods for a camping vacation,using a seldom-used cabin as their haunt. They uncover a tape recorder and a crusty,dusty and blood-and-flesh-coated ""Book of the Dead"" or ""Necromonicon"",inadvertently incant the chant that awakes a limitless supply of malevolent spirits in the woods,and then one by one get picked off until a lone survivor is left to fight to escape. The story isn't much of an accomplishment:it's the whole physical undertaking that's the real accomplishment.<br/><br/>On a small budget that was probably getting smaller as the shoot continued(I don't know the exact amount of time of filming,but it probably lasted at least a year),the filmmakers and stars(all of 'em,most famously budding star Bruce Campbell as the conflicted but can-do Ash)had to make the most of a limited set,claustrophobic settings,gallons of viscous fluids,endless supplies of cakey make-up,a limited amount of lighting(probably NOT an accident,there) and probably a mass-produced amount of fog to create something that has both the feel of a creepily eerie film about the undead and yet had the effects to back up the type of slasher horror pic that the producers were aiming for.<br/><br/>The first of an intriguing trio of horror/comedy films that Raimi,Tapert,Campbell and company would crank out over a period of just under fifteen years(and,after seeing this film in full,I'm not sure if anyone involved originally intended to make any sequels),the atmosphere and noticeably cheap effects may turn-off your pickier horror film snobs,but anyone with a sense of adventure and high tolerance for gore will be reasonably pleased--if not greatly impressed--by this first effort film. A keeper,not a renter,not only for repeated viewing but also for the extras."
"acidburn-10","10","22","29","26 May 2007"," The ultimate experience in grueling horror
","A Horror classic, if you don't have this horror movie in your collection then just get it because your horror collection just wouldn't be complete without this cult classic.<br/><br/>There are just so many shocking scenes in this movie which never holds back like A woman getting raped by trees which was very unsettling and scary, people getting hacked to pieces and heads getting chopped off, when the some of the characters turns into zombies is just terrifying and all done with brilliant directing. This film is all style and that adds to the creepy factor. This movie wouldn't be as scary if Raimi wasn't behind the camera.<br/><br/>One of the most terrifying scenes is when all the main characters are at the cabin and one of the girls is standing by the window and the other 2 girls are playing cards trying to guess each others cards and the girl standing by the window guesses all the cards and turns around and she's a zombie and starts attacking everyone.<br/><br/>The acting is really good they actually got a cast worth caring about like Bruce Campbell (Ash) very convincing and sympathetic and shows that he's a true icon Ellen Sandwess (Sheryll) is plain looking but she works, especially when she's possessed Hal Delrich (Scotty), Betsy Baker/Linda and Sarah York (Shelly) all do well. They come across as normal people and played by real people instead of fashion models that we get in today's horror movies.<br/><br/>All in all Evil Dead is just one of a kind with a simple story but filled with gore and still holds up to the standards of today."
"bob the moo","Null","46","66","27 March 2005"," An influential horror movie with some humour, loads of gore and some shocking moments
","Looking for a fun weekend away, Ash, Cheryl, Scotty, Shelley and Linda all head up to a cabin in the woods for drinking and fun aplenty. Having found it in the midst of the woods, they ignore the mysterious things they see and settle in. However, a clock stops and a mysterious trap door opens on its own and the boys go to investigate. Finding an old book and a tape recorder, they discover that something happened here but don't believe claims of the wood being alive. However when strange things start happening they find it is too late to try and leave and that they have awakened demons that will kill them all before dawn.<br/><br/>I wonder if this film would have been as famous in the UK if it were not for the outrage that it got involved in with the whole ""video nasties"" affair, I guess we'll never know but whatever factors helped it on its way it is undeniable that Evil Dead has been a great influence on many subsequent films. It is easy to look at the things like the tacking shots (done by running with camera on planks), the excessive gore and the ""cabin in the woods"" setting and call it obvious and clichéd but that is to forget that some of these things have become the norm since this film, maybe even because of it. This is not to say that the film isn't cheesy, poorly acted and rather low cost but then that is a fair claim because it is all these things but it is actually more impressive when you know the limitations it was made under. The gore and effects may have dated now but they are still very effective  not because they are cutting edge effects but because they are delivered with a real nasty eye and a sense of horror and brutality that really helps the action. I will admit that ED2 is delivered with real comedy but this film is a lot nastier and I defy anyone to be amused by some scenes. Specifically the BBFC's excised ""pencil in wound"" scene is hard to watch but is not as genuinely disturbing as the tree rape  this is not a funny scene but one that really delivers the horror of this film.<br/><br/>Given that this is a low budget horror then I think it succeeds well because it is gory and, although not that scary (coming from a man who is freaked out by all zombie films) the gore is hard to watch at times and made me flinch. The performances play second fiddle to the director, who marks out the style that he carried with him on his way to becoming the director of blockbusters that he now is; his camera-work is clever and he has a sense for the manic and the brutal. The cast are mostly forgotten and it is only Campbell who has gone on to cult status, but even his performance is not remarkable here (much, much better in ED2) and the rest are just ""kids in a cabin"" fodder.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film that is a low budget horror that works thanks to constant gore, clever and energetic direction and a real sense of brutality in the action. It isn't wonderful and many will dismiss it as just one of many ""don't go into the woods"" horror movies but that is to forget how early it came in that cliché. People who dislike gore will find little else here and I personally prefer the horror comedy of Evil Dead 2 that is more or less a remake with a bigger budget, less brutality and more laughs but this is still an influential film that should be seen for that reason."

Right from the beginning, with the eerie, spine-chilling music and the sense of dark evil in the woods I knew that this movie was going to be unique in the amount of atmospheric terror it would strike into my very soul.<br/><br/>Nearly every single scene scared me to death - the most frightening moments for me were when the camera was zooming around the steamy swamps, through the woods and approaching the cabin at break-neck speed, only to retreat quickly back when the poor soul running from the darkness made it to safety and slammed the door behind them.<br/><br/>The zombies were excellent - the best I have ever seen (or ever likely to see) in any horror movie and their voices were deeply disturbing.<br/><br/>After viewing it I told my friends at school how I felt about it and they all agreed that they were deeply disturbed by the whole experience and to me, this will always be the ultimate in scary horror - no other film before or since has come anywhere near the mark for heart-striking terror for me.<br/><br/>Even to this day I have to pluck up the courage to spin this disc in the DVD player - the effect it had on me back on the 80's lies firmly planted within me and even when I hear anyone mention the title of this film today it strikes me full of terror.<br/><br/>It just goes to show that you don't need a huge pile of cash to make a fantastic, chilling movie.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is the best horror film of all time, and with the rubbish they produce today I think I can confidently say that no other movie could ever scare me again as much as this one does.<br/><br/>Excellent!"

","Director Sam Raimi and good friend Bruce Campbell set out to make a real scary movie...although filmed on 16mm, THE EVIL DEAD is good enough to be your next nightmare and a hell of a lot better than your run of the mill slice and dice. Campbell plays Ash Williams, one of five college friends set out to have a wild weekend in the woods. Two guys...three girls journey to a remote cabin, of course in the middle of the woods. And the woods whisper ""Join Us"". The group stumbles upon a book and a tape recorder belonging to the previous inhabitants, warning of evil spirits lurking in the woods. When the dead come out to play, the newest victims turn into horrid ghouls. Ash, who at heart is a cowardly pansy, turns out to be the macho, macho man to the rescue. It takes courage, a shotgun and a chainsaw.<br/><br/>When the flesh-eating demons start their attack, the blood doesn't just ooze; it splatters, gushes and flows by the bucketful. And there is the scene where one of the girls is beckoned into the woods only to be attacked and raped by a...tree?! Cheap special effects galore decorate this vacation to a little north of Hell. The comedy was unintentional. It is a product of bad acting by actors with little or no experience. But still, Raimi as writer and director has stumbled upon something here. THE EVIL DEAD more than deserves its youth restricted rating. As if it really matters, other cast members are: Betsy Baker, Hal Delrich, Ellen Sandweiss and Theresa Tilly."

","I'd love to know why everyone posting on this site thinks this movie is so priceless. C'mon, people! It's stereotypically set in the dark in the middle of the woods, and anybody knows what happens in the dark in the middle of the woods, if you ever set around the fire at scout camp. Weird tapes wake up demons in the woods. Some idiot girl decides to go out into the woods to confront the demons and gets raped by a tree (yes, you read that right...there is no particular reason for this scene, by the way, except to give the obligatory T&A shot these movies are notorious for). The demons are not only out to rip out your innards, they are also determined to annoy the sh*t out of you before doing so. Otherwise, it's basically a whole lot of fake blood and strewn about body parts-not a bad thing in and of itself, but certainly does not elevate this to ""good movie"" status. Don't bother, unless you have some kind of weird branch fetish."

The sounds the possessed make and their empty eyes,the cheap yet good make up effects,the thick fog and darkness.<br/><br/>This movie also features some great camera work, and some of the shots were pure genius. It might be a little nasty with the trees raping women and the gallons of blood and gore but in this case the gore is not just filler to make the movie more repulsive so it wont need to be scary, no this movie really is scary.<br/><br/>Every horror movie fan should own this.<br/><br/>But I'm not giving it 10 points because of the silly FX in the final scene with the book and the demons.<br/><br/>The plot is not a masterpiece but it's alright and nothing really bothers you, and as for the acting lets just say that although the actors would never win the academy awards they are much better then Saw's actors could ever be."

Sam Raimi's directing style is so unique that it feels entirely different than other horror movies.  I would reccomend this movie to people with a strong stomach, or people who like violent movies.  If you are unsure,(don't worry about it) watch Evil Dead II first to make sure you can handle the gore, and if you can, sit back and enjoy the best horror film ever."
"Tyypo","1","43","77","21 December 2012"," A movie with more notoriety than it deserves
","First off, I liked ""Army of Darkness"", essentially the film that put the Evil Dead movies on the map. I knew of the two prequels, but they were really hard to find for a while. I'm not really a fan of gore per se, so the reviews that described it as such deterred me for a while. However, I couldn't resist streaming Netflix + some spare time.<br/><br/>I know people in these sort of movies are compelled to do stupid things, but this one goes over the top. The most cowardly woman of the group going out alone to look for someone/something was completely out of character. The subsequent violation by demonic foliage was out of place, uncalled for, and unnecessarily gratuitous. Then there's the whole notion that evil supernatural forces are trying to kill them, so... let's split the injured girl away from the rest so she can take a nap. That's a sound strategy.<br/><br/>There are people who are scared by this film, even think it is the scariest they've seen? You probably shouldn't have gone to my high school; you'd just be cowering in a corner somewhere. The gore effects were about as ridiculous as one could imagine. The stop-motion at the end had me laughing like I was watching an episode of MST3K. For comparison, it made a Doctor Who episode of the same era look like ""Avatar"". I can imagine this being a cult movie with its camp appeal, but scary? Really? <br/><br/>This is one overrated movie. When ED2 comes available on streaming Netflix or On Demand, I'll probably watch it for completion, certainly with low expectations."

","A bunch of college kids take a weekend trip to a remote cabin in the woods. They unwittingly resurrect the evil dead--spirits who can possess them and have them kill each other off. The only way to get rid of them? Bodily dismemberment.<br/><br/>In terms of plot this is pretty lame--there are a few lapses in logic that are annoying. Characterizations are nonexistent and the acting is bad (even Bruce Campbell!). But the film moves like lightning with some very imaginative direction by Sam Raimi. And when the evil dead attack after the first half hour, the movie goes barreling out of control. Tons of gore, blood and violence are thrown in your face with great sound effects and some truly gruesome makeup. Also it's kind of funny--notice how many times Campbell is covered with blood but his face is clean and his clothes dry in the very next shot!<br/><br/>This was made back in 1981 on next to no budget by a bunch of college students. It's incredible what they achieved with so little to work with. Also there are two or three incredible tracking shots that I can't get enough of!<br/><br/>This was dismissed by horrified film critics back then (I remember one reviewer was so disgusted he requested that every single print should be burnt!), but it slowly grew into quite a hit. It's now considered a modern day classic. And Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell jump started their careers with this.<br/><br/>So ignore the plot and concentrate on the imaginative direction, gore, special effects and sound.

","SPOILER: I'm at a loss to understand a lot about this movie: the people who say they were scared by it, the fact that it wasn't forgotten immediately after release, the fact that it got a release at all. Basically, this movie must appeal to those that don't believe a good horror movie should have any of the things that make any other movie good: actors that can maybe act a little. A plot. Something faintly resembling adequate cinematography, or at the very least, shots that Camera-work that looks like the cameraman had the visual sense of a at least a seventh grader. <br/><br/>This piece of forgettable trash has none of that. I have no problem with low-budget horror. But this doesn't just look like a student film. It looks like a film made by talentless students who didn't know how to write, direct, set lights, or act. <br/><br/>I first saw it in the theaters as a 13-year-old horror buff, with a friend with similar tastes. As a 13 year old, I found it laughably stupid, poorly made, and not at all scary. Now, 27 years later I gave it another chance. And you know what? It's laughably stupid, poorly made, and not at all scary.<br/><br/>This is an execrable mess. It's that lousy. These people who are giving it 10 stars... I don't know what movie they were watching, because the one I saw certainly wasn't worth the hour and a half of my time. If I could have watched the whole thing in 15 minutes, it wouldn't have been worth the 15 minutes. <br/><br/>I dunno, I guess if you like wooden, ham-fisted lack of acting ability, or are scared by completely fake-looking special effects that are clearly made of poorly animated stop- motion clay, or enjoy weak plots full of logic holes you could drive an 18 wheeler through, there'll be a lot to please you here.

"Det_McNulty","8","5","6","26 May 2007"," A Franticly Satirical and Endlessly Innovative Gorefest Which Launched A Thousand Ships
","Infamous for a variety of reasons, The Evil Dead remains a landmark for cinema as a whole. In 1981 the film was banned, cut or had a delayed release in many countries as it was deemed both sadistic and gratuitously explicit. In the UK the film was originally released cut like in many other countries, yet when the film was due to hit video it was banned by the BBFC. It became notorious for being one of the first ""video nasties"" and it was not until 1990 that the film became ""unbanned"" by the BBFC. Fortunately, when released on DVD in 2001 all the cuts were waved, and since then the film has been widely available in its uncut and intended form. When viewed in the new era most of the film's material is fairly tame in comparison to the content of today's horror films.<br/><br/>The premise of The Evil Dead is one which is so basic that it enabled Sam Raimi to create something so blissfully unique and absurd. The film kicks off with introducing five friends who are journeying to an isolated cabin. On arriving, they find a mysterious book (The Book of the Dead/Necronomicon) and a tape recording from a professor. Out of curiosity they decide to listen to the unsettling recording, which reads out an ancient curse. This results in ""the evil dead"" being released and wreaking possessive havoc on the innocent group of friends.<br/><br/>Though The Evil Dead follows a simplistic story, and one which might even seem clichéd to viewers today, it was still a glaringly unique film for its time and has spawned influence across cinema. Arguably, the lack of a complex or even recognisable narrative structure acts as a way of making the film focus and succeed in all its other areas. Due to the lack of narrative, Sam Raimi is able to emphasise the ""exploitation"" side of the film and let his astonishing array of imagination flow through the picture. Some might dispute that The Evil Dead should not follow a story anyway, as it is a film whereby the aim is to depict survival through ""gruelling terror"".<br/><br/>When you break-down The Evil Dead (analysing each area of the film); I find it hard to comprehend how anyone could refuse to respect the painstaking effort which went into achieving the best out of a tiny budget. The attention to detail in factors such as make-up, camera-work, animatronics, editing, lighting and atmosphere remains an astonishing achievement. Sam Raimi litters the film with B-movie flourish and classic horror references. This is a mark of respect for the films which helped to inspire many areas of The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>The use of quick-cut editing focusing on tiny details is something which became extremely stylish in the sequel, yet not quite as raw. This is an example of how The Evil Dead is supposed to be scary at times. One of the film's most famous factors is the first-person camera shots of ""the evil"" rushing through the woods and around the key set-piece (the cabin). This has become a trademark style for the series; The Evil Dead is both amusing (yet this became much more apparent in the sequels, which ultimately became self-parodies) and fairly creepy. Yes, some moments may seem horribly corny and dated now, but it is something you should expect from such a film. My favourite aspect of the film is Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash, which although extremely cringe-worthy at times is indisputably bursting with panache and charm. Bruce Campbell established himself as a cult favourite due to the series, and rightly so. He honestly is one of the finest character-actors of all-time, a genius of physical comedy and an expert in the art of exaggeration. His acting talent is something which improved as his career progressed, but he is still widely recognised for being the lovable imbecile and protagonist of The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead kicked off a cult following and introduced what was to become one of the greatest trilogies of all-time. There is no denying the sheer fury and excitement The Evil Dead carries with each viewing. Ultimately, it is the low budget that enables the film to still pack an unnerving jolt of exhilaration."

","While that first line might be a bit of a stretch, it gives a bit of mind about what to expect from Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead, a horror movie so vulgar, so gorish, so unexplicably twisted, that it's incredibly ingenuous until the last shot.  Even for a low budget film noticably shot practically on a shoe string from a corpse, it's balsy.  The story starts off, and in times steers towards, the area of horror cliches, and yet by the time(s) we see the demonic characters, and the blood that goes along with it, it's accepted with the territory. <br/><br/>The Evil Dead is to me one of those horror pictures like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or or Night of the Living Dead that goes to show that within the muck of endless B horror films that those with little money to spend can concoct something that shows craft (and good old chills) triumphs over money every now and then.  And if you happen to view this as a comedy, it goes for laughs in certain spots as well, albiet twisted to a crazed T. A+"

","The Evil Dead is the 1981 directorial debut of Sam Raimi, and it's certainly a fine film. The camera techniques are easily this first film's high point, it was just done in such a creative way that still leaves you guessing how it was done. But the weak points are in writing and acting. Bruce Campbell is a great actor, but in this film, he's mediocre at best, and the writing certainly doesn't help that one bit, and he's the best of our five cast members. But despite the detractors, it does invest you into it. As stated earlier, the camera floats around in an inventive manner that is rather impressive for a first timer. Another positive is the tension, which is helped by the music. It has this really good and creeping atmosphere that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Really check this out, but do note that this is the weakest of the three, although if you aren't too much of a fan of comedy, this one might be your favorite, yet that isn't my opinion and is certainly not the opinion of most. And for all of you, this is legally on YouTube for free, so you all can watch it."

Five people, led by future cult horror hero Bruce Campbell, rent a cabin way out in the middle of the woods. In the basement they find an ancient book, read a few passage out of it and all hell (literally) breaks loose! Several characters quickly become possessed by demons whose only mission is to kill the living. And that's all the plot this terrific little fright flick really needs. It's not a ""plot"" movie anyway, it's an exercise in horror in the purest sense; with atmosphere, mood, pacing, camera-work and splatter all at the forefront. Sam Raimi's now-classic film set new standards for levels of blood and gore way back in 1981, and the film stands the test of time miraculously well considering all the advancements in special effects since it was made. In fact, I actually prefer this old style mix of make-up effects and stop motion animation to pretty much all of today's films. Also of note is the invigorating point-of-view camera-work, which has been copied endlessly sense. ""Evil Dead"" is a fantastic, scary, funny, imaginative and gory good time not to be missed!

It has became a beloved cult classic and stands as one of the most influential horror films of all time!<br/><br/>Five young adults go off to a mountain cabin, where they unknowingly unleash evil, possessive spirits that reek havoc upon everything!<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is perhaps the last of the great drive-in horror classics. Director Sam Raimi, who has since gone on to films with much bigger budgets, made his debut with this wildly terrifying genre masterpiece. Raimi's crafty direction builds a thick atmosphere of dread and isolation through out the film, using the woodsy setting as a great back drop. He uses some nicely inventive camera shots. The movie does indeed play out like shocking roller-coaster ride, as the scenes of in-your-face horror and gore hit hard and fast, only to be followed by eerie lulls of tension. It's the most effectively gripping style that any horror film could use! Raimi also makes the most out of using dark humor in the film, making even the most scary sequences strangely funny. The makeup FX are truly gruesome, even with a low-budget there are plenty of freakishly-good FX to drive the thrills.<br/><br/>Raimi also creates some nicely bizarre and memorable sequences, like the vine-rape scene with Cheryl, the demented singing of a possessed Linda, the 'bleeding' cellar pipes, and that grand finale with Ash having to make a stand to survive! Not to mention the knock-out final shot of the film, which is probably the greatest closing image to any horror picture ever! Also worthy of mention is the great music score by Joe LoDuca. LoDuca's music is a perfect match to the film, building plenty of tension and playing off the shocks very well.<br/><br/>The cast is as good as one would expect from a B picture, but they do hold their own. Of course the real star of the show is square-jawed B movie hero Bruce Campbell. Bruce does an outstanding role, playing terror to a T, and enduring the physical hardships of a grueling low-budget film. He deserves his B movie king status!<br/><br/>The Evil Dead has gone on to become one of the biggest cult films of all time and it's not hard to see why either! It's an outstandingly awesome horror ride that should be taken by all horror film fans! If they're anything like this horror fan, Evil Dead will quickly become a big favorite!<br/><br/>Followed by Raimi's comical Evil Dead II (1987) and Army of Darkness (1993)<br/><br/>**** out of **** (horror perfection)"

","I live in Morristown, TN. This movie is awesome!!! Maybe I can fill some of you in on a few things..One of the local backers of this film was assistant producer Gary Holt. He and his family own a location called Renaissance Farm. It was a horse training farm. A Big red barn in the far western part of Hamblen County, Morristown, TN. Later on it was a flea market, for awhile. Now it is some other business. Note at the starting of the movie, on the screen, Renaissance Pictures. The local locations of the film are in Morristown and surrounding areas. At the first of the movie, when the yellow Oldsmobile is traveling down the gravel road, and met head on with the red truck, notice the concrete bridge in the background.. that bridge is non other than Old Highway 25 E in Grainger county. The Highway, 25E is now being widened into a 4 lane highway, they have been working on this road project for years and still are today. It is right on the border of Claiborne County, near Tazewell, TN. The dirt and gravel road sits directly on the other side of the Clinch River.... To access this gravel road, go straight across the bridge, take a right turn and go under the bridge and that will take you right down on the gravel road and on down to the river... Also, filmed in Grainger county, the scene directly after this one.... Where the car horn is being blown and you see the 2 men walking (fisherman I think). Look directly in the background and you will see the opening that was cut into Clinch Mountain for the HWY 25E widening project back in the middle to late 1970's. That part of the mountain is visible in 2 scenes. The road that the 2 men are walking on is the OLD HIGHWAY that was a 2 lane, winding road. As this movie was filmed a long time ago..... the trees have all grown up in that area now and you cannot see the top of the mountain from that area anymore. That road they are walking appears to be at the starting of what is left of the old road that runs near the Poor Valley area. If you are going to go north on HWY 25E from Bean Station and Morristown and upon the mountain, that road will be the first road on the left as you are starting to go up the mountain. The actual cabin where the movie was filmed is (was) located in west Hamblen County, Morristown, TN in the same general area as Panther Creek State Park area...just a bit of the way up from the park.....I have never been to the house....but I have heard about it.....It is not visible from any road. It sit (s) far back up in the woods. Some people make the mistake and get it mixed up with another old ""haunted house"", The Murrell Melville Home, that is in the area and sits near the road... THE EVIL DEAD CABIN DOES NOT, DID NOT SIT NEAR ANY ROAD. The entrance is in an unmarked driveway that enters a field. The cabin sat way back in the backcountry almost in the woods. This is plainly visible in the film. I will not give directions to the cabin or cabin site... they are posted on other Evil Dead websites, they are not 100% accurate though. Anyway, the reason I know all of the above information is that I am a lifetime resident of Morristown, TN and I remember this film being made. Mr. Holt is well known in this area. Anyway, that is my 2 cents worth.... I hope you enjoyed reading it....EVIL DEAD LOVER"

","Okay, so bad acting, poor plot, cheap effects and cheesy photography are what make ""the greatest horror movie of all time""? My 15 year old son said, ""Well, maybe they liked it, because it's old"". Yeah, either that, or Sam Raimi paid dozens of friends and family to vote for this clunker!!! Hey, it isn't a horrible movie: just dumb. I suppose if you're drunk, and have nothing better to do on a Saturday night, then rent this movie. Oh, in one of the ""scary"" moments of the film, my son said, ""These people are dumb... they're retarded"". The same might be said for anyone who actually believes this cinematic garbage is ""essential viewing for a movie buff."" (For ""essential viewing, try ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""Amelie"" or a film by Fellini or Bergman, if you want essential viewing... but NOT this sad waste of film!<br/><br/>One final note: the fact that so many folks on IMDb rated this film ""10 stars"" should be a red flag (suspicious sign, for those of you who have never heard the expression)-- Evidently, the average reviewer on this site is 1. uneducated 2. unsophisticated 3. under the age of sixteen 4. never seen a truly great film or 5. is a shill for the movie industry.

","I thought for a budget of $50,000, they did a damn good job of making a scary movie. The Evil Dead has become one of the most popular cult classics of all time, especially to horror fans. I remember how I accidentally came across this movie, I just had a gift certificate for Blockbuster Video and just bought this previewed, I thought at first it was kind of cheesy, but it did terrify me. I showed my friend this movie and we went on the internet and couldn't believe all the websites dedicated not only to this movie, but I found out there were two other sequels. <br/><br/>5 friends go on a camping trip and are just looking for the most part to just relax, party, and have a good time together. But there is something wrong when Ash's sister is hearing and seeing horrible and scary things in the cabin. She is loured out into the woods by a creepy voice and is raped by the spirits in the tree's, sorry, I don't know how else to say it. But when the guys decide to have a little fun and play a tape from the previous owner who studied spirits and demons, they raise The Evil Dead. One by one the friends are possessed and kill each other.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly disturbing and fun gory flick to watch. I couldn't believe it when I found out that this movie was made with a small budget. Who knew? I bet Sam didn't and he probably didn't expect the success he has today. I think that's the fun part of movies, sometimes people get your art and sometimes they don't, but you can have a home run sometimes and life has it's little surprises.<br/><br/>10/10"
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","5","7","15 August 2019"," One of the greatest best 80's horror films of all time the most terrifying ""Evil Dead"" is still the first one my personal favorite
","The first Evil Dead is still the most terrifying bloody scary movie from the 80's of all time. It is one of the greatest horrror films of all time my personal favorite it is in my top 10 favorite horror films. Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead to me is the best of best masterpiece terrifying terror on a widescreen ever. I saw this film on VHS when I was 9 years old and I was so terrified that I have not watch this movie for over 20 years.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi and his roommate friend Bruce Campbell from college invasted their saving money in to making ""The Evil Dead"" movie. This movie was made on alow budget money Rami and Campbell could not effort better a big group of actors, or better effects, but with super low budget this movie works.<br/><br/>""We're going to get you. We're going to get you. Not another peep. Time to go to sleep. ""<br/><br/>I love this movie to death it was shot in Tennessee in the early winter 80's in the cabin, the cabin in which the movie was shot is burned down. I love, love this movie to death. It is a personal horror film of mine. There were three movies made: Evil Dead II, Army of Darkness and remake. My favorite will always be the first one, because it is more scary, has no humor. Really believable everyone making this movie did a good job.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell's acting performence is the best of the film,I like him more in this movie than in the sequels. In this movie Ash Williams is not a super hero with a chainsaw and a shotgun. He is a normal human being, he cares about his friends, he is not a selfish tough guy like in the sequels, he is a normal guy. He dosen't know what to do and he has to fight for survival against evil demons and spirits posessing his friends. Just like in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood when Tina accidently releases Jason from his cell and now she haa to fight to put him back there where he belongs in his cell. In here Ash, his sister and his friends accidently unleashes evil demons and spirits and now Ash has to fight for his survival to get them back there where they belong in the cell.<br/><br/>The story is a basic cabin in the woods story about a group of college kids who get more than they bargained for when they accidentally release a few demons on their trip to the country. As you might assume, all hell breaks loose and Raimi really proves himself as a director combining horror and comedy elements that both work. The horror is genuinely creepy. Not to mention how well the film is shot with great framing and tremendous high speed demon POV shots that fly through the woods around the cabin with reckless abandon. It's a fascinating first effort, impressively well crafted and holds up very well despite its age.<br/><br/>I love how the film was shot the filming locations I like the other cast beside Bruce Campbell. Ellen Sandweiss was excellent as Cheryl Williams love her performence I did not know Cherly was actually Ash's sister because she was never mentioned in the sequels later. Richard DeManincor as Scotty friend of Ash and Cheryl was really good. I like DeManincor's performence, I love Scotty he was a bad-ass in this movie. Betsy Baker as Linda was a babe she was really good as Ash's girlfriend I am wondering why she did not come back for the sequel. Theresa Tilly was a babe as Shelly I love her.<br/><br/>I love the effects, the blood, the creepines in this movie, the gore, death scens all are excellent. Evil Dead II and The Evil Dead are the best in the series I will still go for The Evil Dead as my favorite in the series. I love this film to death I recommend this film to any horror fan."
"ElijahCSkuggs","9","6","9","13 June 2007"," No budget, no problem.
","The Evil Dead is one of those films that will stand the test of time on many levels; special effects(crude but vicious), shock value and controversy, acting, directing, and music. Each of these traits, along with very nice pacing and suspense keeps the original ED leagues above the filler that Hollywood regurgitates every year. Bruce Campbell, the every man's man, stars as Ashley Williams, a guy who decides to bring his girlfriend and some other pals to a remote cabin in the woods for some rest and relaxation. Through some bad luck, demons are evoked from an ancient slumber and begin to wreak havoc among the group; pitting friends against friends, and then eventually, everyone against Ash. The acting is great, especially by said Campbell, whose square jaw and rubber face ensure him as the horror genre's Jim Carrey. Sam Raimi's film is a compilation of stop-motion gore, claustrophobic terror, and innovative camera angles, and realistically, never has someone done so much for the genre with so little. Of course The Blair Witch Project was well done, but it hasn't had the success and constant imitations that Raimi's little film has. A fun time all around, especially for movie goers who aren't afraid of a little blood and hurt. It's a cult classic, but with such huge notoriety and fame, this film has evolved into mainstream status. And for good reason."
"Zod-2","7","6","9","28 September 2003"," lower expectations make for greater enjoyment
","With 365 other reviews at the time of this writing I find it hard to believe that I have anything new to add but here goes.<br/><br/>No movie is ever going to be liked by everybody but I think the fact that The Evil Dead gets so much positive hype from its fans that fewer people in the future will enjoy it.  Hype brings with it a twisted like/hate ratio.  A movie with lots of positive hype will receive fewer positive critiques from future viewers and vice versa, negative will bring more positive critiques.<br/><br/>With that said I admire what The Evil Dead brings to horror.  When I first watched this movie as a teen it and it's sequel scared the hell out of me. It didn't help that I watched it in my basement alone but that's part of the fun of horror movies.  I watched The Evil Dead again last night and it still packed a punch for me.  Of course not nearly as much as it did 15 years ago but I still found it enjoyable.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is an uneven movie but that is to be expected being made on such a meager budget.  But it does have enough suspense, shocks and creepiness to it that The Evil Dead can actually claim to be a horror movie. A lot of nay-sayers of The Evil Dead say it's a ""stupid"" movie, which in and of itself is a brilliant critique don't you think?  I for one think it's anything but.  Unlike many horror films it has a story which is easy to follow and for the most part fair to the viewer.  <br/><br/>Given that The Evil Dead was made for somewhere around $350,000 many of the aspects of the movie are remarkable.  The special effects are nicely done even if at times obvious.  Sam Raimi's camera work makes otherwise dull moments interesting to watch for the viewer.  Raimi knows his way around a dollar and in The Evil Dead he gets everything he can out of every cent he spends.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a good horror film, The Evil Dead is a perfect choice, if viewed in the right frame of mind.  Just remember, it was made on a very small budget, it was made by a first time writer/director and amateur actors.  With this in mind you should have yourself a good time watching The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead rates a 7 out of 10."
"matthewssilverhammer","8","2","2","7 December 2019"," Raimi directs the hell out of these movies...pun intended.

"laelia123","Null","2","2","19 January 2005"," Evil Dead - terrible, and that's why it's great
","Evil Dead is a terrible, terrible movie. No one can possibly argue against that. That having been said, it's the best and most entertaining terrible movie I've seen. Evil Dead was filmed by Sam Raimi on a budget of $350,000 and it shows. Everything about this movie is terrible - except for the end result. The acting sucks, the special effects are laughable, the dialogue is the most stiff and unrealistic I have ever heard. At one point, one character turns around and is suddenly dead and possessed, with gray rotting skin and white eyes. She floats up into the air, explains to the others that they are all going to die, flies across the room and into the fall, and then falls down. The reaction of the others? Nothing. Eventually one asks ""do you think she's alright?"" That's just a sample. The makers of Evil Dead wanted to make the most gruesome and scary horror movie ever, and tried to push the envelope as far as they could. But their serious treatment is what makes it so funny. Everyone in this movie appears to very committed and serious about the movie, and the result is laughable. The actors seem to have no idea how bad they are, or how simply ridiculous the entire movie is. Had they known, it wouldn't have the same effect. Naturally, critics panned this movie across the board, but it found its audience in younger people who could find entertainment in bad movies. Eventually it developed such a following that it is now a trilogy, including Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, all staring B-movie kind Bruce Campbell. Sam Raimi went on to direct Spider-Man 2, which had a special effects budget that soared into the millions. So they all lived happily ever after except for everyone else who was involved in the movie.<br/><br/>Final Verdict<br/><br/>The best terrible movie I've ever seen. The acting can be summed up in two words: cue cards. The movie leaves many questions unanswered, doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and provides plenty of laughs. An altogether enjoyable, but at the same time painful, movie experience."

","I hated The Evil Dead. This movie was recommended for me based on some of the other movies that I have either selected for viewing, or just inquired and read the synopsis about. I was led to believe that there was something special or outstanding about this movie. As it turned out, The Evil Dead is simply a terrible cliché of all gory movies. The only thing special about it seems to be that it was one of the first of it's type and the director, Sam Raimi, was very young (21 ?) when he made it. It has all of the elements of a ""B"" movie (which it is): lousy story with characters that make unbelievably stupid choices, terrible acting, terrible make up and effects, overall terrible production. I couldn't believe The Evil Dead had a 7.5 rating on IMDb, but apparently if you like blood-fest type movies, this one comes highly recommended by your cohorts in ketchup. I don't watch many movies of this type; I will be more careful about selecting movies that are recommended to me by database preference analysis. I may someday watch the sequel, because other viewers stated that the production values and acting are so much better in the sequel. There's no way they could possibly be any worse."

I am not a femme-Nazi, nor am I sensitive to violence and gore... but when it is so obvious that this movie was just an excuse to lash out in such an extremely negative way towards women and try to disguise it as a horror movie... I just had to say something. I've always thought that this movie was over-rated.

"MovieAddict2016","9","7","12","9 March 2005"," A look at the series before it turned humorous - and it's the best!
","Stephen King named it the most ferociously original horror film of 1981 and it topped the video rental charts of that year  but then censorship reared its ugly head and Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" was brutally chopped and heavily criticized by the more conservative folk of the times. In the UK it lay at rest for many years, considered ""dangerous"" and unsafe for viewing due to its excessive gore and infamous tree-rape sequence. In the US (where distribution seemed less controversial  see also ""A Clockwork Orange"") it faced a similar but less consequential fate. Nevertheless the cult base grew and today ""Evil Dead""  released on DVD tagged with an NC-17 rating  is hugely popular amongst film and horror buffs. Its star, Bruce Campbell, was as unlikely a hero as cinema had ever had  a fearful, cowardly guy who doesn't have it all together and isn't a big macho, gung-ho leader type. It is hardly surprising then that Campbell would be the only actor to establish a successful career afterwards.<br/><br/>Filmed on a $350,000 budget with a cast of no-names, its influential directorial work, excessive violence and infectious attitude would proceed to inspire a legion of upcoming directors  even Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez paid their respects to the film with their cheeseball vampire flick, ""From Dusk till Dawn,"" which is a lot like the ""Evil Dead"" series  both start out as serious, dark films, and later turn into comedic self-satire.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead II"" was less a sequel and more a remake  made with a larger budget and what Campbell himself referred to as ""splatstick"" humor, it referenced the Three Stooges whilst still maintaining the gore level of the original. Then ""Army of Darkness""  the most commercial and childish of the trilogy  became almost totally humor, Campbell's character ""Ash"" Williams turned into a chainsaw-wielding one-line-spewing tough guy-comedian, and the grim nature of the original seemed lost in the chaos.<br/><br/>Suffice to say no one can criticize the ""Evil Dead"" series for lack of creativity or imagination. Looking at ""Army of Darkness"" it's hard to imagine it even relates to the original at all  ""Evil Dead"" is a serious (to some extent) horror film whereas ""Army of Darkness"" involves time-traveling and the concept of having a chainsaw for a hand. Groovy.<br/><br/>The plot is too familiar  a group of lovestruck teens head out to the woods for a bit of alone-time. Once there they stumble upon a mysterious tape recording and the ""Book of the Dead""  once the passages inside are cited aloud, the undead will rise from the earth. So how unfortunate that the tape recording conveniently cites the passages and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't make much sense. We're led to believe these demons that lurk in the woods are at rest yet when our heroes arrive at their cabin, strange goings-on occur before the Book of the Dead is even found. There's also something else that makes absolutely no logical sense whatsoever, but revealing it might ruin part of the story.<br/><br/>Doesn't matter. This isn't a thoughtful horror film. Continuity is not favored either  shots rarely follow each other in a cohesive manner. The greatness of ""Evil Dead"" is not its professionalism  instead, the opposite - that for such a low budget, Sam Raimi was able to construct such a chilling and gruesome horror tale unlike any other (at the time, anyway)  he didn't shy on the comic book-style violence, nor was he willing to sacrifice keeping the audience unsatisfied by slowing down the pace. This is a fast, brutal movie. Bruce Campbell is admittedly more comfortable with himself and the character of Ash in the sequels, but the overall scary nature of the film  its serious horror and lack of over-the-top humor  is more to my personal taste than watching a grown man playing Three Stooges with a couple of skeletons in a graveyard. That's not to discredit the sequels (""Evil Dead II"" is almost as good as this) but if I could only pick one, I'd go for the first  and best  of the bunch. A must-see for film buffs, horror aficionados and anyone who likes a good, creepy, unique film. (It's the only time you'll see someone raped by a tree - honest!)"

","Personally, I found the tension so unbearable that I could hardly stay awake.<br/><br/>The more risible something is, the harder it is to parody. Imagine, for example, trying to parody PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.<br/><br/>What Raimi is apparently trying to do here is to parody moronic and clichéd low-budget splatter flicks. Unfortunately, he has no idea how to accomplish that difficult task, so he just ends up making a *particularly* moronic and clichéd low-budget splatter flick.<br/><br/>(At least, I *think* he's trying to send up the genre. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe he simply lacks the imagination to do anything interesting.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, Raimi is also trying to make a truly frightening movie. But the *sine qua non* of horror is that we must *believe*. Blood and guts are beside the point. For the duration of the movie, we must be made to believe that we are watching real people, and that what's happening to them could happen to us. That is the essence of any horror film.<br/><br/>However, since Raimi intentionally (again, I *think*) used the sort of typical cardboard characters and ludicrous plot contrivances which show up in these exploitation gorefests, he lost any chance to make a genuinely frightening film either.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm getting jaded in me old age, sonny, but I no longer find that films like this work (if you can call it that) even on a sheer grossout level. What's grotesque about red-colored corn syrup and cranberry juice? (Contrast THE EXORCIST, during which many viewers get physically ill at the sight of pea soup--because William Friedkin makes them *believe* that it is something else.)<br/><br/>Even the widely-praised camera work is merely a sad cry for attention.

","I'm sure by this point nobody cares what somebody like me has to say about this movie, or indeed, this *franchise*, but I'll do it anyway. I saw the next two instalments (the remake given the name Dead by Dawn and the loose sequel), and I was glad to finally come to this one. I thought all three movies were somewhat entertaining, but also given an undue amount of cultural weight. This is my favourite of the bunch because it really does contain a weird, morbid atmosphere, and is not played for laughs.<br/><br/>Those only familiar with the other films (and I think there are a surprising lot of you) might be surprised at how hard Sam Reimy works to create an atmosphere of genuine dread and hopelessness. It works well, up to a point. The problem is that the characters are non-entities except for Ash, and the story feels like it was written by a nine-year-old. Of course, we are all only really in this for the mayhem, and it does start pretty quickly. I like how this movie really pushes the case for the environment itself being malefic; that it's not just the playing of a tape waking the dead (or demons as the case may be), but the entire woodland they are in being riddled with evil and malignant spiritualities. It added an unexpected almost folk-horror element to proceedings, even though it was rather understated. Not much dialogue of interest in the film at all, so really not a lot to think about.<br/><br/>The demons seem to be able to possess whomever they want, whenever they want, so the rules of the world are nebulous and don't seem to make sense. Why'd they go back to sleep after the professor made the tape and spoke the incantations? Look, I'm fine with ambiguity in horror; in fact it's largely preferred to having everything explained, but here it just seemed like none of that stuff really mattered, and that's a bit iinsulting.<br/><br/>But hey, this is a really well-made movie with some nice quirks that was created by people who clearly really enjoyed what they were doing. Everyone plays it up to the hilt and I appreciate that. It's a lot creepier than the other instalments and does contain one or two genuinely disturbing scenes involving trees. it's also just over 80 minutes long, so the time will fly by.

"Hannah-Balsom","7","3","4","4 March 2005"," Quite good but not as great as i'd hoped
","Being a big horror fan i was really excited at the thought of this film. Up until last year i had never seen it, just seen clips and heard people discuss it in enthused tones. It seemed to be at the top of most horror fans lists. So when i bought a copy on DVD i couldn't wait to get home and watch it. And i did. And to be honest, i wasn't quite as impressed as i thought i'd be. OK, so first off, the film isn't really very scary. I suppose when it was released it would have been as people weren't so much used to that extreme amount of violence and gore. But now it's just really funny.i wrongly thought it was meant to be one of, if not the scariest film ever. Which it's not. Nor does it pretend to be. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed watching the film but i just wasn't scared which i want to be when watching a horror film, otherwise i don't see the point. Anyway, i can see that the film has acquired over the years a sort of spoof status which is indeed what it looks like at times. The acting is terrible, the script laughable and the plot patchy at best, but i think (or at least i hope) that is how it was intended to be. I admit that i was creeped out a few times and did jump on occasion. So overall, i can appreciate the film for what it was. A funny film with a few scares and a lot of gore. Just not as good as it's meant to be."

","Well here we are with ""The Evil Dead"". Sam Raimi, probably has one of the most charming stories of how he got into the industry. He and childhood friend Bruce Campbell, created a 30 minute short entitled ""Within The Woods"", practically inspired by the works of H.P Lovecraft. This helped Raimi convince people to secure a larger budget for the next production thus ""The Evil Dead"" was made, and thus the rest is history.<br/><br/>Five college students vacation in a furbished cabin in the remote woods. After they find an audiotape reciting incantations that release a plethora of demons and spirits, each of the group suffer various forms of demonic possession. Who and will survive? Regardless it's gonna lead to ridiculous amounts of blood use.<br/><br/>It pretty much proves that regardless of budget, certain ideas and executions can become timeless and more iconic than a lot of these Hollywood franchise remakes we see today. Funny enough Sam Raimi had really became an influence to me when I began to take interest in darker movies. I remember watching ""Spider-man"" (2002) at the age of 10, and I was just blown away at the angles, camera tracking during the web swinging, and the abandoned building at the end was so eerie. How wonderful to know that all this was carried on from his earlier works. Shot for very long hours, and the cast were local friends and family who kept constantly dropping in and out of production. Bruce Campbell is one of the most underrated actors ever, yet I think he'll forever remain this kind of ""B-Movie"" icon for all the right reasons. But as said earlier, this movie is insane. It was made on a shoe string budget, has so many unique special effect moments and the finale is an incredible testament to the art of stop-motion before CGI now wiped it's arse over everything.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Another landmark of the Horror genre. If you haven't had the time to see it yet, make some. 9/10."

","Evil Dead was made in 1979 by a bunch of students out of Michigan on a shoestring budget, drive and a lot of guts. They froze, ate crap, got beat up and cut and burned themselves out.<br/><br/>The end result, after $350,000 and 3 years of post production was an awesome, gorefest, filled with silliness, great scares and eye-popping scenes.<br/><br/>It starts off slowly enough with the teens going up for a weekend of supposed getting' it on and after reading a forbidden book tapped on a tape recorder, well, all hell breaks loose. The lone pretty girl is lured into the woods and raped by malevolent trees (awesome scene!), she comes back and begins to butcher her friends. They begin one by one to turn into monsters and attack the lone survivor who uncovers the only way to defeat the evil in the woods...or did he?

"born_naughty","1","7","13","20 October 2016"," I wish I knew what the point was
","I wish I knew what the makers were going for. I saw Evil dead because of all the positive reviews and I hated everything about it. I'm not even gonna analyze it, I'm not gonna pan it as I don't see the point. The simple fact is that I hated every single aspect of this movie and I haven't the slightest clue what the they were going for. So afterwards I was reading reviews and I noticed something funny. With the positive reviews there are two kinds: the ones that love it because it's terrifying and the ones that love it because it's hilarious. So which one is it? Was it supposed to be funny or scary? Or both? I'll say right now, both doesn't work. Being scared and laughing are opposites IMHO. I can't be scared and laugh and I can't laugh and be scared. So horror comedy doesn't work, a parody on horror movies does. Except for the famous tree scene (which I didn't find remotely funny nor scary) I don't see anything here that could be meant to be funny. The sequels and Ash vs Evil Dead are definitely more like comedies. So here's what I think. I think this original was either never meant to be a comedy (it was in no way billed or promoted like one and IMDb doesn't list it as one). I think the audience thought it was funny and that's why they decided to make the sequels into comedies. That also explains why Evil Dead 2 feels more like a remake then anything else. I know it's just speculation, I have absolutely not basis of proof but it's an interesting thought nonetheless. You don't have to think so, I think it's an interesting thought."

For such a low budget film, the effects really are quite impressive, and if not impressive, at least innovative. The sequels are genius as well, but the first is easily the best.

The tree violation, Linda's hysteria, the carve ups, Campbell scenes... the film itself is admirable.

After a slow start, when the gore starts, it comes in buckets. Sometimes there is so much it's almost laughable, so stupid and ludicrous. <br/><br/>Actually, this whole film is so bad it is unintentionally funny in a number of spots.

","Today we have an enormous revival of the horror genre. I guess there isn't a month in which no new horror production is released. Even though this genre seems to many young people as something new and exiting, the ""older"" people (starting with people in their late twenties and early thirties) know better. We grew up with horror classics like 'Halloween', 'The Evil Dead',...<br/><br/>The story starts with the five youngsters driving to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. In this cabin in the middle of the woods, they find the Necronomicon and the taped translation of the text. Of course they are curious and they start playing the tape, not knowing which evil this will release. One by one, the teens become deadly zombies, except for one. Now it will be up to him to survive the night and to battle the evil dead. <br/><br/>Even though I'm not a huge fan of gore, I still appreciated this movie. Especially the beginning of the movie is still very intense and powerful. Most of the time these movies haven't been made with a large budget, but that doesn't mean that they don't offer any good fun. 'The Evil Dead' looks rather amateurish, but that's exactly what makes it more believable and good. It seems like these five young people have filmed their own adventures. The only remark that I could have is the special effects. I know that this movie was shot in 1981 and with a small budget, but the special effects sometimes really look pretty bad. Still, this is a classic in the genre and nice to watch. I give it a 7/10."

The acting was terrible, and it was one of the most predictible movies i have ever seen. Nothing is really scary when you know whats going to happen before it does. And the problems havent even begun to start. I am well aware that a movie does not need great special effects to be a quality film, but when the special effects actually take away from the movie its another story. If you do decide to get it, make sure you look at the scenes when it shows the cabin and the moon in the background....i have never in my life seen such a poor editing job.

Far better then the many multi-million dollar slasher/splatter films that it's, or their, constantly compared to.<br/><br/>Five college students take a ride out in the heavily wooded wilds of Tennessee to spend the weekend at a cabin that they rented and things start to go bad even before they reach their destination. Crossing a creaky bridge the car almost falls through the rotted woodwork and barley makes it to the other side. At the cabin the students brother and sister Ashley or ""Ash"" and Linda Williams, Bruce Campball & Besty Baker, together with friends Scotty Cheryl & Shelly, Richard DeManincor Ellen Sandweiss Theresa Tilly,find the place a mess. Cleaning up the place they unearth a book and tape recordings, together with a reel to reel tape recorder, that belonged to the cabin's previous owner.<br/><br/>All this time we get to see and feel that there's something evil in and around the cabin that's just waiting to get unleashed. It's the strange book and weird sounding tape recordings that the new occupants found there that serves as the trigger or linchpin that set. the evil spirit, it into motion. Reading from the book that seems to be a hand-written copy of the notorious Satanic Book of the Dead, Necocomicon, the students then play back the tapes, that they found along with it. The tapes has the owner of the cabin explain what happened to him when he deciphered the books mysteries that must have drove him either out of his mind or in his grave or both. The former cabin owner gives out, on the tape, this eerie and blood-curdling Cathulhu chant that activates the evil that surrounds the cabin. That brings the forces of hell out of their long sleep and into the open taking over the bodies and minds of the unsuspecting students. One at a time it turns them on each other until the cabin, and the area immediately outside of it, turns into a mind-numbing and horrific slaughter-house.<br/><br/>Not for those that are weak of heart ""The Evil Dead"" has an unrelenting drive to it that's never-ending. Not giving you a chance to catch your breath even once the unearthly and evil action once it's starts going and never ever stops. Even the ending, when the horrible night in the cabin is finally over, it sets you and the lone survivor of this massacre up for a nasty surprise with a jump-out-of-your-seat final.<br/><br/>Even though some of the scenes with the Evil Force taking over the students bodies may be a bit overdone, especially in the make-up department, they still jolt you right out of your skin. You start to get the feeling, like those in the movie, that there's nothing on earth that can stop the Forces of Evil unknowingly released by the students. That's until those who released them are overcome possessed and finally consumed by them."

","This is probably one of the most ridiculously simple movies ever made. 5 actors, a small crew, and a very tight budget. But it is precisely those strenuous limitations that make this such a classic.<br/><br/>The story starts of with five friends heading to cabin in the woods for a bit of R&R. Here they find what is called ""The Book of the Dead"" and the terror begins! Many of the shots, and especially the spooky set up, are very clever and provide for a terrific horror film. From hand-held perspective shots to eerily steady tracking shots (a la Kubrick) as the demonic presence stalks the protagonists the movie is non-stop terror and excitement. Also, the amazing gore effects deserve mention and they are so putrid and gross that ultimately makes this film not for all tastes. Especially when a woman is raped by a tree (!!!!!!!!!). But isn't that the point? Gore is meant to be unsettling and horror is supposed to be irrational. That is, after all, what makes it horrifying. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated NC-17: graphic carnage and gore and then some more gore"
"herecomethejudge","2","9","23","26 June 2006"," A woman gets raped by a tree...
","First, there are boobs. There is nudity, despite what the IMDb and CARA say. Second, this movie was recommended to me by a friend who considers herself smart, artsy, goes to art theaters... you know the type. All I can say is, don't believe the hype. I challenge anyone who likes this movie to ask themselves why? I think I was abducted by aliens while watching this movie because I swear the whole thing was over but I don't remember any of it and I'm not even on drugs. Maybe that's the problem. People really need to start being objective in their reviews. What I mean is, forget the cliques you belong to, the image you try and live by, forget what you envy or know about the directors/actors and just look at the movie for what it is. In this case, not too good. This is what I got out of it. The people responsible for creating this trash hated women. There are three women in this movie and they all ended up being possessed, raped and beaten/horrifically dismembered. There are 2 men. One is the ""hero"" (Bruce Cambell, who I guess is some sort of cult movie super hero) and one dies rather quietly without much attention. First woman goes into the woods and is raped by the forest... or a tree... or something not sure but there are roots involved. They show her in agony, screaming, etc. They show a root going up her leg and under her night gown... you know where... They show her cupping her breast as a root tries to remove her hand, then low and behold, they show her naked breast. *gasps* After she is all scratched up and bleeding from the incident she runs back into the cabin... from this point everyone else but the one male hero gets possessed by demons and it's just one giant gore fest from here.<br/><br/>If you hate people, you will like this movie. If you are a nerd, and were dumped by a girl, and are developing a serious psychosis towards woman, you will like this movie. You will probably like Anime too. You know, the type with the aliens, and tentacles, and little helpless girls. (Smart people know the truth about people like you and what's under the hood, know what I mean? Be careful what you admit.) Anyway...<br/><br/>The Pros - Good makeup and gore. Some good camera work.<br/><br/>The Cons - Rape. Uncreative. No talent. No plot."

But even if Raimi had tongue-in-cheek shlock in mind, I think it is hopelessly flawed.  Sure, we all feel smart when we're sharing an inside joke with a director.  But how long can that last?  How long can we smirk at a movie?  The fact that both the audience and Raimi know it's achingly dull doesn't make it right."

","Five friends, Ashly 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), Scott (Hal Delrich), Shelly (Theresa Tilly as Sarah York) and Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) have rented a cabin in some woods in the middle of nowhere. They drive up to the cabin, through the woods. That night, as they eat dinner, the cellar door slams open. At first everyone assumes it to be an animal, but to make sure Scott goes down into the dark cellar to check. When he doesn't come back and doesn't answer when the four remaining friends call him, Ash also enters the cellar. Along with Scott he looks around and finds a shotgun, a tape player, a dagger with a carved handle of skulls and the Necronomicon, the book of the dead, a grotesque looking book that's bound in human skin and written in blood. Back up top they play the tape, it's a spoken translation of the text contained within the book of the dead. Once played the evil dead are resurrected and awoke from their ancient slumber. Later on that night Cheryl thinks she hears someone outside her window, having gone out to investigate she is attacked and raped by possessed tree branches. She manages to make it back to the cabin, no one believes her but Ash offers to take her back to town. However it soon becomes apparent that they can't leave as the only bridge has been destroyed. Back at the cabin Cheryl becomes totally possessed by the evil dead and she stabs Linda in the ankle with a pencil. Soon more of the friends are possessed until only one remains, will anyone survive? Can the friends be saved? Can a way back to town be found? Will that chainsaw in the work shed be used for bodily mutilation, or is it just for show? Watch it and find out, now!<br/><br/>Written and directed over the course of four years by Sam Raimi, who's now hot property in Hollywood following the success of Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004), Raimi makes a cameo appearance in this as one of the hitchhiking fisherman near the start of the film. I love this film, it's so energetic, features loads of over-the-top gore and is just great to watch on a pure fun entertainment level, and it's no surprise Raimi has gone on to enjoy the success he has. The direction from first timer Raimi is full of imagination, style, vigour and as many clever camera tricks he can get away with and his budget would allow for. I love the 'dead cam', we get a P.O.V. shot from the evil dead as they twist and turn their way through the woods, with trees falling down in front of them as they pass over them. A cool looking shot where Ash buries Linda in the woods, the camera is placed in Linda's grave looking up at Ash as he shovels dirt into it, Ash chucks the dirt onto the camera lens, bit by bit the screen goes black until finally only Ash's face is visible through a little section that hasn't been covered, god knows how this was achieved but it works really well and looks like a lot of effort and thought went into a short scene. A great throwaway shot where the camera is positioned under Ash looking up at him as the soles of his shoes are visible on each side of the screen. Or a shot which follows Ash across the room from above his head, the camera speeds along to keep up with him and the beams in the roof coming into shot as he walks under them, and they make a whooshing noise as they quickly enter and leave the shot. And a shot where Ash walks on screen, but the image is upside down and the camera moves towards the back of his head and over it and turning 90 degrees it comes to rest on a shot of his face the right way up. Or the way Raimi can make someone walking up a wooden staircase to the cellar interesting, he puts his camera behind and underneath the slats of wood that make up the staircase and follows Ash as he walks up them from this cool angle, the film is visually excellent and a joy to watch, throughout. The acting is just OK, except Campbell who is as likable as always. The script by Raimi is also great entertainment and manages to pack the screen with a feast of blood soaked set-pieces. Although variable in quality the effects include, zombies, dismemberment, stabbings, decapitations, eye gouging, staking, shotgun blast wounds, burnings, beatings, bitten off hands and a pencil stuck in someones ankle, the blood flows freely in this one! There is also some slightly unconvincing stop motion animation at the end, but like all the special effects in this film, I've seen a lot worse and they really aren't all that bad, just not comparable to todays multi million costing soulless CGI. There a couple of shots here and there when it's obvious that a double was used probably because the original actor or actress was no longer available, in particular the fight Ash has with the possessed Linda after she emerges from the grave he buried her in, her hair style is totally different between certain shots! The only nudity is when Cheryl is raped by the possessed trees, another cool sequence. I love this film, get past a slightly slow first 20 minutes and your in for a highly entertaining and action packed gore fest, watch it as soon as you can! Highly recommended."
"lale-ba","5","2","3","4 April 2017"," Directing foundations
","Sam Raimi's franchise about the dead coming back to life went almost side by side with Romero's Living dead"" story and the parallels are unavoidable. The Evil dead"" will tackle the same situation horror layout, with young people being trapped inside the lonesome cabin in the woods, but with some weaker plots and action sequences. However, Raimi will compensate the hollow script with his directing talent and trademark fast moving camera to create the tension and horror. As for the Romero, effects are really outdated, but also more gorish. Also, a whole new B-production star will be born with Bruce Campbell taking the male lead. The Evil dead"" is one the flicks that made zombie trash horror genre."

It's overloaded with gore, unintentional comedy( truth be told, Evil dead was originally intended to be a serious horror film, however, it often gets mistaken for a horror comedy merely because of the films laughable and primitive effects) and a very likable lead, Bruce Campbell. But, looking back, I don't know if you can honestly regard this as a ''masterpiece of horror'' like many claim. In my opinion, it hasn't stood the test of time very well. As a matter of fact, it is awful by today's standards, like many other old horror films out there.

Pretty serious in tone, 2 couples rent a cabin in the woods and discover The Necronomicon and awaken The Evil Dead. Very different for its time this gory fright film delivers on both scares and horrific make up f/x. This has very little comedy and moves at a slower pace than the other entries in the series. I must admit, I prefer Evil Dead 2 with more Bruce Campbell, the introduction of splatstick comedy. Evil Dead 2 is pretty much a reimagined version of the 1st film that does everything the 1st film does better. But, that is only my preference and opinion.

","THE EVIL DEAD is a true, low-budget labor of love, and a damned good horror film! From the opening scene, the sense of unease begins. Director Sam Raimi's camera skims the cold water like a ghost, letting us know that we're in for a terrifying experience. Everything that follows is a lesson in how to make a fright film. For its age, and lack of big money, this movie shows what a young director can do by using his ingenuity and imagination. This movie is scary, even when nothing is happening! The cabin! The cellar! The forest! All soaked In bleakness and doom! Scant moments of humor only accentuate the wickedness in the air. The practical effects range from innovative to ingenious. In Bruce Campbell, Raimi found the perfect... hero? anti-hero? Non-hero? Whatever he is, his role as Ashley ""Ash"" Williams is that of a regular guy caught up in increasingly unbelievable, supernatural circumstances, and Bruce is absolutely believable. He would go on to surpass even this, in the uproarious sequel! Everyone else is good as well, especially when the demons arise, and the gore hits the fan! Few filmmakers charge right out of the gate w/ anything even remotely like THE EVIL DEAD. Raimi quickly joined Romero, Carpenter, Craven, et al., in the upper levels of horror movie-making..."

","This movie is one of my all time favorite horror films. Very cheesy, but in a cood way. It goes along with the low budget campy vibe of the film. It had a somewhat simple but good story. Teens go to cabin. Teens awaken dead. Teen have to fight off the dead. Its filled with some very ridiculous and funny scenes. The gore is not frequent, but when it hits it's in your face and over the top which makes its impact even better. It's one of those movies you watch to have fun, and it's a really fun movie."

","I'm 17 years old and honestly, i actually love this film with a passion. Everything about it, the gore, the special effects, the setting, the theme, the plot and the camera work the lot! I first heard about this film when i was about 7 or 8 and we got the game on ps1. After that, the fascination began. Took me a while to watch it as this film used to scare me a heck of a lot. But once i was able to watch it, its been my favourite horror film since. This film has inspired me to pursue a career in media. It might sound odd but honestly this film is that good. If your a fan of the B movie horror films then this should be a favourite. This is the king of B movie horrors. It doesn't have great special effects (at all) but thats why this film is amazing. The over-the-top violence is endulging. Sam Raimi's best film. The camera technique when the camera goes over the rafters is just brilliant. If your a lover of horror films, this is a must. Every horror fan must/would've seen this film! Class!"

"Nedla24","10","1","1","22 August 2000"," Truly Disturbing
","Of all the words in the english language, disturbing is the best to describe Sam Raimi's cult horror classic.  The setup is simple enough; five friends rent a cabin in the woods and are attacked by evil spirits that inhabit bodies and go on a killing rampage, but it is on this seemingly cliche premise that Raimi builds a horror masterwork.  Evil Dead delivers in every aspect that you would expect of a horror movie and a few that are surprising.  While Evil Dead has mounds upon mounds of gore, billions of ""jump moments"", and other standard horror movie fare, it also builds genuine suspense.  Also the standard horror fare is top-shelf.  The Gore is frightening and not just sickening, the jump moments are perfectly timed and really make you jump.  Furthermore there is a sense of humanity faced with the unspeakable.  As a detatched viewer, you yell at the screen for Ash (Bruce Campbell) to take action, but you realize that faced with that situation you too would be frozen in horror.  Raimi does an excellent job of drawing his audience into the action with heavy doses of point of view shots and close ups that seem to bounce toward and away from the character.  These techniques are used with great success (and ripped off in the recent Blair Witch Project).  While the end may not be as satisfying as one would hope, any ending to this wonderfully horrible ordeal is a happy one.  I would like to end by saying that I am not a fan of the horror movie genre.  I find films like the Elm Street, Friday 13th, and Scream series to be highly stupid, but this movie is genuinely terrifying.  Recommended for those who really want to be scared and have a strong stomach"

"RockPortReview","10","4","9","6 February 2010"," Sam Raimi's horror Masterpiece!
","Evil Dead 1/16/2010<br/><br/>This was Sam Raimi's first feature film and has since achieved epic cult status. There have been two sequels made, Evil Dead 2 & Army of Darkness. While Evil Dead 4 has been rumored for years, the release of ""Drag Me to Hell"", Raimi's triumphant return to the horror genre, prospects are looking good for another ""Dead"" sequel.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi met his leading man and constant collaborator Bruce Campbell in high school and both also went to Michigan State University. In the late 1970's Sam and Bruce put together a short film called ""Within the Woods"" which got them the funding they needed for a feature. Evil Dead was made in the early 80's on a budget of $350,000, and is still one of the most loved cult horror films ever made. It seems to get even better with repeated viewings. <br/><br/>It is the story of five friends spending a weekend in cabin to relax and party. In the deep dark basement they find a tape recorder, a book, and a ceremonial dagger. Upon playing the tape (which is a translation of the book) they inadvertently unleash an evil force that will eventually crash their weekend. The cabin was once owned by a professor of archeology and the book is the Necronomicon or ""Book of the Dead"" it is bound in human flesh and written in blood. One by one the characters get inhabited by the evil force and turned in to hideous demons. As the tape says the only way to kill them is ""total body dismemberment."" Raimi is a huge Three Stooges fan and this can be seen in many of his movies. Known for his slap stick style of comedic horror and gore, his movies are truly original. <br/><br/>The acting is quite over the top, but that's part of its charm. The make up effects are pretty creative and effective for the budget that had to work with. The camera work and shot selection is innovative and well done. This is a film that stands the test of time and will be enjoyed for generations to come."
"Witchfinder-General-666","10","4","9","7 February 2009"," The Epitome Of Horror... And Ingenious Film-Making!
","There are good Horror films, there are great Horror films and then there are masterpieces that every Horror fan, no, every film fan MUST see. Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" of 1981 definitely belongs to the latter category. If a survey was held among true Horror fans, this film would certainly be one of the most frequent titles in the top ten. And for good reasons, as this low budget masterpiece is one of the most awe-inspiring, creepiest, scariest and simply amazing Horror films ever produced. The amazing fact aside that Raimi and his crew shot this with an incredibly low budget, ""The Evil Dead"" accomplishes what hardly another film has. This is easily one of the scariest, creepiest, simply terrifying Horror/Gore films ever made. Even though this is one of the films that epitomize the term Horror, however, it is also witty and hilariously funny at times, which is something unique for a film as scary as this one. At the time of its release, the film was heavily bashed by critics for its extreme violence and gore, and censored and banned in several countries. If anything, however, the repulsion of censors and some critics helped the film achieve an instant cult-status. Director Sam Raimi instantly became known as a Horror master, the leading man Bruce Campbell became one of the most celebrated Horror/B-movie cult-actors, and ""The Evil Dead"" has since long been recognized as a milestone of the Horror genre.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" takes place in a world of the all-mighty H. P. Lovecraft whose amazing literary work has been the base of many brilliant Horror films. And nothing does the man's genius more justice than a cinematic masterpiece like this film. The film follows a group of friends (two guys and three girls) who want to spend a fun weekend in a remote log cabin in the woods. When they find a tape in the basement of the house, they play it out of curiosity and subsequently awaken evil spirits which possess them one by one...<br/><br/>I do not want to give away too much, but I will say this: ""The Evil Dead"" is an absolute must see for everybody even slightly interested in Horror. As mentioned above, this film epitomizes the term ""Horror"" and is extremely creepy and purely terrifying from the beginning to the end, and yet it is also funny - a combination which is, at least to this degree, extremely rare. As opposed to most films, this film's extremely morbid sense of humor does in no way lessen the constant suspense, but goes perfectly in hand with it. The gore is not only extreme, but also extremely well-made. By the time of its release, this was one of the goriest American films ever, today it proudly stands as one of the most celebrated Horror/Gore films ever made. Bruce Campbell is the ONLY choice for the leading character Ash here. Campbell has long become a cult-figure and one of the most popular Horror actors, and while the man is great in every role he plays, he will always be Ash to his fans. The film is impressive in all regards, especially visually (even more so regarding the low budget). The brilliant cinematography contributes a lot to the films incredible scariness, the makeup is incomparably creepy and the gore effects are amazing. The film's sound effects, the voices,... there is simply nothing about this film that is not scary and simply fantastic. The film spawned two sequels so far, which are both very good, but for me this terrifying and ingenious original is still the greatest. Another sequel is planned for 2010. I've personally seen ""The Evil Dead"" countless times and I sure intend to see it countless more times. I could on praising this film forever, but I'll end this comment with a recommendation: If there is a poor soul out there who hasn't seen it so far, do so immediately. ""The Evil Dead"" is an ingenious masterpiece, and no one interested in Horror or film in general can afford to miss it. 10/10"
"BA_Harrison","10","4","9","25 November 2006"," A relentless, gory masterpiece.
","Sam Raimi may be working with mega-budgets and A-list stars these days but, in my opinion, nothing he has done has surpassed the brilliance of The Evil Dead. In terms of originality and verve, this movie certainly surely tops any of his Hollywood blockbusters.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: five people vacationing in a remote Tennessee cabin are attacked and possessed by ancient spirits. Despite this simple plot, the movie manages to be thoroughly engaging from start to finish and delivers plenty of scares along with tons of inventive special effects.<br/><br/>Raimi spices up the visuals with a bagful of directorial tricks including improvised steadicam shots and unusual POV angles. Such techniques can become tiresome if overused, but Raimi keeps a tight rein on proceedings and uses these shots where they are most effective, rather than just for the sake of them. Great editing and imaginative sound design add to the overall brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>The gore effects are, for the most part, very good. The more outlandish and extravagant gags towards the end are the least impressive (the Plasticine stop motion is kind of shonky) but, considering the budget, this can easily be forgiven.<br/><br/>The cast are uniformly excellent, with a special mention going to the young Bruce Campbell as Ash, whose brilliantly physical performance carries the latter part of the film pretty much on its own. He convincingly portrays a character that is pushed beyond snapping point, but who claws his way back to fight the evil forces that surround him.<br/><br/>In the early 80s, The Evil Dead was caught up in the whole 'Video Nasty' debate, and subsequently banned in the UK. As a teenager, I treasured my beat up old pirate copy of the film, but have since bought the full uncut version on DVD and the original Palace VHS release (which features great cover art!). This brilliant film never deserved to be vilified in the manner it was, and is thankfully now recognised by cinephiles as the highly influential and truly marvellous movie that it is."

EVen though the film was low budget, it still managed to bring the scares and a bucketload (and more) of gore to the film.<br/><br/>The first of a trilogy, it is this film which is strictly horror in every sense of the word. The comedy you may see in it now, was not intentional. Bruce Campbell is an absolute legend and this was one of his earliest films. WITHIN THE WOODS was the precusor to THE EVIL DEAD, and that is a brilliant nasty little film in its own right.<br/><br/>If you are only familiar with EVIL DEAD 2, ARMY OF DARKNESS or ASH VS EVIL DEAD, then you need to do yourself a favor and watch the original film which started it all. It may start off slow, but when it gets to the horror, it does not stop. And it is not relenting. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It is a solid 10/10 from me"

Window smashes, girlfriend gone, fun begins! Here we see a more Black comedy yet mixed in to the bowl with a still very scary and jumpy film. The effects in this film are far more advanced from the first and are a joy to watch. (Spoiler): When ashes hand gets posses, and lopt off by the man himself in a crazy gory blood spattering frenzy the real fun begins and our well known hero Ash is born, Chainsaw to the right hand, BOOM stick to the left. GROOVY. Evil Dead III Army of Darkness Still carrying on form Ashes last adventure we see him in a med-evil realm, caught by a army of men and thought to be one of the enemy Ashes is stripped of his weapons and taken to a castle, doesn't take long tho for him to get his Boom stick out and go on the trail to find the Necronimicon Exmortis. In a trail for love and wanting to go home, Ash goes on a journey to get the book for a befriended wizard in order to fight the Army of Darkness, Fronted by Evil Ash, (If your confused watch the movie).

Bruce Campbell, as always, does an amazing job along with all of the other actors/actresses.

"Ore-Sama","8","3","6","23 November 2007"," The Tag Line Was Actually Right
","""The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror"" This tag line is actually correct this time instead of a lame exaggeration. The terror produced by this film is indeed grueling and physically exhausting. I thought I saw the scariest films ever made in ""Halloween"" or ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and while those film did indeed produce their own kind of terror, ""Evil Dead"" has surpassed them.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Five friends go to a cabin for some good old partying. A few weired instances take place but only when the Necromonicon is found and a tape player recites the text that the fun begins.<br/><br/>What makes this film so scary? The first would have to be the inventive camera angles. Fast, rapid and above all else stylish, especially when from the demon's POV, it's like being grabbed by the shirt and pulled along for the ride. The cabin is a perfect setting to take advantage of which Raimi does. Add to that is the use of sound. A creepy soundtrack with sinister sounds and a good use of silence, this movie has scene after scene after scene of unbearable tension, knowing something is going to pop out but never knowing when.<br/><br/>The makeup on the zombies are well done and while the fore effects are not realistic, they sure are cool to look at. The acting ranges from mediocre to below, the best performance going to Bruce Campell who pulls off his part fairly well.<br/><br/>On the downside, the film does drag a bit at the end, probably could've been cut about 5-10 minutes short. With that aside, this is a classic, classic horror film and one of the best ever made undoubtedly."
"authorofhorror","10","3","6","14 October 2007"," Still the best
","I first watched this film years ago, and I still love it. The casting was great, the effects were awesome for the time and budget, and the acting was above average. Above average isn't that good? Well, take into consideration that this was the first major film of most of these actors and actresses careers, and the first major film for Sam Raimi (true legend) and Bruce Campbell (Horror movie God!).<br/><br/>This movie is about a group of teens who buy a cabin in the woods and have a party. After snooping around the cellar, they uncover an old reeled-tape player, reeled-tape, a shotgun, some shells, and a torn Hills Have Eyes poster. Ash (Bruce) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) bring the player and tape upstairs so they can listen to it. Upon doing so, they unleash the deadites from the Necronomicon, which was originally ""created"" by H.P. Lovecraft in several of his short stories. The Necronomicon was basically a book bound in human flesh, inked in human blood, that contained nothing but evil spells, art, and the occasional cheese ball line.<br/><br/>After a woman gets raped by a gang of violent tree branches, she becomes a zombie possessed by one of these evil creatures. Some of the hardcore Evil Dead fans know the ""deadites"" are Indian spirits bent of revenge. After everyone except Ash falls victim to the spirits, he wages war against these ""monsters"". With shotgun, shovel, and chainsaw in hand, Ash decapitates, burns, and slices these creatures until daylight... Is this the end? Does Ash go unharmed? Of course... Or does he?"
"Aaron1375","8","3","6","4 October 2007"," The woods are full of the dead...
","Yes, this movie would go on to spawn two sequels, both of which had a bit more comic tone, however this one is almost pure horror. Albeit, with a couple of humorous scenes. The story, two couples and one sister go into the woods for a nice relaxing retreat. They end up at a cabin which is a bit run down, but not to bad of shape. Strange things happen and then they discover a secret in the basement that unleashes the evil dead! What ensues you ask? General mayhem and lots of gore. In fact this is the first time I have seen the movie in some time, I did not remember how bloody this movie got. This movie features a very young Bruce Campbell and some rather pretty girls and one other guy. They all do rather well, however, the real star is the unique style of the film which was kind of a new way of doing things back then. Basically, the foe or monster coming at a person basically being shown as the camera's point of view. Very effective...what else do you get, lots of body parts being chopped here and there and something else that is rare in horror movies a guy who is the lead and lasts the longest rather than a female. Granted there are still some of the same stuff you see in other horror movies. You will also probably say to the screen ""don't do that!!"". Still this is a very good horror movie and hey the next two movies would be very good as well."

He and 4 other students are taking a vacation in an old cabin in the woods, they unwittingly resurrect some slumbering demons that one by one take possession of the students.<br/><br/>Unlike the title suggests, this is not a zombie movie, it is a horror that is both supernatural and evil, but it's also brilliantly funny without taking away the gruesome and creepy feel of the film.<br/><br/>The only bad thing in the movie is the quite obvious low budget that Raimi had to work with. Thankfully most people can see past this flaw and appreciate just how good this movie is.<br/><br/>8/10"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","8","3","6","7 October 2006"," Join us!
","Released in the years before cable TV and before video cassettes made low budget schlock available to the average viewer, Evil Dead found its audience with the midnight movie horror festival crowd. No way did it get a nationwide release. Privately owned cinemas bought prints and slowly the film spread from coast to coast and even made its way to Britain. But by this time videos were gaining popularity and it was released on cassette at the same time as a very limited theatrical release.<br/><br/>Critics and censors dismissed it as trash and not long afterwards it was relegated to the video nasty bin and banned. As silly as this may seem, that was the logic of the BBFC. The fact that it is inventive and well directed was lost on them. And until recently only cult audiences appreciated its value. With Anchor Bay's new DVD we can all finally enjoy the uncut, definitive and best-looking presentation possible.<br/><br/>Originally released in 1981 as The Book Of The Dead, this was a feature length re-make of Sam Raimi's short film, Within The Woods. The plot (excuse) and story (violence) involves a quintet of friends, enjoying a few days of quiet at a remote cabin in the Tennessee woods. These are not Friday the 13th goofballs who want nothing but sex and skinny-dipping. They are realistic. And it all goes nicely until Scotty (Hal Delrich) finds an ugly-looking book (with a face) and an old reel-to-reel tape recorder in the basement. The tape is of an archaeologist explaining how he resurrected demons that took over his wife in the very same cabin. The professor is nowhere to be found, but the haunting burial rites and incantations written in Sumerian text in the ugly book, The Necronomicon Ex Mortis-Book Of The Dead, are on the tape also.<br/><br/>Sheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) freaks out. She hears a demonic voice out in the woods. ""Join us!"" Foolishly going out to investigate, she is raped by a tree. Although this particular scene isn't so hard to watch, the film still has the power to disturb and make you squirm.<br/><br/>Once Sheryl returns, all hell breaks loose and Raimi has a helluva time firing torrents of blood of varying colours throughout the cabin. Limbs are hacked off with carefree abandon and poor old Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to take them all on at once.<br/><br/>The supernatural hijinks were repeated to a much lesser effect in the sequel, but here Raimi creates an atmosphere of dread and whatever that force is out in the woods - it's scary. It does have some humour, but first time around the filmmakers obviously wanted horror first. You'll wince a few times, no doubt. The raw tone goes hand-in-hand with the low budget and Raimi's bizarre, hardcore cartoonish style is much in evidence.<br/><br/>More time is spent building character. Ash loves his girlfriend and a simple little scene between them makes us totally root for him. He is still to become the hapless buffoon, as he will repeat in Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>At the very least, Evil Dead is so popular that it can no longer be regarded as a cult movie. It's not a classic. Not yet. But it is highly regarded and definitely worth several viewings."
"jellyneckr","Null","3","6","4 June 2005"," One of the best horror films ever made.
","The 1980s was the best decade for horror films. There was AN American WEREWOLF IN London, CHILD'S PLAY, POLTERGEIST, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, and lastly there was THE EVIL DEAD. What made these horror movies so great was that they were very creative pictures that were cleverly directed and had generally impressive writing. Out of the five films mentioned above, THE EVIL DEAD is easily the most shocking and disturbing. We see a woman get raped by tress, hacked up limbs, and gore galore. Still, for those people with strong stomaches, THE EVIL DEAD is considered a classic and rightfully so. It contains all the key elements a well made horror flick should: a believable performance from the lead actor (Bruce Campbell), effective music, fantastic camera work, genuine suspense, and excellent (albeit dated) special effects. On the minor downside, the aforementioned tree rape scene goes a bit too far. Sam Raimi has said himself in interviews that he regrets the way he shot the scene and if he could go back and change it, he would.

","Evil Dead (1981) was one of the last midnight movies (at least in my area). It was also the most violent, gory and cheesiest horror film I have seen in<br/><br/>the last ten or so years that was highly entertaining.  A group of college<br/><br/>kids go fooling around in some old cabin and discover the Necronomicon. Yes, they find the book that H.P. Lovecraft used to love to write about. A book made from human skin and contains a bizarre language and horrific images.  Evil Dead was the movie that raised the bar on shock and gore.<br/><br/>Not only did this movie launch the career of Sam Raimi but it made Bruce<br/><br/>Campbell a B-movie legend.   Made on the cheap but it brought in a lot of<br/><br/>money and in the process became one of the most talked about horror films<br/><br/>of all time.  Several years later, armed with a bigger budget, the same team<br/><br/>produced a semi-sequel/remake that eases on the horror and amps up the<br/><br/>black comedy.  An essential film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/><br/>A+"

","Five college friends take a vacation from school in a abandoned cabin in the middle of the woods. Weird happenings and a phantom force plague the students once they stumble across the Book of the Dead. It seems that the previous tenant of the cabin was a man working on translating the book. His translation opens a doorway unleashing a force that they may not survive from. This film was shot on less than a shoestring. What we are given is an amazing film that builds slow to a wicked ending and a cult status that is second to none. This film was a labor of love by all those who worked on it. It may look `amateurish' but that is part of its' charm. The camerawork is awesome the effects are awesome. The ending is a killer setpiece. I couldn't imagine this film made any better than it was. True, if you pay close attention the continuity is pretty bad. But since the film was shot over a two year period so it is easy to see why these problems would happen. I rate this as a classic. 10/10"

Sure, it was low budget and they did what they could special effects-wise, but that doesn't explain 70's and 80's horror movie stupidity.

","It might seem rather morbid now but a prolific topic of conversation in 1983 were video nasties . I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON in particular came up in conversation with colleagues and friends on a regular basis but perhaps the most talked about video nasty* was THE EVIL DEAD , especially the scenes featuring "" The woman and the trees "" and "" That bit with the pencil "" . After finally seeing it that year I was very disappointed . I found it dumb , badly made and badly paced and basically a waste of time .<br/><br/>I saw it again last night when it was broadcast as part of Channel 4's "" Banned "" season and my opinion of it has improved , but only very slightly . This might be because I have become impressed by director Sam Raimi's work over the years most especially A SIMPLE PLAN and THE GIFT , two very intriguing thrillers and feel he'd probably be better sticking to that genre instead of making yet another sequel to SPIDERMAN . Despite the director's later success THE EVIL DEAD is still very flawed . It might have literate roots that other so called video nasties lack ( HP Lovecroft is an obvious influence on this movie ) but it's still basically a bunch of teenagers go into the woods and get killed in a graphic manner type plot . The characters aren't characters at all they're just cyphers to drive the plot along and the acting is poor . They're is some humour but I'm uncertain if this was deliberate on the part of Raimi . Compare this movie to its sequel and tell me what one is actually trying to be funny <br/><br/>THE EVIL DEAD is a movie that would probably have become totally forgotten if it wasn't for the director's later success . It remains rather watchable though which is something you can't say about most other cheap and cheerless horror movies from the period , but it's no masterpiece either <br/><br/>* Yeah I know THE EVIL DEAD isn't a "" video nasty "" in the true sense so don't message me to point this out"
"StellarDread3","2","4","10","24 September 2017"," The worst film I have ever seen
","To start off with I love weird stupid films and shows, I personally love the Scary Movie franchise (Yes the later ones were not as good as the first two), I love the idea of just sitting down, switching my brain off and enjoying idiotic things for an hour and a half. But I like many people have limits and this film destroyed them, before watching this film I thought the worst kind of film was a boring film that you don't even react to, but no this film changed that.<br/><br/>So this film is about a group of people going to a cabin in the woods for a holiday and when they get there weird and satanic stuff happens, nothing other than that really happens. The characters are very forgettable and bland and this includes the main character who is the worst of the bunch, but where this film is at its worst is with what it shows and makes you listen to.<br/><br/>One of these things occurs about 25 minutes into the film, when I first watched this I stopped it and made sure I saw what I actually saw and then carried on, the thing that happens is one of the dumbest things I think I have ever seen (Remember I love the first two Scary Movie films) and it just makes you rack your brains at its existence. Then near the end everything gets so much worse as the sounds used are very grating and just painful to listen to.<br/><br/>A pro of this film is the special effects which for the low budget of this film (Wikipedia puts it between 400,000 and 500,000) is just incredible as they are so creative and puts other horror directors with bigger budgets to shame. Other than that the plot is like the characters and is very boring and forgettable and the film is regarded as a Horror and it is not scary at all compared to other films from that era like 'The Thing' and 'Friday the 13th' this could just be because of budget but 'Friday the 13th' did not have a much higher budget (Wikipedia puts it at 550,000), this film also has been regarded by fans as a comedy and it is not funny in the slightest. <br/><br/>It may have been different if I saw it when it came out but I do not know, it could just be my taste in films (Although I would say I like quite a broad range of films). Oh well I have no idea and if you like this film then that is great that it can appeal to others and bring you/them happiness and remember that this has been my opinion and you really do not need to get upset or angry with it but hey, do what you like. Have a good one :)"

","Yep. The trees in this film were certainly 100% wood, alright. And, on a whole, I'd say that they made much better actors than did the likes of that complete piece of wood, Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>(And, yeah, that goes double for the rest of the incompetent twits in this troupe of second-rate amateurs, as well!) <br/><br/>OK. You can call me ""Mr. Jaded"" if you like, but, from where I was sitting, this original version of The Evil Dead (that's ""TED"", for short) certainly didn't come anywhere near to living up to all of the preposterous praise and over-baked hype that's been heaped upon it over these past thirty-something years.<br/><br/>And, hey, excuse me if I've suddenly forgotten how to laugh, but I'd sure like to know what the heck people are talking about when they refer to the so-called ""comedy"" factor of TED.<br/><br/>And besides TED being a notorious film for delivering far too many red herrings for its own good, it also had a terrible knack for giving away its ""shocking' surprises long before they actually took place.<br/><br/>Like, for instance - Always well before any horrific moment occurred, there was a noticeable, dramatic rise in the volume of the background music. And this, of course, would immediately clue the viewer in that something definitely ""not nice"" was most certainly coming their way.<br/><br/>As you can well-imagine this nonsense totally ruined the overall effect of any intended surprises & shocks.<br/><br/>All-in-all - The original Evil Dead was something of a major disappointment, in my books. I didn't hate this movie, but, with that said, I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they were freaking-out on acid or else at the fall-down stage of being drunk.<br/><br/>Hey!

","If you were looking for the best example in the ""video nasty"" market, or possibly the bloodiest movie ever made, look no further than this hilarious and over the top gore fest from director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man). Basically five friends, Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), his sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Scotty (Richard DeManincor, or Hal Delrich) and Shelly (Theresa Tilly, or Sarah York) have rented a cabin in the woods for a vacation. Soon after arriving they explore, and they find the Book of the Dead along with a tape recorder with a Professor reading the incantations from the book, and unknowingly they have released the Evil Dead. Cheryl is first to suffer the consequences when she is lured outside in the dark, and she is pinned down by the possessed trees of the forest to be brutally raped before managing to escape and get back inside. Then not long later, while playing with some cards, Cheryl turns her head to reveal herself as a possessed zombie like monster warning them they will all die, and stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil. The four friends manage to lock the now evil Cheryl in the cellar, but then Shelley is next to be turned when something smashes through the window and possesses her. After killing Shelley with an axe, Scotty and Ash think it is a good idea to leave, but Scotty returns with severe injuries that mean he will eventually die. Unfortunately for Ash he goes to check on Linda who has become possessed by the evil spirits, she does go back to normal for a moment, but quickly turns again, and trying to kill him he is forced to stab her with a dagger. Ash can't bring himself to cut up his girlfriend with a chainsaw, so he buries her corpse in the soil, and just a moment later she rises from the grave to try and kill him. After defeating the possessed Linda by decapitating her with a spade, he goes to the cellar to get a gun and shells, and after a quick scuffle with an escaped Cheryl he barricades the doors and windows. After getting more shells and having the pipes burst with blood, Ash has to contend with the now dead and possessed Scotty, who gets his eyes gouged out, and Cheryl comes in to beat him with a fire poker. Ash notices the Book of the Dead on the floor, and he manages to grab and throw it in the blazing flames in the fireplace. This causes the bodies to fall apart and decompose with mounds of flesh, pussy liquids and blood, leaving Ash as the lone survivor, but the film ends with something speeding at him and he screams in terror. Also starring Ted Raimi as Fake Shemp. Campbell makes good as the one who endures all the violence, and the giggly creatures go overboard with their torturous intent, it is both violent and funny at the same. It should also be mentioned that the camera is surprisingly inventive as it weaves through the cabin and woods, but everyone watching will lap up the high amount of blood and guts spewing, an essential horror (comedy). It was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!"

The ending, trying not to give away any spoilers, just leaves it hanging open with no resolution and makes it too obvious that it wants a sequel. I'm not even sure if I can qualify it for its perceived ""camp"" value; dull, flat acting from four of the five cast members, weak special effects (yeah, yeah, yeah. I know:  it was made in 1981!

"a_chinn","10","3","7","17 September 2018"," The original Ash vs. Deadites
","Classic low budget horror film that I love and can no longer objectively review. Directorial debut of Sam Raimi (""Army of Darkness"" ""A Simple Plan"" ""Spider-Man""), film debut of cult favorite Bruce Campbell in his most iconic role as Ash Williams (although his Elvis in ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" is my personal favorite), and the filmscore debut of prolific composer Joseph LoDuca (""Xena: Warrior Princess"" ""Spartacus"" ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""). The film was produced by Rob Tapert, who'd go on to produce many more films and TV shows with Raimi. Ash and his group of friends in their 73 Oldsmobile head to a remote cabin in the woods and inadvertently wake the evil dead when they read aloud from the Necrocomicon. Demonic possessions, evil trees, and all sorts of weirdness ensue. For such a low budget film, it's manages to to be visually inventive (particularly the evil spirit POV shots through the woods), shockingly gory (but in a fun over-the-top way), and also works wonderfully as a black comedy. ""Evil Dead 2"" does feature better special effects and is much more consistent in tone, staying consistent as a dark horror comedy than this first film, which at times wants to be a straight horror film and at other times wants to be tongue-in-check, but those are minor quibbles for a film that's terrifically fun and wildly inventive. A must see for horror fans, but maybe not a film for all tastes."
"Flickout","1","3","7","29 May 2016"," 90 Minutes I'll never get back
","This monstrosity has to be among the five worst films I've ever sacrificed time to watch. A migraine would have been more fun. It's obvious within the first three minutes that the script...well, to be polite...stinks to high heaven. I've heard better dialogue come from the pens of fifth graders. Of course, the premise really doesn't deserve a decent script. Take 5 college-age kids (although I doubt that any of them could have gotten into college), 3 girls and 2 guys? (why not 3 couples? - or would one more talentless unknown have been beyond the budget?) and put them in the usual deserted cabin in the woods.<br/><br/>Next, let them act like 5 college kids alone in the woods - not! Do they drink? Smoke some pot? Make out? Get naked? This is an NC-17 film, so there's no reason not to do all of those. But no - we must rush into finding the poor man's version of Lovecraft's ""Necromicon"" and turn the evil spirits loose before we have time to find out if we care about our characters and their futures.<br/><br/>The only scene in the film worth watching - and fairly (but only fairly) well-done is the attack of the vines and tree roots. This was the obvious time to introduce the touch of nudity sorely needed in an NC17 film. But no...'twas not to be, here or elsewhere.<br/><br/>From there, the film quickly and fully degenerates into a gore fest, with blood, guts, body parts, and unknown fluids flying in all directions. Unfortunately, that's where it stays, right to the (painfully far ahead) finish. I won't call it a denouement, since that would imply that there was a plot or story to be resolved. No such luck. <br/><br/>It's a tough call on which is worse - script or acting. It often seems that the film is progressing (a generous term) without either script or acting, just blurting along on its own. Ultimately, I think worst accolades have to go to the script, since not even Sir Lawrence Olivier could have made any of those roles believable.<br/><br/>Right down there in Putrid Land with script and acting are the special effects. No excuse accepted such as ""OK for the time period"". No, they're not OK. Look at a couple of good short films from the 70s such as ""Closed Mondays"", or ""Bags"" to see what the times could do. When it comes to effects, though, I have to say that nothing says ""the good guy won"" like oatmeal squeezed from a vanquished villain's cuff.<br/><br/>Gawd, this thing was a disaster. It could have been played for comedy, but they were too full of themselves to admit it was a turkey. I'm going to take two aspirin and watch a ""Gilligan's Island"" marathon so I can see some *quality* filmmaking."
"Uriah43","4","3","7","25 October 2012"," A Splatter Film
","I bought this movie recently under the mistaken assumption that it was a zombie film. At least that's what a zombie site on the internet said. Needless to say, this is NOT a film about zombies. At least it's not about zombies in the traditional sense. It's more about demonic possession. Regardless, this is a great low-budget film for those who enjoy the splatter film genre. Gore hounds will simply love it. Horror fans might like it too depending on which style of horror they prefer. But this isn't Hitchcock or even Stephen King for that matter. Like I said, it's a splatter film and because of that it revels in graphic special effects and violence. Now, some of the special effects are very good. Unfortunately, some of them are downright silly and (in my opinion) lowers the film's value. Likewise, the acting is essentially non-existent. But that's not through any fault of the actors necessarily. The fact is that there simply wasn't any room for acting or much dialogue due to the huge amount of brutal action and special effects. And while I recognized Bruce Campbell, the rest of the actors were completely unknown to me. Not that it really mattered of course as nobody was going to win an Academy Award for their roles in this movie anyway. It did however manage to win a Saturn Award for ""Best Low-Budget Film"" and that is certainly quite an achievement. Even so, the fact that it is a low-budget film doesn't necessarily mean that everybody should overlook the obvious faults and pretend they don't exist. Things like dialogue, plot and character development are important and shouldn't be dismissed because the special effects are so plentiful or gory. After all, it doesn't cost much money to write a script. It also doesn't require much imagination to improve on a plot that consists simply of 5 young adults going to a cabin and (all but one) getting chopped up in graphic detail. For that reason, I thought this movie could have been better. But that is just my opinion. One thing I do know though is that this movie isn't for the squeamish or the faint-of-heart. But it is sure to satisfy a certain niche who loves this type of film. And that's perfectly fine."
"manchester_england2004","10","3","7","31 July 2009"," A masterpiece that lives up to its tag-line!
","The tag-line for THE EVIL DEAD - the ultimate experience in grueling terror - is genuinely lived up to.<br/><br/>Having seen the sequel, EVIL DEAD 2, before this one and laughing hard at its light-hearted intentionally comical nature, I was completely unprepared for what awaited me when I popped the video tape of THE EVIL DEAD into my VCR player all those years ago.<br/><br/>There is an ongoing polarising debate about what makes a good horror movie - supernatural horror or gore. Sam Raimi sweeps away the false choice by taking both elements and elevating them to extreme proportions to bring an ultimate terrifying nightmare you will absolutely never forget.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi took a budget that would seem tiny even by the standards of Hammer horror movies and produced a true horror masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of cinema like never before. Wearing its NC-17 rating like a badge of honour, it truly gives no quarter and takes no prisoners. It makes its sequels, EVIL DEAD 2 and ARMY OF DARKNESS, look like Disney movies in comparison.<br/><br/>THE EVIL DEAD is one of 74 entries on the DPP (now CPS) video nasties list and it's the best by far.<br/><br/>The simple plot of five travellers taking a trip to the woods and unknowingly unleashing demons seems very formulaic these days. But I'm telling you the rip-offs and stealth remakes are merely swimming in the wake of this classic original.<br/><br/>The small cast works wonders in this movie. These young people are easy to relate to. They are likable. They enjoy having fun. They like to tell jokes. They show love and affection for each other. As such, we feel for them when they are picked off one-by-one.<br/><br/>The demons in this movie are also proper antagonists. They are not Hollywood villains who you can negotiate with or shoot with a machine gun if they annoy you too much. They are genuinely ugly, horrific, inexplicable abominations prepared resort to emotionally cruel subterfuge to achieve their evil objectives. You can bash them over the head a dozen times. You can shoot them in the face with a shotgun. You can even poke their eyes out. But they keep coming for you until you've literally chopped off their every limb.<br/><br/>The special effects here are funded on microscopic budgets compared to Hollywood blockbusters. Yet there is no Hollywood movie I could name where you literally see demons decay bit-by-bit inside and outside for several minutes, bits of flesh shriveling up like screwed up paper, skulls exploding, blood emitting steam as it oozes out, demons biting their own hands off and faces pierced with shotgun shells like a dart piercing a dartboard.<br/><br/>The camera work and sound effects allow Raimi to exploit to the fear of the unknown to the absolute maximum. You know there's a demon there, yet you can't see it. A simple effect of a camera mounted on top of a motorbike combined with excellent sound effects and jarring music chords literally, and I mean literally, scares the living daylights out of you the first time you see and hear it.<br/><br/>The acting is superb as well.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell plays the role he was born to play as Ash Williams. He is not the stereotypical muscle-bound Hollywood or the James Bond-type hero with nerves of steel. He's an ordinary guy just as freaked out as the audience. He literally is overwhelmed at what is happening. He's watched his friends die. He's even had to kill his girlfriend to defend himself. He tries to avoid believing what he's seeing is true. He shakes like hell as he tries to barricade himself into the cabin. He can't hide forever. Sooner or later he has to face up the demons. When he does he accidentally becomes a hero - one who returns in two sequels.<br/><br/>Ellen Sandweiss also delivers a highly underrated performance as Cheryl. The events that bestow her character are unlike anything seen in movies before this. You feel her fear, her anger, her disgust and shock from the ultimate violation. This is what proper horror is about.<br/><br/>This is a dangerous movie to watch from a personal perspective because once you've seen it, you might never see other horror movies in the same light again. I mean that literally.<br/><br/>Overall, THE EVIL DEAD is a true masterpiece of low-budget movie production. It's easily the best of the video nasties and a must-see for all fans of the genre."

","This movie proves that you do no not need a big budget to scare the living hell out of people. The special effects, while not being sophisticated on modern standards, are in my opinion perhaps the best I've ever seen in a horror movie, the stop motion animation and sick makeup effects add a hint of authenticity. As modern cgi would look, and in most movies looks dull. The set of the movie was also realistic as it was a cabin in a forest instead of a studio set. The acting while not maybe academy award winning, is great, Bruce Campbell does a remarkable job as Ash, the bad ass hero. The girl chanting ""we're going to get you"" really gave me the chills.<br/><br/>What about the atmosphere. It reminds me of the George A. Romero zombie trilogy (which is the best ever BTW), the feeling of isolation and helplessness against a horror nowhere to be seen, but still lurking everywhere around. The use of clever camera-work as seen when the deadite crashes through the window of the cabin to possess one of the girls and in the end when one of them flies through the cabin to get Ash gives a feeling of uncertainty of whose point of view is it if anyones as the deadites are never shown without a possessed physical body and is left a mystery if they even have a form without it.<br/><br/>Humour is also a part of the greatness of this film, the graphic violence is executed in a humorous, but still convincing way, there are also some cool one liners and the performance by Campbell itself is somehow unexplainably funny. There's also a weird rape scene featuring a tree raping a girl, while being pretty messed up it was also hilarious.<br/><br/>That's about it. I give it a solid 10/10 and if you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? Go see it."

Shot in 35 mm and only 1-1/2 hours long, the storyline contains elements that have been beaten to death in any number of horror movies. A bunch of college youngsters, males and females who are in relationships, proceed toward or get stuck in a lonely cottage somewhere around Tennessee, where one by one each one of them falls prey to demons / ghosts / evil spirits or other inhabitants of the nocturnal, hidden world of spirits. The entire action takes place on a single night, so that daybreak heralds the end of horror and beginning of normalcy.<br/><br/>The background to the action evokes interest. An archaeologist has spent his life away from the ""myriad distractions of modern civilization"" to research an ancient Sumerian burial and discovered a book - the book of the dead. He leaves behind an account of his experiences in a tape recorder subsequently discovered by the college vacationers. The Sumerian demon lying dormant gets a new lease of life when the tape recorder with evil chants is played back. The film remains silent on the nature of the spirit and all one gets to see are camera shots zooming onto victims. The spirit appears to lurk in trees and vegetation who then tend to come alive and attack the victims.<br/><br/>The comic aspects of the film lie in how the dead victims, with white, morbid faces and distorted voices, go around trying to attack the rest of the group, though never really making an attempt to do serious harm. Their main intention appears to be only to scare - and that works well on children, but fails on adults after a while. Some of the background music actually tries to create comic effects. The makeups though do evoke and generate feeling of horror and revulsion. The main protagonist, well played by Bruce Campbell, supports the action throughout the film.<br/><br/>While watching the film, the reviewer compared the dead creatures come alive in the film to office workers and thought they were quite similar, the latter being more scary than the former. The reviewer first saw the film at a young age and considered it to be the epitome the horror. Recently, a waiter at the local restaurant requested him to get the film, saying his entire family wished to see this film. Such is the popular hold of this film, which on closer scrutiny is really more of a comedy than horror.<br/><br/>From the film: <br/><br/>Ashley (Bruce Campbell) - Is there something in the woods that did this to you? <br/><br/>Cherly - No, it's the woods themselves.<br/><br/>First published on my blog at: www.myvoice.in"
"Woodyanders","9","3","7","17 April 2006"," A pretty crude and rough, but undeniably effective little 80's splatter horror shocker
","Okay, we all know the plot to this one backwards and forwards, so I'm not going to bother with an unnecessary synopsis here. Instead, I'll just give this endearingly ragged early 80's splatter horror indie landmark all the props that it deserves. Granted, Bruce Campbell's acting leaves a bit too be desired (he's much better in the second one), the make-up f/x are pretty primitive, and the production values are a tad chintzy and cheesy, but there's no denying the sheer infectious abundance of pure brio, passion, energy and enthusiasm which permeates every last gloriously gonzo frame. Sure, money can buy slicker production values and fancier special effects, but all the money in the world can't and won't compensate for a severe dearth of heart and soul. This is the secret to this admittedly scrappy movie's remarkably enduring cult appeal and grungy charm; you can tell everyone involved in this deliciously demented delight put their proverbial all into the film. Moreover, the roughness of the film itself gives the movie a substantial raw, rattling, unrelenting power and intensity that a bigger budget and slicker execution would have only detracted from. Yeah, it's got its faults, but said flaws aside it still does the kick-you-in-the-gut jolting and startling trick to this very day."
"lee_eisenberg","10","3","7","14 August 2005"," This is why Sam Raimi deserves a star on the Walk of Fame.
","ALRIGHT! This is what started it all! From the moment that Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his friends are attacked by the title characters, you know that you're in for something cool! I loved every scene in this movie. Continuity errors, you say? WHO CARES?! The point of ""The Evil Dead"" is to have the evil spirits tear people apart, and then to have Ash turn his chainsaw on them. Granted, you probably shouldn't let just anyone see this movie (that scene with the roots is particularly inappropriate for little children), but for anyone mature enough, this is THE movie to see. It's probably the only horror flick besides ""The Shining"" that has pre-WWII music for its soundtrack, and I would like to assert that it puts Bruce Campbell on the same level as Jimmy Stewart, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks."
"JeffroDNice","6","3","7","9 October 2004"," Not sure why this is a classic
","Good concept (for 1981), great camera work and you have to be impressed with how much they did with so little. But what Raimi needed more than money was time: time to write the script, think about the characters, and rehearse. The acting is wooden, as if the actors are still blocking out where they will be standing in each scene. Their actions and reactions are implausible, with the impressive exception of Ash's vacillation over what to do about his girlfriend. You share his moral dilemma as he weighs whether he would be slaying a demon or murdering an innocent girl. With so many horror movies that are executed so much better, this movie is only useful as part of Raimi's biography...and perhaps the history of the genre. Good for film students; not a priority for anyone else."
"suenamilyn","2","5","15","2 July 2005"," Horrible film, yet all the more entertaining
","If you are truly looking for a cheesy, horribly made film, then there is no better then The Evil Dead. First of all, you will laugh at the horrible film making. There are goofs and mistakes galore. Crew members visible in the bushes, disappearing blood, costume changes, etc., it is all here. Ed Woods Plan 9 from Outer Space does a better job at covering up its mistakes. The plot, one of the only good points in this film, besides the laughable bad acting, is very interesting and it is good for the sequel (one of my favorite movies) Army of Darkness. The only other good thing about this film is that it spawned the career of cult actor Bruce Cambell. But the very best seen is a rape sequence in which a girl is raped by... trees. Yes, trees. it still reminds me of the trees in the Wizard of Oz. ""These ain't your apples!"". So if you have had a rough day and just want to simply turn your brain off, pick up Evil Dead. if you are looking for a great old horror classic, pick up army of darkness. because evil dead is merely a five year old's rendition of army of darkness."

"The_Void","10","4","11","14 October 2005"," The very pinnacle of schlock-horror!
","I've got to tell you right off - The Evil Dead is my favourite horror film of all time - so you can expect a praise-filled review here! I have seen this film at least one hundred times since I first saw it at about the age of ten, and to this day, I can still stick the DVD in the player and guarantee myself a good time. The Evil Dead may be low budget schlock at heart, but there's very few A-class films that I can say that for! The notorious shocker that started the video nasty debate in the eighties is as good now as it was then, and that is all testament to the imagination and dedication of the talented team of amateurs that conquered their budget restraints to put the film together. I'm sure that Sam Raimi and co. didn't know that they had a cult hit that would still be much loved twenty five years later on their hands during filming - but really, that only adds to the cult value of this masterpiece. The plot is brilliantly simple, and it follows the story of a group of five friends that go for a relaxing holiday in the Tennessee Woods. However, their holiday turns out to be anything but relaxing when Ash and Scottie, with the aid of a tape recorder, unwittingly unleash the aptly named 'Evil Dead' from it's slumber.<br/><br/>Looking back at the video nasty list now, the vast majority of them are tame by today's standards. This is either down to the change in views of what is and what isn't acceptable, or simply because the films were so atrociously made that they're impossible to take seriously. The reason that The Evil Dead sits at the very summit of that illustrious list, therefore, is because this is every bit the film now that it was then. The film is grainy on purpose, and the gore effects, while obviously cheap; are potent, relentless and disgusting enough to still cause a stir today (the fact that the uncut version wasn't passed all that long ago shows that!). The Evil Dead has become the benchmark for schlock horror films, and this is shown by the fact that almost every film in this vain to be made post-Evil Dead has benefited in some way from the film. That's not to say that Raimi hasn't taken influence from some classics himself. The claustrophobic sets and camera angles echo those in Night of the Living Dead loud and clear, while on famous sequence involving a spade has been taken straight from the Hammer classic 'Plague of the Zombies'. However, Raimi has implemented all of these things into his film in such a way that it feels fresh - and there's nothing wrong with regurgitating elements from other people's films if you can make good of it.<br/><br/>The claustrophobic way that Raimi uses his camera helps the film implicitly, and when coupled with the isolated setting that the central location is in; we have a great base for a horror movie. Considering that he was an amateur at the time, Raimi's use of the camera is extraordinary and more than gives many of the established horror film makers a run for their money. The idea to put a camera on a motorbike ('Raimi-cam') is brilliant, and those shots give the film that extra 'x factor'. Seeing the camera roar through the woods is actually quite terrifying. This also gives the film a very nervy atmosphere, as you never know where the evil is going to strike next! The most infamous sequence in the film has to be one that sees Ellen Sandweiss venture out into the woods, only to be violated by the trees. Raimi has said since that this sequence was the mark of an amateur filmmaker, and I agree with him. However, this sequence is an integral part of the film as it helped it to gain a lot of it's notoriety, so I guess it's important if only for that reason.<br/><br/>The characters are thin in a typical schlock style. Characterisation doesn't matter, however, as the focus of the film is always on the atmosphere and gore - but nevertheless, the ensemble of amateur actors perform with gusto, and their heart definitely helps the film succeed. Consider the women of the film. They give it their all when their characters are turned into evil demons, and there aren't many 'a-class' actresses that would be able to do that! Of course, on the acting side this film is famous for one man over all else; B-movie god, Bruce Campbell. His performance as Ash was what has made him a cult favourite. Bruce portrays his character with comic brilliance; using a range of facial expressions to portray fear, exhaustion and a sense of loathing towards his situation. Bruce develops the character of Ash as the film goes on, going from a wimpy young man, to a resourceful 'demon-slayer' using all manner of items, including axes, planks of wood and even his girlfriend's necklace to dispatch of his foes. Don't get me wrong, he didn't deserve an Oscar (that was part II!) - but if it weren't for him, this wouldn't be the film that it is.<br/><br/>On the whole, The Evil Dead is a film of such paramount importance that it is fundamental viewing for anyone who considers themselves a horror fan, or any young filmmaker wanting to make an impact in cinema without the benefit of a lot of money. Many people refer to this film as 'just a fun flick' or 'so good it's bad', but I cant agree with that. Considering what went into making, and the end result - The Evil Dead is one of the greatest films ever made."

"retrobobthenesjunkie","Null","2","4","27 May 2018"," enjoy, this is a true delight to watch
","The Evil Dead is a pleasure to watch as a horror movie. However, do not expect the acting to be great. Honestly, at times the acting dips from average at best to below average at worst. There are several instances where the acting efforts of an individual feel uncomfortably out of sync with the efforts of others sharing the scene with them. The special effects suffer from similar problems, as well. Often times they appear poorly executed, and other times they appear just plain lazy. There are even moments during the stop motion sequence that appear laughably juvenile. The storytelling itself feels lacking. While I was not provided enough story to satisfy my imagination I was provided enough story to keep my interest peaked. Whether that is a sign of inadequate storytelling, or genius storytelling is subjective. Where I feel The Evil Dead rises to the occasion, and leaves a lasting impression is in the camera work, the atmospheric tension, and the eventual arrival of Ash on the screen. The director maneuvers the camera in a way that makes the viewer aware of a presence while keeping the viewer oblivious to it's whereabouts at the same time. I could see the fear on Ash's face, and I could see his response, but the stimuli was never revealed. While, the atmosphere created through the environment is one of defeat. I was made aware that there was no escape beyond the walls of the cabin, nor was there safety within the walls of the cabin. Yet, I felt comfort within the cabin where I hoped I would see the evil's approach. The highlight for me, as a long time Ash fan, is his arrival. There is a transition from Ashley to Ash, and watching Ash fight against his own inadequacy in order to defeat the evil dead is 100% cinematic entertainment.<br/><br/>This movie is not without more than a few problems. However, the entirety of this experience is entertaining, and enjoyable enough to easily overcome the minor deficits that survived.<br/><br/>-Bob"

"Wuchakk","6","2","4","12 February 2018"," Low-budget cult horror classic has a great first half, but a redundant second half
","RELEASED IN 1981 (but not until April, 1983, in the USA) and written & directed by Sam Raimi, ""The Evil Dead"" chronicles events when five Michigan State students travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. Havoc ensues. <br/><br/>This is a cult classic movie and the famous director's first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and there's a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students' arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. It's atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante it's basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Don't get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but it's too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. It's just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other. <br/><br/>This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's ""Gargoyles,"" but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of ""The Evil Dead,"" by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesn't work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level. <br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 25 minutes and was shot in Morristown, Tennessee, with additional work done in Michigan. <br/><br/>GRADE: B-/C+"
"john_sprocket","5","2","4","24 September 2017"," Just an average guy
","In the first Evil Dead movie, Ash was just an average guy. He was cocky and egotistical. He wasn't stupid. He wasn't brave. In fact, he was the Beta male to his friend Scott. Hell, throughout the opening of the movie, people are calling him ""Ashley"", not the much cooler ""Ash"" he gets in later movies.<br/><br/>A lot of what fans have come to expect from Bruce Campbell and Ash weren't in this movie. Bruce Campbell himself said on Reddit that the problem was that he couldn't act in this movie. But that's not the whole story. This movie didn't have campy humor or a strong hero. This movie was scary. You were thrown into the movie with no sense of humor, just dread.<br/><br/>The movie had a $50k budget, which was spent over a few years that the film was thrown together by two friends. Every expense was spared. But it has still had a lasting impact on the modern horror genre.<br/><br/>And, while I find most modern horror movies to be forgettable, I find myself coming back to Evil Dead every year around Halloween. It is scary and gory and unique in some way I find fun and endearing."

"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","8","2","4","24 June 2008"," Check this Masterpiece!
","In the fall of 1979, Sam Raimi and his merry band headed into the woods of rural Tennessee to make a movie. They emerged with a roller coaster of a film packed with shocks, gore, and wild humor, a film that remains a benchmark for the genre. Ash (cult favorite Bruce Campbell) and four friends arrive at a backwoods cabin for a vacation, where they find a tape recorder containing incantations from an ancient book of the dead. When they play the tape, evil forces are unleashed, and one by one the friends are possessed. Wouldn't you know it, the only way to kill a ""deadite"" is by total bodily dismemberment, and soon the blood starts to fly. Raimi injects tremendous energy into this simple plot, using the claustrophobic set, disorienting camera angles, and even the graininess of the film stock itself to create an atmosphere of dread, punctuated by a relentless series of jump-out-of-your-seat shocks. The Evil Dead lacks the more highly developed sense of the absurd that distinguish later entries in the series--Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness--but it is still much more than a gore movie. It marks the appearance of one of the most original and visually exciting directors of his generation, and it stands as a monument to the triumph of imagination over budget."

However, while they're there, they find a strange book entitled Naturon Demonto, (renamed Necronomicon Ex-Mortis in the sequels) which roughly translates to Book of the Dead. They accidentally play a tape recording that recites demonic incantations from the book that eventually makes the demons reawaken and possess them one by one until the lone survivor, Ash (Campbell), has to step up and fight back.<br/><br/>This is a great film. Sure the acting isn't great, but this movie features some great practical effects from Tom Sullivan. Yes, it's fake. Yes, it looks fake. However, it's impossible not to appreciate them.<br/><br/>It's a VERY gory movie. For pretty much the last half-hour or so, blood is soaking everything. There's even a scene where a character get's it's hand hacked half-way off, so it tears the hand the rest of the way off with it's mouth.<br/><br/>This film introduces Ashley J. Williams, better known as Ash. The character of Ash is well-known for being a badass, but don't expect that from him in this one. In this one, Ash is actually kind of wimpy for the most of the movie. It's not really until Evil Dead II that Ash becomes a full-blown badass.<br/><br/>So, anyway, this movie is amazing. It's scary, it's entertaining, and it's a hell of a lot of fun to watch with a large group of people. So, in the end, does Raimi succeed in bringing us the Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror? My answer is definitely yes."

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","2","4","5 May 2008"," A modern horror milestone.
","We have a tendency to look back and glorify the old, great horror films, like The Exorcist and Rosemary's Baby and Night of the Living Dead, etc, automatically hailing them and lamenting the depressing thought that films like that will probably never be made again. Rob Zombie recently eased that fear a little bit, but in Sam Raimi's early career, he was making gritty, grimy horror films that reminded us that the old days of horror can still be brought back to life. For every I Know What You Did Last Summer or Hostel or other idiot teen slasher I think back to the days of Raimi's early horror films and just wonder what happened.<br/><br/>Here's something interesting, in modern times, there are more and more high budget horror movies coming out, with a noticeable decline in quality as the money gets bigger. I wish someone would notice that one of the best things about The Evil Dead is that it was made on a shoe-string budget. Like Chaplin's favorite part of his career, the early years when he would just go to the park with a bench and a girl and a big oafish guy and just bang out a film, Evil Dead gives the feeling of being just a bunch of friends who went out to the woods and cut themselves off from society for a while to see what they could come up with. And they came out with a classic! <br/><br/>The plot, of course, focuses on (you guessed it) a group of friends who go out to the woods to camp. The opening of the movie, the drive through the creepy woods, is one of the best examples of mood-setting that I can think of. You can almost feel the trees closing in around you as the hapless friends drive through the woods, teasing each other about the scary woods.<br/><br/>There are several scenes in the movie that will immediately put off a lot of viewers, such as the infamous tree love scene (not my favorite either), but the fact that the movie doesn't try to please anyone is what allows it to cut loose and just be a real horror movie. Trying to please a wide audience is the worst thing that any horror film can do, because that's what gives you those stupid sophomoric teen thrillers.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell, in the first performance of his best role, Ash, is surprisingly geeky in the first Evil Dead movie, at least compared to the hardened badass that he was to become in the two sequels, and considering the fact that he is generally remembered as being the coolest horror hero imaginable. But I think that may be what makes the trilogy work so well. A good story should show character change, and through the course of the trilogy Ash becomes something completely different from what he was when we met him in 1981, and Campbell fits the geek and the hero exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Raimi understands the cartoonishly excessive blood and gore will reduce the real scariness of the movie and make it almost into a bloody comedy, so he uses that idea to its maximum potential, causing us to laugh and squirm all throughout the movie, although the real scares are few and far between. The sound effects, camera work, costumes, and vile liquids spraying forth across the screen, however, are horrible enough, and it's clear that Raimi and the cast and crew are having a lot of fun with the material, which is one of the many reasons that it's so easy for the audience to have fun with it, too.<br/><br/>It should be noted that, because of the shoestring budget, they had to be truly creative in their effects and filming. Much of the camera work is done using very crude techniques, and the creativity involved creates a feel that the biggest budget could never approach. There are dollies and slides and other devices that are handmade from things like pieces of wood and duct tape in order to get the necessary shots, and the effect is brilliant. Can you imagine? They actually used duct tape to film this movie! Outstanding! <br/><br/>Strangely, Raimi took a four year break from directing after the Evil Dead, before finally following the movie up with the astonishingly bad Crimewave, the badness of which just strikes me as a real mystery, given the talent involved in making it. Luckily, he almost immediately followed this disaster up with the first sequel to Evil Dead, which plays like a sequel and a remake at the same time. It serves as a testament to the success of this early effort that it was basically remade Evil Dead II, and now is set to be remade again in 2009. Let's just hope that, now that he's a Hollywood director, Raimi can still capture the same attitude and gritty goriness of his early career!"

","OK, let's start the review with a simple math question, shall we? What do you get, when you go into the middle of the woods, with $375,000, a camera, six college students, a script, and a car? If you answered one of the greatest franchises and concepts ever, you are correct. If not, please leave this review.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead has touched geeks all over the world, me included. It has spawned comic books, merchandise, a groovy musical, and video games. Along with many spin-offs of it's most popular and beloved character - Ashley J. Williams. It even made the director, Sam Raimi, famous. You may also remember him from the Spider-man trilogy.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead has also gained one of the largest cult followings in the history of dorkiness, probably only behind classics like 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' and 'Star Wars'. And that' saying something.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple. Teens go up into a cabin, and get killed. Only difference is that in this certain movie, the main character survives, but only to get possessed, attacked again, and then thrown into the past to save an army, and eventually to save a convenient store from a demon... But perhaps that's giving a bit too much away.<br/><br/>Now, the idea sounds very clichÃ©, yes, but like all great horror movies, it was once original. Stephen King once called The Evil Dead 'The most ferociously original horror film of the year'. I may hate King, but at least he got it right once.<br/><br/>The movie stars.... Yup, you guessed it, Bruce mother fu(c)king Campbell as Ashley J. Williams. This single movie turned Bruce into one of the biggest cult actors of all the time. You may also remember him from the Spider-man trilogy. Remember? The man who named and defeated the title character? Eat your heart out, Venom.<br/><br/>So, Ashley/Bruce brings his girlfriend Linda (typical brunette), his sister Cheryl (typical nerd), his best friend Scott (typical pervert), and his girlfriend Shelly (typical slut) up into the middle of the woods. They find an abandoned cabin, and decide to spend the weekend there. Sounds like a dream vacation, dosen't it? <br/><br/>And let me just say, like any good horror flick, chaos followed - A lot of chaos. From the horrifying scene where Ash's sister gets raped in the woods (by a fu(c)king tree no less). To the classic scene where Ash had to butcher all his friends into little chunks (spoiler). To the nightmare inducing scene where Ash finds out that an evil force destroyed the only bridge back to civilization. Make sure to bring the whole family! <br/><br/>Paranoia, loneliness, ever ending dread, and endless loss of familiarness and the things we love makes The Evil Dead a hard watch for the weak minded. But I'm not writing this review for you pussies, am I? Plus there's also the X-rated gore and violence that is vomit and nightmare worthy also... Which makes it not of the weak stomach either... But again, GTFO if you are.<br/><br/>The Evil Deas remains as one of the scariest movies ever made, and a career starting success. The sequels would also get a lot more scarier, a lot more funnier, and a lot more overall awesome.<br/><br/>This movie would also spawn the first franchise where not one of the three films shared the same main genre. Last but not least, it also invented it's own kind of fu(c)king camera style (the 'point of view')."

","I was hesitant to see this because I didn't think it was my type of flick, based on the people that tend to like the series. But I rented it anyway. It turned out to be pretty decent. Some very funny and stupid moments, along w/ some not so special FX. I thought it was so poorly made that you couldn't help but laugh at it. Then, to my surprise, I read comments here at IMDb and these people actually thought it was good. Not so-bad-it's-good, but ""brilliant"". I'm stunned. Are these people brain dead? I don't give a damn if they only had a couple hundred thousand to make it, that doesn't excuse the bad acting, bad makeup, bad script...bad everything. The sequels are even worse, except, they're not funny. They're just bad, and boring. The character Ash is not cool or funny, he sucks. Why does every movie in this crappy series have a rating over 7? Unbelievable. Not to say there aren't other bad movies w/ high ratings at this site but c'mon man..."
"mattymatt4ever","6","2","4","7 January 2003"," Good low-budget entertainment
","I've said this before and I'll say it again, I always feel more of a connection to films that are made on low budgets than the big studio flicks, because I'm an aspiring filmmaker myself.  Watching a movie like this inspires me, especially since I've always wanted to make a horror movie. Is it a great film?  Of course not.  Once the movie hits the 20-minute mark, the notion of plot completely disappears.  But I loved the special f/x, which immensely surprised me, knowing the budget was only $375,000.00.  I didn't expect the gore to be so elaborate.  That's right, there's tons of gore (some say that to today's standards, the gore would be considered tame, but I say it's still quite extreme), and it doesn't look cheesy at all. The blood looks real, the make-up effects are great.  I could tell Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert put their hearts and souls into this project.<br/><br/>
I'm so glad I purchased the DVD, because it (along with ""Evil Dead 2's"") contains one of the most amusing and insightful commentaries I've ever heard.  Sam and Rob both have an incredible sense of humor.  And I was fascinated by the way they described the production of this movie.  First of all, I assumed it was shot in either 2 or 3 days.  This movie proves that continuity is for sissies, because it's packed with continuity errors and I didn't notice a thing.  The film was actually shot over the course of many months.  They seemed to have lots of fun making it, though it was a grueling process, since there were no stunt people (actors were getting scrapes and bruises all over the place), they'd stay awake for hours and hours and it was freezing cold outside.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" contains a few scares and the gore effects are often fun to watch (this was before the invention of CGI and I felt impressed knowing that not one effect was genered via computer), but I still wish it could've had more plot.  After all, we're basically watching one character after another get killed and come back alive again, and all that changes within the repetition of this pattern is the way they get killed.  The film needs a little more closure.  But at least Raimi doesn't pretend this is a work of high art.  In the commentary, he actually pokes fun at a lot of the film's peculariaties.  But he experienced much joy in making the film, and watching ""Evil Dead"" allows me to share some of his joy.  This is truly the work of an earnest, committed filmmaker who luckily went on to direct bigger movies like ""Spider-Man"" and ""A Simple Plan.""<br/><br/>My score:  6 (out of 10)"

Sam Raimi's inspired foray into the genre has rightly gained an enormous cult following and as well of an extended franchise of its own including a superior sequel, a fun follow up, a solid remake and an amazing tv series.

","I went in to this movie expecting something great. Instead, what I got, was 85 minutes of loud and obnoxious zombie/demon/whatever growling. Through the first 20 or so minutes I was somewhat intrigued by the plot but after that, it became a chore that I just had to sit through. The plot is practically non-existant.<br/><br/>I can't believe this was considered even remotely scary back in the day. I don't even mind the dated practical effects, but the entire movie is filled with random immersion-breaking moments. For example, at one point, a zombie grabs a man's foot and proceeds to stab him multiple times. What should the man do? That's right; he should stand there screaming for at least half a minute before even trying to get free.<br/><br/>The best part of the film: The beginning when no zombies are around yet.

","I rarely ever say I have an actual favourite horror movie, I've always had multiple (The Shining, Psycho, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Scream, Halloween, The Thing, The Conjuring 1 & 2 and Insidious Chapter 1 & 2) but two that have always remained my favourites are Saw and Evil Dead. Especially Saw, I just love that movie so much (and I'll have a review up soon for that.) Because both of these movies were made with a shoestring budget, yet they ended up changing horror as we know it.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is very disturbing, there are some scenes that make you feel so scared, this isn't just any normal horror movie, this shaped the genre for haunted house movies in the middle of nowhere made with a small budget. It proves you don't need to make a big horror blockbuster like Jaws in order to make an amazing horror flick! Of course as the Evil Dead franchise got bigger, the budget increased for each movie, but the sequels to the original Evil Dead are possibly even better.<br/><br/>4/4 : One of my all time favourites"

","What a pleasure it is to revisit Raimi's classic time and time again and never tire of it. Hard to believe 39 years has passed since The Evil Dead splattered it's way onto our screens and into our existence but this fact only reinforces it's tenure now as a modern 'classic' of horror cinema, even though it was ahead of its time back in 1981. It cost supposedly $50K to make and yet what they achieved with that paltry sum is indeed astonishing.They, for the most part didn't put a foot wrong. From the swirling fog and mist, to Cheryl's leafy assault and pursuit amongst the undergrowth, Linda's hilarious demise, the surreal excursion into the basement and of course the landmark final tracking shot - a movie of this flaming originality and departure only comes along perhaps once a decade. The Evil Dead stood in for the 80's, Blair Witch for the 90's and after that, I can't really think of the next entry ( there has been admittedly kind of a drought for awhile). Like your worst dream as a ten year old, The Evil Dead resurrects itself in real time as the everloving fun-house nightmare you cannot escape."

","I love the Evil Dead franchise, and this was my first movie i saw from it.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" is creative, gory, spooky at times, and ground breaking.<br/><br/>Yes, the actings not the best, and yes of course its got a low budget but The Evil Dead really proves what can be done with a low budget. The special effects and makeup are fantastic, especially for 1981, and Raimi's cinematography is stellar, especially in the final act of the movie when (minor spoiler) Ash begins going crazy.<br/><br/>The iconic character of Ash Williams wasn't in full fledged badass mode here but the more cowardly, ""just a man by himself in a cabin with friends possessed by demons trying to kill him and trying to survive"" side of him shows and i love it.<br/><br/>The cabin setting is iconic and the cabin has a genuine eerie look to it, especially on the inside, and the Deadites (possesed people) look pretty spooky.<br/><br/>Now my problems (i dont have much) start with a certain...interestingly strange and unnecessary scene. (if you know it you know it) Now, i'm not offended by it but it doesn't really fit with the tone of the rest of the movie and feels sort of awkward and kind of forced for the sake of shock value. Its brief, so it doesn't throw me off too much.<br/><br/>Overall, The Evil Dead is a classic and I love it as well as the rest of the series."
"acole0228","8","0","0","5 April 2020"," Good old fashioned spooky cabin movie
","There must be really something inherently creepy about cabins in the middle of the woods. Whether it's the isolation, vulnerability, the proximity to nature or the fact that it's pretty cheap to shoot a movie there (like this one), creepy cabins keep showing up in horror movies. It's basically a trope at this point.<br/><br/>While this film series is well-known for incorporating humor and action elements, those are lacking in this film.. In a way, it kind of feels like a band's first album where they are piecing the elements together but still haven't found their sound. Ash Williams (played by Bruce Campbell) in the later films would become more action hero like, but in this movie him and the rest of the characters that venture to the cabin are just regular people.<br/><br/>The story premise, which involves evil spirits being summoned through a book of the dead, is a bit silly (which is why Evil Dead 2 works so well as a kind of parody of the first movie), but The Evil Dead is so well made that this can be gladly ignored. Director Sam Raimi uses a lot of inventive camera work to make the horror feel real. Through POV shots, the invisible evil spirits in this film have a real physical presence, and there are plenty of great long takes that build up suspense perfectly. The effects are low-budget but work really well, and nothing is held back because there was no major studio they needed to deal with when making this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is kind of the black sheep in the franchise, but it is still a very effective horror movie."

"aidanratesmovies","7","0","0","27 March 2020"," Impressive low budget horror flick dulled down by thin plot
","Although at times it's often over-the-top nature and peculiar storyline can be generally amusing, Evil Dead suffers most from dragging out its plot till it wears thin, and becomes dull in the process. All the performances in the film, besides that of Bruce Campbell, vary on being generally okay to mildly cheesey. Bruce Campbell doesn't get his time to shine in the film in comparison to the others in the franchise, but his performance is well done, as he clearly shows the most emotion and does it the most well throughout the course of the film. At times, the action and gore is certainly over the top, but the thrills can be particularly interesting to watch, especially on how far the scene is willing to go to illustrate a point. However, this can also be its most fatal flaw, as the film at time becomes rather frustrating, trying to span out the time in the film with the events in order to make a proper time cut. In the end, the film seems too long, even though its runtime is less than 90 minutes. It's a shame because of the pacing, and its campy nature doesn't seem appreciative enough to capture my attention, to what it could have been if it were shorter, or more likely, had more going on. In the end, The Evil Dead is a horror classic that has not aged well for the modern viewer. It can be amusing at times, but fails to deliver on all accounts, and seems more like an interesting idea dragged out, than a complete film itself. It can be impressive for its low budget, but in the end, doesn't have enough material to truly capture the eye of those watching. Its ending however, does leave more room for hope though, and will hopefully lead to improve on the sequels to come.

The curse of the necronomicon. Old H.P. Lovecraft never saw it coming. From there, the film turns into a cross between The Exorcist and Dawn of the Dead, with the gore cranked all the way off the dial. It's gross, man. But it's all done practically. Scratch that.. it's all done way on the cheap. That's what gives this it's charm. It's so bad it's good. Minus the tree scene, which is just not good at all, but we won't get into that.

I say return because I am certain that I saw the original Palace Video release although subsequently I most of my viewings were of the later Evil dead 2. Watching this was a surprising joy. Certainly not perfect, with many over the top elements becoming almost laughable, or even actually laughable because although I thought this was the grim one and No.2 the comedic version, Sam Raimi clearly couldn't resist the odd joke. The main reason I found this such a warm, comforting and pleasant experience was, I think because it brought back those early video days. Constant searching for something mad, crazy and subversive. Never mind the quality just feel the innovation and the degradation, the brazen doing of what had never been done. Unlike much of what I found in those far off days, in the back of sordid video stores or at the bottom of boxes at a car boot sale, this is clearly quality film making. Despite having limited resources and lacking much facilities, sheer enthusiasm and a gut feeling for film enables Raimi and pals to storm a simple idea into fruition thereby bringing to the screens (or more significantly then, video) a film that punches in the gut, makes you sit up and look at the world just a little bit differently."

","Like Peter Jackson's 'Bad Taste', 'The Evil Dead' demonstrates director Sam Raimi's wild brilliance in its nascent form. Budgetary limitations can not serve to curb his fertile imagination. This movie is quite possibly the quintessential video nasty, but the liberal amounts of blood and gore on display are tempered by a very black sense of humour which ensures that the terror is balanced by laughter.<br/><br/>The premise is wonderfully simple: a group of friends decide to spend a weekend at a deserted wood cabin in the wilds of Tennessee. Once there, they happen upon an ominous tome called the 'Necronomicon' - the 'Book of the Dead'. This is accompanied by a reel-to-reel tape recorder featuring the recorded notes of a scholar studying the book. As part of his research, the scholar quotes extensively from the book and, when the group of friends play back this recording, an unspeakable evil is raised in the woods nearby. Said supernatural force invades the cabin and possesses several members of the group, transforming them into the titular evil dead. It is up to Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) - he of the superhero jaw and resourceful nature - to save the day... if he can! For those with a strong constitution, 'The Evil Dead' is an instant horror classic. It does not take itself too seriously which works heavily in its favour, and Bruce Campbell is an immensely likable everyman who plays the hero brilliantly. At one point, at his wit's end, he exclaims to the demonic forces which have laid siege to the cabin, 'Why are you torturing me, you bastards?!'.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most infamous and most discussed scene in the film is the from-out-of-nowhere rape scene in which a woman is sexually assaulted by a tree. It totally throws you a curve and is as bizarre as it is sickening.<br/><br/>It is no surprise that Sam Raimi has conquered Hollywood so effectively; the talent and chutzpah on display in 'The Evil Dead' - his directorial debut - really makes you sit up and take notice.

","It's awesome how much this film moved people. It became a phenomenon extremely quick and spawned 2 sequels. Running off of the extremely low- budget that it did, it was extremely impressive. The effects were great, the gore was satisfying, and the actors were great for the money's worth. This is a brutally putrid and oozing, gooey film. The gore and brutality of everything is so over-the-top that it's just satisfying as all hell. No moments were realistic in any way possible, and that is what makes this movie so much fun. Sure it had some flaws, and though I'm not completely bypassing those and giving it a 10, it's a great film."

","Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead simply rocks. We have two dudes and three young women, better said we have Bruce Campbell and the victims. Or even better said, we have five victims that for us will be in danger since the first seconds of the film but that will know that they are in real danger as the story unfolds. Pretty much I was ready to like a lot this film, it's been more than a year since it's DVD has been waiting and basically the moment one of the women (the one played by Ellen Sandweiss, to be more clear) goes out (wait, the setting: Bruce Campbell's character Ash is together with his girlfriend Linda, his sister and two friends vacationing in an old cabin right up in the mountains. Book of the Dead, ""it deals with demons, demon resurrection and those forces which round the forest"") the old cabin and has a truly horrifying experience the moment I said to myself: this is just F**K**G (yes, the f****** goes in capitals) awesome fun! Is the beginning of the end, just the beginning of a series of freaking insane moments, certainly with The Evil Dead we have a case of a film that does lives up to its great cult status. And Bruce Campbell is just really cool as the dude who will not only lose his beloved girlfriend, sister and friends but also will have to deal with demons with the shape of his beloved ones, Ash not only loses his beloved ones (first his sister and later on his friend Shelly, his girlfriend Linda and finally his friend Scotty) but he has to beat the s*** out of the possessed them (Scotty also has to get violent). Nothing but a real torture, your girlfriend is now an annoying demon that tricks you, that laughs at, that will try f****** kill you, it's a great (only for us certainly) bloody night up there in the mountains"

","When I rented this movie on recommendation of a friend, whose Mom made the blood (her, Sam and Ted Raimi, and Bruce all went to High School and college together). I thought ""80's zombie-slasher"" boy, was I WRONG! This film is anything but a zombie slasher flick. Yes, it was in the 80's; but this movie is more cabin in the woods with demons surrounding the cabin, waiting for the right moment to strike. What made this film work is that the demons weren't the killers; it was the teenagers. (they killed each other) One way they made it scary is by never showing what is making these actors possessed. It would only show the POV of whatever is chasing them, sometimes all the way through the house and woods. With that ominous roar as these ""creatures"" chase these actors kept me up at night. This movie is also a ""hand to mouth, eyes wide in horror"" flick. I won't tell what happens, you'll have to rent it yourself. i would recommend renting/buying this movie immediately.

This movie made me understand what ""sensing the presence of a supernatural evil force"" means. Didn't get over this fright for weeks And I also missed the humor due to my terror. I never realized that it is a low budget movie. The horror was first rate. The isolated cabin, the deathly silent forest harboring a nerve and ear shattering evil, rushing camera shots as this evil presence races after its victims, the events just before each camper turns into a monster, all are world class. Every horror conceivable can be experienced while watching this movie even though it is devoid of any special FX. Everything is unpredictable - who will turn into a monster, what the evil book can do, what will be found in the underground room - making every moment extremely suspenseful and captivating. Now that I have more guts to watch it, I found it amusing as well. It is well worth the time. Recommend it to all horror fans"

","Wow.<br/><br/>What an entertaining (and shocking) flick! I picked this one up after seeing a clip of it on a ""Top 100 Scarey Moments"" programme on Brittish TV.<br/><br/>Now, I am a person who finds it extremely hard to be frightened by a movie. The only movie that ever frightened me before was The Blair Witch Project, a movie with very mixed opinions in the public. The Evil Dead didn't scare me as such, but it did really shock and thrill me. This is a brilliant, original movie, with some great filmmaking and tricks with camera work.<br/><br/>This is such an inspirational movie, it deserves more recognition than it currently has. You name it, Evil Dead started it. So many films try to copy it's camera tricks, surreal effects and style.<br/><br/>It isn't a film which makes you think at all. 5 college students go out to an old cabin in the woods to spend some time there. There they find a strange, disturbing looking book, and a tape recording. Upon playing back the tape recording, the words recited on the recording awaken something in the woods... The spell is said to give the dead license to posess the living.<br/><br/>As has been copied by about a million films now, naturally, somebody gets possessed. When the possessed inflict wounds on the living, they will soon too be possessed. That sets the scene for the rest of the movie, with a 'survival horror' style. What follows are a series of shocking and gorey attacks and weird goings on.<br/><br/>The best part though, is this movie's great sense of humour. You won't just scream and cringe, but you will laugh too. The absurd 'gore humour' really is absurd. You'll feel guilty for laughing as Ash's headless girlfriend is humping him, blood leaking all over his face, whilst her head lies on the floor a few yards away making childish noises. That's the sort of absurd, sick over the top gags you can expect. The interweaved comedy sequences mix with your fear and disgust and balance it all out to just leave this feeling of enjoyment.<br/><br/>I think I have now made it clear what sort of people will enjoy this flick. If you take gore and things too seriously, or you don't like to be frightened out of your wits by sudden 'boo' sequences, then for gods sake stay away from this film.<br/><br/>To a horror fan, any horror fan, who also has a sense of humour, and isn't always looking for movies which take Einstein's brain to understand the plot, this is perfect, and a classic. One to watch. As I made obvious in the 'one line summary' for this comment, this film is perfect for a night with some friends and some drink.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead later spawned a kickass, although less over the top, sequel, Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn, and an odd comedy-adventure type movie (I suppose you could call it a spinoff?) called Army of Darkness."

It has a worthwhile script, make-up effects and camerawork, but the Rankin/Bass-like stop-motion ending is just too much and we can sense the 'tongue' slipping out of the 'cheek' and trying too hard to 'touch the tip of the nose.'<br/><br/>Five friends (two romantic couples and an extra girl) set out to spend some r&r at a Tennessee cabin.

","While not as good as The Shining, or horrible as all the sequels of Nightmare on Elm Street, the values of Evil Dead come from somewhere else.

It never got a cinematic success, but when it hit on video, the cult slowly formed up. Evil Dead was extremely succesful on video, and thanks to several releases it has survived to this day.

The almost amateurishness of this film only adds to its beauty.  Raimi, who has no real boundaries, experiments with the camera in a variety of interesting ways.

The movement of the camera through the forest is enough to grip you and ready you for the inevitable carnage to begin. Although you know that this is a movie and ""it's only a sound stage and actors"" you seem to forget this very quickly.

","(***** out of *****)<br/><br/>Low budget horror does not get much better than ""The Evil Dead"". In fact no other low budget horror film even looks like ""The Evil Dead"" thanks to Sam Raimi (The director of ""Spider-Man"" for the ladies and gentlemen of you out there who do not know this.) So if you want to see how a big director starts from the real bottom end of film making and works his way up then you need to watch this film at all costs. Besides he was just a young kid when he made it (using a school's 16mm film camera)..... and so were his friends who acted in it.... and they ended up making a film which coined the term ""video nasty'! The movie was filmed in 1979 and released in 1982 where it hit the video market just at the right time. It was one of the very first cult classics promoted by the advent of video tape.<br/><br/>`The Evil Dead' IS one of the nastiest films ever made. It contains extreme violence, blood, rape, torture, beheadings, dismemberments, mutilations, gore, violence towards women, chain saws - all in FULL VIEW of the camera. No holds where bared in the making of this film but some countries may show this movie in a censored form which entails the removal of about six minutes from the film. But the story is original, fast paced, scary and extremely enjoyable. Many fans watch it over and over and over again. Many of today's new film making talent watch this film over and over again and it is obvious to see why. <br/><br/>The camera work is used unusually, skilfully and surprisingly (so rare these days). The editing is dramatic and the low budget special effects must be given credit for the end results which beat the pants out of some of things that hit the shelves these days. In short the film making aspect is really what ""The Evil Dead"" is all about. Here the director is really giving you a bang for what bucks he had.<br/><br/>The premise is a simply one to explain. Five young kids go to a cabin in the woods for a short vacation. In the house they find a tape recording which manages to invoke an incantation which wakes up the evil in the woods. It comes after them - turning some of them into the undead, demons, zombies and flesh eating ghouls. Cue lots of household items being used as weapons, an initially sissy anti-hero (Bruce Campbell) who becomes the GOD of million adoring horror fans (you'll see why when you watch it) and low budget special effects galore. Copied by a hundred other horror films, exploited by a million uncensored bootleg copies Â– `The Evil Dead' is still the low budget horror king. And that is a hard act to beat!"

It took me so long to get over it, and I don't think I truly appreciated what the film had to offer at the time.<br/><br/>When I was older, at about the age of 14, I rented the film with a friend of mine in Darwin, Australia where we were living at the time. Watching it late one night at his house, the film had his older sister running out of the room within 30 minutes of it's running time, but both my friend and I were salivating for more gore, more horror, more THRILLS! (which undoubtly is what this film does deliver).<br/><br/>If you have never seen a horror film(!) before, please see The Evil Dead, and discard it's two awful comedy-horror sequals.<br/><br/>The problem with the film's two sequals is that they were released at the wrong time really. They were released in the midst of the whole 90's horror-fest thing that America seemed to be going through, where every second movie released from the vaults just happened to be a horror film, trying to better Evil Dead.<br/><br/>If the two sequals had stood up to the gore and chill factor that this film did, perhaps they would have succeeded also and become landmark films as this film did.<br/><br/>Nowdays, there are no good major horror films released (especially not from America). Nowdays, everything that comes out of America (not just horrors either, sadly), either has to have someone from Friends or Party of Five in it to even make it past the godforsaken box-office.<br/><br/>Back in the 80's, films were released not for popularity, but for fun and enjoyment of others.<br/><br/>Now, people have to contend with the fucking censorship side of things, then all America sees in it's glazed eyes is $$$$$$$$$.<br/><br/>""If the film ain't gonna make the $$$$$$$$$ then f*** it!""<br/><br/>Before the 90's, America's attitude towards releasing a film was : ""F*** the Censors, lets give the people what they want!

","Evil Dead, both as a single entity, and in the context of the entire trilogy...is a perfect example of how to make a great movie without spending millions and millions and millions of dollars.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is directed by genre fave Sam Raimi, and is perhaps the movie is known best for, perhaps outside of Spiderman nowadays. Raimi both wrote and directed, and did so on a budget that was more than likely roughly akin to what they spent on lunch for Spiderman.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a group of friends who are taking a trip to a cabin deep within the woods. Upon their arrival to the creepy looking cabin, they come across a set of audio tapes recorded by a dr. of some sort who had been studying the ancient ""Book of the Dead"" or Necronomicon. He realized early on that reciting the ancient incantations within it had woken and ancient evil deep within the forest, that eventually came for him, and claimed his wife. Little do they know it, but the friends, upon listening to the tape, have once again awoken these evil spirits, capable of possessing their bodies and and their minds. One by one they are taken by the spirits of the forest,until only Ash...played perfectly by Bruce Campbell is left to face those who were once his friends along with other things going bump in the night.<br/><br/>I don't want to give any real plot details away for anyone reading this that has not already seen the movie. This film, upon first viewing, is often viewed as cheesy, low budget schlock, and by all means, that is exactly what it is. The low budget gives the film a vibe all it's own....with creepy camera angles and tricks wisely in place of gaudy special effects. The makeup effects are, in my opinon quite good, and the possessed members of the cabin are truly frightening looking. Yes the blood looks like ketchup, and yes there are a few scenes that look like they were done with playdough, but that's the fun of it.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi manages to transcend the limitations of the budget by keeping the film taught, and genuinely creepy, with more than one 'Gotcha' type moments. As the film progresses, you really do begin to get a sense of Ashes peril, and begin to realize that not only is fighting for his life and his sanity. All of this is also possible thanks in part to genre vet, Bruce Campbell...who delivers a great albeighit over the top performance. The man has some of the most classic facial expressions, adding a whole new dimension to his performance.<br/><br/>Evil Dead may or may not be the weak stomach type...many find the film to be gross and repulsive...while others find it hoaky and unreal. I leave it to you the viewer to draw your conclusions.<br/><br/>I only ask that before viewing Evil Dead, or any of the Evil Dead trilogy...clear your mind of any preconceived notions you may have regarding it....leave your sense of logic at the room, and sitdown to enjoy a piece of pure popcorn schlock. Evil Dead doesn't deserve an Oscar and it is not a timeless masterpiece of cinema, but it is something that it rarely gets credit for being...mindless frightening fun.<br/><br/>Turn out the lights, open up your curtains....and watch it with the ones closest to you, and you may not be so quick to head up any cabins any time soon."
"ColeSear","10","0","0","14 August 2002"," Best Gore Film Ever? (Spoilers)
","If there was ever a horror film in the gore sub-genre that went for the throat and just wouldn't quit it is unquestionably Evil Dead. This is a film with such pulverizing scenes of blood-letting and death that there's no time to be concerned with much else it just draws you in and you become absolutely enthralled. 	At the beginning we see just enough of these characters to differentiate amongst them. They are sketched out just enough such that we don't hat them for their out and out stupidity, which they never really display, and so that their deaths aren't a relief but sometimes it does come as a pleasant shock. The use of the subjective camera to represent the spirits made this film and absolutely did wonders to add to the atmosphere. The relentless speed and the bowling over of trees on the part of these spirits who never really manifested themselves in their true form made the film what it is. Of course one cannot talk about the cinematography without discussing the score of this film for without it these would have just been cute camera moves. Instead the spirits had their own theme song a tenebrous, loud yet low-pitched thump that struck fear into my heart every time I heard it. 	Another way the film Evil Dead is interesting is that it takes some precepts of film and the horror genre in general and uses them masterfully. First, is the Book of the Dead which may also be known as the Necronomicon which may or may not be a factual text but the point being they implemented it to unleash unknown powers on these characters and it was done tremendously well. The book of the dead is undoubtedly a piece of work that has been sparingly used but here it is a perfect fit and shows these people have at least working knowledge of the works of Lovecraft. In Lovecraft's fiction man's desire to know what they had absolutely no hope of understanding always lead to his downfall a similar parallel can be drawn to this film. Secondly, this film mastered the use of the subjective camera as the villain which was initiated with It's Alive! And made famous by Jaws, after Evil Dead it would be foolishness for someone to try and rely so heavily on it because it just wouldn't work as well. Third, there is the great use of possession in this film which is no doubt inspired by The Exorcist and comes close to reproducing an equally effective result along that line. 	Some audiences may look back on this film which is now 20 years old and think it looks dated but they can't argue with the fact that it works. I happen to think that the special effects are great especially for when they are made. Claymation or Stop-Motion Animation is a great technique and truly a lost art. Granted it is very difficult to film but the results are great especially with Evil Dead because the clay and whatever other materials they chose to throw in their alongside the oatmeal just added the extra grotesque touch the film need. I think it was just wonderful! 	There is a great debate between people who are proponents of Night of the Living Dead and Evil Dead. I think all the arguing is futile. Both of these films are their own unique kind of beast and they're both beautiful in their own way. Enjoy both these films for what they are and the debate should end and everyone busting a vein trying to win the argument should just shut up."

","I had viewed this film under the direction of a friend who had said that it was quite possibly the best movie ever.  Perhaps if they didn't make it out of pocket change and an 8mm camera.  This movie, I thought, was horrid, a poor example of a ""do not do"" in film school.  Some interesting ""plot"" holes: Where did these kids come from?  How do they know each other?  How did they learn about this cabin?  Why didn't someone go looking for the scientist who was up there? Ash doesn't seem all too distraught about his friend being killed, nor does he seem to really care when all of them are zombies.  The makeup was poorly done and the acting was worse than porn.  Want a good horror film?  Rent something else.  This movie is perhaps a bit to much of a cult film to be described as such."

","Sam Raimi's directorial debut is a gore filled beauty of a film. It may not have award winning acting, but hey, who cares, it's still a load of fun to watch. Filmed on a micro-budget, 'The Evil Dead' is about five teenagers who are on vacation in a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. While there, they discover a book with ancient texts and a tape recorder which contains translations of said texts. Unwittingly, they play back the tape and unleash a horde of evil spirits that are lying dormant within the woods. What follows is a rollercoaster ride of mayhem and scares with a touch of humour. Director Raimi has created a cult classic and this is one movie that will be remembered throughout the annals of horror movie history. There are clear elements of inspiration in the film. Tobe Hooper's 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' and George A. Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' are to name but two, which then only adds to the ferocity of the film. This is for hardened horror fans and will no doubt attract future fans to the genre. 'The Evil Dead' is a one hell of a ride."

"jksburns","Null","0","0","16 June 2002"," A simple film
","Simplistic is the word to describe The Evil Dead. This would usually be a criticism for any other film. But The Evil Dead turns it's limitations to it's advantage. The first shot, of a vicious creature roaming the Tennessee woodlands, is a case in point. The film-makers have managed to get around the problem of creating an animatronic creature (which would probably have devoured the budget as well as the actors) by shooting from the creature's point-of-view as it tears through the woods, growling and snarling. Simple and very effective, it grabs the attention of the audience. For the rest of the film, The Evil Dead takes the audience on a roller-coaster ride of horror that remains unrivalled (except for the sequel). Bloody and violent to a ridiculous extreme to please drive-in audiences, it caused incredible controversy in England, where it was banned for a while then released in a heavily cut form. It was this controversy that made The Evil Dead an instant horror classic. But hype dies and so do hyped films, only true quality remains. The Evil Dead is still being talked about, thanks partly to it's loyal fan base and it's countless re-releases. But also because it's extremely well-made and effective.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is brilliantly shot with an energy that is rarely seen in films a hundred times more expensive. The editing is razor-sharp and the special-effects (for a film made on a low-budget) are excellent. The zombies in the film are the most horrible creatures, with their blank eyes and rotting bodies. It made a star out of Bruce Campbell, a comic-book hero in three-dimensions, who made the character of Ash a horror icon. With Ash, director Sam Raimi, turns the genre on it's head by creating a hero that is, in no way, heroic. The film also has moments of uneasy comedy ('We can't bury Shelley. She's a friend of ours') that just manage to make the horror all the more horrible, like the dinner scene in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Not to say that The Evil Dead is a film to be taken totally seriously, the cartoon violence and the references to The Three Stooges make that impossible. But the film is genuinely scary in places and Raimi's handling of suspense is fantastic. The scene where the characters arrive at the cabin and the swing is thumping against the wall is a great example of Raimi's skill.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead could easily have been just another gore film, but Raimi's brilliance as a director shines through and lifts this simple film above everything else."

","I was 21 or 22 years old, in the Army, stationed overseas, on a field exercise, in the mountains of Korea, in a mobile Microwave Communications Center, LATE AT NIGHT, when I saw this movie. I finished watching it and had to go out on duty at my Ratt Rig, (A mobile Telecommunications Center) LATER THAT NIGHT! BY MYSELF! It was probably the scariest night of my life. This movie isn't a zombie movie as most of the people in here have posted. (how ridiculous!) It's about demons and the demons within you awaiting to be unleashed. Well on that particular night I was definitely hoping that those demons were somewhere else. I made it until the next morning but my imagination was running in overdrive due to this movie and even now, (15 years later) I can look at this movie and it's still SCARY. Here's a good hint for you guys who meet a woman that says she loves horrors: The first time that you she comes to your house tell her that you have a good horror movie for her to see. (Be sure that she's never seen it!) Put in Evil Dead, make sure that it's VERY dark and before you know it she'll be in your arms. It's always worked for me unless the woman didn't watch horrors or she flat out told me that she didn't want to continue watching (too scared) the movie and we progressed to other things (If you know what I mean). I actually know people who will not watch the 1st Evil Dead (my favorite) but will watch the Exorcist.

"Eviljomr","Null","0","0","8 December 1999"," One of the great horror films
","I think the first Evil Dead is my favorite of the trilogy, even though everyone I know says 2 is the best.  Strangely enough, the first time I watched the trilogy, I watched the films in reverse order, having been introduced to the series by Army of Darkness, then watching Evil Dead 2, and then (after some searching, this was well before Anchor Bay's re-release) Evil Dead.  I think the reason it's my favorite of the trilogy is that it's a horror comedy that puts equal emphasis on both.  Evil Dead 2 would lean more toward the comedy aspect, and Army of Darkness essentially became an action comedy with monsters.<br/><br/>An incredible film when you consider it was made by a bunch of college students.  Some very innovative camera-work, including the now-famous ""Raimi-cam"", as Joel Coen calls it.  Has some rather low-tech but still effective special effects, some of them are a little creaky compared to the effects in the sequals though.  Being a big fan of stop motion animation, I really enjoy the stop-motion special effects.  I can see why a lot of Asian horror movies, like Hong Kong's Chinese Ghost Story series and the Japanese Evil Dead Trap (the sequals are in name only, and have less of a supernatural element) are influenced by this film.  The acting is a little amateurish, but it gets the job done, and is appropriate to a film like this.  We get a feeling that the Ash persona hasn't quite developed yet in this film, a lot of Evil Dead fans complain he comes off as kind of a wimp in this film, I think that's appropriate though, and important to the development of the character.  <br/><br/>I think overall, this is a very different film from the two sequals (which I like very much, but prefer the first).  In this film, the violence comes of as a bit more graphic, and not as slapsticky as in the sequals.  It's hard to measure, but I think this is the goriest of the three.  The sequals may be much more polished and technically accomplished, with excellent cinematography by Peter Deming in Evil Dead 2 and by Bill Pope in Army of Darkness, but The Evil Dead has a certain raw, original quality the sequals tried, but failed to recapture.  I think the sequals are both very good films in their own right, but I think The Evil Dead is the best of the trilogy.  One of the all time great horror films, along with Dario Argento's Suspiria, George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, Peter Jackson's Braindead (Dead Alive in the U.S.), and many other great films I don't have room to list."

","This is what a cult classic is all about. <br/><br/>This movie may be shocking for its relentless gore and wicked use of a chainsaw, but you can see a great director at work.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, who gave us DARKMAN, THE QUICK AND THE DEAD, and A SMIPLE PLAN broke out into the scene with the real cheapie and helped bring the great Bruce Campbell in schlock genre territory (where he belongs, no matter where he dwells).<br/><br/>Ultimately, Raimi and Campbell do their best work in the faux sequel (actually it's more of a remake of this) EVIL DEAD II, but that doesn't mean this movie isn't bad. It's much more serious than the second one, with some very trendy horror elements and wicked camrea effects.<br/><br/>
The part I hate about this movie is the end, which is a long, gory sequence that is very patience-trying and seems to go on forever. The best part is the last shot. <br/><br/>But there are some great moments that don't appear in the second one. Like the infamous scene where the trees start attacking, almost raping, Ellen Sanweiss in the woods. <br/><br/>Like TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (which inspired some moments in this film), this is a groundbreaking horror cheapie from a young director onto better things.<br/><br/>If you look closely in a scene from the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, you will see Nancy watching EVIL DEAD on television!!"

","I didn't have high expectations when I rented this film, but I thought, hey, maybe it'll be one of those unexpected masterpieces. For one, I rented Halloween after just reading an article, and it has become one of my most treasured favorites. This film though had its ups and downs. The acting is better than I expected, yet still off in moments. The dialogue isn't there, especially for the tiny amount which the film has. The effects are many times laughable, and the plot is scarcely there. What's left you ask? The direction is fantastic. It puts you into this world and carries you crazily along for the ride. The angles and shakiness are pretty effective. This is really the film's highlight. The setting is very wonderful. Not original, I grant you, yet still, it carries a deep eerieness about it. It reminds me of the creepy setting of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The gore flows in gallons at the screen. It made me cringe, and that was pretty interesting. From the bleeding cabin, the pencil to the ankle, the decapitation, the chopping, the eating of the bodies, the tearing of bodies, and the barely there bodies, to the hands through the skin. The gore is all there, and very visible. The squeemish be warned. This actually is probably one of the most revolting films. Which I know may attract some. The film is strong in those moments and yet has too many weak moments to make it a great film. I guess it is a classic in many aspects, yet not in others. I just can't take a movie entirely serious when a girl is raped by a tree, and a corpse giggles like a ditzy cheerleader. If I had to name a moment that I hated, it would be the tree and the girl, or the board to the obviously rubber person. If I had to pick the best moment, I'd say the final shot of the camera rushing through the buildings to Ash's face, or the opening tour of the pond, both wonderfully done. I'm sketchy about renting the sequel. If anyone wants to e-mail me and explain the film to me, and tell me if I'd like it, I'd be very thankful.

","This movie, The Evil Dead, is the first out of the Evil Dead Trilogy, all directed by Sam Raimi (who also directed A Simple Plan, another great movie).  With an extremely low budget somewhere around only $50,000, Raimi had few options to try and scare the viewer.  He did an excellent job of doing so by using the camera as a tactic.  Examples of this in the film was when he would have the camera skim over the forest, making it seem like evil was around the cast and the cabin, was excellent.  also at the end, when Ash (the sole surviver of the Evil Dead, I told you this would be a spoiler) is walking out of the cabin in the day, thankful to be alive, and then the camera comes screaming through the forest, in through the cabin, through the doors, and out right on to the unsuspecting Ash was a great way to leave the movie open for a sequel.  Although the blood and gore was incredibly fake, you couldn't expect much more from a movie with a budget as low as it was. Out of the three movies in the Evil Dead trilogy, this one was geared toward horror the most.  The other two, especially Army of Darkness (which was basically all comedy), is geared toward the horror/comedy aspect, which is always entertaining.  If you're really in the mood for a nice treat, get the special edition DVD of this movie, with audio commentary by Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, among others.  It is excellent.  My grade: A-"

Watching Robert DeNiro fighting demons just wouldn't quite fly to well. This film is genuinely scary. Spooky is another good description.

","The Evil Dead is technically crude, shamelessly exploitive and darn good fun. It's not an elegant film by any stretch of the imagination, but one must take into account how difficult elegance is to achieve on a budget in the low five figures (if that!).<br/><br/>The real reason for seeing this movie is to marvel at what Raimi was able to do with little more than imagination and boundless creativity. I'd especially encourage folks who have recently seen ""A Simple Plan"" and have never sampled the ""seminal"" Raimi to give this a watch--the style's been refined over time, but it's the same dark sensibility at work!"

","The first of this classic trilogy.  To compare all three would be a mistake however.  Whilst the plot and characters flow through the sequels, the tone of ED1 is quite unique.<br/><br/>Unlike 2 and 3, The Evil Dead 1 cares not for laughs, instead delivering a gritty, no budget, daringly crafted shock-fest. Shot on 16mm by a group of college kids, the direction and mood keeps you gripped in a way that modern horror rarely does.  Sam Riami clearly thought hard about each and every sequence he shot - some work well, some less well, but his efforts overall pay off.<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that will make your girlfriend do the old pillow over the eyes trick.

","The evil dead is an excellent example of what makes a film, and proves that money doesn't equal good filmmaking.

","I am an aspiring film student, so I can appreciate fully what the filmmakers had to go through in order to make this film.<br/><br/>Raimi does have an arresting visual style. Using the camera as the evil force was a relative new thing I would imagine in the early eighties when this came out. The beginning of this film is, I think, the only time where you see the evil force skimming across the landscape like a phantom. The story could have been better, as the plot had been used by so many bad horror films before it. The one thing this film had was a great moody forboding to it.  The low budget forced Raimi into using the camera to scare people most of the time.  This same low budget also gave Raimi the ""freedom"" to do lots of quirky things with the camera, such as when Ash comes out of the cellar towards the end and the camera not only shows the view from straight above, but also shows a view from below.  Another good example is when Bruce is looking down in the basement nearer to the beginning and the camera, instead of looking down at what they are seeing, looks up at them from the attic.  What this does is not only give the viewer something to continuously occupy their minds, but also serves to point out to the mind of the viewer the fact that the evil (the house) was all around Ash. I loved the way Raimi just seemed to want to play with the camera for effect.  I do not think many filmmakers seem to want to just play with the camera and the point of view.  There were few drawn out shots, which makes for a better paced film.<br/><br/>What the story lacked in depth Raimi made up for not just in camera style, but also in his ability to know that the audience needed for this film. This is a very kinetic film, a lot of movement.  Some for no other reason than to show a different view of the surroundings.  In the end, I think Raimi and Campbell are the two biggest reasons to view this movie.<br/><br/>The ending is also very good."

","Don't be fooled by the multitudes of younger horror fans who believe that the first ""Evil Dead"" movie is inferior.  Unfortunately they've been weaned on diluted Hollywood style ""horror"" flicks with big budget scores, sets, and casts to detract from the actual horror.  In the 70's and 80's the horror genre welcomed low-budget, no-frills horror films that truly excited and scared audiences (i.e., Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Halloween, the Fog).  Even though I can now enjoy the twisted humor of Evil Dead II and III, I was disappointed that Raimi decided to veer further into ""tongue-in-cheek"" hi-jinks and laughs rather than the more serious tone of Evil Dead I.  ED II & III can't truly be classified as horror films.  I honestly can't think of a movie since 1985 that scared me as much as those 70's-80's horror gems.  ""Evil Dead""'s kinetic camera-work, adrenaline surged pace, and truly evil nature, takes you on a roller-coaster ride of terror. Watch all three and tell me which one's the real horror film."

","Forget about the scenes of grueling violence, the dismemberment of heavily bleeding zombies, the ultra-rapid decay of undead bodies at dawn - these are just the usual horror-flick gimmicks. What makes this movie a stunningly accomplished oeuvre is the powerful representation of existential angst - the estrangement of the individual from its environment, the epiphany of becoming aware of the fundamental gap between nature and the individual man, shown in incredibly powerful images in the last half an hour of the movie, when Ash feels that the house (being a symbol of his ""soul"") is surrounded by an unseen, totally incomprehensible, yet omnipotent ""evil"" (the ""absurd"") : Everything has changed, nothing is as it was before, there is nothing familiar anymore, nothing to hold on to - this is the exposition of the feeling of the absurd in Camus' sense. Being restricted to a very small setting and cast of actors which gives the movie nearly the feeling of a play, the whole conception of the archaically simple plot is directed towards this last moment of total estrangement. I am very well aware that probably, Raimi just wanted to shoot an entertaining horror flick, but what he (probably unintentionally) accomplished is one of the most powerful displays of angst and estrangement in film history."

","Apparently, this film was extremely low budget.  However, it is much better than other horror films with higher budgets and more 'professional' cameramen.  The beauty of this film is minimalist approach--the horror sequences of monsters, approaching of demons, or demonic possession is done with simple make-up, time lapse photography, and in some instances--particularly regarding organic decomposition--claymation.  The film does not pretend to be high budget--and this directness of approach immediately does away with any pretension that the film otherwise might contain.  There are several great effects in this film, particularly the one later when Ash touches the mirror.  Likewise, the fish-eye lens camera work really creates a 2 dimensional screen-like quality of 'looking awry' at things from the confines of the haunted cabin in the woods.  During the demon chase scene, the camera does a great job of making the cabin appear absolutely huge and labyrinthine--something that Stephen King conceptually describes of a similar haunted cabin in the woods in his latest novel (with Peter Straub) Black House.  In any case, there are parts of this film that are really scary and exciting.  On a horror film scale of one to ten, I'd say this earns an 8."

","I know it goes against the popular mass, but Evil Dead is my favorite of the Dead trilogy. Yes, it is true that the Sam Raimi quirkiness seemed to become more and more apparent as the trilogy rolled along. Each film possesses its own personality, and I found the desperate solitude created in the smoky hills of Evil Dead the most cinematically effective. Evil Dead, to me, had the most in common with later Raimi films like The Gift and A Simple Plan. All three films relied on silence and surprise as its main technique. As opposed to the zany, eye grabbing  circus of his Army of Darkness, Evil Dead II & Darkman.<br/><br/>To me, Evil Dead set the stage for a classic. We had young filmmakers, not yet tattered by the spoils of Hollywood, sacrificing everything to make a movie and a career for themselves. There was nothing for an audience to go on except what they're eyes were experiencing right at that very moment. I myself didn't expect to see a film with blood running down the screen. The violence and gore is legendary, only being eclipsed by Peter Jackon's ""Dead Alive."" Evil Dead, unlike most horror films, doesn't seem to exist only to bleed and spill though, but more to act as a window for young Sam's need to make movies. This is my favorite part about a filmmaker. I think that such an attitude produces the best results creatively. Hence, my stance on the dubbing of classic.

","Sam Raimi's feature debut was this 16MM horror movie shot on a low budget and began filming around 1979, only to be retouched and reshot many times up until its U.S. release circa 1981.<br/><br/>The movie is a simple tale of five teenagers who vacation at a dilapidated cabin in the Tennessee woods. One night they play the tape recording of a man who had been to the cabin once before and discovered the horrendous secret of the ""Book Of The Dead"". His translations of the text are loud enough to wake the dead...and they do. Spirits of demons are awaken and one-by-one they are possessed and killed in an attempt for survival. In the end, our only survivor is Ash (Bruce Campbell), a somewhat ignorant and cowardish boy forced to save himself from the darkness surrounding him.<br/><br/>Not as highly slapstick as its followers (there is one horrendous Three Stooges salute near the end), and gorier than both sequels combined, this movie lacks plot and believability. But what you get are some fast-paced and surprising jolts, really great camera movements (the camera rushes through the scenery at breakneck speed), and some graphic violence bolstered by monster FX and stop-motion animation. Also notable, this was before the days of candy glass and soft contact lenses, so the cast and crew put their all into this movie.<br/><br/>The DVD release from Elite Entertainment is a sure buy.

Naturally, my favorite of the three films was Evil Dead II, but I loved all three really just the same, and when seeing the first film for the first time in nearly ten years I was taken back to the days when horror films were bloody, suspenseful and scary, not about cutting up young virgins! I also dig Bruce Campbell in this movie! Go get it and watch it, preferably late at night in the dark."

","The story goes, that when this film was first submitted to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) it was viewed by James Ferman (BBFC president and overlord of British censorship from 1975-1998) and two other adjudicators from that organisation (one male and one female). Ferman and his male colleague, taking this film in the spirit it was intended, found the whole film absolutely hilarious, while the female found it wholly distasteful. Unsurprisingly, given the film's previous track record in the UK, which I'll come to in a moment, it was her view that won out and, under the Video Recordings Act of 1984 (which meant that all video releases had to be certificated) it was cut by over two minutes for an 18  certificate. This may not sound much but did make a big difference.<br/><br/> The original UK video version of the film, released in 1983 when British videos were unregulated, had been precut by it's distributors by one minute. The reason for this was that they were fearful of falling foul of the vague and inconsistant, yet highly draconian, Obscene Publications Act.  Despite the sixty seconds of cuts this first version was indeed prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, under the aforementioned act, on more than one occasion, but never successfully.<br/><br/>In these more liberal times, March this year saw, for the first time ever in the UK, the COMPLETELY UNCUT version of ""The Evil Dead"" released onto video. Ironically this version is LESS shocking than either cut version.  To put it simply, someone being whacked with an axe twice is shocking, yet three or more times is funny!  Now that the uncut version has finally been released,it means that for the first time British viewers can enjoy the film as what it's meant to be - a preposterously over the top slapstick comedy. Albeit one with very eery opening scenes.<br/><br/>So come on England, throw away those cut versions, and get on the Sam Raimi rollercoaster for a ride you'll never forget!"

","With the wind howling outside, I slouched upon the sofa to watch Evil Dead and enjoyed it verymuch. So, 24 hours later, here are some of my thoughts. The special effects are pretty outrageous- like seeing the combined contents of a fridge and chemistry set thrown over the actors. As for the acting, it is...dire, though Bruce Campbell is beliveable as Ash, trying to survive with his sanity intact. Also the script did not appear to allow for characterization. And it isn't that sary either. But I must heartily recommend this for at leat this single reason- Sam Raimi and his magic camera. The sheer imagination behind the lens is what impressed me most.

","ah, evil dead, the first movie of the series (followed by Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Army of Darkness).<br/><br/>It's hard to tell if the actually meant this movie to be stupidly funny or if it was a serious attempt. Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness are blatant comedies and work better than this film, but I think everyone should see this one. (It would be better to see this movie before the others.)<br/><br/>There are some very disturbing scenes like ""the pencil scene"" and ""the tree scene"" and the part where Ash chops up his girlfriend with a chainsaw. The acting is absurd, but funny. The funniest character is Scotty. He is the macho-tough guy with a few really good one liners. (He actually says ""I'm gonna break your face"" to a girl they are staying with. HAHA).<br/><br/>I don't know how cheesey they wanted to make this but as an example, on the exterior scenes you can see the floodlights they put up, in front of the house, in the middle of the woods. They're in plain sight, they didn't even attempt to disguise them. haha. And also, pay attention to the moon. It is hillarious super-imposed in a rectangle in the corner of the screen.<br/><br/>
This movie is pretty original and has some tense moments. It could scare some, but I have nerves of steel and was not startled by anything in this film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching Evild Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. They are supposed to run together, but the endings don't match up all to well. It's like Raimi decided to change his mind while writing the scripts. Evil Dead 2 is essentially a better remake of Evil Dead with some really funny scenes and over the top gore."

","One day I came home as my son was watching a rental of ""Army of Darkness."" I commented that the battle scene reminded me of Monty Python. He told me I might like it because Bruce Campbell, whom I have admired in Xena/Hercules, Brisco County Jr., and Jack of All Trades, is the star.  Then I noticed that the director was Sam Raimi! I was hooked, and got my son the trilogy for his birthday.  So today, I watched Evil Dead for the first time.<br/><br/>I usually don't watch gory movies...I outgrew my ""horror"" phase when I started getting nightmares from them.  Knowing the styles of the director and actor, I figured there would be enough humor to keep it bearable.  The only humor (other than the ""gift"" scene) were the stupid mistakes made by the characters and the outrageous special effects, which kept it from being too believable! I'm just glad I didn't see the ""shocker"" ending before I knew about the sequels...<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching it, but much prefer more recent works by the director and actor.<br/><br/>Back in the 60's, before ""slasher"" movies, there was a term for this genre...blood and guts, or something like that.

","Welcome to the Crypt!  I'm kidding, of course.  This is Evil Dead, not that lame TV show.  This movie was absolutely terrifying!  There was a time in our history when America took pride in it's horror movies.  This film is the pinnacle of that time.  You have a scenario that rips off the premise from ""The Exorcist"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"", but still pulls it off exceptionally; a group of college kids go to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, and begin to murder each other.  As it happens, there happens to be an ancient spirit residing there.  Instead of a full-out assault, it doesn't kill them right away, but instead let's the kids linger.  This movie is intense, and it showed that Raimi was an irreverent talent.  If only Raimi's other films were so lucky.  ""The Quick and the Dead"" sucked, and ""Evil Dead 2"" wasn't very funny, and was uncool.  However, ""Evil Dead"" is Raimi's indie masterpiece.  It's extremely graphic, and there were times where I was watching the film and started to think, ""uh..Lunch-coming-up!""  If you can stand scenes of people being cut open and counting their rings, then you'll be fine.  I thought I would be a lot less scared by ""Evil Dead"".  I was pretty cool through it, but I still had bad dreams.  As far as killing people, it's pretty good.  This is the best of the ""Evil Dead"" series, by far.  And, at least one of the cast members is a decent actor who'se done some good work.  I'm talking about Bruce Campbell.  Bruce did a lot of stuff; he worked with Lea Thompson on ""Caroline in the City"", he was in Waxwork 2; he was the main character in Brisco County, Jr.  But ""Evil Dead"" was the hallmark of Bruce's career.  Bruce can now be seen at L.A's prestigious Garden Street Mall, where he sells lightly salted meat products. In short, watch ""Evil Dead"" for a real thrill ride.  I read in Fangoria about how Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were at each others' throats, and that the entire three days of the shoot were absolute hell. Rating: 10/10 (When Raimi made ""The Gift"", I think something inside all of us withered and died.)"

Bruce Campbell, Betsy Baker, 'Sarah York,' 'Hal Delrich' & Ellen Sandwess pull off an extraordinary film, and for many of their acting debuts.  Under the writing and direction of Sam Raimi, this film is a masterpiece with experimental angles and shots, stop-animation, fast shots, sudden close ups, great mood and even some crude, but very effective, clay-animation.  All these features send this group of friends into a whirlwind as they drive along that infamous road, leading to that eerie cabin in the woods.  Only one will leave (or will he/she) alive, the question is who and how?  Not only does this film 'do it' for its fans visually, but the originality is extremely odd and bizarre, but very scary and totally applicable to the plot.  From possessions, dismemberments,***SPOILER*** an unforgettable tree-rape scene, (yes you read that correctly) to a slight love story and some heartfelt emotions, this film has it all and should be on the shelves of all die hard horror fans - or any movie fan in general. Oh, by the way, DEFINITELY NOT for the slight of stomach.  This film begins pleasantly with friends on the road to a 'nice vacation spot' and then leads to the insane happenings at the cabin in the woods that will change all of their lives.  At the cabin, the archaeologist who lives there off and on, is not at home and all that the group finds of him is a tape recording and a book.  The book of the dead.  The Necronomicon.  With this book and the tape recording, this group of friends will unleash the evil that lurks in the woods around them and ultimately pay the price for their naivete.

The acting is very well done and believeable but the Scotty character spouts out some bad dialogue from time to time.

This movie also had some campy humor mixed in a few scenes as well and a great gory filled ending that you'll love.  As for plot wise, it's simple but I won't tell, you'll have to watch for yourself. Also, you have to watch for the tree rape scene, poor Cheryl.  If you want to see this movie how it should be, buy one of the re-released versions by Anchor Bay Entertainment.

","The Evil Dead is the first in a trilogy of films (Evil Dead II and Army Of Darkness followed).  While it is not the best, that distinction would definitely have to fall to the second in the series, it has it's place in history as the film that launched the careers of Sam Raimi (writer/director) and Bruce Campbell (star).<br/><br/>A simplistic plot, which is just really an excuse to showcase the excellent (for the most part) special effects and the virtuoso camera movements of director Raimi.<br/><br/>The film also deserves notice as one of the slate of horror films that got fledgling studio New Line off the ground.<br/><br/>But perhaps the finest achievement of the film is it's continued influence on films to this day.  Not just the low budget horror genre, but all films across the board.  I don't know if Sam Raimi realized he was creating some revolutionary techniques at the time, but his film has stood the test of time and Raimi is finally getting his due in hits like Darkman and the critically acclaimed A Simple Plan (which is actually far more frightening than this film).<br/><br/>Raimi is currently directing Spiderman and I for one cannot wait to see what this master of the camera has in store with a budget that ridiculous."

","There are two components to a good horror movie: the psychological value, and the humor value.  Almost all horror movies have found one or the other, but The Evil Dead, has found the perfect combination.  The absurdity of the much-discussed, excess in blood and total bodily dismemberment, adds the perfect humor value, but doesn't let it get silly like some horror classics(blood diner, Ice Cream man).  But there's is also this very creepy element to the movie that even with such a low budget, Sam Raimi, was able to mastermind a very psychological thriller.  The points where the hero, Ash is alone in the creepy cabin, surrounded by the bodies of his friends as the house seems to react to his presence, messed with my head.  Bruce Campbell really makes his character show the paranoia of being in complete solitude, while an incredibly evil force tries to get the best of him.  This movie is possibly the best horror movie i have ever seen!

And I've seen a lot of horror movies. (The Shining, The Exorcist, etc.) This movie is a classic horror story with tons of blood and death. There are two scenes from the movie that will stay in my mind. The first one is when one of the girls runs into the woods. She gets ""lost"" and is attacked by trees. I've seen several websites call this scene ""The Tree Rape,"" but I have a correction on that. Do any trees really attack her, NO, vines do. The second part that will stay in my mind is when one of the girls is locked up, and the other is sleeping. A third girl is possessed and goes after the two boys. In the end of this attack she is dismembered and buried. The reason the is so gross is because it's realistic. During this she even gnaws off her own hand.

"ilcapodicapi","Null","0","0","25 November 2000"," Some horror, lots of gory action, zero comedy
","Firstly, I saw this film expecting a gory-slapstick-comedy, I was disappointed, but ended up enjoying this film for different reasons. It starts off nicely with some great camerawork, then within 20 minutes one of the main characters is being raped by a tree (I'll say that again so you know you 'heard' it right- one of the main character's gets raped by A TREE), although there's no frontal-nudity or anything of nature, this scene is still rather shocking and it became evident to me that this film wouldn't be the laugh-riot I was expecting. Now the film continues as a rather disturbing horror flick until the first dismemberment, after this point just about all the violence is directed toward plastic looking demons. The remainder of the film is entertaining for two reasons, the gore (which is continuous and fairly graphic, but not as extreme as I expected with the violence being limited (for the most part) to stabbings (often in the face) and an occasional decapitation. However, towards the end Raimi does cross the line between gory and gross), and Raimi's creative camerawork,which is showcased in an ouststanding 'haunted house' sequence and forms the backbone of this film. In summation, this film is worth seeing if you enjoy horror, with about 20 very disturbing minutes, and lots of gore after that. My main complaint is the lack of humour (although Campbell seems to be a parody of the 'all-American' kid)."

","The original Evil Dead is worth much more to horror fans than a ""lead in"" to the more popular sequels.  Unlike many modern horror films, Evil Dead is actually scary. Evil Dead truly changed the genre.  The film created suspense and scares using camera effects, lighting, and intense direction instead of relying on special effects and recycled plots.  The harrowing story of kids hiding in an isolated cabin in the woods and being picked off one by one is still good for a chill.  The gore is well placed and effective.  The music is fantastic and atmospheric.  The ""possessed"" make up is surprisingly effective and gave me nightmares for days afterwards.  The scene involving Cheryl and the deck of cards is a great example of the best elements of the movie.  The lack of budget adds to the movie, making it seem more realistic.  The climax is nerve shattering.  The acting isn't the greatest, but it is good enough to make the characters more than cardboard cutouts.  Bruce Campbell isn't as brilliant in this film as he was in the others, but his portrayal of a man slowly losing his mind is effective for a young actor.<br/><br/>All in all, the amazing camera work, the kinetic direction, the makeup, the gore, the suspense, and the use of actual scares make Evil Dead one of the greatest horror films ever, and a good way to kick off a fantastic trilogy."
"marc_hendriks_2000","Null","0","0","28 September 2000"," a very rambling review containing spoilers
","Acclaimed (and, in my humble opinion, overrated) critic Roger Ebert once said that people regularly come up to him to ask what kind of movies he finds more difficult to review: the ones he likes, or the ones he dislikes. I tried to answer that question for myself and found myself heaving with relief that reviewing films isn't my day-time job. I LOVE films, I'm passionate about film (like Homer Simpson once said: ""Mother. Teacher. Secret Lover""). I love to sit down and watch a film of my choice at my convenience, and I guess there's not much fun in being made to go see a particular movie (one you didn't necessarily wanted to see) at a particular moment and having to write a witty article about it. (""You're not in the mood?! Well, you better GET IN THE MOOD!"", to quote a certain outraged George 'Can't stand ya').<br/><br/>I don't (pretend to) have something interesting to say about every movie I see. Let me rephrase that: not every movie I see makes me want to get things off my chest, or out of my system. And that basically answers the initial question: the movies I write about are mostly the ones I disliked, or am disappointed in. I live in a society were we like to complain a lot and I, too, am better in prosecuting than in defending or praising. Usually, I have no trouble putting in words what I think is wrong with a particular movie (it's pretty easy to sum up the sometimes obvious mistakes and/or flaws), but ask me about some of my favorite films (""Blue Velvet""; ""Dawn Of The Dead""; ""Pulp Fiction""; ""A Clockwork Orange""; ""Ordinary people""; ""Koyaanisqatsi""; ""Rear Window"") and I'll probably go mute on you. And that's the reason why I didn't (try to) review any of the above titles on this site. These films make me very happy. I just like them a lot. Everything just seems right. They keep me glued to the screen. They succeed in sucking me in. I never analyzed any of them to discover why I liked them (let alone analyzing them to discover IF I liked them). I just did. (Maybe another reason I don't review my favorite movies is that everything that can be said about those films, as most of them are considered to be 'important masterpieces', has already been said... and said and said and said -- although  this is not necessarily true because I reviewed the fairly unknown ""Shivers"", which I hated, a few weeks ago on this site and was bemused to find out that I had used almost the exact same words as someone else on the same page). And I almost hate the question 'why' in these matters, as every answer is almost always followed immediately by yet another 'why'? (remember that brief scene with the late John Candy and Macaulay Culkin in ""Uncle Buck""?).<br/><br/>I'm not saying that there isn't an explanation for why I liked a certain film (or book, or painting, or piece of music), but if there is, I certainly won't spend my (insert coughing-sound here) Valuable Time on trying to find it. I don't want to sound pretentious (especially not for a merely 23 year old guy who has still a lot to learn about the English language, amongst other things), but I guess I'm not only speaking for myself here, but also for a lot of artists (filmmakers, writers, painters) out there.<br/><br/>While I was writing the above paragraphs, I suddenly thought back of something I saw on television a couple of weeks ago. I can't remember the exacts, but a woman had just shown beautiful drawings and paintings which she had used to express her feelings. The interviewer said: `Yes, very nice. But now we need you to put it in words'. O, my God, I thought when the guy said it. That must be one of the fundamental flaws of humanity: the necessity to put it in words. We need to be able to put things in words. We need it in writing. Feelings, sensations, sentiments are way too abstract. We need to capture it somehow, put it in a jar and label it. Thereby limiting the meaning of something. The spoken word and the written word -- those are boundaries we created ourselves. Created by ourselves because we need to be in control of things.<br/><br/>I just read Pauline Kael's review of Kubrick's The Shining, and I found myself repeatedly exclaiming the words `Yes!', and `of course'. When I read Kael's review of The Shining, I had the idea that I was now actually able to explain (and put in words -- sigh!) why I think ""The Evil Dead"", also one of my personal favorites, is so much better than many other horror-films. In my review of The Shining, I stated that I thought the visual beauty distracted the viewer from the fact that its psychological premise was going nowhere. I agree with Ms. Kael that the visual beauty also distracts from the horror. Kubrick probably used the novel of Stephen King as an alibi to explore some visual ideas (""A hotel with long corridors! Did somebody say 'Steadicam?'""). Wasn't it Orson Welles who considered the camera as the greatest toy? Well, I guess Kubrick thought the same thing. The only difference was that Kubrick took the game just too damn serious. Visual Perfection was the goal. Not emotions. Not fun. With, more often than not, rather contrived, hollow results. The same thing goes for John carpenter's Halloween. His movie is technically pretty much flawless. Neat. No rawness. Even his killer doesn't display any raunchiness. He walks neatly. Wears a spotless white mask and blue overall. Kills neatly, too. In the sleeves of the soundtrack, Carpenter reminisces that, during editing, the executive of production said to him 'It ain't scary. Save it with the music'. It's true. The movie is just too darn neat too really scare us, and heavily relies on its successful, but also a bit too neat and one-tone, music score. I'm not saying that every horror-film should be as raw as `The Blair Witch Project' (I can't wait for Myrick and Sanchez to shoot a mockumentary that takes place at sea!), but I guess that, when things get too polished, it'll kill the horror.<br/><br/>`The Evil Dead' works on several levels whereas most horror- movies only try to aim for one of the following goals: 1. Over the top comedy (like `Braindead') 2. Physical violence; blood and guts. 3. Psychological suspense. This movie has it all. But, even more, it even succeeds in maintaining a raw look (logically, as the movie was made on a shoestring budget) and still manages to be a minor triumph of cinematography, editing, and direction.<br/><br/>Raimi takes your basic campfire story (a bunch of teens in a remote cabin fall victim to an ancient demonic force) and uses it to show off a bunch of great visual ideas. Using visual ideas to scare you. He picks the best and scariest places to put the camera. Who said art had to be in great taste? If there's one genre you can show off in (on a low budget), it must be horror.<br/><br/>There are numerous unforgettable moments in this feature. The arrival of the youngsters at the cabin, for example, which is, in my book, one of the most stunning scenes in the history of cinema. The camera follows the oldsmobile as it slowly drives through the woody area. The teens get out, but only one of them actually starts heading toward the cabin. There's no dialogue and the only sound we hear is the rhythmic banging of a rocking-chair against the wall of the cabin. A great scene, preparing us for things to come. Breathtakingly photographed and smartly edited. Or what about the scene were Cheryl wanders off in the woods by herself at night, winding up being raped by a possessed tree? Or the scene filmed from a the point of view of a possessed zombie who is locked up in the basement and snarling and laughing watches its potential victims (`For God's sake, what happened to her eyes!?'). And, of course, that wonderful closing shot in which we move rapidly through the woods, work our way through a barricaded cabin and attack a surprised Bruce Campbell, the sole survivor who was just about to count his blessings.<br/><br/>This is the only film in Raimi's oeuvre where he uses beautiful images and great editing to support a story, instead of just occasionally throwing in a weird angle. I'm not a big fan of his subsequent work (including `Evil Dead 2' and `Army Of Darkness').<br/><br/>Geez, I really went off on a tear, now didn't I? Didn't I use the sentence ""Getting things out of my system"" about a hundred or so lines ago? Well, I guess I can go to bed now.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","[WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!]<br/><br/>I'll admit that although I love halloween, scaring people, ghosts, and such related topics I generally hate horror films. why? very simple. they are, generally speaking, unoriginal, unscary, uninteresting garbage. and please don't misinterpret that statement as meaning I'm against gore, not at all, I will explain in due time.<br/><br/>the thing I love about The Evil Dead Series is that each film stands out from the others in it's own unique way. in The Evil Dead, the original low budget foray with Ash into the woods, that stand out feature is innovative mood and texture through camera work and creative special effects.<br/><br/>the most talked about feature of Evil Dead is this ""force""... a series of takes where an unseen force races through the forest, over stumps and around trees, down inclines, banking left and right, shaking errily, from the force's perspective. this is a great mood setter. others include an entire tight-as-piano-wire sequence filmed nearly entirely at 45-degree angles, and a tracking shot above the character's head as he moves through the cabin, the rafters swishing by in the foreground. Sam Raimi KNOWS how to use his camera to build tension.<br/><br/>and, although visually a little cheesy looking, the ""meltdown"" sequence at the end was quite grotesque. note to Army Of Darkness fans: you actually see limbs, heads, so on being hacked off throughout this movie. very grotesque.<br/><br/>from start to finish the film has clever touches: the monsters spit a white puss into the air when wounded. a clock stops for nearly the entire movie, suddenly coming to life at one point running backwards, the pendulum smashing against the sides of the box violently. during a ""dismemberment"" sequence we see quick flashes of an axe brought into frame as blood sprays onto the wall behind it. blood is everywhere: dripping from pipes, the walls, and at one point actually running down the screen. ""happy"" 30's music plays on a victrola as one character goes insane. and, of course, the last shot, where the ""force"" jigsaws doors in half as it moves through the cabin. this isn't only brillantly scary stuff folks, this is a sick kind of art.<br/><br/>many people have previously stated that Campbell wasn't up to his usual standards in this movie, I for one would agree. BUT it's both his first movie and the character was written to be a wuss until he's forced to stand up for himself. no ""groovy"" in this picture folks. there is a bit of other humour, but it's very dark. some of the gore is so exessive it's funny in itself. don't mistake the bad dialouge for a bad script, that was very intentional.<br/><br/>want to see one of the coolest horror films ever made? there's Evil Dead. otherwise, you always have masterpeices like Urban Legends...."

","So much has been written about this film over the years that it's hard to be subjective about it anymore. It's a film I know so well now that it's too easy for me to get into a massive dissection of it.So instead I thought I'd focus on how it first affected me and what it still means to me now.My first knowledge and exposure of this film was surprisingly not a first viewing of it but rather a shocking (for me,I was only 7!) cinema trailer that was showing on British television at the time.A fast cutting trailer(that I've never seen since)comprising mostly of the rushing shots through the forest accompanied by the now famous Evil Dead chase sound and the ""were going to get you"" chant. The trailer absolutely terrified me and I had nightmares for weeks, mainly because I had no idea what it all meant and also had never really seen anything but Hammer horror on the TV.<br/><br/>When I was old enough to start seeing more risquÃ©' horror(about 12) The Evil Dead was one of the first I saw on video (along with ""The Exorcist"", ""Mothers day"" and ""Halloween 3"" bizarrely enough.)What can I say, the film had a profound effect on me and I can safely say it was the one that whetted my appetite and eventual love of horror in the years to follow. Never had I seen such an atmospheric, creepy and sense assaulting, freaked out horror film. Repeated viewings years later only confirmed what an effective low budget this film still is.I recently watched the Bruce Campbell audio commentary on the Elite DVD and all I will say is that his views put paid to all the detractors of the movie. For every one that complains about the supposed shoddy effects, the bad acting and how it's not really scary, these are the same people who queued for ""Armageddon"" and ""Godzilla"" and sat there numb at 'Blair Witch' waiting for an explosion or sex scene. A film like ""The Evil Dead"" reeks of passion, made by people who love films and not fuelled by mass market and greed. The original camera work, the scant disregard for the faint hearted in the audience, the repeated viewing factor, the mastering of equipment because it was all they had to use, the atmosphere (Intentional and un-intentional) and the jet black comedy in this film all put it up there in my all time top five. A must see for any self respecting horror fan.To partly quote Alan Bryce ""If you don't like this film you have no imagination"" (talking about Blair Witch) I'd say if you don't find at least something redeeming in this film then you don't like Horror."
"tequila-29","Null","0","0","29 June 2000"," A shocking masterpiece!
","This is what Stephen King called the most ferociously horror movie of all time. `The Evil Dead' is a low-budget production shot by independent star-director Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss and Betsy Barker. The story is a joke: five teenagers in an old cabin accidentally evoke demons and get possessed one by one - that's it. But splatter movies have never been famous for their unconventional and innovative plots, so it really doesn't matter at all. Raimi did a fantastic job with this terrifying mix of merciless gore excesses and shocking horror. The film was very controversial in it's time, and it still is today. It's banned in the UK and Germany - unfortunately, it was released in the early eighties and got caught up by the moral panic of that time. At my opinion, `The Evil Dead' is definitely the best splatter movie. I have to admit that it lacks the stunning effects of actual releases such as `The Frighteners', and it's far not as bloody as Peter Jackson's `Braindead'. Anyway, what makes it a brilliant piece of film is it's dark, desperate atmosphere. It makes the audience watch nervously, timidly awaiting the next shock - it simply scares you to death. I've never seen a film with such shocking effects, it just lets you no time to breathe. Bruce Campbell's acting as the lonely, blood-covered hero Ash surrounded by evil is amazing and got him up to the league of cult horror stars. It might sound strange, but Campbell's believable acting actually makes `The Evil Dead' seem to be a realistic film - despite zombie-like demons. But I wouldn't call this a splatter movie if there wasn't anything else about it. I tell you, don't watch `The Evil Dead' if you can't see blood! For it's time, the film was a scandal, and even if it had been released today, there would again be voices calling it `degrading' and `inhumane'. The nasty and bloody scenes of dismemberment, slashing, impalement and decapitation led to bannings and heavily cut versions of the film in many countries. Fortunately, there have been several uncut re-releases since then, so we can watch this masterpiece as Sam Raimi wanted it to be. `The Evil Dead' set the standard for modern splatter-genre and is one of the greatest classics in horror history. For any horror fan who doesn't feel disturbed by ethically questionable gore scenes, this flick is definitely worth a look. Besides, there are two sequels, again directed by Raimi and starring Campbell: `Evil Dead 2 - Dead by Dawn' (which is more kind of a remake than a sequel, Roger Ebert gave it a 3 out of 5) and `The Army of Darkness - Evil Dead 3'. Both are worth watching, but the original remains a class of it's own."

The plot is kind of creepy and the camera angles only increased the creepiness.  I also thought that the way you never really see what is causing the disturbance was very creative.

Naturally, she is totally freaked out by this, but when she reveals the event to her friends, they find it ignorable (""but trees don't attack people!"") and rather than show any concern, they proceed to play a game. Yet in mid-game, they are confronted by the same girl turned demon, skin turned green and talking in demon-speak, which barely gets a rise out of them (""do you think she's OK?"").<br/><br/>What follows is a non-stop violence fest as more of the girls turn into demons and get beaten with sticks, axes, etc. by the two male kids, in fierce competition for the award for worst actor.<br/><br/>This movie will scare the hell out of you if you are under the age of 12."

","Definition of a cult classic: a movie that never quite appealed to mainstream taste, but for some reason really appeals to a certain kind of person. With that in mind: Evil Dead is only going to be a cult classic for you if you're the certain kind of person that enjoys constant, gratuitous, vomit-inducing gore.<br/><br/>Basic plotline: some teenagers go to stay in a creepy cabin in the woods. They discover an ancient Sumerian book -- the Necronomicon -- and unwittingly raise some evil spirits. And then everybody gets possessed and dies, with the sole exception of the hero. Wait, did I say ""dies""? I should have said ""gets torn limb from limb, gushes every conceivable kind of bodily fluid (and some inconceivable kinds), and just generally manages to perish in the most protracted and horrible way anyone could imagine"".<br/><br/>Now, I have no basic objection to gore. In a good horror movie, the gore just highlights the terror, and adds a visually shocking element to it. But in this movie, there's really no suspense to go along with it; apart from a few false scares at the start, and some startling zombie attacks, it's really just constant, on-camera violence. I finished this movie feeling more ill than terrified.<br/><br/>And humour? Well, unless you find something intrinsically hilarious about zombies chewing their own arms off, inflicting gaping wounds with pencils, and vomiting blood from neck-stumps, don't count on it. Even Bruce Campbell isn't any fun in this movie; he's basically here only to be terrorized, look put-upon, and get drenched with blood. This isn't the hilarious, manic Ash that makes the later movies worthwhile."

","The premise is simple. Five generic college students arrive at an inconspicuous cabin in the woods for a few days of vacation. Unbeknownst to them, the cabin and the surrounding woods are home to evil beings that are dormant ... that is, until the kids find an old book and tape recorder filled with zombie gibberish. The story is set mostly during one night. Dense fog obscures one's vision outside the cabin.<br/><br/>The first-half plot isn't bad. The camera takes the POV of unseen entities, darting here and there. And the kids spend a lot of time exploring the cabin and its cellar, waiting and listening, as eerie sounds put them on guard that something isn't quite right. The music, too, adds to the sinister atmosphere.<br/><br/>But if the first half conveys a pleasantly spooky atmosphere because of what we do not see, the second half's plot plummets to stupidity because of what we do see. No longer hidden, the evil makes itself visible, in the form of nightmarish images and gratuitous gore. The film thus loses its suspense and mystery.<br/><br/>The second-half plot trends repetitive as the same fate befalls one kid after another. And the gore continues to escalate. Nearing the film's merciful end, I started getting a headache, as the gore got progressively more annoying.<br/><br/>The film has no thematic depth. And since the underlying premise presumes a supernatural explanation, we can't apply logic to any story element. Acting is largely irrelevant. The credibility of the film thus lies mostly in sound effects and special effects, which are nicely crafted but over-used. I would have enjoyed the film more if the zombies, or whatever they're called, had been less visible and if the gore factor had been hugely reduced."

","The Evil Dead (1981) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Sam Raimi's groundbreaking horror film about a group of friends who go to a cabin in the woods only to have their fun turned to pure horror when they uncover an evil book. THE EVIL DEAD has become one of the most loved and worshiped films of the genre and while my love for it doesn't go that high, there's still no question that it's a rather marvelous achievement considering what the filmmakers had to work with. What impresses me so much about the film is the fact that Raimi could have just delivered another slasher film set in the woods but instead of that he went for something different. That something different turned out to be a way to mix scares with humor and for the most part it works. I think there are some very funny moments here and not all of them are directly in your face. One of my favorites is when they're going over the dangerous bridge, momentarily get stuck and we see Bruce Campbell stick his head out and his reaction is just priceless. Once the horror elements kick in the viewer is in for a bigger treat. Raimi does a very good job at building up a terrific, creepy atmosphere and this here really carries the film. Once the possessions come into play I think the film loses some of its scary impact but that's not to say these scenes aren't effective because they certainly are. All five of the cast members are decent in their roles but there's no question that the real stand out is Campbell. He would certainly go onto much better performances but even at this early stage of his career that comic timing is still here. THE EVIL DEAD is quite a unique little picture and even after all these years there's still a freshness about it."

","As a birthday present to myself (and to gear up for the upcoming Halloween movie season), yesterday I bought the ""Book of the Dead"" edition of Sam Raimi's 1982 horror classic, ""The Evil Dead."" I had rented it the night before and much to my mother's dismay, I instantly fell in love with it. <br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" concerns five friends, including Ash (cult favorite Bruce Campbell), as they go on a vacation to the mountains. They spend the night in one of those spooky log cabins and as you know, trouble's a brewing. One of them, discovers the infamous ""Book of the Dead"" and as the plot requires, they read from it, not knowing that doing so would be opening up a Pandora's Box of ghastly horrors. One by one the friends are possessed by the malevolent forces that had been lying dormant in the woods, leaving only Ash to fight them off.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" is truly a classic in every sense. It's not scary at all, but does have quite a lot of tension. I would guess that if this is scary to any degree, it's not because of atmosphere really, but more because of the horrific makeup used and the incredibly gory special effects. All of this is lightened up by a really dark sense of humor that would become more apparent in the later sequels.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi really knows how to direct a good horror movie and of course would try to shake off this image over the next 20 years, which would lead him to directing last year's ""Spider-Man."" The hand-held camera shots, up close angles of Bruce Campbell in later scenes, is all genius movie-making.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" is a great horror film, don't miss it. <br/><br/>10/10"
"ivony","6","3","8","17 June 2003"," Not the ""scare"" so many claim it to be...
","While I can see the entertainment value in Evil Dead, I find it laughable that anyone would refer to this movie as ""scary""...especially in comparison to the Exorcist.  I remember feeling more fear during the flying monkey scene of The Wizard of Oz than any moment of Evil Dead.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong.  There were some good points to this movie.  For example, the camera shots with the ""demons"" chasing and following through the woods had its potential.  Unfortunately, it was linked with a bad script and even worse acting.  Sam Raimi did well with never actually showing the demon, but spoiled this with his cheesy not-so-special effects of the friends-turned-demons inside the cabin.  It just didn't go over well. <br/><br/>
I've heard the ""it pokes fun at the genre, all the while taking itself seriously"" argument.  That doesn't fly well with me...at least not when so many try to claim this film is ""scary"".  It simply isn't so.  Had Sam Raimi consistently used the scare-by-imagination route, this film probably would have been a more successful scare.  Unfortunately, this was not the case. It's as if Raimi couldn't decide what he wanted to do; and in the end, made an awful attempt at horror...even campy horror.  Sure there was blood and guts.  But to be successful, one has to actually *believe* that it is blood and guts we're seeing...not ketchup, corn syrup, or colored water.  Oh, and let's not forget the squirting milk that seems to be the chemical make-up of the demons. <br/><br/>I understand this was made on a shoestring budget, but that doesn't mean it had to be horrible.  It *is* possible to create a good scare with little money and, like I said, had Raimi continued the assault on our imaginations, the Evil Dead would have been more successful in the fear department.<br/><br/>Now, the negative aside, I can see why this movie has become a ""cult classic"".  It *is* indicative of the horror genre of the time period and does have its moments of sheer fun.  By no means would I recommend watching this if you're actually looking for a good scare.  However, for entertainment, a hearty laugh, and some good fun the Evil Dead does deliver. You simply cannot watch this movie without a sense of humor."

","I cannot add anything new to the critique of this film.  I can praise the inventive camera work by Sam Raimi.  It is outstanding.  I can commend the production for its ability to use what little financial resources were available to their fullest.  The film is effective in that it does create some good, honest scares.  It utilizes some interesting special effects hitherto not seen in film.  Bruce Campbell is very good in his role, and the other actors are not too terrible till make-up gets hold of them.  Some of the night sequences are very chilling and atmospheric as well.  But(and you probably knew this was coming)the film is wildly overrated as some kind of cinematic masterpiece.  It is NO masterpiece.  It is your basic take some teenagers out into the woods, let them play with black magic, and finally kill them off in crude ways.  This is one gory, unrealistic film.  That's fine if that is what you like.  But I found myself yawning in some stretches through the repeated, pointless, senseless, brutal gore.  And let's talk logic...at one point one demon-faced girl is knocking wildly on the door to get to Mr. Campbell...while only several feet down is a window that had its glass smashed in.  She got something against windows?  Evil Dead is not a bad picture.  For its type, it is very good, but when you get right down to it...it's not my cup of tea to see so much violence with almost no exposition.  I need a story with a little meat, not a lot of butchered meat and little story."
"vincent410","4","4","13","29 March 2000"," Nowhere near as good as it is made out to be
","The Evil Dead is regarded as one of the great cult horror films made in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Made for approximately $300,000 as an expansion (of sorts) to a student film made by Raimi entitled ""Within the Woods,"" this film relies (after the initial twenty minutes) entirely too much upon shock tactics and stage blood to propel events onward, although since this is sort of what Raimi and company intended to do, it's not really a fault of the film itself. In any event, the first twenty minutes or so are brilliantly shot, well-made, and hint at all sorts of subtle terrors awaiting the audience amidst the imminent buckets of blood. However, after the visceral evil begins, there is a sharp decline. A few scenes come across as remarkably tasteless, and I won't go into them here. However, one does not review solely based upon the negatives, and there are a few great moments within. As I have stated earlier, the beginning is brilliant. The camera work is spectacular (as it is throughout the film), and between that and the performances we are drawn into the events of the film. We are the college students, and we are there in this quietly sinister cabin in the woods. After the beginning, things turn a little too splatter with too little substance to sustain or warrant the blood-drenched ""horrors."" One shot from this film will stick with me for a long time, though: the camera looks down from the cabin's roof to see two characters talking between the shining headlights of an Oldsmobile. This is a powerful scene, at once shuddering with latent horror and revealing just how talented Raimi is at the surrealistic, subtle side of horror. Too bad he didn't reveal more of that here."

I have a sort of fascination that compels me to watch for about 20 minutes (that's how long I stuck with Saw when it was on a movie channel) and then I drop out. I think that I'm more attracted to the psychological thriller, having been weaned on Hitchcock. I stayed with ""The Evil Dead"" to the end, mainly because of all the hype I'd read about it here on IMDb. Overhype, I should say. Most of it seemed just really silly and never came close to getting me frightened...never got the pulse going more than a calm 80, not even close to what the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" did for me. Sorry, but give me ""Dark Water"", where I can actually feel for the characters and use my brain, over stuff like this."

Well I watched it the first time and thought ""ehhh...it was OK but confusing"" And if I had rated it right after seeing it only once, I would have given it a 5 or even a 4, but the 2nd time is even better. You learn the events in the movie better seeing them a second time, sure you cant get back that shock value of seeing it once, but thats no big deal, this movie gives plenty of them, You'll probably not even remember them when watching a second time and get surprised all over again, I know I did.

","""The Evil Dead"" has been hailed a horror classic for many years now, and I can understand the hype behind this gruesome little low-budget shocker. The story is rather simple: a group of five friends are driving up to a secluded mountain cabin to spend a few days. They arrive at the old, rundown little cabin in the middle of nowhere, and while investigating around the property, they find a creepy book with a tape player in the cellar. The kids decide to play the tape around the fire, and unknowingly, they release an evil force. Soon after, the friends begin to become possessed by an evil entity that turns them into grim, deadly zombies. As each of the friends begin to turn into the horrible monsters, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is the only one left, and must fight against his friends-gone-zombies. Can he survive the night? <br/><br/>While this movie has a large amount of flaws, its unique originality make it so rewarding. There's continuity errors all over this movie. We see the tubes used to spew blood from the zombies, things change in-between shots, and you can obviously see that the moon in the background of some shots is clearly a matted image. So, what gives? This movie is still an excellent piece of horror despite all of the errors. It's amateurish, yet it's not. Had the filmmakers had more resources, this movie would've been perfect in nearly every way. But I think the low-budget feel that this movie has is part of its campy charm. The budget on the film somehow manages to not bring down the movie in the least. The camera-work in this movie is highly impressive, and I can understand why Sam Raimi became such a big director. He knows how to make a movie, and does it well and with style.<br/><br/>The acting in this film, like everything else, isn't perfect. It's decent enough, but nothing even remotely award winning. Bruce Campbell is the lead character, and is likable and has the audience rooting for him throughout the movie. The special effects in this movie are sometimes laughable but oh-so-messy. The blood and makeup effects are really corny looking, but despite that this movie is unbelievable violent. I can see why it was given an NC-17 rating. Even though the violence may not be entirely realistic, it's pretty nasty stuff. The atmosphere and setting in the movie is perfect - the secluded cabin in the woods is a perfect backdrop for the story, where almost everything in the movie takes place. I really liked the cabin setting, it was claustrophobic and worked greatly in the film's favor.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Evil Dead"" is campy, violent, and often funny in some respects, but it remains an important film in the horror genre because of its originality and craftiness. Its campy and unbelievable violence is a treat for horror fans, and even if that's not your cup of tea, the movie offers a handful of genuinely frightening visuals and situations. While it may be amateurish, it's also very atmospheric and unique, and just for that, it is a deserved classic. 9/10."

","I had the good fortune to see an uncensored 35mm print of this in art school in a Media Studies 200 level course called -- amazingly -- History of the Horror Film. The guy who taught the class was a genius, and THE EVIL DEAD was the climax of the semester (this would have been spring 1990). At the time the film was still notorious thanks to home video as ""The Most Horrifying Movie Ever Made"" (nah: CONQUEROR WORM) or ""The Most Gruesome Movie Ever Made"" (nah: Carpenter's THE THING), but the role that the film served within the framework of that class was as an all-out assault of *EVERYTHING* that came before it in one unstoppable, hypnotic barrage.<br/><br/>We saw this film at like 7pm and people were FREAKING OUT, literally, in a college auditorium. Twenty-year old adults were reacting hysterically, both with enthusiasm (such as myself) for finally finding a horror film that got everything more or less right, or with hypnotic revulsion (probably 40% of the class, and not all female either) by people who were finally being confronted with a horror film that had the power to frighten them, and was unapologetic about doing so. People make a fuss about the foliage rape scene: fehh! The one that got us so frightened that some people actually got up & left was when the first girl starts naming cards, becomes possessed and starts talking like that garbled voice at the end of ""I Am The Walrus"" that says it buried Paul backwards or whatever. We were all screaming, and we were screaming together -- the film became a shared experience, and former classmates discussed it clear through graduation three semesters later. Being there for the screening had been a rite of passage & we wore the badge with honor. Watching it at home on a DVD is nice, but the way to experience this film is in a theater with a live audience. You'll scream too.<br/><br/>I will let others sum up the plot. The film literally is a collective assault on the nerves using material culled from the entire history of horror before it: All the conventions are touched on, no T is left dotted and no eye uncrossed. We went out and rented EVIL DEAD 2 the next day and to me it was a let-down: I prefer the claustrophobic, cold, distant hopelessness of this film, the hands-on, rough hewn look of the special effects and the gambles that Sam Raimi took. I like how the film sets itself up, explains itself, removes any doubt from the mind of the viewer that the kids are doomed, and then unleashes a fury of Hell who's shock value has yet to really be equaled. Sam Raimi may be making Superboy cartoons now, but he will always be remembered for THE EVIL DEAD. This is one film where every good and bad thing you may have heard about it is probably accurate. The gore, the awful acting (my favorite is the jerk boyfriend who is easily the jerk boyfriend to end all jerk boyfriends), the overactive cinematography, the prevasive violence against (zombie) women, the gripping artiness, the complete trashing of everything that is sacred, how lurid and obliquely sleazy the film is, and yet how compulsively watchable. Like a train wreck.<br/><br/>10/10; By the way, the *CORRECT* way to see this film is the way we did, in the 1:33 (or 4:3) open matte full frame ratio -- Anchor Bay's masked 1:85 LBX transfer is for newbies. Find an old home video print or better yet the Elite Entertainment DVD from 1999, now discontinued. And guys, get over the foliage rape scene. Life is very short ..."

The possessed characters are brilliant, better than the make up in Romero's Trilogy, and the back drop is used to perfection.<br/><br/>It may be another in a long line of horrors in the wood, but it easily stands out as one of the best due to its scares brought out through the high quality cinematography and Sam Raimi himself. And the underlying humour that is apparent throughout just improves it further (see the present Ash gives to his girlfriend)."

","I ordered this ""classic"" on DVD and watched it again after a long time. The movie starts out slow-paced and gives you the feel of a campy low-budget horror flick, and it is. So, you watch and wait for the action to start and when it does, you are rewarded with plenty of gore but unfortunately, it's not very realistic gore. Most of the effects were done with clay and time-lapse cinema (yes, like those used in ""Santa Claus Is Comin To Town""). I felt the ""Violated by the Woods"" scene was rather dull. Gee, how difficult is it to think up a young woman having sex with trees? Not very. In other scenes, I felt they were plain annoying and stupid. The scene where Ash's girlfriend becomes a Cindy Brady demon is a perfect example. ""We're gonna get you, we're gonna get you..""). Ugh.<br/><br/>I'm not a Raimi fan, but I thought this may have been the one good film he made. Not quite. I'd probably enjoy watching the idiotic ""Spiderman"" series more, at least the FX are not made with claymation!"

"SteveyMac70","6","2","6","22 April 2018"," Clichéd, wooden, but still worth watching
","What better place to start with my first review than this classic 80's cult horror. I remember in my very early teens, all the hype surrounding this movie and scrambling around a friend's house to watch a grainy VHS copy totally against my parents' wishes, especially after the uproar that it had cause with the notoriously pompous British Censors which only added to the movies' allure. <br/><br/>I recently decided to go through my old DVD collection so that I could give a rating to movies I had not seen in a long time and therefore had not rated. My attention was drawn to this movie very early in my task - I was not disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It is a pretty poor movie by today's standards and a complete cliché, but in a way, that's what makes it good! It's like a journey through a carnival house of horrors as an adult. The effects are shocking, you know what's coming yet it still makes you jump! The acting is outdated and almost wooden at times. The effects of the puss squirting from the arm and eyes is almost laughable but still you can't stop watching it. It still manages to create an atmosphere that draws you in and engrosses you so that you do not want to switch it off no matter how bad you tell yourself it is. But it isn't bad at all, it really is quite good. Take yourself back to the 80's and this movie truly was a masterpiece filmed on a budget but drawing the attention some of the so-called blockbusters of the time could only envy. <br/><br/>I have seen this movie several times now and each time I come back with the same opinion - that it is definitely worth watching. If you are viewing for the first time, do so with an open mind and put yourself back in the early eighties to give yourself a fair go... you won't be disappointed. I can only give this movie a 7/10 which in my rating system is a movie worth watching and that is exactly what it is what it is nothing more, nothing less, but still a masterpiece of its time which if judged back then would have surely scored a straight 10"

I like horror movies but they have to be good in order to win my satisfaction haha!<br/><br/>Anyways, the movie wasn't that great! It was rather boring and stupid. The girls were so annoying with their screams and whining about nothing. OK when you are about to be startled and you don't know what's coming at you, that is understandable to scream.

"Johan_Wondering_on_Waves","4","2","6","24 October 2015"," A few excellent things but overall still very disappointing
","Things I liked (the good) - well the best parts are in the first half hour or so, decent build-up with the tape recorder, the old book with spells, the bridge that could fall apart every moment. - one of the girls being trapped by branches of tree and/or plants, that was a strong scene - the special effects surely are impressive - and while not the best horror make-up I have seen they surely did a good job there<br/><br/>Things I disliked (the bad) - Yes the story is as generic as the premise - The characters well they don't have background or personality whether they live or die in the end I wouldn't care, yeah maybe the character of Bruce Campbell was the most interesting but that is mainly because he got most screen time - Once hell started to break loose and the gore and splatter started, it will with some short breaks go on until the end. This overkill surely lost its effect on me before the 1 hour mark. At least Braindead kept most of the action and splatter until the end. - No rules how people get possessed/infected. One person becomes a demon while being cut an other doesn't while getting cuts and gallons of blood over him. This was way too random for me, at least give everyone a fair chance and not randomly make someone immune to it. - Not good when you like everyone to die asap and still think 80 minutes feels like 3 hours<br/><br/>Note that the only reason I did give it a chance was that it was a double bill on a DVD with The Brood, a movie I think is great."

"david_rudy_lee","10","1","2","23 December 2019"," Low Budget Masterpiece
","This film I have an interesting past with. I saw Army of Darkness first, then had my mother pick up Evil Dead 2 before finally seeing this one. I don't think my video store had this so we bought it on VHS as the reason why. It is an interesting way to watch it as both of them are more comedic where this really has much more of the horror. I've seen this quite a few times now, with the last time being in the theater on 4K. The synopsis is five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.<br/><br/>We start with a group of friends in a car going to a cabin that is in the middle of the woods. The man driving is Scott (Richard DeManincor) with his girlfriend sitting next to him Shelly (Theresa Tilly). He is kind of a jerk and likes to play jokes on those around him, some of which are not that funny. In the back is Ashley J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) with his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker). Campbell's sister is also along Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss).<br/><br/>Odd things happen from the beginning. The wheel to the car locks and it is aimed right for a truck that is coming. It actually rips out of Scott's hands. He blames Ash for it happening, but he tells Scott that he just took it in for a tune-up. They have to go over an old bridge and along a narrow path to the cabin. There is a porch swing that is hitting the shuttered window until Scott takes the key down from the door frame and it. It then shots moving by itself.<br/><br/>They unpack and start to settle in. Cheryl likes to draw and is doing of a clock. Something is calling to her to join them from the woods and then her hand is taken over by something. It makes her draw a rough looking book with a face. They then have dinner when the door to the cellar flings open. They all look into it and Scott goes down to see what caused it.<br/><br/>Ash calls out to him, but he doesn't respond. He then takes a lantern to go find out what is happening. The cellar is dark, damp and weird things are hanging from the ceiling. He goes into a back room and Scott scares him. They find a table with a shotgun, shells, a book that has a face and looks odd as well as an old tape recorder along with a long knife with skeletons on it.<br/><br/>This stuff is all brought upstairs and they start to listen to the tape. The voice is a professor who found this text while doing a dig and has come here with his wife to translate it. The book is the Book of the Dead; it is bound with human flesh and inked in human blood. It contains ways to summon demons and things to this nature. The tape upsets Cheryl and she shuts it off. Scott wants to hear more so he fast forwards it and plays it again. He ends up to a point where the voice is saying a incantation. We then see something wakes up in the woods. Cheryl screams to shut it off and a tree crashes through the window.<br/><br/>Cheryl goes to her room and something is calling to her. She goes outside and is attacked by the trees. She does make it back to the cabin and demands that Ash take her into town. They soon learn they're trapped when the bridge is destroyed. They go back and Cheryl becomes possessed. She attacks them and in turn possesses others. Can this group find a way out of this nightmare and survive?<br/><br/>Since I've already given my history with this movie, I'll get into this. This is more horror than the others ones and even though I know what's going to happen, it still creeps me out. What is insane though is how low of a budget that writer/director Sam Raimi had to work with though. They went far with what they had to bring this all to life for sure.<br/><br/>I should also state that some of the movies that terrify me the most are possession films. I might not be able to necessarily stop a killer, but I have a fighting chance. When it comes to films with demons like this, I wouldn't know what to do and would probably either die or become possessed before I could. This also does bring a bit of issue I have here. Not enough to effect my rating, but my problem is that there doesn't really seem to be a rhyme or reason for who becomes possessed. Cheryl gets attacked and I understand her. Same thing for Linda and Shelly, but Ash is attacked in similar ways and he seems to be able to resist. It doesn't get explained either.<br/><br/>Something else I do like is the Book of the Dead. They don't use the name Necronomican yet, but that's what it ends up becoming. I really like the concept of this book that contains ways to bring these demons to life. It is spooky that they're just living around us, not bothering us and they seem to be upset when their slumber is disturbed. I also like that after what the professor did, they're subtly roaming the woods and messing with these people. I do want to know if the incantation needs to be read every night to attack or what. That's something else that is not fully explained either.<br/><br/>I do have to say that the pacing of this is really good as well. It doesn't take long for creepy things to happen and we get to meet the characters around it. This is interesting as well, because we get to know them through seeing fear of what is going on. With a runtime of 85 minutes, it doesn't outstay its welcome and the horrific elements are evenly paced throughout. As I said, it never gets boring either and I like how this all ends.<br/><br/>That brings me to the acting. I will admit, it is quite amateur and I have to commend them for going out to do what they did here. Campbell isn't the Ash that we know and love yet, but you get glimpses. You can also see that he would go on to do great things as well. I like him here as our lead. Sandweiss I thought was fine. She's kind of hysterical, but I almost think that is due to her being more in tune with the supernatural without realizing it. She is also easy to isolate. DeManincor is a jerk and I think he does well. He got a reaction out of me, so I have to give credit there. Baker and Tilly are both fine. I did find Baker to be pretty attractive. Everyone also does really good when they're possessed. It is so creepy if I'm going to be honest.<br/><br/>That will take me to the effects, which for the budget look really good. They were all done practically. Some of them were clever and still gross me out. The blood we get looks good and I like that the possessed people have almost black blood. I think this is an interesting choice to kind of differentiate. There is a bit of an issue that the blood and gore on characters isn't also consistent, but that's fine. There's a lot to keep stretch and someone who has worked as a Script Supervisor, that can be tough. It is also shot very well in my opinion.<br/><br/>A grip that I do have is with the 4K version only. They added a new soundtrack to it. I heard on a podcast about it and now that I've seen it, I agree with them. I don't like it. I thought going for almost not having a soundtrack over most of it was actually creepier for me. I can't hold this aspect against the film, as my DVD is different there. I just wanted to bring it up if you happen to check out that version as well.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film has a lot of nostalgia for me. I can recognize that this low budget effort has flaws, but I'm going to overlook them. Many of them don't really affect anything so there's that. The demons here are creepy and even after knowing how things play out due to multiple viewings, it still works. I like the Book of the Dead that is used here. Like I said, there are some inconsistent story parts. The effects though looked good and the pacing is effective to a solid ending. I don't like the soundtrack that is added for the 4K and prefer the original way we got it. This is definitely a classic and I believe this to be a great movie."

"jayjaycee","9","1","2","21 October 2019"," The Holy Grail Of Splatter Horror!
","""The Evil Dead"" is a 1981 horror film written and directed by Sam Raimi starring Bruce Campbell and Ellen Sandweiss. There's probably no movie more controversial and simultaneously beloved than Sam Raimi's directorial debut. In Germany it was banned and highly cut for more than three decades and only hardcore fans had the chance to own it. It literally was unavailable as an uncut version until 2017 and now it's even rated 16. Last year I had the chance to finally experience what's claimed to be the holy grail of horror and I was tremendously impressed. This year, it did not change a bit. Unlike most people from my generation, I absolutely love this film for what it is. From start to finish it offers a gripping and sinister atmosphere that always sends shivers down my spine. Every single frame of this brims over with pure horror and it's incomparably iconic. While there's not much dialogue and the characters make some questionable decisions, it's scores with the pictures that speak for themselves. The best of it all are the absolutely gross and bloody special and make-up effects that haven't aged that well, but still manage to terrorise the audience with their excessive vehemence. Furthermore, every single character is worked out so well and sympathic, especially Campbell's Ashley Williams, the hesitant protagonist and hero against his own will. He really carries most of the film with his genuine coolness and well-paced character development. A hero the scared viewer can easily identify with. Next to this, the plot offers a lot of terrifying ideas and plays them out extremely well. Considering that this is a low budget production it made every single penny worth it. All in all, Sam Raimi created a timeless and horrifying splatter masterpiece that lives from its gorgeous effects and iconic scenes. Although it was a college student film it managed to become an infamous cult classic that will always scare the hell out of teenager generations to come. It might not have aged perfectly, but that's what makes it so special and remarkable. It breathes the essence of 80s horror. Also, it's absolutely inspiring for young filmmakers and shows them that you can achieve so much with so little. An all-time favourite that will never get boring. I love it!"

But, seeing the initial product of Raimi's vision still satisfies in ways none of the others do.

"bromegaman","8","1","2","26 January 2018"," The Evil Dead (1981) - A relentless, unflinching, original, and gory horror classic that set the standard for 'cabin in the woods' films to come
","Released during a fantastic time for horror films, 'The Evil Dead' crept in under the radar and while it may not have invented the 'cabin-in-the-woods' trope, it certainly popularized it and many other horror cliches to come. As well, the film was endorsed by Stephen King himself, who rightly praised its originality (for the time of course), and though it was mocked for a while, it's found its rightful place in horror filmmaking history.<br/><br/>THE STORY
'The Evil Dead' can never claim to have a robust and complex story, but that's not necessarily a problem. The basic premise - a group of somewhat drunken young adults stay at a cabin and accidentally unleash hellish forces that kill them one by one - is quite simple, but it's how Sam Raimi and company take this premise and go with it that is truly admirable. The concept of the Deadites, and the way Possession works, which seems to be a mixture of a contagion-style contact spread and Exorcist-style demonic possession - is quite imaginative and original. Possibly never before and rarely after have creatures in horror been so cleverly designed. The contagion-like spread through touching adds a sense of realism that makes the otherwordly hellish nature of the possession all the more horrifying. The fact that the Deadites mock and taunt their victims before killing them makes them not just spooky creatures, but frightening villains to contend with. Even if the basic premise is very simple, the flourishes with the Deadite concept is original and frightening enough to justify it. Out of 5 possible points for this category, 'The Evil Dead' gets 4 points.<br/><br/>THE TECHNICALS
'The Evil Dead' was made for a budget of only $350 000, and was from all accounts an arduous and difficult shoot. Thankfully, the labour paid off for the most part. Not only were the concepts original and creative, but the filmmaking shows off a lot of talent. Dutch angles are usually a source of frustration, since they're often use to unsubtly point out things that are supposed to be bad, and are as a result quite cheesy. 'The Evil Dead' is a clinic on how to use dutch angles effectively, as they are used in scenes of tension and uncertainty. Rarely, if ever, are they used when a Deadite is on the screen. They are used when a character, especially Ash, is frightened and panicking. This way, what would be a static scene of a character losing his mind is now enhanced and compelling because the camerawork draws the audience in. As well, the use of stop motion animation at the end is unexpected, but very effective. The makeup is also often fantastic. Though the film is indeed gory, it's used to heighten the fear. An 'Evil Dead' that shies away from gore is not proper 'Evil Dead'.
Very creative cinematography is employed here by Sam Raimi and Tim Philo, who make the most of a cramped location and pull off some great shots. The legendary demonic POV shots still hold up today, and 'The Evil Dead' stands as a testament to low-budget creativity in part due to this.
Easily the strongest technical aspect of 'The Evil Dead' is the sound production. The film is filled with demonic voices and unfamiliar noises throughout nearly every scene, and the slightest sound is enough to freak out the viewer. Though the film's score is, in my opinion, fairly standard and not worth much mention, the sound design is fantastic and deserves recognition.
Occasionally, the film's continuity stumbles a bit, as seen with that horrible Deadite Cheryl double doll that looks very little like Deadite Cheryl, or the changing hairstyles of the cast. As well, as much as I've come to enjoy the stop motion finale, it must be acknowledged that it is rather off-putting how inauthentic it looks at times. For the most part, though, the technicals of 'The Evil Dead' are great. I'll give it 4 points here too.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Evil Dead' is a great horror film, an absolute classic worthy of any horror fan's attention. It's not for the squeamish or easily offended, but there's enough creativity and conviction on show to distinguish it as one of the best of its era. Highly recommended."

It does not rely upon big special effects or a very large budget to make it effective. it is a very effective horror film without these things, which is what too many scary movies rely on heavily. Everything starts out with a group of young adults in a car heading out to a secluded cabin in the woods, as you can guess, things get pretty bad from there on. I loved the classic, creepy atmosphere all throughout the film, it contributed to the overall dark feel. <br/><br/>The cast does a good job here, I really enjoyed their performances. Bruce Campbell in particular stands out, very enthusiastic performance. The makeup was oh so well done, i loved the scary evil look the people had to them when they became possessed by the demonic spirit. Not only was the look great, but oh my god I loved the demons voice, sounded perfect. Eerie and creepy as hell, very effective as far as the voice goes. <br/><br/>Overall, this really is a fabulous horror film and I recommend it. 9/10."

","This movie to be honest isn't that Gory and I consider the Saw Franchise worse. This movie is what I believe to be a genre changing film with it's low budget and cast. This was pretty cool and Ash looked more nerdy. This gets a 7/10 for it's raw material and work. Sam Raimi is truly one of the best people in the film business."
"hatsunemiku-27340","7","1","2","13 September 2017"," Low Budget Classic
","While not possessing the humorous qualities that made Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness nerd culture classics, The Evil Dead is a great low budget, independent horror film from a small group of friends looking to make it in the harsh world of cinema. Filmed for dirt cheap, The Evil Dead had to come up with ways in which to take shortcuts that would make it look good and be scary without looking silly. Thus was the first person perspective Sam Raimi is known for invented. Claymation, cheesy blood hoses, and milk vomit add to the enjoyable inventiveness of this movie.<br/><br/>There's not much to say. The actors are all subpar, even Bruce Campbell is still gonna need a few years to iron himself out into a B-movie god. The story is weak and the script isn't particularly memorable, it'd only be with the next iterations we'd see the memorable parts. I feel that if this weren't attached to two other much better movies it'd have been lost, but despite that it's still an enjoyable cinematic treat and one of the most respectable horror films of the eighties."

","The zombie horror film owes a considerable debt to the masterpiece, ""Night of the Living Dead"" from George A. Romero. That was the movie that instigated a brand new kind of horror in cinema. ""The Evil Dead"" took the subgenre to a whole new level. The success to down to Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell. It takes a short time for the film to really warm up but once it has, there is no let up for the viewer. The bloody and gruesome set pieces are fast and furious. A group of friends are holidaying in a cabin, amidst the American countryside. An ancient evil is unleashed upon the holidaymakers as hordes of the undead besiege the cabin and the characters attempt to protect themselves. In spite of the excessive bloodletting, I wouldn't describe this horror film as being particularly frightening. It is still very watchable all the same. The direction is good on the whole. Naturally, the budget was low but it is almost non-existent here. Bruce Campbell is the only person who went on to have any kind of career as an actor. A number of scenes were either trimmed or removed completely before the American Film Censors would allow ""The Evil Dead"" to be released. A influential film."

","Although I've read for years about the issues the film faced coming out uncut in the UK, (with the tasteful ""tree scene"" being a bit of an attention grabber) I for some reason have never got round to seeing any of the Evil Dead movies. After leaving some people pretty surprised over what I've missed for the last few years,a very kind fellow IMDber caught me by surprise,by sending a complete box set of the franchise! Which led to me finally opening the book of the dead.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>For Spring Break,friends Ash,Linda,Scotty and Cheryl and Shelly decide to spend the holiday in a remote cabin. Looking round the cabin,the gang find a tape-to-tape recorder and a weird looking book. Playing the tape,the voice recites a series of odd incantations.Quickly pressing stop,the gang soon discover that they can't silence the evil dead.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Running out of the woods and into the cabin, writer/director Sam Rami & cinematographer Tim Philo make every penny of their low budget spring the dead into life. Circling round the cabin,Rami and Philo unleash an ultra-stylized chill,where extreme close-ups of eyes are stabbed with razor sharp edits (assisted by the Coen brothers) of lightning-fast first person tracking shots picking up the pace of the spirits. Drenching the screen in lashings of gore,Rami stubs the grisly splatter Horror with wickedly dark slap- stick Comedy chops,that gives the film a wonderfully peculiar comedic atmosphere.<br/><br/>Locking on the soon to be unlucky campers with devils eyes,the screenplay by Rami skilfully trims needless exposition to cut into the heart of ""the cabin in the woods"" campfire tale,via drawing a thumbnail impression of the five,which gives just enough details to their relationships. Holding back on Ash's iconic chainsaw action for later films in the series,Rami leaps round the setting with an infectious merry go round atmosphere,hitting the gang with Gothic chills that explode into grand guignol extravagance twisting the relationships of the gang. Joined by a cute Ellen Sandweiss delivering screams and cackling glee as Cheryl, Bruce Campbell gives his first chop at Ash a charming boys own adventure edges,as Campbell expresses Ash's desperation to find a practical solution to facing the evil dead."

","The LA Times once called The Evil Dead the ""grisliest well-made movie ever,"" which is largely accurate. Every time you think The Evil Dead might start to let up or change pace, it gets more disgusting, challenging and surreal. Essentially, the film melds the relentless evil of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" with the demonic spirituality of ""The Exorcist"" to produce an unforgiving, DIY, low-budget masterpiece. The various creative, resourceful effects and complicated, cheap rigs only add to the respect I have for The Evil Dead. It is my favorite illustration of how death comes ripping anytime, and in any way it chooses."
"framptonhollis","9","1","2","29 October 2016"," Iconic horror classic!
","After a somewhat slow beginning. ""The Evil Dead"" quickly turns into a stream of nightmarish moments, and remains one of the most unique, entertaining, and original horror films of all time.<br/><br/>While it doesn't have nearly as many iconic moments as its brilliant sequel ""Evil Dead 2"", it's still a superb movie that I urge every horror fan to see immediately if they haven't already. It's the perfect example of an unexpectedly popular cult movie shot on an extremely low budget. It's an independent movie legend, that has spawned tons of fans and imitators, and it still remains an impressive little movie to this day. <br/><br/>Despite a small budget, Sam Raimi and his crew work with a lot of great special effects, especially during the film's gruesome finale, that is packed with gore and stop motion. ""The Evil Dead"" certainly has technical flaws and some strange editing decisions throughout, but these flaws help add to its charm. It's not a perfect film, and if it was perfect, then it wouldn't be nearly as good or entertaining, believe it or not,<br/><br/>I would also like to mention the film's dark sense of humor. Or, at least I think it has a dark sense of humor. Honestly, I can't tell whether or not the movie is intentionally or unintentionally funny. Some scenes feel so slapsticky and over the top that they must be comedic, and the fact that the film's sequels take these comical scenes to a whole new level feels like proof of this being an intentional horror comedy. The sequels may be funnier, but that doesn't mean that the original doesn't have its laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>Despite dark humor being sprinkled throughout ""The Evil Dead"", it remains mostly serious throughout, and at times is genuinely frightening and intense. It is nowhere near as goofy and funny as its sequels, and has the capability to actually shock and scare me at times, unlike ""Army of Darkness"", a movie that I also love, but still doesn't remotely scare me."

","Do you remember back in the day, when once or twice a year the expensive pay movie channels had a free weekend? Everyone I knew used to put the blank VHS in and just start taping anything and everything right?! Then you'd end up with crap movies, great movies, and some movies you've never heard of. I was about 14. My brothers friend gave him 2 of these VHS tapes. With 3-4 movies on each one. It was a long weekend or something, so I had some late nights watching them. On one was Monkey Shines, Amityville Horror, and The Evil Dead. I had heard of the first 2 before and the last one had a name that sounded ridiculous.<br/><br/>When I got to the Evil Dead it was very late at night and it turned into a horror movie experience I will never forget and made me a life long genre fan! I quickly got over the ""crappy"" quality and low budget. I was mesmerized by the terror. Excited, scared, and blown away. It was the perfect time and setting to make me a Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fan FOR EVER! I realized that there was a sequel and that Army of Darkness (which was a ""new release"" VHS at the time) was the 3rd one. So i devoured it all HAHA.I wish others could have the experience I had with my first viewing of Evil Dead. But instead I will continue to be an ambassador for it! Don't expect crystal clear quality or amazing cinematography its just not like that. Its older. And one of their first movies. Just let go and let yourself get sucked into the horror, the genius...And the CELLAR!!!!!! ooooooooooohh. Ha."

","The new TV Show Ash Vs Evil Dead beginning, I though't that the minimum respect for this anthology of gore horror comedies was to begin by re-watching the hole trilogy and the 2013 sequel.<br/><br/>Evil dead 1, the ""scariest"" of the trilogy, scary maybe due to Ash's persona (Bruce Campbell) not yet fully matured, or to the the comedy side not yet fully admitted, but great. Real early great gore low-budget effects, surprising and even sometime scary because of the graduating blood thirsty tension all through the movie. Great comic evil lines which will grow to become the evil dead trilogy signature. Even with my 21th century eye, I enjoyed the great work on decors and ""antique"" special effects. The precise, punchy and yet humorous touch of Sam Raimi makes it a masterpiece. My favorite scene: the mythological tree rape sequence!"
"Halloween1247","8","1","2","17 October 2015"," I good example of a horror movie done right
","The Evil Dead by Sam Rami was a film that was called by Stephen King himself ""The most ferociously original horror film of year "" and I would think he knows a thing or two about horror.<br/><br/>The film starts with 5 college age friends go off to a cabin in the woods. In this group of friends there is our hero Ash Williams ( Bruce Campbell ) with his girlfriend Linda( Betsey Baker ),as well as his joker friend Scotty( Richard DeManincor )and his girlfriend Shelly ( Theresa Tilly ). Also Ash's younger sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss ) goes with them.... for some reason. Seriously, this one thing never made sense, since it seems that the two couples are going for a romantic retreat in the woods and she comes without a partner? Then again Cheryl is the only one to get lucky is this movie....<br/><br/>When these friends go to this cabin things seem off. At first it is just little stuff like Cheryl being forced to draw creepy books or trapdoors randomly slamming open. When they explore the basement of the cabin they find The Book of the Dead and a skull bone dagger thing that according to Scotty looks like something Ash might have got it on with. They listen to a tape recording where the previous owner of the cabin reads some text from The Book of the Dead. One of these incantations releases the demons and they possesses Cheryl in one of the most awkward way possible. From then on the story is about the group surviving the onslaught of demons that are called Deadites. <br/><br/>So the story is simple but the Deadites have this cool mythology setup and once these things are established, the second half of the story is non-stop horror. If you can really bring the scares in a horror film, you can get away with a slim story. The story just does its job at getting Ash to the point where his friends and family torturing him.<br/><br/>The main character Ash is usually known as a bad ass one-liners Deadite killing machine. That is not the case in the original movie as he is kind of a goof ball. Ash is still a great protagonist and is the most likable in the movie; just don't get disappointed if you want to see Ash crudely attach a chainsaw to his hand. The real attraction in the first movie is not Ash, it is the Deadites.<br/><br/>The Deadite makeup looks amazing and is better the most zombie affects nowadays. The thing that really makes the Deadites is the actors that play them. The one Deadite that really stands out is Cheryl just for her Deadite voice. Ellen Sandweise seems to be having the time of her life just being as evil and creepy as possible. All the Deadites have their own bits of personality to them. Deadite Linda also has this really creepy song in the movie while she is lurking outside the window that is just plain disturbing.<br/><br/>Another area that this movie really excels in is the blood and the gore. The Deadites are not afraid to get their hands dirty, like in a part of the movie when a Deadite gets its hand cut and the Deadite just bites it clean off. To kill a Deadite is upsetting for the characters because you have to kill a friend and because there deaths are really gruesome. Deadites really know how to milk a death because they won't just die; they will spurt out blood or leak out some really nasty yellow stuff. This film may not have the same kind of blood and violence modern horror film has, but it knows how to use it all creatively.<br/><br/>The music score in the film is kind of a disappointment as it really just sounds like standard horror movie music. The sound that the evil force makes is the only really interesting sound in the movie. The force sound is one of the more iconic things in the movie.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, while under attack from Deadite Cheryl and Scotty, Ash manages to throw The Book of the Dead into the fireplace and then out of the blue they like explode. With some of the best stop-motion I have seen, satanic hands burst out of the Deadites and they like dissolve into plies of bugs and pus and it is truly memorable.<br/><br/>Sometimes the Deadite makeup effects look a little silly and there are some inconsistencies with the way things look, but who cares! This film is a great bit of cinema and Sam Rami shows that you don't have to get everything right to make a great horror film.<br/><br/>A must see for horror fans <br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Sam Raimi has created a cult classic that has stood the test of time, The Evil Dead is a horror classic. The first of the three in Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, The Evil Dead is campy, silly, and all around a gruesome thrill ride worthy of its cult status. It's hard to not admire the film, you can clearly tell what Raimi was going for, the limited budget and inexperience definitely shows, but that only adds to the overall charm of the film. A group of unsuspecting 20 something-year-olds unleash an ancient evil and have to fend off the foe for the sake of their souls. <br/><br/>As the movie moves along, the tone goes from being creepy to downright chaotic as the demons taunt and torment the remaining survivors. It's hard not to laugh at the silly antics of the possessed, as well as the campy dialogue coming from most characters. But like I said, all of those silly aspects of the film only adds to the overall effect of the film, which couldn't be any more entertaining. The movie may be too campy for most people's taste, this is a movie that must be seen by any true horror fan or anyone who has a taste for extremely low budget films.<br/><br/>It isn't until the sequel Evil Dead 2, which was made 6 years later that our hero Ash truly takes form, but this sets the stage for that. The Evil Dead may be over the top, unrelenting, and silly, but the movie is never dull nor entertaining! This is one of the best horror movies of all time, bar none!"

","While it's not the first film in the ""Evil Dead"" franchise to recommend to a non-seasoned viewer, ""The Evil Dead"" has pride of place for being the first of the films, as well as for being so visceral and intense.<br/><br/>Five young people journey to a mountain cabin near the Tennessee border for a weekend getaway, only to accidentally awaken malevolent spirits of the dead by flicking the ""play"" switch on a recorded recitation of ""ancient Sumerian burial rituals and funerary incantations."" One by one, they are done in by the grisly ghouls, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left to deal with the supernatural menace – or die trying.<br/><br/>Billed as ""The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Horror,"" ""Evil Dead"" is markedly different from what you expect having seen the first two sequels. There's no ""groovy"" catch-phrase in this one, and the terms ""deadites"" or ""Necronomicon"" aren't mentioned. (The ""Book of the Dead"" here is called ""Naturon Demonto."") Humor is mostly in the eye of the beholder; on the surface this is a ""video nasty"" that lives up to its name with exploding heads and a straight-faced, unforgettable depiction of tree-rape.<br/><br/>I'm not on board with the idea of this being a classic. But it is a good horror film, directed by Sam Raimi with real flair and engaging depth-of-field camera-work. After a slow opening 22 minutes, the film kicks into high gear and never lets up all the way to the end.<br/><br/>The film proved a bit of a slow-grower. A sluggish box-office performer when released in 1981, it has since become a bigger deal culturally than ""Chariots Of Fire,"" the year's Oscar-winner for best film, as well as other big 1981 hits. Great, no, but it has a kind of greatness about it.<br/><br/>""Why are you torturing me like this?"" Ash cries out at one point.<br/><br/>""We're going to get you..."" the spirits answer, singing tauntingly.<br/><br/>What makes the film work so well as I see it is not the acting, which is frill-free minimalist work to put it kindly, but rather the sense of location. The strange house, more a shack really, is a thing of wonder, with various rooms tricked out with odds and ends that suggest more than we see. There's a bit of a ""Snoopy's doghouse"" effect going on here, as the house interior seems way too spacious and crammed with accouterments to match the exterior we see. There's even an attic visible in some exterior shots which never comes into play in this movie.<br/><br/>Why are the kids so insanely willing to stay in the house when things start to go so wrong? The car steering wheel suddenly acts on its own, the bridge they drive on to the house gives way as they pass over it, a pendulum clock stops in mid-swing, a woman's hand becomes possessed as she sketches, and a trap door bangs and flies open by itself. Perhaps it's some moonshine they drank that was lost in the editing, or some pot-smoking which was scripted but never filmed. The end result is you never really care about these dumb characters, who seem more like lab rats than people. Without the same level of humor that buoys ""Evil Dead 2"" so brilliantly, you don't care as much as you should.<br/><br/>But that's more a quibble than a fault. The positives outweigh the negatives, especially in terms of the brilliant sound design by Joe Masefield (which adds immeasurably to the spooky mood throughout). They are further enhanced on the DVD thanks to dueling commentaries by Campbell and by Raimi and producer Robert Tapert, who play up their different views of what went wrong and right with what apparently was a grueling production.<br/><br/>The end result was worth the struggle. ""Ultimate Experience,"" maybe not, but ""Evil Dead"" is a solid stab at shock horror that will leave you breathless, and quite possibly wanting more."

","I saw this on video tape on first release. At that time in the UK a list of Video Nasties gained notoriety and a ""must see"" attitude was manufactured as a result. Proudly at the top of this list was The Evil Dead. I hunted down a copy from a local video shop, he kept it under the counter, it cost me £5 just for one evening to rent and me and my group of mates sat in a dark room and watched. We had a ball! Terrified, thrilled, excited, entertained. By todays standards of course the effects are cheesy and cheap, the make up is not very well done, the whole production looks aged and not shiny and polished like the modern horror that we all expect nowadays. But what this movie did have was an eerie sense of ""what you are about to see"" and it didn't disappoint. Jumps galore, just enough gore to make you wince, great performances from the then unknown cast and rock solid direction from Sam Raimi. Kids nowadays will claim ""overrated"" or ""cheap and nasty"" but they are missing the point, and unfortunately for them, missing out. I bet those same modern kids would say Psycho was rubbish ""black and white"", ""corny acting"" ""slow"" or ""tame"" - but watch these movies at the time of release and see them as the works of genius they are."

","Where can you even start? The Evil Dead, directed by Sam Raimi, starring Bruce Campbell, produced by Rob Tapert, with assistance from Josh Becker, and special effects by Bart Pierce, and even co-edited by Joel Coen, as far as horror movies go, The Evil Dead is the best of the best. It was here that Ash, the greatest horror hero in cinema was born. He has had two more adventures (Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness) and I hope he will have at least one more. At the end of the remake Bruce Campbell had a cameo which gives me hope that this might still happen. The remake was decent, but the original is just the best. It's scary, it's funny, and the camera work is out of this world. Sam Raimi was a genius even when he was a teenager and a better director than most directors when they're 40. If you haven't seen the original Evil Dead you really should. Even Stephen King agrees it's the best, and he's the King of horror!"

This was a great film to start of his directing career and with a budget of only $300, 000 they did an outstanding job! Especially with the special effects. There were so many great special effects in this movie my jaw almost dropped. I can't believe all these amateurs who were new to the film world accomplished such great special effects. Of course the movie does have its flaws but for a low budget film made by people who were new and didn't have a whole lot of experience with films, this is just great! Check it out."

Who, if anyone can survive the night or the evil dead?<br/><br/>A cult classic within the horror genre, this brutal, grotesque and raw film is a must see for any fans of the genre. A classic film that has inspired many other horror directors of the genre and gone on to inspire two sequels and a remake. The acting is not the best and in fact is a bit mediocre, though this film did make Bruce Campbell a star and one of Sam Raimi's favorite cast able actors. The pacing is wonderful, the camera work as well, the acting and dialog though can be considered cheesy in some aspects but it is still decent film. One must understand that this film though many consider a B-film was and in fact an extremely terrifying film for first time viewers. Some may consider it cheesy now compared to the effects ridden horror films of the present, but to this viewer, I personally find this to be an enjoyable horrifying film. The effects all practical add to the grotesque realism. Though while the film starts slow it eventually build up steam to an almost unbearable breaking point of horror. The original Evil Dead is a must see for anyone who considers themselves a true horror film aficionado. Though not for the faint of heart whatsoever."

","When I was 14 / 15 myself and two school friends used to go to our local cinema in Glasgow for the Wednesday night skuddie / horror double-bill. Allow me to clarify. The opening / supporting film would usually be a soft porn flick, and the main feature would be the latest horror. The man on the door would enquire re our age, to which we would reply ""18, mate"" - and that was us in.<br/><br/>We had an arrangement that we would each bring something to the party. And so it was that cans of lager, cigars and so on, were transported from our homes to the picture-house in large coats.<br/><br/>If I shouldn't move from here, I can remember - with one of my old Granda's cigars in one hand and a can of lager in the other - saying to my pals, as we settled down for The Evil Dead, how I was sick and tired of being disappointed by these would-be scary films about young Americans getting murdered on rural holidays. Not this one, one of my mates assured me. He'd seen the clips, and they were enough to convince him that this film would be different. And he was right.<br/><br/>All the knock knock knockin on horror's door stuff was familiar enough, but once it all kicked off, it was a relentless, concentrated gorefest. There is no doubt that I had never been so captivated by a horror film in my life. For once, I had got what I paid for, and was thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>So, how did it look tonight, all these years on? Might sound daft, but I think that one of the things that 'dates' early 80's horrors (and Sci-Fi's) is the electro-drone music. But, I enjoyed the sfx - very European, with touches of The Thing near the end. Has there been a better horror film than this made since? I think that The Omen is a better horror than this - but it's older, and very different. And I would say the same of a number of other films. However, I cannot think of a younger horror film that is a better horror film than this. Then again, as you'll have worked out for yourself, it's all changed since my day - all of this was just fields, you know."

","The Evil Dead follows five college students driving out to a secluded cabin in an even more secluded forest. At first the five young adults have a fun time with one another until they explore the cellar in the cabin and find the Necronomicon Ex- Mortis, The Book of the Dead. They play a tape recording of the previous tenant of the cabin, Professor Knowby, who recites the incantation described in the book to unleash ancient Candarian demons from their slumber. Afterwards strange things begin to happen around them until a dark force begins to possess them one by one. Will any of them survive the night?<br/><br/>When I first saw The Evil Dead I liked it but didn't really give it much thought afterwards. However upon reevaluation and thinking of just how much work went into making it I've come to really appreciate it for its natural horror and have recognized it as one of my favorite horror films. The brilliant use of natural effects like fake blood, stop motion, realistic props really blend together masterfully and make this a truly disturbing experience. <br/><br/>The cast deserves major recognition for their work. Of course the one everyone remembers is Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams who in this movie isn't the snarky, one-liner spouting walking bag of awesome he becomes in the later movies but is still a great character here as he has to gain courage through the night and take charge against the Deadites that are trying their hardest to kill him. Another stand out cast member is Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Ash's sister, who at first is the common scared girl we see in most horror films. But when she becomes possessed she turns into an entirely different character. She threatens them all in a dark booming voice and spouts a few lines that are almost comedic in a dark way. It's a chilling performance and without it the movie wouldn't be half as effective.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do a great job too. Betsy Baker plays Linda, Ash's girlfriend, who really shines as a Deadite. Her creepy smile combined with the brilliant makeup make her one of the scariest looking characters in any horror film. And then we have Richard DeManicor as Scotty and Theresa Tilly as his girlfriend Shelly, who were both credited with different names as the Screen Actors Guild wouldn't allow them to star in such a film as this. What's interesting is that Scotty is set up to be the hero for the first half of the film but by the halfway point we switch perspectives to Ash who is forced to watch all his friends suffer and die one by one. <br/><br/>Where this movie shines is in its effects. This movie was made on a very little budget by people with little to no experience filming professionally and yet they managed to pull it off exceedingly well. From the cuts and bruises the characters endure to the demonically possessed students almost nothing in this film looks fake. Although there are some noticeable instances where an obvious dummy was used and the stop motion might be considered dated by this time but still in a time where CGI was barely used if at all it's amazing to see this kind of practicality in a movie made by a bunch of college kids. <br/><br/>The Evil Dead series gets progressively campier as each film goes on but make no mistake, this film is straight up horror. There are a few unintentional humorous moments to be found in the dialog or a few visual gags here and there but if you're expecting the same kind of humor as its sequels you certainly won't find it here. And what's great about the horror in this movie is it's constantly building you up. You know something is going to happen. You know the movie is just biding its time leading up to the next scare and just when you think you know something is going to happen it doesn't, only to happen about a second later when you've let your guard down. There's a real atmosphere to the cabin and surrounding woods and you feel just as trapped and paranoid as Ash does.<br/><br/>The film lives on a diet of blood and gore so if you've got a weak constitution for that kind of stuff you may want to think twice before seeing this film. The standout scene that really scared me though comes in the first half hour where Cheryl goes to investigate mysterious voices coming from the woods and starts getting attacked by tree branches that proceed to rip her clothes to shreds, spread her legs apart and for the coup de grace a tree branch launches in between her legs. This happens for a good 2 to 3 minutes and you're forced to watch the entire thing play out. She manages to escape sure but it's still a terrifying scene and probably the only one that really disturbed me afterwards. <br/><br/>However as I said there is a lot to appreciate in terms of how this movie was crafted. This is the first theatrically released film of Sam Raimi, who would later go on to direct the Spider-Man Trilogy and the recently released Oz: The Great and Powerful. And after seeing this movie and looking back on those I can see just how much Evil Dead still influences his style. <br/><br/>All in all The Evil Dead is a classic horror film that will leave you guessing what's going to happen every minute. It may start out slow but once it gets going with the horror it doesn't stop until the credits roll. It's a great movie for horror enthusiasts, aspiring filmmakers, and anyone else looking for a good old fashioned gore flick. I definitely recommend it."
"JamesMitchell451","10","1","2","22 September 2013"," One of the best horror films ever
","Very few films can mix humor and horror like The Evil Dead. The film is about a group of teenagers who are going to a cabin out in the middle of nowhere. While there, they find a book called the book of the dead, one of them recites the words and in doing so, releases unleashes a bunch of demons. The acting is top notch from everyone, along with the creepy as hell demon voices that are guaranteed to give you the creeps and the sound of the winds increasing outside, it wins in the auditory department. This film is gory. Yes I've seen hundreds of not thousands of films and this is the only film that the gore looked so real and disgusting, I actually threw up. There is no horror film out there right now that can match this film in terms of violence, between demons getting their heads cut off and buckets of blood (literally), I recommend that you bring a barf bag. Another thing is that this is the scariest film I have ever seen, even more so than The Exorcist. The way this film builds up suspense and tension is unrivaled in any film in any category, not just horror, and the best part: most of the scares aren't jump scares! It is also unrivaled in the humor department, heads are getting cut off and yet it is intentionally funny, the sort of humor that you'll find in Zombieland and Shaun Of The Dead (Though this film came before both). Add all this, plus the most creative camerwork in the industry and you've got the formula for one badass film. If you like movies of any sort, go check this out. And even if you don't like movies (I've never met anyone like that though) you should still go out and buy this movie. The Evil Dead is a masterpiece, I cannot recommend this movie enough."
"Equinox23","10","1","2","30 April 2013"," ""Why Are You Torturing Me Like This?""
","Let me start by telling that I'm not actually a fan of gory horror movies and that the movies that scare me the most are those in which the horror is not graphic but rather happening in your head. Like the most scary movies to me are ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925) and especially the scene when the phantom is described and one can see the horror on the face of the person who is describing him, or The Haunting where the horror is also only conveyed by the reactions of those exposed to it.<br/><br/>The other preliminary is that the first thing I learned about this movie is that it was banned in Germany for being too brutal and yet I watched it and am glad I did for I was pleasantly surprised - if one can talk of pleasant in the context of a horror movie. For what I found was a movie that takes its brutality and gore and the effect on its protagonists seriously. <br/><br/>For me the conflict became evident in Ash's exclamation: ""Why are you torturing me like this?"". First of all I took it as being directed against the demons who are of course threatening him, but then I discovered some other deeper meaning here. For he is the only one who actually knows the remedy against them, which is dismemberment, but he is also shown as being very reluctant to actually apply it. So what is tormenting Ash is also this knowledge and the effects it does or would have on his soul. Which according to Peter Brook also happens to be the central one in Hamlet. Hamlet is ordered to revenge his father's death, but at the same time the ghost also demands him not to taint his soul. In both cases the choices are horrible and both are quite classic."
"lolbleachfan","8","1","2","2 January 2013"," Cartoonishly Violent and I Love It!
","'Evil Dead' is a movie that you really should go and see without having and prior knowledge of it whatsoever.<br/><br/>The story is a group of buddies all going to a cabin somewhere in the rural Tenessee woods for a weekend getaway. When they get there, they discover a weird book and some tapes. The tapes belonged to an archaeologist who was studying the book and came to the cabin to not get distracted by anything at home, he explains how he believes this to be the book of the dead, or Necronomicon, itself. He managed to translate some of the writings and speaks them out loud of the tapes. The words summon demons to the cabin that slowly possess each of the friends one by one until the lone survivor, Ash, has to fight off the rest of the demons and somehow escape from woods alive.<br/><br/>Now, as soon as you see the phrase 'group of buddies' in the context of a horror movie, you want to roll your eyes. Yeah, it's a horror movie cliché to have a bunch of boring and unlikable teens just there for the sake of getting killed. But wait! We actually care for their characters. Okay, they're not exactly three-dimensional Shakespeare characters but at least they are decent characters. Especially the relationship between Ash and his girlfriend, Linda. They're an adorable couple that you want to see live but it all ends in tragedy as the demons use Linda to torment Ash.<br/><br/>The rest of the film? Really unique. There are very few films out there that can take place in one small space and hold my attention the entire running time. The cinematography is fantastic, with some shots really making you wonder how the hell they managed to do them. The atmosphere is fantastic, with very little music and more emphasis on sound effects. The wind blowing outside, the floorboards creaking, the squelchy noises the blood makes as the characters walk through them. Great stuff. The cabin itself is very creepy. If I saw anything like it in real life, I would just stay far away. It's widely known that the movie was on a really tight budget and the crew found the cabin abandoned in the forest. Knowing that makes it a whole more creepier.<br/><br/>The effects are jaw-dropping and a true testament that practical effects will always beat CGI. The way the demons look, the white stuff they spray out of their mouth when they are stabbed or shot, the ridiculous amount of blood almost literally coming out the woodwork and the stop-motion finale.<br/><br/>It's also pretty inspiring when you watch or read a lot of stuff that went on behind-the-scenes. How some of the effects where done, the hell the crew persevered through, the ridiculous controversy it caused especially in the UK but is now considered a horror classic. I highly recommend watching documentaries on the film if you have an interest in film making.<br/><br/>Is there anything bad about the movie? Of course there is. While I did mention the characters were decent, the acting is a bit bland. Even Bruce Campbell as Ash who has become one of the biggest cult movie stars is nothing to write home about in this movie but when the characters become possessed, then they turn up the ham dial all the way up to 100 and it becomes far more entertaining. I also don't think I need to say anything about the infamous tree rape scene. It's just out of place even in a movie as crazy as 'Evil Dead.' Well, that's my take on it. If you haven't seen it, do me a favour and do it soon. It's one of the most creative, original, entertaining and greatest movies of all time."
"sashank_kini-1","8","1","2","1 November 2012"," Spooky, Funny and Unsettling - Evil Dead Remains Vastly Superior to its 'Sell-out' Sequel
","Jump sequences have been quite successful in evoking fright; add to that a claustrophobic cabin and remove any sort of background music and what you get is tense gripping horror. This element was entirely missing in the sequel of Evil Dead, which I had the displeasure of watching about a year ago. Evil Dead however retains segments of horror while also providing enough laughs, and thus remains more exciting, more interesting and more original than its sequel. <br/><br/>The plot of Evil Dead is not very new: Ash, his sister Cheryl, his girlfriend Linda, his best pal Scott and Scott's girlfriend Shelly decide to stay the night at a lonely deserted cabin in the woods. In the first scene itself, as they are traveling in a cramped car to their destination, they encounter this mysterious force (although they do not understand what actually happens) as their car steering wheel loses control momentarily. As they cross the rickety bridge to the cabin, a plank of wood gives away under the car's weight but they somehow cross the bridge and drive to the cabin. <br/><br/>Over there, the mysterious thing's presence is felt again as a swing outside the main door keeps striking the house until Scott opens the door. At night, Cheryl is the first unfortunate to be directly targeted by the force as it takes control of her hand while she is drawing. Later, at dinner, the moment Scott says 'party down!' the basement door opens on its own. In a funny Scooby Doo like sequence, the camera pans at each one's faces as they speak their thoughts about the incident. Scott first enters the basement with Ash following and the pair come out with a book on the dead and a tape recorder. The tape, recorded in the past by a doctor, is played and the evil spirits are beckoned. After Cheryl is raped by the forest, she demands Ash to take her out of town but the pair realizes the group's fate is doomed when they see the bridge destroyed. One by one, Cheryl and the others are possessed and it is up to Ash to do something before it is too late. <br/><br/>The low level canting shots in Evil Dead, which were shot without using dollies (the crew couldn't afford it) made me uneasy and I was reminded of similar shots in Blair Witch Project; its marvelous how these raw effects could evoke fear while many of the sophisticated effects in recent movies cannot. Another interesting element is Raimi's focus on the eyes: when the pendulum stops suddenly, a close up shot of Cheryl's frightened eyes are seen. A much better example is when Ash keeps a box on his lap and feigns to sleep while Linda tries to look at the contents. The camera focuses on their eyes as they play this little game of theirs. Later, when Ash is about to bury a possessed Linda, she pretends to sleep and the camera again focuses on their eyes, thus depicting the irony and difference in the situation. <br/><br/>The gore in the film is plenteous, but it isn't very disturbing as most of the blood comes from the zombies. However, there is the tree rape scene that is much more uncomfortable since Cheryl isn't in a possessed state. This reminds me of another scene in the movie: just when Ash contemplates striking a possessed Linda, she turns normal for a few minutes and begs Ash to protect her from 'them'. This was when I realized how my perception regarding the gory content changed when the characters transformed; it would have been much more disturbing to see a normal Linda being hacked to death. <br/><br/>Bruce Campbell, the supporting cast and the 'fake shemps' deliver great performances for a horror movie. Some of the dialogs are very funny and very cheesy, with Linda getting some of the worst and most vapid lines in the film. The thing I did not understand about Evil Dead is how the entire 'monster mechanism' worked – while it seemed at times that the evil force could not enter the 'cabin' (Ash closes the doors and locks the force outside), Linda gets possessed all of a sudden even though Cheryl only stabs her with an object and doesn't bite her. <br/><br/>I saw Evil Dead twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both the times. While its sequel sells out for popcorn fun, Evil Dead remains spooky, funny, unsettling and the superior one."
"tina-klein","8","1","2","4 April 2012"," Oldie but creepy!
","The Evil Dead is just a REALLY scary movie. Low-budget, the plot is simple and direct, the characters are few, but the pacing is wonderful.<br/><br/>I had been a fan of horror for several years before seeing this movie. I read about it and wanted to see it, but at the time it was harder to find than uranium. I finally got to see it on the Sci-Fi Channel in the early-to-mid 90s, and I was spellbound. This movie scared the hell out of me and left me creeped out for a good while after it was over. After seeing this movie, my lifelong love of horror was cemented. If you are a horror fan and haven't seen this film, WATCH IT!!! And shame on you for not seeing it earlier."
"Red-Barracuda","7","1","2","24 October 2011"," This is how you make a movie on a shoestring
","The Evil Dead will always remain a great example of what kind of cinema can be made on a minuscule budget. Its a testament to what can be achieved if the filmmakers have imagination and ingenuity. It was infamous initially as one of the most prominent members of the video nasties in the UK. This was probably in part due to the fact that it was the most popular videotape of the year back in 1981. Like many films from that famous list, its really quite difficult now understanding why it was deemed so dangerous. Undoubtedly, this is a very violent film and that is certainly the main source of its notoriety. But its just so fantastical and non-realistic that it makes you wonder if the moral guardians of the day had the slightest sense of humour. Yes, this is a splatter movie but its also a pretty kinetic piece of cinema. The Evil Dead is certainly one of the best examples of imaginative filmmaking on an ultra-low budget.<br/><br/>The Dead films are one of the best trilogies out there. The chief reason for this is that they change a little each time in a successful way that keeps the formula fresh. This first instalment is an out-and-out horror film, part two is a comedy-horror par excellence and the third adds a fantasy dimension to proceedings. All achieve what they set out to do. For me, the second film is where the series peaks, as it is the best combination of its two major strengths - the horror and the humour. Star Bruce Campbell and director Sam Raimi were the twin strengths of the second and third instalments. But the original film is really unquestionably Raimi's film. Campbell hadn't perfected his knockabout comedy persona here, so its the visual invention of Raimi that the film derives its main strength from. There is a great eye for detail here such as the ominous thump of the swing seat on arrival, the malevolent POV camera-work of the unseen demon in the woods and the scary demonic girl in the cellar. Fair enough, some of the special effects towards the end are a little ropey now but what can really be expected for a film made on such a shoestring? All in all, this remains a very remarkable little movie that deserves its cult reputation. When you consider that everyone involved in making it was in their early twenties it makes it even more impressive bearing in mind how original and non-derivative it is."

","If one were to think of Sam Raimi the director, what springs to mind? Perhaps the SPIDERMAN movies? Maybe DARKMAN? Most assuredly ARMY OF DARKNESS (the third movie in the EVIL DEAD series!) Back in '80 and into the winter of '81, Raimi along with his pals Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell, set out to make a student film that would eventually cross over into their first feature. And what a doozy! Borrowing story elements from some notable Italian horror, SUSPIRIA for one, as well as popular American horror, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE EXORCIST spring to mind, the young filmmakers then proceed to tell their own twisted tale. Five college students spend the weekend at an old dilapidated cabin, only to discover an ancient book of spells called the Necromonicon and a tape recording of the incantations. Unfortunately, the tape recording awakens some very angry demons who then proceed to possess four of the students, soon leaving Bruce Campbell as the iconic Ash the only survivor. And if that wasn't bad enough everything in the forest, from the trees to the fog and wind, seems to have a mind of its own. Worse still, the only way for Ash to defeat the demons is to dismember each one of his friends. Tons of low budget gore, an unhinged plot and some very wicked special effects are what makes this movie shine. It's guaranteed to shock, appall, and terrify you. So gather together your brood of friends, unless you dare to watch it alone. Either way, the best way to watch it is with the lights turned down and the volume turned up! Enjoy some bloody good fun!!!"

","I call it Tension Raiser No. 1. I saw it on a local video hall in my neighborhood. That time I was a sixth standard student. I must say I got scared out of my pants. Could not go out at night time outside for a long time. Sometimes I was jolted out of my sleep by dreams of the possessed girls of the film choking my throat with their dreadful hands. How would one define a good horror film? A good horror film evokes terrible and relentless tension and unease. Despite knowing that its merely a movie, one gets scared terribly and the terrible hangover lingers for much longer time than one is comfortable with. Evil Dead is one such one of a kind film.

"gigan-92","9","1","2","22 November 2010"," If You Haven't Seen It, Then you Haven't Really Experienced Horror
","I find the overwhelming majority of modern horror just plain deplorable, cliché, and dull compared to this film. For such a small budget, it set a bar so high hundreds of films have failed to even come close to its greatness. Right off the bat I'll say that yes, the acting could have been more solid at times, but it doesn't distract at all. Bruce Campbell already stands out a bit from the others in my eyes, although he does vastly improve the quality of his performance in the sequel. The cast here is secondary, the atmosphere set up by the very creative and clever photography being its strongest point. Tom Philo came up with interesting visuals, under the guide of Sam Raimi. Our director creates a true sense of terror and helplessness just from the way it's shot, for example one of the opening sequences as the characters arrive at our cabin. It's just so ominous.<br/><br/>This is greatly helped by one of the few good horror composers, Joseph LoDuca. The music was chilling and got to your nerves every time you hear it. The effects are good old 80s material, which I prefer when it comes to the horror genre. CGI can ruin an otherwise good horror film; alas ""I am Legend"". The makeup was gruesome and the photography effects just plain scared the hell out of me! The movie hits you hard with excellent carnage and some very disturbing shots, like that infamous tree scene. It's disturbing yet funny, to really sum it up properly. Raimi pokes fun at the genre while serving up stunning cinematography making just a fun movie to watch over and over. By now I doubt many haven't seen it, but if you haven't then you have not truly experienced horror."

It's got the necronomicon, and Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is a simple story about a few kids who go to a little cabin for the weekend, when they discover a book. This not any normal book, it's the Necronomicon; the Book of the Dead. It slowly turns everyone into demons, all except little ol' Bruce, who is left to fend off against the evil dead menace. Finally, after a long night of fighting and being tormented, Ash (Bruce Campbell) throws the book into the fire place, leading to one of the coolest scenes in any movie... Ever.<br/><br/>The acting is awesome. It's four kids, no experience, putting their heart and soul into this movie. Most importantly, Bruce Campbell, who not only acted, he funded the majority of the movie, did a lot of the FX, even got injured making this movie. And the gore in this movie is incredible, the pencil in foot scene is so wrong... And we can't forget the tree rape, thanks Sam Raimi for giving me nightmares about that!

","Five Michigan State students venture into the hills and mountains of Tennessee to spend a weekend in an isolated cabin. There they find The Book of the Dead (a fictional Aztec/Canaanite text, unrelated to the Egyptian Book of the Dead), otherwise known as the Nyturan Demonta. While searching the basement of the cabin, the students find and play a tape recording of demonic incantations from the book, unwittingly resurrecting ""Kandarian"" Demons. The characters are then possessed one by one, beginning with Cheryl Williams (Ellen Sandweiss), after she is hypnotized by the song of a Demon and lured into the forest at night. Alone and far from the safety of the cabin, the Demon proceeds to possess the trees of the forest, which come to life in a snake-like fashion and brutally rape her. Cheryl escapes the trees and is chased by the Demon all the way back to the cabin, where no one believes her story and assumes that she was attacked by a wild animal. Her brother, Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell), decides to drive her into town where she can stay the night. They discover that the only bridge is completely destroyed and the supports are bent into the shape of a claw-like hand.<br/><br/>Soon thereafter, Cheryl, having been infested by a Demon during the rape, dies and becomes a deaden (a corpse that is used as a vessel for the Demon that has possessed it) and stabs Linda (Betsy Baker) in the ankle with a pencil. Scotty beats her with the blunt end of his axe and kicks her in the cellar; he then locks her in the fruit cellar, but afterward Shelly (Theresa Tilly) enters her room and is killed and possessed by a Demon lurking there; now a deaden, she becomes psychotically vicious and attacks Scotty (Hal Delrich), who dismembers her with an axe. Scotty then leaves to find a trail out of the woods.<br/><br/>Ash goes to check on Linda, but finds that she too has become possessed by a Spirit. Scotty returns, but has suffered massive injuries inflicted upon him by the possessed trees. Before losing consciousness he tells Ash there is a trail in the woods. Linda revives momentarily from the possession & Ash drags her outside and locks her out of the cabin. He goes back to check on Scotty, but finds that he died from his injuries. Linda later returns as a deaden and tries to stab Ash, but Ash stabs her through the chest with a dagger. Ash drags her outside to dismember her with a chainsaw, but finds that he cannot bring himself to do it, and simply buries her instead. She rises from the grave and, after a violent struggle, Ash beheads her with a shovel. He returns to find the cellar door open. He enters the cellar, to find shotgun ammunition and returns to the upstairs. He hears a noise from Shelly and Scott's bedroom. With the shotgun, he goes in to investigate and suspects Cheryl may be in the closet. Cheryl jumps at the window a demon had earlier broken through and tries to take the shotgun from Ash, grabbing at it wildly. Ash shoots her in the chest, but it does not seem to have any effect. Ash then proceeds to barricade both the front and back doors. He runs back into the cellar to find a box of shotgun shells and experiences a strange series of events including the cellar filling with blood and hearing voices. Cheryl tries to attack Ash through the door, but he shoots her and then barricades the door.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Scotty's dead body suddenly revives to reveal that he has been possessed by a Spirit, only to have his eyes gouged out by Ash after a brief struggle. Ash notices that Nyturan Demonta has fallen near the fireplace and is starting to burn. Ash sees that Scotty's body is starting to burn as well, giving an allusion that disposal of the book into the fire will also destroy the Demons. Before he can reach it, however, Cheryl successfully breaks in through the front door and easily knocks him down. Scotty then pins Ash to the floor while Cheryl grabs a fireplace poker and repeatedly hits Ash in the back with it. Ash manages to grab the book after several attempts, using the necklace he had given to Linda earlier in the film, and throws it directly into the blazing flames just as Cheryl raises the fireplace poker to impale him. The Demons leave the bodies of Cheryl and Scotty, and their corpses become inanimate and fall apart over the course of several minutes just as dawn breaks, leaving Ash as the only survivor. He heads outside and stands in front of the cabin for a moment, thinking he has survived the ordeal. An Unseen Evil speeds through the forest, breaks its way through the cabin doors, and descends upon Ash, who screams in terror as the film ends"
"woinaroschy_1979","10","1","2","6 September 2010"," They don't make movies like that anymore...
","This movie is a true masterpiece and one that will always be cited as a reference in the domain of horror movies. With very few means (the location is a shabby cabin in the middle of the forest, there are only 5 people acting in the movie, there is no CGI because it was made in 1981) the director manages to transform a very simple story into a nightmare, that will give you goosebumps and make you cover your eyes every 5 minutes. The movie reminds me a lot of the ""Night of the living dead"", another masterpiece of horror. The make-up is perfect, real, very visual (only 2-3 times where I am able to see that it's not blood or that it's make-up or a mask). But it's really the camera angles that fascinate me the most, the rapid movements in the woods, around the cabin or even from the basement, giving you the impression that you truly look through those dead eyes, or that shot where the image turns upside down because the view climbs up on the ceiling and then back down to the face of the victim. Amazing! Comparing horror films today with this one is like comparing water with wine. They just don't do films like that anymore! The only horror flick that could come close to it is The Grudge, but it's a totally other type of horror film.

","In this cult classic - the original cabin-in-the-woods flick - a furious demonic force possesses a group of thrill-seeking teens (led by Bruce Campbell) who venture deep into the Tennessee backwoods for a weekend of sex and drugs. The five friends awaken the ferocious intruders by playing a tape-recording of weird incantations, which consists of recitations taken from the Sumerian ""Book of the dead"". As each character gets possessed, the gore-factor effectively rises. The build up of the outrageously organic violence leads to a humorously horrific climax in which the remaining zombies deteriorate (via clever stop-motion techniques devised by Tom Sullivan) and their organs emphatically explode. <br/><br/>With this film, Sam Raimi established his signature touches as a director: breakneck speed, kinetic action sequences and inventive camera angles. ""The Evil Dead"" is shot with a powerful flair, and it's mainly Raimi's directorial verve that elevates the film above it's mundane zombie contemporaries.

"pyrocitor","8","1","2","25 April 2009"," A clever blend of ironic cliché and straightforward, unsettling horror - well deserving its cult infamy
","There remains a perpetually unmistakable veneer to the sect of films known as ""cult hits"" - classics to certain select groups of people without being necessarily enjoyed or even known by a mass audience. It would be difficult to find a more fitting example than maverick director Sam Raimi's feature-length debut, The Evil Dead, decades before the Spider-Man films. In fact, apart from a vaguely distinctive style and cheeky humour, the two bookends of Raimi's career to date could hardly be more different on the surface: Spider-Man a mainstream, big budget action blockbuster and The Evil Dead a shoestring budget, schlocky horror comedy, tailored only really to appeal to a select fan base sharing a gruesome sense of humour. But most prevailing between the two, at the risk of delving into sentiment, is the passion and heart Raimi instils into each, regardless of their exterior trappings or financial investment. Despite being an ultimately small and unassuming film, The Evil Dead goes about its business in a remarkably self-assured and efficient fashion, just as fundamentally constructed to entertain as a certain friendly neighbourhood superhero. <br/><br/>Given the general association of such horror fare with a sense of ""so bad it's good"", it is easy to forget just how grimly effective Raimi's film is, or how much of a cornerstone for 'do-it- yourself' film-making and macabre special effects. Masking its microscopic budget with chilling use of a single forest location (decades before The Blair Witch Project), Raimi's film opts instead for horror atmosphere turned bludgeoning object, complete with a pounding dirge of an ominous musical score and frantic cinematography, zooming along the forest floor as if precipitating the tension to unbearable levels. Similarly, for all of its deliberately campy excesses, it becomes increasingly undeniable just how genuine a knack Raimi's film demonstrates for full-blown fright, with an overwhelmingly Gothic ambiance and eerily effective mastery of horror conventions, extracting surprising scares from even the most familiar of set-ups. Indeed, rather than trying to fight the inevitable onset of cliché, Raimi instead cheerily incorporates them into his film and simply uses them for his own purposes, a welcome synergy of time worn technique into an ultimately unique concoction. <br/><br/>Similarly, Raimi shows an innate awareness of viewer expectations as well as genre conventions, and gleefully takes pleasure in inverting just about everything which doesn't contribute to the continuous sense of creeping horror turned symphonic chillfest. Many sequences which should be terrifying are instead turned morbidly funny, many seemingly innocent sequences are twisted into being frightening, the film's sole romantic part is rendered completely un-romantic, and the fleeting moments of typical horror gratuitous sexual objectification are completely de-eroticized. However, Raimi appears equally determined to work in just about anything possible geared towards making his viewers squirm, and the film delivers in spades on the gruesome violence and disturbing gross-out effects front - no matter how intentionally campy and relatively cheaply they are done, the sheer gut reaction generated by them is the mark of a true genre pro.<br/><br/>The film also marks the breakthrough performance of soon to be B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, and his enormously enjoyable work in The Evil Dead demonstrates exactly why his popularity would subsequently rise so vastly. Campbell manages to encapsulate the tone of the movie within his performance alone: on the surface serious and slightly nerdy, but with a thinly veiled quirky and goofy sense of humour on the underbelly, managing to not only amplify the shudders and screams of the rest of the film but bring a very welcome comic charisma to it as well. The rest of the cast appear to be giving almost wilfully bland performances, making their subsequent encounters with the demonic exactly the sort of abrasive difference needed to infuse the picture with a true shock value. As such, while most of the actors may spend most of the picture doing nothing but screaming and howling, they do it with considerable energy and aplomb, as well as a slyly ironic sense of humour making their presence all the more appealing. <br/><br/>While likely too ironically cheesy, terrifying or wilfully gross to appeal to a mass demographic, The Evil Dead nonetheless merits its reputation as one of the defining early cinematic meldings of horror and comedy, as well as a foundational text for the school of schlocky, 'do-it-yourself' horror productions. Infamous in its cult success, the film marks a rare exception of living up to its hype, and should prove near essential viewing for any horror enthusiasts who have yet to experience it. <br/><br/>-8/10"

","The Evil Dead one of the best horror films ever made and another great example of how to make maximum impact on minimum budget. Plot and plausibility go out the window in favour of an atmospheric, disturbingly-amusing gore flick that doesn't shy away from anything and it made a cult icon of Bruce Campbell, who is great as Ash. What perhaps sets it apart is the brilliant way it was made, showcasing Raimi's talent for crazy visuals and frenetic camera-work and he also knows how to make effects. He definitely should have stuck to making virtuoso, inventive flicks like this rather than doing the flat, unconvincing Spiderman trilogy.<br/><br/>I can't believe the liberals labelled this film as 'The Number One Nasty' in the U.K. Video Nasties uproar in the 1980's. Not only does this seem amusing by today's standards but couldn't those goddamn backbenchers with PC values and a stiff-upper-lip appreciate a work of art rather than just judge a book by its cover. They didn't even see the thing for Christ's sake! The Evil Dead will always be at the top of the horror canon. It is a great work of surreal 80's body horror-adopting themes established in 70's exploitation flicks and Romero's Living Dead trilogy.<br/><br/>8/10"

"karlonsh","10","1","2","26 April 2007"," My Tip !
","""A classic of the genre you must have watched !"" One of the ""real horror/pictures"" in this world is Evil Dead. I mean, nearly all elements a good horror film has to proof, this one does. Something evil that you do not really see, except the ""Zombies"", a well thought concept, in which a bunch of ""adoliscenses"" want to stay a weekend in the nature and getting heated up by ""demons"". Stereotyped idea you might think, but if you do you're wrong on this one. Sam Rami's first work has reachedcult status from scratch and the legendary ""Book Of The Dead"", ""Necronomicon"", was ""animated"" pretty well to that time's conditions and budget (it was made of plasticine, goes without saying that !). Originally the Necronomicon is to thank to H.P. Lovecraft, because if he hadn't come with his horror novels in the 1920's - 1930's, I wouldn't know wheather Evil Dead could summon up such a story. By the way Evil Dead was Bruce Campbell's debut in a film and the figure this unobuious ""hero"" Ash, was impersonated very well by Mr. Campbell ! The remaining cast is good eighter such as the atmosphere in the film. And one more praise to the effects - and - mask makers of it, you've done incredible, guys ! I advice everybody to watch it and those who'll do should know, that the two sequelsare unless as good as the first, if not even better on the effects. Absolute recommendable, but only the uncut version. Greetings to everyone not - knowing me !"

As a filmmaker very few films inspire (particularly a horror film) you to really pursue your dreams. This film did that for me way back when and I am eternally grateful. Made on a shoestring, it's right up there with Blood Simple in terms of making it possible for a ""poor"" filmmaker to aspire to greatness. And, it's obviously not just a cheese-ball low budget-indie horror flick, it's one of the most ingenious hilarious, yet scary flicks to this day. Sam Rami has obviously gone on to bigger (and perhaps better) things since Evil Dead, but without it there would be no Spider Man, or A Simple Plan for his career. A great flick that really doesn't date."

"El_Rey_De_Movies","8","1","2","3 November 2005"," Never turn on an abandoned tape recorder!
","Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" movies are so different in the way sequels are structured that they really have to be reviewed together. Raimi made the original ""Evil Dead"" as an extremely low budget college project back in 1982 with the help of buddies Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell. But what he lacked in money he more than made up for with a dizzying array of camera tricks, homemade special effects, and sheer nerve and bravado. It's a very simple story: four friends rent an isolated cabin in the woods where they find the abandoned notes and tape recorder of an archaeologist who's discovered a book named the Necronomicon ex Mortis or Book of the Dead. When they play back the recorded notes that contain translated passages from the book, they unleash a horde of demons which they then spend the rest of the night fighting. Although there's an INCREDIBLE amount of karo syrup/blood thrown all over the place, what impresses you most about this is how much humor Raimi manages to inject into the proceedings. There's some scary stuff, but it's hard to take it seriously or get offended when the demons torture Bruce Campbell with an array of gags straight out of the Three Stooges. Even the monsters are credited as ""fake shemps"" in the credits! There are a couple of scenes that are creepy, both visually and aurally, which is a credit to how inventive Raimi was in setting up shots and designing the sound on a budget that wouldn't pay for the caterer in an Ah-nuld movie. The first ""Evil Dead"" is very obviously made by a young director who loved making movies and couldn't wait to strut his stuff in front of the entire world. It became a video hit here, so a sequel was announced. But Raimi, Tapert and Campbell pulled a fast one on their audience  instead of doing a straight continuation of the story like a normal sequel, they went back and basically remade the first ""Evil Dead"". The difference was that this time they had access to a much bigger budget that would allow Raimi to really push things completely over the top and watch them go splat when they hit the other side! There's more blood, more gore, and more monsters but this one is even sillier and funnier than the original. As I said earlier, it's basically the same story, reworked slightly. Two of the original characters were jettisoned so that Raimi could concentrate more on Campbell's performance  and that's the glue that really holds both movies together. Campbell transforms his character from a terrified and rather mousy little nerd to a chainsaw-wieldin', shotgun-totin', quip-spewin' Ramboesque action hero who proceeds to chop, shoot, kick and punch the crap out of each and every demon that confronts him  even after having to chop his own hand off because ""it went bad"". If you can't handle lots of fake blood and gore, this isn't the movie for you  but if you like your horror mixed with smart-assy humor and lots of visual flair then this one's for you, buddy."

It's not dull and blunt with the plot of just some dude killing people, but not too complex and in depth as the Exorcist. This also doesn't scar the sh*t out of you, but doesn't leave you not scared or nervous like the Grudge (which sucks, I have no idea why people like it).

It also contained one of THE great performances from, at the time, an unknown Bruce Campbell who went on to show how good he is in Evil Dead 2. Yes it was low budget, but the makers never tried to do too much with their limited resources, simply concentrating on scaring the living daylights out of the viewer.

","Please realize that I'm not trying to look down on this movie. It's a good movie, but it lacks a plot. That was my only real dilemma with this movie. The only thing that happens is the group listens to a tape that awakens the dead, then the forest (yes the forest) captures a girl and everything goes from bad to worse from there. But when it comes to horror movies Evil Dead shines as an original because it uses the ""Deadites"" a type of evil dead zombie that's actually kinda smart. The Deadites are obsessed with eating souls. I have to say that I was surprised at the amount of gore used in this, but that's probably because I saw AoD first. Out of the three movies (Evil Dead, ED2:Dead by Dawn, AoD) this one has the most ""no non-sense"" feel to it, it has a much deeper fixation on horror than the other two which mixed comedy elements into them. Horror fans are sure to get a kick out of this as it is a really great horror movie (it's a really great horror series). I recommend it to horror fans who don't need a deep story to get their fix and gore fans because some of this is beautifully brutal."

Ashly (Bruce Campbell), Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Scott (Hal Delrich), Linda (Betsy Baker) and Shelly (Sarah York) originally had in mind a quiet, relaxing weekend away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, but their tranquil vacation immediately comes to an end when strange goings on begin to occur both inside and outside of the house.

Eyeballs being squashed? To describe 'The Evil Dead' as ""gory"" would be a severe understatement, as director Sam Raimi seems to have no qualms about thrusting the audience right into the bloody, cringe-inducing mayhem that makes up the second half of this, his first feature film. And yet, believe it or not, the term ""gory"" is something of a misnomer when applied to 'The Evil Dead', as it usually has the habit of implying that the film it is describing has little going for it besides blood-splattered carnage and over-the-top set pieces. The controversy surrounding the content of the film is understandable, as some scenes are sure to induce physical nausea for those who watch them. But what Sam Raimi has created with 'Evil Dead' is much more than that; it's a constantly disturbing film that shakes up the senses, and it rarely goes out of its way to cause a stir.<br/><br/>~ 8/10 ~"
"Howlin Wolf","9","1","2","12 March 2005"," At the time, it mixed old and new shock tactics to stunning effect!
","If you're a young, talented and ambitious film-maker; how to get people's attention? Well, horror's always a reliable genre in which to make your first big 'splash'; being as it doesn't have to be entirely dependant on 'flashy' effects, if you're on a tight budget. Some 'innovative' camera-work always goes down nicely, too. (how many subsequent films have copied John Carpenter's ingenious 'edge-of-frame' technique in ""Halloween"", for example?) Oh yeah, getting your film banned at least helps in the 'notoriety' stakes, too; so often as it is the clinching factor in persuading otherwise indifferent audience members to have a look and see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>... all requirements eagerly met by the joyful enterprise known as ""The Evil Dead""! There's plenty of the traditional spooky music and dark foreboding spaces, but brought to the table for the first time in 1981 were audacious camera moves and a no-holds-barred approach to piling on the gore! I'm sure it felt fresh in its early days of release, and surprisingly, it still feels fresh today. This is 'Grand Guignol' horror that has no time to linger in admiration over its gruesome handiwork, due to its breakneck pace. I'm now prepared to forgive Raimi the first film of his that I saw, (""Darkman"") thanks to the fun I had watching this. Little details make me eagerly await the chance to catch the other two entries, also - the first minor cameo from the 'chainsaw', for example! It's a simple plot - basically just watching Bruce Campbell slay the ranks of the undead - and even the OTT nature of what's gone before is stretched by the 'Claymation'-like explosions of the finale; but such largely irrelevant quibbles are almost wholly redeemed by the unforgettable nature of the last shot. It's best to experience that for yourself; but bear in mind when you watch that you're seeing elements that have since become mainstays of every notable scarefest within the last 20 years. Was LOTR director and future Oscar winner Peter Jackson taking notes prior to making ""Bad Taste"", for instance? You bet!"
"Ithaqua1987","10","1","2","17 December 2004"," The Evil Dead
","The Evil Dead is one of the most imaginative and fun horror movies ever made. You can really tell that Sam Raimi and co. had a blast making this movie as the enthusiasm (along with the blood) pretty much drips down the screen. Hearing all the wild stories about the film's production is as fun and interesting as watching the movie itself. This movie introduced Bruce Campbell and his ""Ash"" character to the world and pop culture would never be the same again. Bruce is probably the best actor out of the bunch, but that really doesn't say much since the acting is pretty much atrocious. The wild and inventive camera-work and editing make up for it though. The special effects hold up surprisingly well and the filmmakers get extra points from me for creativity. No CGI here folks, this is down and dirty film-making at its best. Probably my personal favorite horror movie of all time this movie has an essential ingredient that most of today's mundane horror movies are missing,.............style."
"insomniac_rod","Null","1","2","7 November 2004"," Sam Raimi's deal with The Devil.
","Did Sam Raimi sold his soul in order to have a successful b-horror movie? Did The Devil asked for recognition and display of his power in order to give Raimi the winning formula?<br/><br/>The ""Evil Dead"" is not an easy watch. The movie starts like a standard early 80's slasher flick but after half an hour of it's running time it turns into a bizarre gore-fest.<br/><br/>Five friends (minimal stereotypes) rent a cheap cabin in the woods for some fun but suddenly, one by one they get possessed by an ancient evil spirit that rests in the woods. The plot sounds typical for the 80's horror but believe me, it's something you haven't seen! This movie is recognized internationally. I'm sure that the movie has been translated in many languages. Everyone knows about it. In my country, MÃ¨xico, the title translation is ""The Devil's Awaken"" or something like that. This is now more than an obscure cult classic, it's THE EVIL DEAD.<br/><br/>Adding the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) into an early 80's slasher flick sounds a little pretentious but it isn't. It worked perfectly.<br/><br/>The idea was totally asked for. The whole demon possession is believable because of the Necronomicon idea. In my opinion, since the brilliant ""Exorcist"" (the first big budget movie about demon possession), none other movie has had the adequate treatment of the topic like ""The Evil Dead"". People that know a little of demon possession, evil incantations, treats with the devil (or selling your soul to him), and these kind of topics related to the occultism can tell that ""The Evil Dead"" is a movie that knows exactly what it's showing. The make-up (somehow related to ""The Exorcist"") is excellent. Descriptions about possessed people actually match with the characterization used in the movie. The voices, the wicked laughs, the goofy evil spirits, the supernatural physical strenght, and the behavior that the movie shows is a display of what happens in real life cases. I wonder if Raimi was into Satanic stuff...<br/><br/>Anyways, the weirdness of the situations combined with lots of gore makes this a unique cinematic experience. There are elements of horror from the 70's and the basic elements of the 80's all mixed up with Raimi's horror point of view. The black humor is present indirectly mainly because of the grotesque images that not everybody's imagination could craft. Still, there's nothing to laugh about if you're a die hard horror fan. If you want to laugh and watch an extremely gory film them watch the sequel to ""The Evil Dead"". <br/><br/>Bruce Campbell delivers a terrific performance under situations that you can't imagine. His face expressions, his yelling, and the torment expressed on his eyes, are the elements that make an unforgotten performance. The rest of the actors deliver a decent performance mainly because their acting skills were not needed at all.<br/><br/>The scare factor is ALWAYS present through the movie and that's why it's difficult to label this as a straight horror movie or as a cheesy slasher flick. The tension is present in every scene and the usual but effective scenes that make you ""jump out of your seat"" work pretty good. The truth is that the movie works in EVERY field that the horror genre can offer. There's gore in huge amounts, there's tension, suspense, and the feeling of horror that not much films can offer. <br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" contributed with several scenes to the genre and nowadays are labeled as infamous. For example, the pencil stabbed in the ankle, the demon in the cellar, the demons mocking, the possessed people, and the creepy but effective ""join us"" voices. The possessed Linda still gives me the creeps. Because of these elements and more , ""The Evil Dead"" is a cult classic and an important and basic movie in the genre. I wouldn't match this movie with ""The Exorcist"" but I would match it in a special category, the ""Evil Dead"" category. The trilogy (1, 2, and Army of Darkness) is a key franchise in the genre and will always be a reference for ANY horror producer. This franchise stands alone and deserves a lot of respect for it's contributions to the genre and to the industry! The Devil hasn't been very accepted in the genre but this time he looks ""cool"". <br/><br/>Anyone that has watched the movie MUST have an opinion about it; you either love it or hate it but if you're into the genre you will certainly have an objective review about it. I love this movie for what it is and I can say it changed my life and my point of view towards horror movies. <br/><br/>You need to watch the movie at least 2 times to understand and live to it's full this gory experience. It's a horror movie you will never forget and believe me, it will stay with you for a long, long time. The demonic images, sounds, violent images, and of course, Bruce Campbell will hunt you until you become a die hard fan of the movie. This is a fantastic horror movie with fantasy elements, disturbing elements, and the occasional correct use of gore. What else can you ask for?!<br/><br/>Watch it for a good scare and you will get MORE than you expect. Probably the best horror from the 80's, no kidding. Also, it's probably in the top 10 of the best horror movies of all time.<br/><br/>10/10. It's contribution to the genre raises it's perfect grade. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HORROR FAN!!!"
"roy-nicholas33","9","1","2","7 November 2004"," Groovy
","I bought the uncut version of The Evil Dead on DVD two years ago, The Anchor bay version, What an ace movie this is! <br/><br/>Sam Raimi who directed this fine crafted movie made a big name for himself in the horror world when he followed The Evil Dead up with a bigger budget Dead by dawn sequel and the later Med-evil dead, Which i still laugh at today.<br/><br/>I own all three movies on special edition DVDs. The Med-evil dead is my favorite (if you watch when Bruce Campbell is being chased through the woods before the windmill, You will see three trees split open. The last tree to split open has the face of a demon on the inside side of the tree!)But at its time The Evil Dead was ground breaking stuff on a shoe string budget.<br/><br/>The movie was originally completed in 1980 but was not released until 1983 as the movie ran over budget and could not be completed. But determination prevailed and Mr. Raimi became a cult horror name!<br/><br/>My verdict 8/10 Highly Recommended if you have never seen a splatter movie before."
"MightyAlz","8","1","2","1 November 2004"," Good, Not-so-clean Fun, but not as violent as it is hyped.
","When you go to see this film, do not expect it to be the most violent film ever made. It was made on a budget of $90,000 resulting in fake-looking gore. Most of the violence is also too comical and over the top to be taken seriously. However, as an example of how to make low-budget horror movies, this is one of the best. Featuring innovative camerwork, a creepy atmoshpere and a sinister soundtrack, the Evil Dead can either be watched to frighten you or just for the fun of watching Demons being hacked to pieces. It is not, however, as violent as George A. Romero's living dead trilogy."

","Evil Dead is a film not for people with weak stomachs. As it is very gruesome and grisly. But it has a great story,good characters,and a great lead in Bruce Campbell as Ash. Five friends go to a cabin,where they find a recording of a few passages of the Book of the Dead. It resurrects flesh possesing demons,who take over the bodies of Ash's friends. Ash must brutally dispatch them all. The film is very scary. It has some jump out of your seat moments.

Why, oh WHY did I insist on buying this movie? As if the tree rape scene wasn't bad enough, you've got a giggling zombie who talks in sing-song (""we're gonna get you...""). And, don't even get me started on Bruce Campbell's acting. Oh, and who could forget the gloppy oatmeal / creamed corn looking melted zombie flesh? The Wicked Witch was more convincing when SHE melted! And people put this on a pedestal? It is laughable.

","Five friends go to a remote cabin and find themselves in the middle of a haunted forest surrounded by mysterious evil forces. Director Sam Raimi, operating on a super-low budget of approx. $300,000, makes a movie that is intense, gut-wrenching and, in a sense, innovative despite the familiar premise. Sure, one can admit that the acting and the gore can be a bit over-the-top.  Heck, even the special effects really pale in comparison to other films in the genre. But one can't deny the creativity that Raimi has put into his film.  This creative sense of the film more than makes up for its miniscule budget.

"LauraH2477","Null","1","2","22 November 2003"," One of the best horror films ever
","This is not a movie you need to watch if you have been raised on ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" type horror films. No, this film is for people who grew up watching the films that ""Scream"", ""IKWYDLS"", etc., got their ideas from. <br/><br/>  It's a low-budget 1980's cult classic because it's full of originality, humor, and genuinely scary, sick moments, it never takes itself seriously and neither should the viewer. It intends to scare you, make you laugh, cringe, and even gag at times, and it succeeds in these areas admirably despite its budget and its numerous flaws. Keep in mind that it was made by college students who, in spite of being amateurs, put their best efforts into it. They did a great job and as a result the film is dear to my heart and to many other people who have seen it time and again over the years.<br/><br/>
  If you can't relax and enjoy a horror film because you're expecting ""Sixth Sense"" type mind games (not knocking ""Sixth Sense"", though, it was excellent), then you are also among the folks who should avoid this one, since there is nothing subtle or thought-provoking about it. It's in your face from the start and isn't the slightest bit ashamed of it, but it's done in a very friendly, tongue-in-cheek way. People should just sit back, relax, make fun of the mistakes and bad acting, and enjoy the scares, which are many. A great party flick."

","What can be said that hasen't been said already of this movie?  It is the most original, and truly frightening movies I have ever seen.  Having had the luxury of having seen ""The Evil Dead"" in the theater with ED enthusiests and on the small screen, I can say that this film works well in both formats. Made on a shoe-string budget of around $350,000 dollars made by Sam, Bruce and Rob from showing thier short film ""Within the Woods"", the effects are cheesy but are still very well done. The camera angles, lighting, matte composite shots and sound work harmoniously together to create a truly special film which boils down to one man fighting off his recently turned zombie-esque friends in a cabin, all alone in the woods. True, the acting is a little stiff, but keep in mind that Bruce Campbell was only 21 when they shot it in 1979-1980. All of the great props of movie history are in the film such as the 1972 Oldsmobile 88 Supreme, the axe, the out of sequence costuming of artificial blood on the face and clothing, bookcases, mysterious dissappearing floodlights on the cabin roof, and a shovel to name a few.<br/><br/>If you'd like a good scare and a little bit of laughter, get this film, turn off the lights, light a fire in the fireplace and settle in."

This film is a prime example of a low-budget causing the filmmakers to become more creative.

This shack had no running water and the washroom was an outhouse, the shack itself consisted of a kitchen, family room and 2 bedrooms.  While I watched this movie I was horrified, but it was the long lasting effect that it had on me that was the worst.  I had nightmares for almost ten years, never being able to get the image of the deadite girl sitting on the floor, chanting ""We're going to get you"", out of my head.  I am 21 now and I still get scared watching Evil Dead to this day, and my fiancee refuses to watch it because she can't get to sleep that night if she does.  This is the effect that The Evil Dead has on people, and that is the reason that it is the greatest horror movie ever made.

"Fractalizer","7","1","2","17 March 2002"," Genre Defining Classic
","Evil Dead got banned in Germany in 1985. This probably contributed a lot to its infamous reputation it enjoyed here during the second half of the 80s. Among teenagers it was _the_ movie to bring to a party and devide the guests into those who were ""brave"" enough to watch it and those who weren't.<br/><br/>I remember one such party, I think it was 1990 already, were the movie was playing. I caught only about half of it (not including the gorier scenes at the end) because I was too busy experimenting with other stuff you tend to be very much interested in at the age of 16 (won't tell whether it was sex or drugs)... or maybe I just wasn't brave enough?<br/><br/>Anyway, time moved on, the ban on the film was lifted in 1991, and you can now rent and buy it on DVD in various incarnations. So, I rented the ""full uncut"" UK release (PAL, Code 2, 86 min).<br/><br/>OK, the violence in this picture is excessive but presented in a slapstick/comic book manner that makes it easily watchable. Acting is as bad as everyone is saying, but still it's hard to not like Bruce Campbells performance.<br/><br/>I also liked the much acclaimed camera work. From the first minute on camera angles and movements are used to create suspense and the sense of some immaterial threat lurking in the woods.<br/><br/>There are other very nicely done low-budget effects such as a mirror liquefying when one of the characters tries to touch it, which curiously reminded me of similar scene in The Matrix (done in CGI) that alone probably cost about as much as the complete Evil Dead.<br/><br/>I'm not sure though whether, after 20 years, this movie is still scary. The Sixth Sense, for example, scared me much more (don't laugh).<br/><br/>Still I guess it is a must-see for any fan of the genre. It is wonderfully campy and bits of it actually can pass as rather smart filmmaking, especially considering the highly limited budget.<br/><br/>7/10 (this includes a bonus point for being the influential cult classic it is)"
"poe426","10","1","2","15 January 2002"," EQUINOX redux...
","EQUINOX (1971) is a creepy, almost documentary-like low budget fright film that begins with four college kids going out into the mountains for a picnic. They stumble across an imploded cabin (the home of a professor, played by the late fantasist Fritz Leiber) and find a book whose pages are made of human skin. If our intrepid quartet can't keep the book from falling into the wrong hands, there'll be, well, Hell to pay...<br/><br/>
EQUINOX appears to have inspired Sam Raimi's fright-fest, THE EVIL DEAD: the parallels are, uh, Legion... But, whereas EQUINOX (available for years on video tape under the oddball title, THE BEAST) features towering, ape-like split-screen creatures, stop-motion animation, and forced perspective shots of ancient castles and the like, THE EVIL DEAD relies primarily on some extremely effective makeup fx. THE EVIL DEAD is intense, and there certainly are some shocking scenes, but the series began to slide into self-parody with the second installment (which I liked, nonetheless), and finally into outright cornball slapstick humor of the Three Stooges variety. It's a shame Raimi didn't stay the course: there are few enough ""legit"" fright films as it is; by opting for the dim-witted kiddie crowd, Raimi denies us a series that might well have rivalled George Romero's Living Dead trilogy in terms of sheer terror."

"eibon09","Null","1","2","18 July 2001"," Excellent Low Budget Horror
","The Most Serious of the three films in the popular horror trilogy.  For the most part a grim and straight forward horror picture.  Not bombarded with the unnecessary slapstick comedy that plagues Evil Dead 2(1987) and The Army of Darkness(1991).  Better and more scary because of its serious tone.  The Evil Dead(1982) was an innovative horror feature of the 1980s.<br/><br/>
In my opinion its the best of the Evil Dead trilogy.  Has more pure horror than the sequels.  Ash is not portrayed like a member of the Three Stooges as in the following films.  Evil Dead(1982) is excellent in its atmospheric aura and fast moving cinematography.  Evil Dead(1982) also contains the coolest gore scenes in the entire trilogy.<br/><br/>
The POV shots are used with such innovative bravado and technical efficiency.  The POV shots are in the manner of Dario Argento.  One of the first to use the shaky Cam effect.  The use of POV in Evil Dead would influence a number of film directors.  Sam Raimi is the best American filmmaker when it comes to POV shots.<br/><br/>
Ash in the first Evil Dead is a tragic figure.  Here he is a far cry from the clumsy Comedic heroic figure of Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn(1987) and Army of Darkness(1991).  Ash in Evil Dead(1982) is tormented by the loss of his friends and girlfriend.  Ash is pretty much patterened after the main character of Sammo Hung's Encounters of the Spooky Kind(1980). Ash is a simpleton who fights to survive against the demons that possess his friends.<br/><br/>
One of the best elements of this movie is the subplot involving Ash and his girlfriend, Linda.  Its this element as well as others that makes  The Evil Dead(1982) my favorite of the trilogy.  Bruce Campbell and Betsy Baker are wonderful in the scenes they do together.  Its heartbreaking and sad to see Ash dismember and kill a woman he loved so much.  The sequence where Ash gives Linda the necklace is one of the movie's lighter moments.<br/><br/>
The humor is blended into the horror scenes without being overly ridculous. Evil Dead(1982) is full of dark humor that is both funny and scary.  Mixing horror and humor is a tricky thing to pull off because there has to be a balance for the combo to work.  The Evil Dead(1982) is successful in combining the two.  Fun to watch horror with humor as opposed to humor with horror.<br/><br/>
Notorious for the rape in the woods scene, Evil Dead(1982) becomes a daring picture at this point of the film.  Scene like this separates the first from the next two as a masterful horror pic.  Ellen Sandweiss is very brave in going through with this scene.  A terrifying sequence to observe and watch. Sam Raimi reuses this scene in Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn(1987) without the absolute viciousness of the one here.<br/><br/>
The gore here is fantasticly shown.  For a low budget film the make up effects are impressive.  Was not popular with the MPPA because of the extreme color used to portray blood.  The filmmakers use a stylish and crude appoarch to make the gore scenes work.  Joel Coen must have learned something about filming gore scenes from Evil Dead(1982) when he directed Blood Simple(1985).<br/><br/>
The original title of Evil Dead(1982) was Book of the Dead.  The book and many ot the film's themes derieve from the horror and scifi stories of H.P. Lovecraft.  The big influence for Evil Dead(1982) was an early 1970s horror flick known as Equinox(1971).  An early movie Joel Coen worked on before going on to become a major director and do films like Blood Simple(1985), Miller's Crossing(1991), and Fargo(1996).  Shares many ideas with the Sammo Hung kung Fu horror pic, Spooky Encxounters(1980).<br/><br/>
Some fabulous cinematography are used in most of the films' best scenes. Sam Raimi shows his talent in directing Evil Dead(1982) with his hyperkentic style.  Some areas of Evil Dead(1982) reminds me of the Lucio Fulci films from the early 80s, especially The Beyond(1981).  One of ten terrific horror features that came out in the 1980s.  Many have tried to copy the style of this movie and most have failed."

","I've read many criticisms of this film which state that the first twenty or so minutes of the film are the best. I could not disagree more. Once the actors stop trying to act as if they are relating to one another, and start chopping each other up, it all gets much better. The best part of The Evil Dead is that, unlike the second and especially the third episode in the series, it can be taken seriously. In fact, it is a lot more enjoyable if you take the film seriously and try to imagine how Ash is feeling when stuck in a cabin with only a pair of Deadites for company.<br/><br/>The makers of The Blair Witch Horsedung could have learned a lot about low-budget horror film making if they had taken the time to sit and watch this film. Real horror comes from being able to relate to the characters (is there anyone who didn't feel a certain revolted confusion when Scotty chopped up Shelly with an axe? thought not...), not from false claims passed off as publicity and shaking the camera so much that the viewers have a headache afterwards. Granted, the acting from most of the players in this film is just as bad, and the special effects are almost as non-existent, but moments like when a possessed Cheryl begins laughing as she is locked in the fruit cellar show that if you spend enough time and energy building an atmosphere in a horror film of any budget, the splatter you show for the rest of the film will be much more effective.<br/><br/>(seriously revealing plot information ahead, don't read past this point if you haven't seen the film)<br/><br/>A case in point is the moment where the book is thrown into the fireplace, and the two remaining Deadites suddenly stop in their tracks. I didn't know whether to throw up or laugh when I first saw them falling and rotting apart (I suspect I did both at one stage, as I first saw the film a long, long time ago). As both bodies rot away into pools of goo, we don't see any explosions or other such dramatic poise as we do in films like Final Destination. Instead, we simply hear a disembodied voice that Darth Vader would find impressive calling to Ash: ""Join us... join us..."", and then we see Ash walking out of the cabin as another disembodied spirit comes after him. A million times more effective than any of the ""oh, look at those scary funny twigs"" moments in Blair Christian Propaganda could ever hope for.<br/><br/>In other words, anyone who hasn't seen this film has not seen what a real triumph of low-budget horror filmmaking looks like. The first sequel is a nice adjunct to the film, but forget about Evil Dead III completely. In my rulebook, if a sequel is made to an intense piece like Robocop or The Evil Dead, and it fails to recieve an MA or R rating from the Australian Office Of Film And Literature Classification, it is not the genuine article."

The acting is not so great either, but the directing and the idea are what steal the show.  And, you have to see the ending.

","This movie is with out a shadow of doubt the most terrifying movie of all time. Sam Raimi has done not just good job on creating this movie and indeed the whole trilogy but a record-breaking attempt at making a horror movie. Sure many will say that this honour should go to movies such as the Exorcist. But really what does that movie have to offer that is scary. A head spinning round that's about all and even that does not amaze. If this movie were released once again at the cinema, it would do very well indeed. Even now you have got the game hitting the Dreamcast this year (evil dead: hail to the king). I have not seen this movie in about 5 years and still I can remember every second of it.

","Here's another movie that definitely has viewers give black or white opinions. You either love it or you hate it. Exceptions not counted, my guess is: if you're not a true horror fan, you'll absolutely despise this brilliant piece of film. It's understandable because if you're not to it, the constant terror, haunting sound effects, scary photography (from the forest creature's point of view), and bathtubs full of blood and other gore that occupy the screen for 75% of the duration will put you off if not sicken you beyond belief. But if you would manage to see beyond that, you'd see the incredible talent of Sam Raimi, the director. The vision, the way of shooting the movie, the choice of sound effects, are examples of a great new master at work. <br/><br/>The special effects are low budget, yes, but once again to all the people who complained, THIS WAS A LOW BUDGET FILM! You can't buy a Mercedes with minimum wage. And however ""bad"" the effects may have been, they were still effective and at times pretty scary. Just watch this movie alone in the dark late at night and you'll see.<br/><br/>When i first saw this movie i was shocked at the gore displayed in this film, and although less so, still am today. With the exception of certain zombie films, especially the brilliant ""Brain dead"", there has yet to be a horror movie making this attempt to gross you out. <br/><br/>Another thing which made me give this milestone of horror a perfect 10 is that there's some dark humor, but just enough to not get in the way of the shocks it's trying hand out."

That is why you get even more horrofied when something runs up at him from behind. **End of spoiler, keep reading** The movie is very caotic, but realistic enough to think that it is scary.

"very_doubtful","10","1","2","23 March 2000"," 50'000 $? How did they do that?(!IF YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW ABOUT THE STORY SKIP THIS REVIEW!)
","Evil Dead is by far the most frightening horror film I have ever seen and I can't imagine how any film could possibly top it. The budget (50'000 $) is laughable because the film contains so many effects that it is almost unbelievable it was done on such a small budget. The actors and actresses did a decent job (at a salary of 100$ a week) although they weren't experienced at all. Sam Raimi's direction is absolutely outstanding, maybe the best ever seen in an American film.<br/><br/>The story is about five students who go to a cabin in the woods. They find a tape with the voice of a professor trying to translate the ""Necronomicon"", the Book of the Dead. By playing the tape the students unleash the evil power that lives within the woods. Gradually they are turned into blood-thirsty zombies until there's only one of them left. Ash (Bruce Campbell) now has to fight not only his former friends but also the evil that is trying to get him too.<br/><br/>The film is ultra-horrifying and ultra-violent. It is a masterpiece of horror and will probably scare you out of your wits if you see it for the first time. But it is also very inventive and adds some entirely new elements to the horror genre. Truly ""the ultimate experience in grueling horror""!<br/><br/>Along with ""Halloween"" this is my favored horror film!<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 (The sequels are very good and also very different from this one)"

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","2","7","14 January 2006"," A worthy contender for 'greatest horror film ever'
","I don't know why it took so long for me to watch this film... I think it's the fact that I've always been told that it's a gore-fest and not really anything else. I can tell you now; I have been grossly misinformed. This is one of those films that everyone who's into the genre should see. If you as much as 'like' horror, you should see this film. Look past the less-than-stellar acting, the dubious dialog and the thin character writing, and you will see one of the greatest horror films ever created. The plot is hardly worth mentioning. The pacing is top-notch, you're not bored for a second through the entire film. Not one second, throughout the whole film. Seriously. The acting is mostly unimpressive. The characters are daftly written, and so hard to tell apart due to vague personalities that I was never completely certain how many men or women there were, or who was who(well, apart from Campbell as Ash, but his face is a pretty recognizable one). The dialog, as mentioned earlier, is quite dubious. Just about all characters(including the demons/Evil Dead, in-between moans and 'join us') get at least one really bad line. Delivery isn't exactly perfect, either. The effects, though some cheap and a few outdated(but not noticeably so; none of them looked fake or were easy to figure out) are very good. The real strength in this film, however, is the buildup to the horror and the editing. The way ""The Evil"", this unseen, abstract force of true evil is hinted at through the film... impossibly effective. The POV shots originating from said force are incredibly creepy. The editing is tight and excellent. The cinematography is by far some of the best I have seen in my entire life. A few shots were off, but there is no doubt that Raimi knows exactly where to put the camera or how to move it, even when he doesn't have the money to get a hold of expensive rigs. Now, as mentioned earlier, many have told me that this is a gore-fest... while everything I have put in my review up to this point still stands, let me make one thing clear; there is plenty of gore in this film. For better or for worse. Plenty. Limbs are torn off, bodies are maimed and blood is dripping by the truckloads. However, even if you don't like gore, if you don't care for blood and violence, you should watch this film... if you are into horror and you can take the gore(which is graphic and intense, make no mistake about that), you should definitely watch this film. One to watch for everyone who is into horror. I recommend this film to every horror fan who believes he can stand the violence and gore, and to everyone who is into both horror and gore... you've probably already seen this film, but if you haven't, go do so now. You won't regret it. 10/10"

","I don't know why some people think that this is an interesting movie. First of all, the demonic forces don't throw things around or cant make the dead alive. this is stupid. If you wanna see real horror watch exorcism of Emily rose and try to compare the two. In E.O.E.Rose the horror is created just with the superb acting and dialogs. there is no one vomiting colorful liquid, blood all around or trees raping people.<br/><br/>Has anyone ever felt scared in real life? In real life the horror comes from our feelings inside that cause us to perceive the ordinary things around us in a different way than normal. Demonic forces just use these inside feelings and scare the possessed ones make them act insane. sometimes give them knowledge which may be good or bad. but NEVER can they make person do things which are physically impossible.People who are possessed (and there are very few most of them are psychotics) cant so things like flying around or other wonderful feats. Trees, bushes never rape people.<br/><br/>I like films where horror is created without showing the things that can never happen in real life."

"Foreverisacastironmess123","10","1","3","31 October 2017"," ""We can't bury Shelly, she's a friend of ours!""
","When I first ever watched this, I was just left kind of bewildered and queasy-headed because the endless barrage of over the top screaming and chaotic action was a bit overwhelming, it was quite the ""gruelling"" experience indeed.. But on subsequent viewings years later I really grew to love this movie and appreciate its place in cinematic horror history as an important landmark of which the influence has been quite profound and it's among my favourites now. It just has a lot of what I personally tend to go for in a good fun horror movie; it's fast and doesn't stop once it really gets going, it's has loads or rich eerie little touches and is brimming with the most fantastic classically scary atmosphere, I mean being set in a secluded cabin in the desolate woods in the middle of nowhere on a dark and stormy night, it's got one of the best kinds of atmospheres that a horror fan could wish for, and that cabin and those woods were a perfect setting as well as a pitch-perfect setup for when the really crazy demonic s**t starts to go down. All of that stuff is incredibly well established and built up before it actually starts to happen. It has characters that you actually feel for a little, Eileen Sandweiss' rising hysterics as Shelly who somehow can sense that they've unleashed something terrible upon themselves by hearing the incantation is very effective until she's the first to get possessed, and Bruce Campbell was so young and wet around the ears, the Ash in this is a bit of a wimp until he starts trying to fight back after he gets put through he wringer, and boy does he ever! It also has a lot of over the top splatter gore especially at the end when everything's all crooked and he gets hosed down by the blood pipe and the projector turns red and explodes, all the gore is used really well. You can tell it's a low budget picture but it just works such wonders with the mood and camera-work that the grunginess and bare-bones aspect of it just adds to the overall feel, and like with a lot of the cult horror classics from back in the day, the quality and charm shines through the dingy cracks and it all works out so amazingly well despite itself. Again once it starts rolling and they're all completely f****d after hearing the tape recorder's forbidden words of certain doom, it becomes a real ride into madness and terror, but it also always has a good sense of fun about it too somehow, people die and get dismembered but it never comes off as too much of a sickening horror movie, with the possible exception of THAT scene! In the exuberance of its more lively moments there's a certain subtle knowing goofiness there. But it's still way more of a serious horror movie than the second and third movies, and I personally think it's better than them for that. The possessed are so cool, I love how automatically demented and vicious they are, far from being mere angry unquiet spirits, these vile entities really do seem like utterly insane toxic dead souls from some unimaginable nether-hell who's only care is spreading death and destruction! My favourite malicious corpse is Linda, her giggling and clown-like facial distortions are so creepy and in comparison to the other demon zombies which are mostly mindlessly violent she/it is more a jovial sort who is so happy to be among the corporeal once again after an eternity of ancient slumber, although when push comes to shove she's just as bloodthirsty! I love the explosive use of stop motion effects work used in the climax as the demons dissolve into green putrescence as the dreaded book burns. It does look crude and even kind of s**tty, but is still more importantly an awesome blast at the same time, not unlike the movie as a whole really! This movie is to this day such a glorious horror romp and it still has the same raw visceral and spooky macabre magic that deservedly made it into a beloved classic, one that is positively to die for!

"andrewnmiller","10","1","3","16 July 2017"," A landmark for horror movies.
","Now, I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies, so when I sat down to view the first Evil Dead movie, I didn't know if I would even like a film about scary things in the woods, demon possession and a B-list actor, but much like a lot of movies I've watched, Evil Dead totally surprised me with it's use of atmosphere, horror, music and of course Bruce Campbell. After viewing this, it's become one of my favorite horror films period.<br/><br/>The film starts with five collage students heading to a remote cabin in rural Tennessee for a vacation. While there, one of the kids hears a feeble satanic voice calling her to join them then her hand becomes controlled and she draws a book with an evil face on it but isn't sure what to do about it, so she doesn't mention it to any of the others. Later on, the door to the cellar strangely opens, compelling two of the kids to venture down and examine it, while down there, they find a Sumerian chronicle of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. While listening to a tape recorder that was found with the book, the voice of the archaeologist a cycle of chants that awaken a strange devilish creature that possesses one of the students. Now it's up to a remaining students to battle the entity while trying to not get possessed themselves and keeping their sanity.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi was able to take a budget of 350,000 dollars that would seem small compared to the Hammer horror movies and has given us a truly great horror film that wears it's rating like a token of integrity and shows no mercy or takes no hostages. Evil Dead is still a film that is able to hold it's own despite the film being branded a ""video nasty"" over in the UK due to the overabundance of gore and blood, and yet one can't disagree how much influence Evil Dead had on the horror film genre, and while it's not difficult to view things in the movie like trailing shots, the extreme amounts of carnage and the house in the forest location and call it noticeable and quintessential, it's easy to overlook that all of these clichés that have become so associated with horror films over the last few decades arose because of this movie and while that's not to say that the movie isn't silly or over-the-top because it certainly shows that, it's equally amazing when you are aware of the confines the movie was filmed under.<br/><br/>Sam's camera work here is nothing short of perfect. By means of rapid camera work and forceful shots, he made a creepy world which is difficult to stare at but too thrilling to not glace at and his way of filming is distinctive which is apparent in the opening scene where the camera produces so much ambiance to make the viewer start nibbling their nails in anxiety of what will happen next. It's one of the best opening shots in film history and dripping with atmosphere. Another incredible shot is when the shadows from the trees begin to pursue the characters and are hitting everything in their path, truly one of the best sequences in any horror movie.<br/><br/>Even with it's small price tag, the movie is astonishingly polished on a technological stage, and while the visual effects do come across as outdated and ridiculous, they were made on the cheap when set side by side with modern blockbusters and yet I haven't seen any major Hollywood movie where demons fall apart both externally and internally, bits of body tissue drying up, skulls blowing up, blood spewing everywhere, demons gnawing their hands off and faces rattled with shotgun ammo like darts on a dartboard. The film also works because of it's own self-awareness of that fact that it's a low-budget zombie picture, and yet doesn't take itself very seriously and doesn't think the viewer should either. The film is supposed to be a little on the campy and cheesy side and yet scary and haunting at the same time and there are times in the movie is poking fun at itself and the horror genre too.<br/><br/>Of course, a great horror movies are nothing without great characters and the actors who bring them to life and Evil Dead has the best of both. Ellen Sandwess might be dull-looking but she still does well in the part particularly when she gets taken over by a demon. Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, and Sarah York all play their parts well, but the reason to watch this movie is for Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams. Bruce was born to play this role and he isn't played up as the clichéd Hollywood strong man or the James Bond type hero, but rather playing a regular man who is just as scared as the viewer at what's going on around him. His performance in this movie is what has made him such a hero amongst the cult movie crowd. Bruce portrays the character of Ash with such a comedic brilliance and yet is incredibly benevolent, rather than the toughed bad-ass that we see him become in the second and third movies, while oozing swagger and charisma with unquestionable bravado. His growth as a character is also well done here where Ash starts out as a timid coward and as the film moves along, he becomes a shotgun-holding demon killer by the end. Simply put, Bruce Campbell will always be Ash, no questions asked.<br/><br/>Honestly, there really isn't much else I can add to what has already been said about The Evil Dead. It's a timeless horror classic that broke a lot of new ground for the genre which continues to be felt to this day, so if you haven't already seen this, then go out and watch it, you won't regret it!"

","The Evil Dead is one of the most interesting and unique Horror movies ever. It spawned the career of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and a whole franchise that followed it's huge success.<br/><br/>It was made on almost no budget and simply self made inside a real abandonment cabin in the woods. The gore and make up is self made, they had no stunt people for the action scenes and no money for better equipment, but hell it works incredibly well!<br/><br/>It's astonishing how good this movie is, for some reason, even though you see that it's a low-budget student film, you never once feel like ""Oh man, these are just some kids playing zombie in their cellar"", instead you are invested the whole way through.<br/><br/>One of the reasons for this are the actors, who had little to no experience and aren't written as stereotypes, instead they just feel like real people who are in a bad situation. The best part of this is by far Bruce Campbell who has the most real reactions to the weird things which are happening.<br/><br/>The best example of this is a scene which surprised and positively floored me: The scene when Ash knocks out his girlfriend Linda and ties her in one of Sam Raimis trademark montages to a table and starts a chainsaw to cut her in pieces. Me knowing just a few of the one- liners and the image of Ash from the sequels thinks ""Okay now it 's gonna get bloody as hell."" But instead, Ash just stops the chainsaw and breaks down because he can't kill his girlfriend, who he loves so much.<br/><br/>It's one of my favourite scenes ever, and it's done very well. And this is what i like the most about this movie, the realness and the heart of it, together with the insane amount of creativity and work that's clearly put into it.<br/><br/>I also have to praise the camera-work of this movie, it's so insanely creative and effective, together with the fitting editing, and most of the best scenes in the film are because of these two aspects.<br/><br/>And also, something almost no one talks about while discussing this gem, the soundtrack is fantastic. It fits perfectly at the right places and has some memorable themes. As i watched the movie with a Friend a few weeks ago, he always had a emotional reaction to the love theme of Ash and Linda, and ""awwww""-ed every time he heard it and remembered what's at stake for the protagonist.<br/><br/>All in all, i didn't expected such a weird but fairly adult, scary and ALSO funny at times, horror film, and hell yeah i love it to death..."
"lesleyharris30","5","1","3","15 November 2015"," For a very Acquired Taste,
","The Evil Dead is a very mediocre movie with a rather poorly written storyline than never really goes anywhere, but a talented cast. It definitely has its moments, Bruce Campbell shines in the lead role, his first performance of the iconic character Ash Williams, he has an undeniable screen presence that it both natural and dedicated, I'm still interested in watching the sequels mainly because of Campbell and the fact that the humour is more evident in them, there is a bit of comedy in this that I quite liked, but there wasn't enough for me. As a horror, I found it to be very light on thrills, it never really had me at the edge of my seat, the low budget dosen't help, the actors never really feel like zombies, just people wearing poor make up, and the long sequences of them killing one zombie is a ridiculous scene, it's just load and obnoxious, I wasn't sure how they wanted me to feel, it was too funny to be scary and too scary to be funny. The plot never really goes anywhere, that's my biggest problem, it lingers for about 70 minutes, there comes a stage where watching people just kill zombies again and again becomes tedious, even if they're doing it in a new and different way each time. Has its moments and I'm certainly interested in watching the sequels for the sake of Campbell, if you're a die hard horror fan you'll probably love it, but The Evil Dead wasn't for me. <br/><br/>A group of friends head to a cabin, where they unexpectedly must fight a bunch of demons. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Bruce Campbell"

","Arriving at a remote cabin in the woods, a group of friends find a strange book in the basement which unleashes a horde of demons which possess the group one-by-one and forces the lone survivor to battle them off to survive the terrifying ordeal.<br/><br/>This here is easily one of the all-time best horror films ever made. Among the numerous outstanding qualities on display is the startling amount of high-quality suspense featured here, which makes for a truly chilling and utterly unnerving experience which starts almost from the very beginning. One of the most innovative aspects of this, the demented and bizarre camera angles here flying around the woods at inhuman speeds at truly obscure angles that gives a great idea of the forces at play here, and the continued usage of the tactic all throughout the first half to show the creatures out in the woods chasing after the ones inside or sneaking up to the cabin makes for a stellar, stand-out series of scenes which makes for quite a nice time here by building to quite a dynamic fever-pitch along the way. As well, the later scenes in the woods where the incessant rolling fog coming through the woods enhances matters so that the scenes around the cabin where they begin whispering in demonic voices or of them approaching the destroyed bridge off in the distance are just plain chilling and creepy, effectively making a clichéd situation all the more uneasy here with the lead-in from here to the film's second half where this really picks up. Firmly entrenched with the possession angle and featuring the group coming under the influence one-by-one, this becomes a series of demented, creepy antics here with the possessed popping out of the darkness, crashing through the floors or appearing sane before turning into a glowing-eyed demon throughout this section makes for some utterly chilling, jump-worthy sequences that are surprisingly demented. Aided by the chilling, creepy cackling they do in that eerie sing-a-long voice while tormenting him in their demon make-up, it all creates a remarkably nerve-wracking experience. Still, none of this here is possible without the film's utterly over-the-top and graphic gore gags here, with the requirement that the body must be dismembered to be freed of possession means there's several graphic depictions here id dismantling the corpse, along with the wounds inflicted here to hold them down in the first place which requires all sorts of stabbing, impaling and setting on fire, which doesn't include the vicious antics committed against the friends while being terrorized, the blood-splatter let loose in the basement or the graphic meltdown at the end which ups the ante quite well here. While the effects don't hold up at all and the story's a mess, the positives are far more worthwhile which make this one as enjoyable as it is.<br/><br/>Rated NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence, Rape from an inhuman source, Language and Brief Nudity."

","Sam Raimi's hyperactive, crazed The Evil Dead is a benchmark zombie flick, a milestone in the realm of practical effects, and just a bloody damn good time at the movies. And I do mean bloody, as gallons upon gallons of blood, puss, and all manner of other goo are spilt, and slabs of latex gore are flung around for nearly the entire hour and a half running time. Now iconic Bruce Campbell plays Ash, a hardware store clerk on a remote getaway with a few friends at a cabin in the woods. Upon entering the dilapidated base,sent, they find a seriously no touchy looking book, which of course they open anyway, reading some of the strange words within. The book is the Necronimicon, containing ancient incantations which bring the forces of evil to wild, screaming, laughing, projectile vomiting life. No sooner have they spoken the words, something makes its way from the woods to haunt them relentlessly. The POV shots of a fast moving 'something' tearing it's way across the underbrush towards the cabin are now iconic as well, and a telling sign of the delirious horrors to come. Corpses start to come back to life, and really mean that. These aren't shambling, sluggish undead, or rage virus fast ones either. They're the film's own brand of demented zombies, spastic lunatics that howl, cackle, speak in tongues, spew bile everywhere, cavort around like chickens with their heads cut off (which happens) and generally liven up the movie with their nonsensical antics. Oh yeah, and there's a scene where a girl gets rated by a gropy tree (!). It's all filmed in a hazy, jagged manner, unpolished and sketchy as hell, making us feel like this really is happening in so,e weird corn of the woods to these hapless people. Ash doesn't get his classic chainsaw hand or shotgun in this one, you'll have to wait for the sequel for that, which is just as awesome and amazing as this, but slightly more expensive looking. This is the ultimate cabin in the woods movie, a nerve shattering exercise in go for broke, kamikaze horror that doesn't let you catch your breath for a single second, either from screaming, laughing, or screaming with laughter."

"FairlyAnonymous","7","1","3","10 September 2014"," A fun and violent movie that isn't as disturbing as many make it out to be
","The Evil Dead is a fun movie. It's strange to say that, but it isn't scary and its violence only adds to its humour. <br/><br/>The movie never has any real ""jokes"" in it; it simply has great timing. Everything in the movie is timed so well that it makes it hilarious. The difference between a horrifying death versus a hilarious death can just be a matter of seconds. This gives the movie a very unique flavor. Most black comedies usually get humour from violent/scary things happening and the main characters not reacting to it. However, this movie doesn't quite do that. The main character definitely react to death and violence; however, something always happens (due to timing) to detract from the horror of the scene.<br/><br/>One such example is when the main character decapitates someone and the body falls on the character and bleeds into his mouth. Under normal circumstances this would be horrifying (and the main character is definitely scared) but because of the timing and the fact that ""A decapitated body coincidentally landed on the character and is spewing blood directly into his mouth for a long period of time"" makes it hilarious. The movie's gore is a major part of its humour. It's over the top.<br/><br/>The movie's premise is actually entertaining enough. By today's standards it is incredibly cliché. Even for it's time, the whole ""Friends going on vacation in the woods"" scenario was a cliché, but not nearly to the degree that it is today. The movie's ""lore""--what little of it is revealed to the audience--is still more well developed than most horror/possession movies. While not a lot is revealed in the movie, you can definitely feel as if there is a bit more to the story that has to be revealed. <br/><br/>The acting is good in the campy sense. It is supposed to feel kind of generic/campy. Overall, the cast is most entertaining when either being possessed or when reacting to something in horror...<br/><br/>All in all, The Evil Dead is a very entertaining horror comedy. It isn't really scary and it isn't hilarious. It is simply a creative horror film that did very well with its budget restraints. The violence is done mainly to comedic effect.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"RomanJamesHoffman","8","1","3","30 March 2014"," Gore-fest horror spectacular and archetypal Video Nasty.
","The horror genre has always benefited from low-budget movies: in 1968 George A. Romero independently produced the seminal zombie flick ""Night of the Living Dead"" and in doing so invented the zombie apocalypse genre as well as marrying incisive sociological commentary to evisceration; and in 1978 John Carpenter reworked some of the tropes found in ""Black Christmas"" (1974) and effectively suburbanized horror in the consummate slasher movie ""Halloween"" (1978). Both were low-budget efforts done out of love and both immediately and irrevocably changed the way we think about horror. In a similar way, Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"", although not quite in the same league as the aforementioned films, nevertheless was born in similar low-budget circumstances and was able to transcend these financial limits with sheer creativity and craft. And in doing so, created such a furore upon its release and spawning such a robust legacy that it can rightly said to be considered a classic.<br/><br/>However, having given such high praise, it remains to be said that the movie cuts an unusual figure among other ""classic"" horror movies (low-budget or otherwise) in being possessed of a definite self-awareness in its employment of horror clichés that have led some to consider the film a parody and not to be taken seriously - a kind of horror version of ""This is Spinal Tap"". Chief among these is, well, the whole plot: a group of young people head out to a remote cabin where they find an ancient book which they shouldn't read from but do and allow demons to come into this reality and wreck havoc. This kind of plot barely cut it back in the day, let alone these days (even though it was remade, quite well in my opinion, in 2013). And yet, despite an undeniable campy quality (with patchy-at-best acting augmenting the thinnest of plots), when it unleashes itself it can create a lurking sense of claustrophobic dread more penetrating than ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974), demons which pose a genuine threat in their sheer malevolence, gore that would make Lucio Fulci blush, and a very real sense of hopelessness.<br/><br/>So, even though the film has its camp flourishes (like the ridiculous and equally horrifying ""Tree Rape"" scene) and knowing nods and what-not, it seems that the distanced self-awareness that ""The Evil dead"" demonstrates is the very thing that allows the film to venture into the realms of excess with its gore and nihilism that allow it to ultimately stand above the tropes and genre conventions it employs. As such, being so bleak and such a gore high watermark, it's no surprise that the movie wound up on the list of official Video Nasties drawn up in the 80s; a list designed to remove from circulation movies which were considered morally corrupting. To be honest, a lot of the movies on the list haven't aged well and one wonders what all the fuss is about, but with ""The Evil Dead"", while morally corrupting may be pushing it (especially given the depths of recent movies ""The Human Centipede"" (2009) and ""A Serbian Film"" (2011), it still retains its ability to creep you out, make you squirm, and damn well entertain you."

","In 1981 The Evil Dead was premiered and at the same time a horror masterpiece was unveiled to the world. The Evil Dead immediately sets you up in a creepy mood just by the first few minutes; I absolutely love it. Now right away you are introduced to the charterers, 5 high school students (or college I don't know for sure) all of them are clichéd no doubt about it except for one, he's different but I'll touch up on that later. The story now seems very basic people go into and abandoned cabin to die in weird ways, simple but at the time that was new. The rest of the movie keeps its scary and suspenseful mood that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the payoff. Now the movie gets interesting; all hell breaks loose... LITERALLY! Demons start to posses bodies and tress? Thats right trees and this is shown in one of the most disturbing/ darkly comedic movie scenes depending on your sense of humor. The demon makeup is very good and the gore, there is so much gore DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU ARE SQUEAMISH!! But the gore is a lot of fun to watch. Now to the one different character, Ash. All the characters get an equal screen time but one by one they're picked off until Ash is the survivor now in the first movie he's not as interesting as the sequels. Now lets talk about the final 5-7 minutes, it's fantastic a true display of stop motion effects, wonderful! The Evil Dead: its a horror movie with non stop scares, an incredibly fast paced movie that never lets up, its scary, its fun, and it gets a 9.5 out of 10. And one last thing about the first of the series; the ending (like very very end) is really awesome and the credits even tho nothing happens are cool to me at least."

Its a low budget film, but this only adds to the film, in my opinion. The usage of practical effects is truly amazing and is something that I kind of wish would still be used today in some areas. There are also a lot of interesting shots such as the fast moving shots through the forest, which are fun to watch. Acting wise, it's not strong, but Bruce Campbell gives a fun performance. It's a must watch for horror fans, and for anyone who wants to have a good time and some fun scares."

"Richard_Alex_Jenkins","8","1","3","7 September 2013"," The Right Colour of Blood
","It's difficult to explain why this film is so entertaining more than 30 years after it's original release. I've seen the film before, know what happens next and it's got pretty average acting, but it's still a good film because of the intertwined level of horror and humour. When I first watched this film it was a full blown, shocking horror, but now, thirty years on, it's a complete comedic blast. Almost genius in a way.<br/><br/>After watching hoards of horror movies recently I was half expecting TED to fall flat on its face in comparison, but if you've seen films like 'High Tension' and the way it veers off with idiotic plot holes and ridiculous twists at the end, you'll really appreciate the straightforward A-Z terror mapping of this film. It's essentially scares and survival of young adults getting more and more freaked out while looking for ways to get to grips with the situation and then survive, but all done in a ridiculously bombastic way.<br/><br/>After victim no.1, Cheryl, is zombiefied and then superbly bundled down the cellar, the naive group have problems grasping what's going on. They're just kooky kids freaked out in the woods at night, witnessing very strange things.<br/><br/>""I think there's something out there"" one of the girls says. You're not wrong there darling, and something very much down the cellar as well.<br/><br/>As we all know, rule number one of any horror situation is lock all doors, board up all windows and do not go outside until morning. Well forget that...<br/><br/>After Shelly gets singed in the open log fire, she utters ""Thank you. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't pulled me off those hot coals, burning my pretty flesh"", one of the films' laugh out loud moments. The first infected bitch, Cheryl, chained off down the cellar, lifts up the hatch on a regular basis so she can taunt the others for being so weak and scared - a true classic 10/10 horror/humour event, filled with malice and no shortage of cackles.<br/><br/>And of course there's hero Ashley, getting smashed around the room for the umpteenth time, reeling around on the floor under yet more broken shelves and wardrobes, rallying to the rescue of his buddy, but instead just standing there watching Shelly gnaw off her own hand.<br/><br/>The transformation of the girls, one by one, into unrecognisable zombies is a bit too quick. A few minutes, maybe ten, and they're fully transformed, but does it matter? After a nice bit of dismemberment the two guys are the last men standing, true to nature, the strongest surviving until last. When Ash finds himself alone, especially now that his own girlfriend is fully zombified, he FINALLY starts to react instead of just freaking out.<br/><br/>And there you have it... Ash defends himself for a while, mysteriously not turning into a zombie like the others either, even though he's wounded, but slowly grasping the required 'dismemberment' logic. He doesn't quite fulfil the role of hero, but after bashing his girlfriend around with a giant telegraph pole and ultimately beheading her in a swishing spade-like manoeuvre, you've got to hand it to him for getting this far into the nightmare.<br/><br/>The spurting colours and gunk and the rather nasty plasticine stop-motion effects at the end don't really enhance the film, and the effects are all a bit slap-dash and splattered around, but I still enjoyed them.<br/><br/>I really wanted to give the film a '9', but I had more enjoyment writing these comments and re-living the past, laughing perhaps where I shouldn't, than actually getting scared by this film, so a point deducted for that.<br/><br/>It sounds like an awful film in many respects and granted, it was a better film on its original release, but it's a worthwhile piece of cinema with extra amounts of gore and lots of entertainment check boxes properly ticked."

","I first heard of the Evil Dad franchise when I was a kid (9, 10 years old). I dared not to come any closer to it because, let's face it, this is not a movie for children. Time passed, I grew older, and at one point, after Hollywood hadn't made a decent horror movie in a decade I saw something that scared the Hell out of me - The Evil Dead remake trailer. I said to myself, now is the time (I'm 21 now) to see what this franchise is made of. I rented the movie today with really high expectations due to the knowledge how it is a cult classic, a masterpiece in horror and a revolutionary vision in horror movies. Are all of these elements true?<br/><br/>1) The atmosphere. At first viewing I was disturbed by the gory images, the utmost violence and bloodshed this movie threw at me. Only after a few hours of contemplating had I realized that The Evil Dead made me more scarred and shocked than any other horror movie in a decade. The basic scare is not the CGI or insane killers, or sic traps, but the fact that there is no knowledge of what is happening, how to fight it, or how to escape it. Fear is elemental. The claustrophobic, colorless, dark atmosphere with no tension relief and panic that simply doesn't stop, awakes a feeling of terror like I have never felt while watching a movie. Even though the movie is relatively short, the final 20 minutes pass without a word spoken, with marvelous camera-work that held me on the edge of my seat. I just knew something was going to happen, and the expectation tore my nerves apart.<br/><br/>2) The acting. As basically every cult classic only one person stands out. Bruce Campbell is good. He is actually the only one that actually tried to do something with his character more than be a screaming freaked-out teen. He is the prototype of a horror movie hero.<br/><br/>3) The story. Actually, nothing to say here. There is nothing specific or memorable about it. One could define the story in a sentence but that's not the point. The point is that the lack of a story is what makes the movie so terrifying. As I said before, there is no knowledge of what is going on - ignorance it the basis of fear here. Questions are raised but not answered, questions that really need answers in order to give one a peace of mind, but this is Evil Dead. There is no peace of mind. But, a lack of a story could be seen as a big flaw. There are some segments of the film that could have been explored a bit further in order to gain a multi layered structure of the characters and the storyline.<br/><br/>4) The music. Perfect timing, perfect atonal horrific sounds, and a great main theme.<br/><br/>All in all, The Evil Dead redefined how horror movies were made. It redefined how people saw horror movies and it will definitely change views on horror movies for generations to come. This is not the Godfather of horror movies, and do not expect something like that, but it comes really close."

"Robert_duder","8","1","3","17 April 2013"," The patriarch of epic indie Horror
","I literally laugh out loud when I hear someone say...The Evil Dead? That movie is terrible. OF COURSE IT IS!! It is deliciously, brilliantly terrible. It is gory, and even creepy at times and then flips flawlessly over to being downright hilarious. But in my opinion the true brilliance of The Evil Dead is when you look at it from a film making perspective...which I don't usually like to do...but this movie was essentially done on a shoestring budget with hands on special effects and gore. The cast went through gruelling conditions to bring this movie to life (no pun intended) It is the quintessential indie film. It proved and still proves that a horror film made independently by then ""unknowns"" can still be immensely successful. The story is incredibly simplistic, for the most part it is said that Sam Raimi didn't have a real script but had all the ideas in his head. There is nothing about this movie that you can say is ""brilliant"" except for the sheer fact that it was made by an incredibly talented group of young people. The script is silly, the gore is gratuitous and over the top, everything about it is simple but the film is legendary and incredibly fun to watch for horror fans.<br/><br/>Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly are all okay in their roles. They are a little campy in the beginning and a little stiff in line delivery but then once they're all possessed and part of the ""evil dead"" is when they all really shine especially Sandweiss and Tilly. They put their heart and soul into the movie and basically signed themselves over to Raimi and let him do whatever it was he did and they deserve kudos for that. Did they make or break the movie? No. Honestly they felt like fodder for the demons and didn't really stand out. This is perhaps the reason why The Evil Dead made Bruce Campbell a legend. We all know him now as the King of Camp but in The Evil Dead he is truly giving his very best ""serious"" performance. Yes some of it is laughable but he is so dedicated and fun to watch and there is absolutely no doubt that he has this charisma on screen that makes him riveting. He carries this movie on his back and does so perfectly. The guy is covered from head to toe with every manner of disgusting body fluid that you can imagine and he looks classy while doing it.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is the most fun because it tries so hard to be serious. Those who are squeamish will certainly find the gore hard to watch. Those of us who are die hard horror fans will see the dark humour in how over the top everything is. But it is is a horror film through and through. The atmosphere that Raimi created (again on virtually nothing) is brilliant. The entire setting in the cabin, the dark and creepy woods, the infamous ""woods raping scene"" is all simply twisted and disturbing and even the humour in this film is (I think) entirely unintended and comes from watching these guys have a lot of fun making a horror film. But unlike many independent horror film makers (especially nowadays) this group of people headlined by Raimi and Campbell are incredibly talented and went on to much bigger things. The Evil Dead is not for everyone but it is a classic without a doubt and true horror fans and fans of film making have to appreciate it for what it is and what it has become. The remake currently in theatres is stone cold brilliance...but for a variety of different reasons. 8.5/10"

","Miraculously enough, Sam Raimi and his long-time friend Bruce Campbell struck pay dirt with their first feature-length film. A low-budget but ghoulish horror movie, ""The Evil Dead"" takes place in the Tennessee hills where five college students are heading off for Spring Break. This quintet hole up in a dilapidated cabin and discover a tape recording along with an ancient but enigmatic Sumerian tome. Before long they find themselves surrounded by demon-possessed fauna and experience evil first hand. The reel-to-reel tape recording that they uncover contains comments from an archaeologist about his research and his experience with demons. The ""Naturon Demonto"" stands for the Sumerian Book of the Dead. The unwitting students unleash the demons when they utter some incantations. Those dreadful creatures come after them with a vengeance. Cheryl thinks she hears something outside and ventures out into the dark. The woods rise up against her and vines pin her spread-eagled to the ground while a tree thrusts its bole itself into her. This has got to qualify as the most outlandish rape in cinematic history. Things wax progressively worst, and Cheryl's brother Ash (Bruce Campbell) has to lock her up in the basement. Indeed, he has to festoon the trapdoor with chains. Nevertheless, Cheryl can raise it far enough to look at the occupants in the room. Eventually, all the females become demon possessed, and the guys really have their hands full as they defend themselves. This 85 minute horror epic swirls horror with humor. Happily, Raimi doesn't take himself seriously, and ""The Evil Dead"" is a black comedy of sorts. The success of this chiller spawned two sequels, ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) and ""Army of Darkness"" (1992). One of the eeriest of shots occurs when we share the perspective of evil and are flying through the woods. Reportedly, Raimi achieved this steady-cam effect by mounting his camera on a 2x4 and running through the woods with Bruce Campbell on the other end. What makes this movie so memorable is the spirit that Raimi infuses the film with, its skewered cinematography, the breakneck pace, and its humor. The 2013 remake changed the names of the characters and alters several events."
"StevePulaski","8","1","3","7 April 2013"," Unapologetically gory and surprisingly very amusing
","The Evil Dead and its two sequels have achieved a small, but loyal cult following in the field of horror, showcasing likely some of the goriest brutality on film in the eighties. It follows a group of twentysomethings, Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), his sister Shelly (Sarah York), and his friends Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) and Scotty (Hal Delrich) as they embark out to a remote cabin in the middle of the woods. They stumble upon ""The Book of the Dead,"" which is inked in blood and bound by flesh, and unleashes a number of demons and evil spirits that quickly begin to take over the cabin and the souls inside. It's up to Ash, the cool-guy hero of the group to defeat the spirits and save his friends.<br/><br/>The plot is, without a doubt, as standard as standard can get. At the end of the day, we come for the scares and the gore and that's exactly what we'll receive. Buckets and buckets of blood are utilized; one of the best scenes involves Ash puncturing a demon's eyes with both his thumbs, with huge amounts of blood quickly oozing out. Yet even with all this constant, flashy violence and gore, the film never veers off on the course of being sadistically exploitative or depressingly nihilistic. Its gore and violence isn't meant to be taken seriously or offensively. There's an aesthetic and tonal cheeriness to this material that is widely unexpected - especially in the eighties, when it seemed many horror films attempted to be as bleak as they possibly could be.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi (who would later become known for not only his Evil Dead trilogy, but his Spider-Man films) knows how to employ terrific tactics when he works on horror movies. His presence and involvement with the 1980's horror film Intruder, while one of his more obscure films, definitely replicates a style that he would soon become affiliated with. Here, Raimi always seems to be trying something new, specifically with the camera angles. Consider the POV shot we get of someone (or something) gliding through the forestry near the cabin, even going as far as to colliding through the windows of the cabin. The trick to these scenes is we never know exactly what the POV is of, but we don't need to. We know it's not good, since it zips by at an unusual, lighting speed and makes the characters scream when they come in contact with it.<br/><br/>These scenes work because Raimi largely knows when to utilize them and how to have them work accordingly with the cinematography. Shot on a roughly $350,000 budget, much of the atmosphere is presented through a lens concerned more with naturalism than polish. The presentation of the picture feels rawer and purer than many other horror films of the time period. This is yet another horror film that contributes to the thought that smaller budgets make better horror films in general.<br/><br/>There isn't a whole lot to The Evil Dead. As a horror film, it features the obligatory faceless characters, little development, and devotion to smaller events that may or may not lead up to a grandiose finale. And yet, it works mainly because it aspires to be a bit more ambitious in the regards to its film techniques and gore usage. It's a delightful blend of black comedy and riveting horror excitement, which is a combination that is depressingly underutilized.<br/><br/>Starring: Bruce Campbell, Betsy Baker, Sarah York, Ellen Sandweiss, and Hal Delrich. Directed by: Sam Raimi."

","If you are looking for a horror movie that scares you, leaves you with images 'till next morning, and even then causes you to wake at nights even years after watching, this is the movie for you. It is definitely disturbing, dark, hopeless, creepy, and everything a good horror movie is. That being said, it is a B-horror movie with a budget of less than 400,000 dollars. So the special effects are just good enough and the actors just convincing enough to sell it. The movie dances on today's line of ridiculously thrilling or hilarious with it's claymation. However, the story is original, thrilling, and sticks with you. Don't watch with the kids or grandparents."
"joshi_3592","8","1","3","22 December 2009"," I can't believe I actually watched this film. Man is this scary!
","I'm a very squeamish person, and the irony is that I like horror films. But man, this film is by far the scariest I've ever seen. It's not just creepy or eerie, it's damn right horrifying. So two thumbs up for Sam Raimis horror master piece.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell as Ash is just awesome, and he's kinda the main source behind the appeal to these three films. After having seen some scenes from the third film, Amy of Darkness, I thought Ash would be some kind of handy action hero who isn't particularly scared by anything. Nope, he was pretty scared during the whole movie, and almost survived by pure luck, and some quick thinking. I guess he get's used to the demons in the sequels. Nevertheless I'm looking forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>Now this movie was shot on an shockingly low budget, it's shows a little, but it still amazes you what these guys managed to do with almost nothing. The camera work is great, the make up is pretty good, and the effects are pretty decent. I don't know why, but sometimes low budget films are the scariest.<br/><br/>Now if you're easily scared, I wouldn't recommend this film for you. if your squeamish, watch it with friends on a bright summer day, turn the volume slightly down, and turn on the subtitles (just in case). Then it shouldn't be so scary. I saw it alone, and it still freaks me out as I am writing this review. PS. it is not directly scary because of gore and such, there are some for sure, but it's the atmosphere that's scary. <br/><br/>So for one of the scariest film ever, with few flaws and some bad acting, but still a great original idea, I give this film a 8/10."
"Matt_Layden","10","1","3","20 July 2009"," A Horror Masterpiece - I Love This Movie.
","This film is the definition of a horror film. It's a classic and I will never, EVER, get tired of watching it. If there is one film that I could have on a desert island, this is it. If there is one film to turn a person onto horror, this is it. If there is one film that got me into film-making, this is it.<br/><br/>First, let me say Bruce Campbell is great, even though he is basically a chump in this outing. It's Scott who is the 'bad-ass', chopping up his possessed girlfriend with an ax. Seeing his transition from film to film is great, but here is where it all started.<br/><br/>The film is scary as hell. I know there are people out there who thought it was too cheesy to be scary, but these are probably the same people who think Jason X is one of the greatest horror films of the last decade. Seeing Ash's girlfriend sit on the floor laughing in her high pitched tone is scary, the cabin is scary, the deadites are scary.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is still fresh, exciting and frightening as the day it was made. This is truly ""The Ultimate Experience In Grueling Terror"". Forget Spider-Man, this is Raimi's true baby. The camera work and what they did for the time and the budget is mind blowing (to me anyways). I credit this film with being a huge influence on me wanting to make films. I love the camera movement in this film, every small subtle thing works perfectly and all the obvious in your face Raimi style angles are great to see for the first time (which are still used to this day in his films).<br/><br/>While the film is not as gory as it's sequel, it does have more cringe worthy bits. The Tree Rape scene is enough to make people's skin crawl. Or how about the 'original pencil trick'. I cheered in The Dark Knight and cringed my face in The Evil Dead. How many people still talk about this film today? Hundreds of thousands. It's been a huge impact on horror (see Cabin Fever).<br/><br/>I always wonder about what I would do in this situation and it always ends up being the same, sitting in the corner with a shotgun and shooting anything that moves. Watch The Evil Dead you will not be disappointed."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","3","12 July 2009"," A Horror Masterpiece
","The Evil dead must be one of the most talked about horror films ever made, and for good reason. Unlike The Exorcist and Halloween, The Evil Dead does not take itself too seriously, which is actually a great thing and allows Sam Raimi to shine. He gives the film suspense and thrilling sequences of gore, horror, and mystery. The characters are all well rounded, and the actors portray them with such foolishness, it is great that they were not aiming for anything more. But the stars here are the gore, the effects, and the zombies. It has some of the most wacky horror sequences I have ever seen, filled with thrills, suspense, but also hilarious to watch. Bruce Campbell is good for one of his first films. One of the most entertaining and over-the-top films I have ever seen. A classic and for sure one of my horror favorites."
"ODDBear","9","1","3","13 June 2009"," The king of low-budget horror
","Ultra low-budget horror movies simply don't come any better than this. Wonder kid Sam Raimi concocted a really scary demon flick here and with the use of some incredible camera work, very inventive make-up effects and surprisingly good special effects he made one of the best horror films of the eighties.<br/><br/>The woods scenario had been used a lot, even demons had made many appearances but this flick makes it look so fresh and insanely creepy you forget all that stuff and really sink head first into this nightmarish vision. Granted, the fog machine is used way too much and Hal Delrich as Scott is incredibly bad in his role, but still, all this works in the film's favor. Bruce Campbell is very subdued here compared to his Ash in Dead's two subsequent sequels but even this early he shows leading man potential and why he is one of horror's true cult legends.<br/><br/>Some scenes here are creepy as hell and it's got a few very nasty shocks in store, even for seasoned horror viewers. Raimi hits all the right notes here; there's a creepy basement, fog bound woods, blood and guts in big doses and there's even a chainsaw here. As said, make-up effects are really spectacular and the gory show still impresses nearly 30 years later. Humor is also well placed and delivered; though this flick is indeed a horror film as opposed to the more comically driven sequels.<br/><br/>I really don't know what to say more about ""The Evil Dead"" that hasn't been said (and written) many times before. If you're one of the lucky few who hasn't seen this horror masterpiece; stop reading now and go watch it."
"TOMNEL","9","1","3","2 June 2008"," Night of the Living Dead meets the Excorcist...and this is better than both.
","This is a very silly movie...not as silly as the two sequels it spawned, but it's still silly. The violence is very over the top, and the villains of the film are creatures inhabiting the bodies of the characters, brought to life through black magic. The girl in the Excorcist said some pretty crazy stuff when she was possessed, and the characters here are just as rude and over the top. It's actually sometimes hilarious. At the same time, this is one of the most nerve wracking scariest horror flicks. You have no idea what's going to happen at any moment, and you feel for the protagonist Ash (Bruce Campbell) who's going through Hell trying to get out of this abandoned cabin.<br/><br/>Five kids go into the woods to an abandoned cabin, and after playing back a tape recorder, and evil force is unleashed. They try to survive as these strange spirits try to kill them off and possess their bodies. In order to kill the possessed people, known as deadites, their heads must be dismembered, leading to a lot of gore, and some violent and scary scenes.<br/><br/>Evil Dead, more than any other movie I've seen, has such a perfect mixture of slapstick and horror. These creatures are so vile and nasty, but at the same time somewhat humorous in their over the top nature, and the extreme gore effects. Someone could be chopping another person's head off, which would normally try to be scary, but here it's so over the top and the camera work is so fast it becomes comical. It's a really great mixture of humor and horror.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great movie, which spawned off two sequels that were actually superior to it.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 90 mins. R for language and violence."

","Forget Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' series of recent, this movie will forever be to me Sam Raimi's best piece of cinematic work. Yes it is cheesy in many aspects but it works. I have viewed this movie with many different people and it all effects them the same. The creepy atmosphere with the eerie synthesizer music sets the tone and my friends were always at the edges of their seats during the movie. I would recommend this movie to anybody who is a horror fan, if not, it might not be the best choice but watch it anyway! The wonderful story of a group of friends who decide to get together at a cabin for the weekend who soon find out that they are not the only ones inhabiting the forests they are visiting. Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash is brilliant, this is just one of those movies that I can honestly say I'll never get sick of watching....ever. I now see why they put this video on the 'video nasty' list back in the early eighties. Truly mortifying and entertaining. This might probably be one of the BEST horror movies ever made!

","""The Evil Dead"" is very atmospheric, small budget horror film. The tension is build by the unseen horror, that haunts the teens enjoying their time out in a small cabin away from everything.<br/><br/>The obvious lack of huge budget has driven Sam Raimi in a very good decision not to show the thing, that turns people into a flesh hungry monsters. Weird camera angles and eerie music give the film a throbbing personality, with very eerie atmosphere.<br/><br/>As said, the plot goes like this: A group of friends go into a cabin middle of nowhere. Then they discover a human flesh bound book, the Necronomicon, and they of course awaken the evil in the forest. Silly for them. The evil then starts to hunt the friends one after another, turning them into a flesh craving monsters. The death is always near.<br/><br/>There are some rather campy jokes in the beginning of the film, but it does turn into a rather serious horror film in one point. It's the build up of the atmosphere that does it. There is also the fact of not showing the main baddie, which gives the viewer a good change to let his/hers mind to make out its appearance.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell is the one actor, who rose from the film as a lovable b-film star he is today, as for other careers the Raimi bunch came along this film.<br/><br/>All in all a very good horror film for the fans of the genre."
"Sandcooler","9","1","3","18 January 2006"," That...was cool
","Sam Raimi did something directors rarely do, give the audience what they want. There's no lengthy build-up, that's a start. It can be important to care about the characters, but endlessly postponing action just makes me mad at everyone. Then there is blood and gore, and while being over-the-top is often seen as criticism, it's actually quite difficult to achieve this flaw. You can make any amount of people die horrible, violent deaths, but most of these movies just look like the director got bullied at school. Doesn't apply to ""The Evil Dead"", this is really just cool. It's up-tempo HG Lewis really. Incredibly entertaining almost from the first minute until the last, never has a horror movie been more deserving of a cult following. It's kind of a guilty pleasure, just not one I feel particularly guilty or ashamed about. It's not something new, it has never been overly original, but it has never been done better either."

","Even though I own this movie on DVD, I had to catch it on a special midnight screening last night so that I could finally see it in all it's big-screen, publicly squeamish glory.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it needs it, but on the big screen this film is so much more obviously amazing. The crazy angles and tracking shots are very involving and basically disallow the viewer from not getting trapped into its story.<br/><br/>Especially nice about this movie is its fun. The makers obviously never wanted to let up, so it just delves right in and never stops. Not only does it not matter that a lot of the events in this film are unexplained, most of the time nobody thinks even to point that out. The movie is so true to it's own desire to just immerse and never come out for breath that it is wonderfully self-secure. It only gives a few tidbits of why things are happening to give the audience some foundation so as not to just float away in a random haze of chaos.<br/><br/>On a smaller screen, the effects don't seem very special, but on a wide-screen, they are quite good and still very fun. The entire movie is by no means the greatest horror film in existence, but everything in it is good and just as good as it needs to be.<br/><br/>I'd say all horror fans should see it, but especially if there's a showing in an independent theatre nearby.

"Bogmeister","8","1","3","25 September 2005"," Here we go, to that cabin in the woods
","From such humble aspirations and low-rent resources, near-greatness is achieved. ""The Evil Dead"" takes its place alongside another seminal horror classic, ""Night of the Living Dead""(68) as one of the most influential groundbreaking spikes of terror ever committed to film. With nearly no money, using 16mm film, Raimi and his crew devised a non-stop relentless barrage of horrific images and building dread. The film actually shows some influence by the afore-mentioned earlier film. It takes place in a very isolated location, a choice spot selected by the filmmakers. The setting manages to be very creepy from the outset, before anything even happens. I never really thought of the woods as creepy until I saw this pic. Well, maybe I did, but this is the picture that confirmed my fears.<br/><br/>There is a limited amount of characters, reflecting the tiny budget, including a very young Bruce Campbell, who's still very active as a 'B' movie actor. If you've never seen this film, your first thought is that the group of 5 young people, stuck in a cabin in the woods, will be attacked by exterior forces from outside. In one sense, some of this is the case, but the story amps up the horror when the threat manifests itself from within. The story just gets more and more ugly and disgusting, to the point where most viewers will be shaking their heads in disbelief near the end point. But it's not disbelief in the story - you have that sensibility going in - it's a difficulty in grasping the extent to which the filmmakers went to. What were they thinking? you might think to yourself; what a bunch of crazed lunatics. Some of the FX at the end, resembling limited stop-motion animation, may not look too impressive but, by that point, most viewers are already impressed."

","One of the great things about this film is that it's so low budget and nitty gritty in a Texas Chainsaw kind of way. It really has the weird oogy feeling about it and that, to me, is the most important factor in the film.<br/><br/>Secondly the gore is piled onto the atmosphere this only makes the film all the more nitty gritty. Rarely do you see so much gore in one film and the movie still be taken somewhat seriously.<br/><br/>Now that's not to say the film should be taken too seriously though. It definitely has it's share of tongue in cheek moments, but when you get down to it, it's a lot more serious than the next couple of entries.<br/><br/>Acting here, other than our man Campbell, really ain't all that great. But that's an element most horror fans can dismiss for the most part. Don't get me wrong, it isn't exactly all terrible either.<br/><br/>The one scene that aggravates me the most though is when 'Cheryl' hears a noise outside the cabin late at night and actually goes INTO the woods yelling 'Who's out there!?' To me, I just can't justify such stupidity in any way. And that's why I can't give the film a full five stars. <br/><br/>But again... don't get me wrong. I love this film as much as the next loyal horror fan.<br/><br/>It's gore infested, demon possessed, and directed with gusto! This is an all time horror treat and can't be missed."

","Sam Raimi took off and running with his first feature film, ""The Evil Dead."" Shot on the cheap, Raimi still managed to scare his audience, and the film is a cult classic. 5 young people are on a little trip to an isolated cabin. While checking the cabin out, they find a tape recorder and a book. Not leaving well enough alone (This is a horror film, after all), they play the tape, which explains that the book is a ""book of the dead,"" which contains incantations that allow demons to possess the living. The spell which is translated on the tape releases the evil that's in the forest. Trapped in the cabin, each of them soon becomes possessed by the ""evil dead,"" which torments and brutalizes the remaining survivors, until only Ash (Bruce Campbell)remains. Ash has to try to survive the night and avoid his friends, who want him dead.<br/><br/>The film is pretty graphic: people getting chopped up because that's the only way they can be stopped, one poor individual gets stabbed in the foot with a pencil, and there's lots and lots of graphic gore. But the most incredibly graphic scene is when one poor girl gets raped by the forest (you have to see it to believe it).<br/><br/>Even after over 20 years, this film is still unsettling (And I have a VERY hard time watching this at night).

The attempt at film noir in some shots was just awful. The screaming was far too long,loud,ill placed and headache provoking. The over all lame attempt at continuity was boring.

","In my reviews of 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' I have mentioned numerous times of my appreciation for Sam Raimi and his movies. I have to say, that I think he is a stylish director and a great story teller.<br/><br/>Now I have to admit that it was not until recently that I got to see 'The Evil Dead' and 'Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn', despite Evil Dead being his first movie. I had seen the third movie, 'Army of Darkness', a while ago, and I really enjoyed it (come on, who didn't?), so with some widely available, and cheap DVD releases, I got the whole trilogy. Yay! 'The Evil Dead' follows a group of friends who take a trip to old, cheap cabin (two ominous signs there!). When they arrive, they find a cellar (ominous sign the third), and what appears to be abandoned research into the occult (fourth and final sign of evil). They play a recording of incantations that bring ancient demons to life, and now Ash (Bruce Campbell) and friends have to survive until dawn.<br/><br/>If Bruce Campbell's comments supplied with the DVD were any indication, I wasn't looking forward to much apparently. Well, the acting was rather campy, but still a little better than what Bruce had implied, and the plot wasn't astounding or completely original. He forgot to mention the movie's special effects: rivaled, and beaten, by 1933's 'King Kong'. I wish I was joking here, I really do.<br/><br/>Hey, I'm not holding any of that against 'the Evil Dead'. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were unknown to Hollywood when the movie was in production, and the budget was very small, yet they came up with one of the best horror movies ever made, and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. The way the film is shot, and some of the better moments of acting, maintain a dark atmosphere and manage to keep the movie suspenseful. However, I didn't know if the special effects towards the end were supposed to disturb me or make me laugh at the cheesiness. That's my only real complaint about the movie. I did want to see the Ash from 'Army of Darkness', but now I see him as a male version of Ripley from the 'Alien' saga - terrified at first, calm and casual at the end.<br/><br/>8/10 - Not for the faint of heart..."

I'd lost my bet with my pal (as I turned on the light immediately) and had to endure being called 'Duh' dude for a while. Nevertheless,the movie was darn frightening. The walking dead, the falling bridge and the living woods are all became inspirations for today's horror genre (include those teen-scream films et al). I wonder are there anyone just like me, duh ??"

The fact that there are just a very few totals and that the camera is always quite close to the action and to the actors, is what the film gives so much atmosphere.

","Ok. The Evil Dead movie hit theaters in 81 and it was frightening. They started making it in 1977 it was released in 1981. Once this fild came out, people hardly wanted to go see it... After seeing the trailer or commercial, people thought this move was two intense. Ill tell you a true story... This was on the news along time ago. 3 friends went to see The Evil Dead. After the movie was over, 3 of them went home and they had not slept in days... After 2 of them had heart attacks after when they were walking together... Someone never knew they watched it and asked them do you want to go see it? They both immediately had heart attacks... Protesters were protesting against the film... Then rating for the fil was NC-17. It was way to gory and frightening. That is why it is restricted from tv. Also the exorcist is restricted from tv too. But when they play it on TV they must cut out scenes for both movies. The Evil Dead topped The Exorcist in being most frighning. Dead Alive(Braindead) was released in 93 and people said that it was a evil dead wannabe. I agree. Put it this way.. .Watch Evil Dead 2 which was released in 87 and look at Dead Alive(braindead). Comedy? Well so is Evil Dead... Evil Dead is comedy and horror. Most people find it scary and not funny. Dead Alive had a big notch hero and so did Evil Dead.. What a coinsedense. Dead Alive has alot of gore. And so does evil dead. Evil Dead may have less blood but it is gorier. They have white blood and it is disgusting. Zombies getting cut up and everything... It is just scary. Evil dead now is by far the best damn zombie movie in the world and 2nd in scariest movie in the world... first is the exorcist. 2nd best zombie movie ever is Dawn Of The Dead...<br/><br/>Well Thank you.. I just cleared everything up.."

I'd take this flick over any art film anyday. Bruce Campbell's performance is note worthy, he sticks out as being great in his first real movie. Sam's directing is top notch, and more involving and fun than his directing in Spider-Man.

About half way through the movie, it all of the sudden becomes very weird and surreal (I think it starts when a pipe filled with blood bursts.

"meisill","10","1","3","30 July 2003"," So relentless it works...
","Sam Raimi, the same director who was given 139 million dollars to make ""Spiderman"" started off with 150,000 dollars to make ""The Evil Dead,"" which I personally like better. ""The Evil Dead"" is the first in the trilogy that features the misadventures of Ash, a gun- lugging, chainsaw-wielding, blood-secreting ""sole"" survivor of a night of mayhem and horror. Ash, being the main character, basically is faced with the decision throughout the entire movie to either kill his friends, or lock them up in the cellar. I personally enjoyed the film because of its relentless amount of gore. When's the last time you've seen a Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) lick its own face while a demon is hitting someone on the back with a fireplace poker.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around a group of five friends who decide to travel to a supposedly remote cabin for a vacation or something.  But things go awry after... well it doesn't matter. A real basic summary of this movie would be: teens get killed off and/or transformed one by one into zombies by the evil spirits inhabiting the surrounding woods.  Basic zombie/survival horror flick.  But this one stands out from the rest for some unidentifiable (to me) reason.  Maybe it's because it knows no bounds.<br/><br/>So anyways, if you like NC-17-worthy gore, tree rape, and any way, shape, or form of dismemberment, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>*Gore: 10/10<br/><br/>*Suspense: 3/10<br/><br/>*Overall: 6/10"

"bmk149","10","1","3","13 April 2003"," This is the film that got me into horror movies
","I first stumbled apon the Evil Dead when i saw it had got the NC-17 rating from the MPAA. I've never really heard of a film getting an NC-17 because of the violent content only so i decided to check it out. Thank God i did. The Evil Dead is by far the best horror movie i've ever seen. It's this film that got me into the Horror/Gore gerne into the first place and since then i've become quite the Gorehound.<br/><br/>SPOILERS Below:<br/><br/>The gist of the movie is about a bunch of young college kids who rent a cabin in the woods for a weekend of sex, drugs and drinking. Things go way out of hand after the guys find a Ancient Sumarian Book called ""Necronomicon del Monto"" and a tape recorder with a message from the professor who studied it there with his wife. After playing the recording on the tape recorder the demonic forces awake from their slumber in the dark forests of man domian and all hell breaks lose. The Demons have the power to possess the living and one by one each of the kids in the cabin become possessed and try to kill their friends. Among the horrors you will see in this movie are a violent tree rape scene, a pencil stabbed in the heel of a woman's foot and twisted, a possessed woman biting her hand off after having it cut half way off with a hunting knife, a man chopping up her possessed girlfriend with an axe including shot of arms and feet being severed with lots of blood, a man severing his girlfriends head with a shovel and her body falling on top of him spurting blood all over his face, a possessed chick having a hole blown out of her check with a shotgun blast, a possessed man's eyes being gouged out via thumbs, and a glorious meltdown and disintegration sequence were the possessed persons body's start falling apart right befour our eyes. This film definetly lives up to it NC-17 rating and if you don't believe me check it out for yourself. This is by far the goriest film i've ever seen with the exception of Dead Alive (unrated version). Other then the awesome gore effects the film has some of the best camera shots and movements i've ever scene in a movie. The acting is good for a low budget horror flick, well at least Bruce Campbell's is. The scene where it's just him all alone in the cabin with the demonic forces screwing with him gives you the feeling that this character might think it's all just some weird hallucinations he's having possibly from the drugs he's done. Maybe this was a just a bad head trip and he chopped up his friends for nothing (chuckles).<br/><br/>SPOILERS End:<br/><br/>I can't possibly give this film enough praise, it's the best your gonna get when it comes to low-budger horror flicks, Hell it's even better then all the high-budget Hollywood horror pictures that have come out, well at least in my opinion. I could watch it again and again without ever getting sick of it. Rating: 10/10."

I last watched it on the porch of a mountain cabin, very similar to the one in the film. What a rush! Very few horror movies deserve the praise that this one does. The cult that has arisen around this series is deserved. Too much gore? Impossible, although Braindead, aka Dead Alive, tries. It's great that both Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson gained opportunities to make some money with big budget hits, recently. Still, Evil Dead proves that ultimately it's not the budget that makes a great movie--it's the film makers. Ash should appear in the Freddy v Jason movie and kick both of their tails!"

","I was expecting more from this cult classic. Jaws is an example of a cheap film that uses the camera to achieve tension the budget can't. The Evil Dead seemed almost like a pornographic parody of some other film. Minus the sex of course.<br/><br/>I found the camera angles erratic and distracting. The soundtrack could be described in the same way. The narrative was all over the place and the acting was on a par with Debbie Does Dallas. This film certainly doesn't stand the test of time in my books. This is to Sam Raimi what Bad Taste was to Peter Jackson. But if you love to see horror that's ""so bad its good"", this might be one for you. It certainly paves the way for its genre and has obviously inspired many films that followed but don't expect to be scared if true horror is what you're after."

","THE EVIL DEAD <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.37:1<br/><br/>Sound format: Mono<br/><br/>Whilst on vacation at an isolated backwoods cabin, five students are terrorized by ancient spirits which possess and kill them, one by one.<br/><br/>Clearly the work of talented filmmakers going places, this OTT gore-fest is alternately loud, excessive, stylish and disgusting, in roughly equal amounts. Debut director Sam Raimi throws everything into the mix, perhaps to atone for a flimsy plot and stock characters (well-played by an excellent cast, including cult-performer-in-the-making Bruce Campbell), and while much of it is tongue-in-cheek, some scenes leapfrog the taste barrier with unconscionable glee (Raimi has since admitted the 'tree rape' sequence was a mistake, for example). Sadly, the movie is rendered monotonous by its excessive pace and comic insouciance (the sequels - beginning with EVIL DEAD II - went even further in this direction), and the movie quickly succumbs to the laws of diminishing returns; once you've seen one drooling demon getting its head cut off, you've seen 'em all! Fantastic low budget production values, however, and the makeup effects are dandy.<br/><br/>NB. Caught up in the UK's 'video nasties' hysteria, the movie was cut and banned and generally unseen in that country until 2002, when it was finally passed uncut by the British censor. The complete version first aired on UK TV in 2005."

","While this movie was never in the running for an academy award, it has touched two generations of fans now in the last 26 years. It was made by college kids as nothing more than a b-movie but it turned out to be one of the most original and gruesome movies in the last quarter century.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is a tale about 5 college kids taking a vacation in a secluded cabin among the woods somewhere in Michigan. During their stay they stumble upon the centuries old Necronomicon, the book of the dead. (Not to be confused with the book of the dead from The Mummy) After stupidly reading from the book, the ancient evil the book possessed comes to life and begins attacking the 5 kids (including one scene where a woman is raped by a tree, yes you read that right) until they are either killed or posssessed. One by one they are dispatched by the one remaining survivor named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and by daylight the evil is gone....or so we thought.<br/><br/>This movie took the possession concept from The Exorcist to a brand new level. This was supposed to be a b-movie orchestrated by college kids yet the special effects are AWESOME for 1981 and non-Hollywood standards. If you see this movie and not the next 2 in the series, its quite amusing to see Ash play the role of the wussy as upposed to the hero he'd become. If you look at the movie from the perspective of it was a low budget flick run by unknown actors, actresses, directors, etc you can truly appreciate its lasting effects on the world and the sequels spawned from it.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie is the end when Ash throws the Necronomicon into the fire and the remaining deadites (names for the possessed) melt, that's tremendous special effect work if I may say so. Definitely watchable 6 out of 10"

","I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, it's truly scary, very disturbing + unsettling, quite well-directed, and incredibly influential. But I just can't overlook the terrible acting (outside of Bruce Campbell), cheezy dialogue, stupid characters, and slavish adherence to silly genre conventions. I mean, could the girl do something other than run into the haunted woods? It did scare me quite a bit, though, the first horror film to do so since The Descent. The scene where Ash's girlfriend is laughing maniacally - brrr. Gives me shivers just thinking about it. I think if it had taken a little more time getting set up (it feels really rushed at the beginning), had some decent actors, and a better script, I would have really liked it, as the direction and visuals are top-notch for such a low-budget film.

","I have to give Evil Dead a 9/10. It is a great Horror movie, that was low budget, but Scary enough to please the audience. Its a typical storyline, where as usual you see a group a American Friends driving through the forest and crash their car. This has been repeated in 100s of Horror movies. The situation where a group of friends are stuck in the forest. In this movie they find a house, and decide to spend the night. But there is something Evil following them. One of the memorable scenes in this movie is when the girls are playing Cards. They have to guess what card the opponent is holding. One of the girls that catches the Evil Spirit starts reading out loud all the answers without looking. As her voice starts sounding creepier, her friends look at her surprised. She Turns back to look at them and they get spooked, because she has turned into a monster. The make up on the monster is terrific, Its amazing how they spent very less to make this movie and the movie is known as one of the Best Horror Films. There is a trilogy in Evil Dead series. The Original was the best, the second was comic and the third was a fantasy adventure. Surprising good stuff."

","This has been my favorite movie and favorite horror movie for years. Sure, the acting comes and goes in quality and yeah, that stop-motion animation is dated, but that's not what makes a horror movie. This has something you almost never find in our modern watered-down Hollywood horror trite these days. Pure, dark, terrifying atmosphere. It's dark, moody, and the action comes and goes with relentless pace. The quiet moments are so well done that you can FEEL the stress. The scene out in the woods... if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about... reminds us all of how the filmmakers came to the idea that submitting this movie to be rated (or raped) by the MPAA would've resulted, most likely, in an X rating. Not to mention, this movie is about the only competitor in horror film existence that might even be able to match, let alone compete, with the amount of gore dumped throughout, Peter Jackson's (Unrated, Uncut) Dead-Alive. If you are a real horror fan, you will want to OWN this feature."

","Its low-budget look gives it a real charm. It progresses along gradually enough, ie the suspense builds realistically and naturally, instead of giving us zombies within the first five minutes, that we believe the zombies when they eventually come - it actually works as a straight horror movie, unlike its sequals.<br/><br/>I don't know where Raimi found Bruce Campbell, but he's the real highlight of this movie. He's incredible - he's got this superhero's head. It was a great idea to have a certain guy's face being the figurehead of the series. Especially when he's got a face like this! Those crazy eyes, that jut jaw. Raimi is right - he does look great in a head shot.<br/><br/>The first half hour is really exciting, because you can tell everyone is just learning how to make a film. It was shot over a period of seven years, i hear, so the general quality improves throughout, but there are no noticeable jumps in quality - the texture is not incredible uneven. It all hangs together okay.<br/><br/>Its a fairly full-on zombie experience, once we get into the thick of it. Its fairly harrowing and foul, so be prepared - weak of stomach should stay away.<br/><br/>Certain parts were better than others: I thought the zombie trapped under the trapdoor banging up against it was fantastic, all of Bruce Campbell was fantastic, especially his later scenes. But i didn't like the part near the beginning where a girl wanders into the woods and vines start chasing her and climbing up her crotch.<br/><br/>Raimi's lightning-fast steadicam which predates Barry Sonnenfeld's famous ""crazy-cam"" from Raising Arizona by a good decade is pretty freaky, but gets a little gimmicky.<br/><br/>7/10.

","Bruce Campbell, the man with the Superman jaw, stars as the hapless Ash, beset on all sides by the zombie versions of his best friends. Stuck in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, in a forest thick with dry ice, his situation may seem hopeless. And it is. One by one his zombie friends must be destroyed, before they destroy him. Needless to say, this is accomplished with the maximum of gore. Blood flies in all directions. At one point the lightbulb in the cellar fills up with the stuff. His friends mutate into grotesque, giggling, demonic ghouls. The first one to undergo this drastic change in her fortunes is locked in the cellar from where she provides witty comment on the action, while staring into space through milky contact lenses. Ash tries hard, grappling with the undead humans and the half-dead dialogue. Bruce Campbell is at his best when most of his face is covered by a zombie's hand, or a zombie's blood, or both. Luckily, there are few pauses between bouts of violence and screaming and running around. The horror film clichÃ©s are all present and correct: randy teenagers, cabin in the woods, mysterious book plus tape plus incantations, bad acting, bad dialogue, over-active camera work, women wandering off in the woods alone.<br/><br/>The film works, though, in its own sleazy way. It aims no higher than scaring the s*** out of you, which, at times, it does. Sam Raimi, who has managed to carve out a successfully eclectic Hollywood career, keeps things moving, tossing in horror movie jokes (the ripped fragment of a poster for ""The Hills Have Eyes"") with the confidence of one who knows that the whole thing is a joke, really.

","Five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.<br/><br/>While I am not going to dispute the greatness of this film, and I would not deny it is a modern horror classic (among the very best of the 1980s), I find that the best way to critique the film is as though I was watching it at the time.<br/><br/>At the time, Fangoria wrote that the film ""might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films."" They were right. Watching it as though it had just come out gives you that feeling that these guys (none of whom were known at the time) really brought something new to the table. Stephen King saw it, the horror community saw it, and there it was.<br/><br/>And you have to give Raimi and friends credit. This was ultimately a gamble. Sure, they made a test version (""Within the Woods""), but here they laid it on the line and maxed out their credit to see their dream work (not unlike Kevin Smith and ""Clerks"" a decade later). It could have flopped, and they could have spent the rest of their lives waiting tables to pay off their debts. I think they deserve credit for that.<br/><br/>But there is another way to see the film, and that is through the lens of thirty-plus years. In retrospect, the film holds up well with critics. Martyn Glanville says it is ""one of the great modern horror films, an even more impressive when one considers its modest production values."" True. And yet, I feel like it has lost a bit of something.<br/><br/>There will always be an ""Evil Dead"" versus ""Evil Dead 2"" debate, and while the atmosphere of the first is more dark and horrific, the second has a good pace, equal or better effects and a ramped-up sense of humor that has made it the bigger film... and done in such a way where you can watch it without seeing the original, perhaps making the first film obsolete. Throw on the franchise addition of ""Army of Darkness"" and now the 2013 remake, and the brand might have lost its luster (just a tad).<br/><br/>What is perhaps most interesting is the cultural impact the film had, even for those who never actually watched it and probably never will. Bruce Campbell launched a successful acting career (and an almost stalkerish legion of fans), Raimi made other great movies and was given the Spider-Man franchise. And then you have the Coen brothers, who got their start on this picture in the editing department. Few directors have had a bigger impact on film over the last few decades than the Coens. And they have this film to thank for that.<br/><br/>So, for me, I recognize ""Evil Dead"" as the classic (both ult and otherwise) that it is, despite my preference for the sequel. Where I really see the film's strength is not in its horror, though, but as a homework assignment for film students -- any cinematographer who does not learn a trick or two from Raimi is not even trying. The angles, the zooms, the colors..."

Fast, fresh, and frequently funny, its old school practical effects (including stop motion animation) remain a treat to watch; the film may indeed be a little ""rough around the edges"", but that merely adds to its charm.<br/><br/>The story has five young chums - two guys, three gals - travelling to a cabin in the mountains who have their fun interrupted when by poking around some artifacts left by the cabins' previous tenant, they unleash the demons that had been dozing in the area. Once the demons start possessing this hapless quintet, it becomes clear that there's going to be plenty of bodily dismemberment going on.<br/><br/>Raimi and company aren't afraid to dispense with good taste here, as witness the notorious scene with a lecherous tree limb. The atmosphere is completely authentic and the performances totally committed. Bruce Campbell may be the breakout star of the production, as poor, tortured Ash, but everybody here delivers an entertaining performance. ""The Evil Dead"" shows some real imagination and ingenuity, and takes only the barest of breathers in between its assaults on your senses.<br/><br/>The film has a healthy respect for horror films of the past, and as an appreciable in joke, features a ripped up poster of Wes Cravens' ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in the cabins' basement. It's films like this that prove that old adage that the independent productions are great for forcing their makers to be creative, and everybody involved gets an A for effort (buffs will note that Raimis' friend Joel Coen was the assistant editor here), from composer Joseph LoDuca to cinematographer Tim Philo to makeup effects creator Tom Sullivan.<br/><br/>This remains great fun from viewing to viewing, and its two sequels kept up the tradition of imbuing the horror genre with a riotous sense of humour. A true crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","EVIL DEAD & EVIL DEAD 2 (1983) (1987) *** each.  Bruce Campbell became an indie horror cult hero thanks to gonzo filmmaker Sam Raimi for his breakneck camera techniques in these disturbingly, graphic violent horror flicks made on a shoe string budget with buckets of visceral gore and blood to spare involving square jawed hapless human cartoon Ash (Campbell - all slapstick virile gusto) - and his friends on a woodland outing in an abandoned cabin unwittingly unleashing a demonic force to be reckoned with when they read The Book of The Dead summoning hellish nightmares and unsettling results including the sequel's use of Ash's appendage as a chainsaw accessory (!) Rapid moving camerawork, awkward framing and amateur acting all comingle perfectly in this fetid stew of campy terror including a forest's stalking and raping of comely young women !"

","Pathetic low-budget horror from a very young Sam Raimi is nothing but a gross-out cinematic (if you can it that) experience. Bruce Campbell and four other equally dim-witted people go to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and release an unspeakable evil that will not stop until they are all dead. Every horror film ever made before ""The Evil Dead"" seems to have a little air time in this enormous yawn. The shoe-string budget was used on visually ugly special makeup effects that only lessen the value on an already useless flick. Like the equally worthless ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Evil Dead"" is a would-be-shocker that ends up being more stupid than anything else. If you want to see a good low-budget horror flick check out ""Night of the Living Dead"" (the 1968 version) or ""The Blair Witch Project"" instead. Turkey (0 stars out of 5)."

","An American horror; A story about five students staying in a remote cabin in Tennessee who unwittingly unleash evil spirits on the world after finding an ancient magical book. This cabin-in-the-woods story is a mix of suspense, camp, black comedy, and over-the-top gore by design. It has some inventiveness with camera angles and jump-scares, and its staging and setting is impressive. While the general workmanship is below par the 16mm film guage suits the grubby, low-budget intensity.
There isn't much depth to the story, and it has a predictable ending. It is crude in the way it shows women as objects of violence and there doesn't appear to be reasoning to the demonic forces, but the black comedy moments and tongue-in-cheek tone are good compensation. The best aspect is the sound design which helps sustains the atmosphere amidst some pretty grim acting."

"sonickid","3","1","7","11 June 2012"," ""Why are you torturing me like this?""
","I might get a lot of heat for this review, but, in my opinion as both a horror movie fan & a fan of cinema in general, ""The Evil Dead"" is simply a poorly executed film.<br/><br/>The plot is simple; a group of ""teenagers"" (calling them teenagers seems inaccurate, I'm in my early twenties & they look older than me) venture into the woods for a retreat at a cabin. In this macabre cabin they discover an ominous ancient book & an audio recording. After they play the audio recording, which recites a spell to reanimate the dead, that's when the ""horror"" begins.<br/><br/>The story is simple & easy to follow, & that is not a complaint. It is a unique way to create a movie about a common horror movie subject—the undead. The setting is well created; the woods (within Kentucky, I believe) are creepy & the cabin definitely has a very dark & ominous vibe.<br/><br/>Sadly the setting & the story are the only well-done elements in the movie. The dialogue was mediocre & the acting of the characters ranges from cardboard to obnoxious overacting. There were moments where I just wanted some of the characters to be killed off just to save me from their acting. Once the second character had ""turned,"" I just wanted the movie to end.<br/><br/>The special effects are really good; I give the creators credit in that regard; they did particularly well for an obviously low budget film. ""The Evil Dead"" definitely pours on the blood, guts, & gore; however, that didn't help my opinion of the movie; special effects simply aren't as important to me as good acting & coherent dialogue.<br/><br/>As far as the music score, at some points in the film it blended well with the events occurring while at other times it clashed.<br/><br/>Something as rudimentary as cinematography also struck me as amateur, not simply low budget but amateur.<br/><br/>If you would like to see a movie that properly combines elements of horror & black comedy, I would strongly recommend ""Frostbitten"" (Swedish title: ""Frostbiten"") or Hitchcock's black comedy films (specifically, ""The Trouble with Harry""); if you would like to see a very low-budget horror film, check out ""Just Before Dawn;"" if you want to see a simple-minded slasher-type gory horror movie, then see one of the Halloween sequels, its remake, or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake. All those disparate films have something in common that is lacking from ""The Evil Dead;"" they all have good acting.<br/><br/>I have read that this film was considered by some fans to ""take itself too seriously"" compared to the rest of its series, perhaps I'd feel different about it after watching its sequels; however, I cannot recommend this movie; if you're looking for any of the elements that I mentioned above, check out the other suggestions I mentioned."

","Like most people I know, I was first introduced to the Evil Dead films with 1993's Army of Darkness. The latter was one of my favourite action/comedy/adventure films when I was a boy. I still remember to this day when my father first told me about the original Evil Dead. He told me, however, unlike Army of Darkness, the original film was a ""real"" serious horror film. He also told me that it was the first movie that he and my mother had watched during their first date....<br/><br/>I was never allowed to watch the film until I was a teenager, and when I finally did.....I was truly terrified. I had never seen a horror movie like it before, and to this day, I have never really seen another horror movie like it since. For me, I really think that The Evil Dead is still a pretty scary movie today.<br/><br/>The plot is rather simple and somewhat cliché. Five college friends journey deep into the Tennessee woods to vacation at a small creepy cabin. They later find an old tape recorder that when played allows demons living in the woods. One by one, they become possessed until only Ash (Bruce Campbell) remains.<br/><br/>There is just something incredibly frightening about this movie that I don't believe any other film has ever been able to recreate. Many viewers find parts of the film funny, but for me, I never did. The part where you see Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) engulfed in the darkness of the cellar, looking up and laughing demonically with the blue goo dribbling down her chin is, for me, something truly creepy and disturbing even to this day.<br/><br/>The make-up of the ""deadites"" may look cheap, but I think that that just makes them all the more creepy. Even the deadites in Evil Dead II (which had a bigger budget) did not seem almost as menacing and truly ""evil"" as their original counterparts. That being said, I don't even think the deadites in the 2013 remake lived up to the terror of the original.<br/><br/><br/><br/>10/10"

1. The character Ash (Bruce Campbell) is so loveable, honest, charming, and funny.
This was the foundation of his character that has given me decades of enjoyment watching him evolve into the indestructable, and totally amusing deadite killer that he became.
2. Sam Raimi with his killer camera work is second to none.
3. It is still a cult classic, after 36 years. And I believe that every evil dead follower is just as rabid and loyal as myself. They know what I mean if ""they get it""

About the movie? Simply put, four teens go to an old creepy cabin in the woods, wake up demons by reading from the book of the dead, which in turn possess the teens. Ash then, has to deal with crazy demons who are trying to get him to ""JOIN THEM"".

","Although it spawned both a beloved horror series as well as an acclaimed television series, I can't help but feel that ""The Evil Dead"" is underrated. Likely it's because of the one-two punch of the crowd pleasing sequels, but Sam Raimi's directorial debut is often dismissed by series fans in favor of its more comedic continuations. In my opinion however, this is the strongest entry in the series. It's strikingly atmospheric and ominous from the very first shot and it never lets up: There's the remote setting, the oppressive atmosphere, the downright unsettling use of sound, and impressive practical effects. Buoyed by Raimi's gonzo, go-for-broke directorial style, the movie also manages to both establish and maintain a palpable senses of dread, and the final result is one of the best examples of grindhouse cinema."

","If someone asked me ""Luke, describe in 400 words what happens in The Evil Dead""...I would probably struggle. Basic plot is basic. Group of teenagers go to remote cabin in woods, discover book of the dead, play a tape recording speaking some dead lingo and then creepy stuff happens. I've seen the remake a good few times, this is my first watch of the original and actually I would probably rate them the same for different reasons. An advantage that the original has, is Sam Raimi. Wow. Probably his best film. He does lack some technical finesse but the inventive POV camera tracking shots through the woods were incredibly effective. When Ash climbs up the stairs in the basement, when he walks through the cabin...extremely well crafted camera techniques that heighten the experience. His writing was also good, not the best but better than your average horror. There are hints of personality to our characters, particularly Ash, but I don't think it was enough to make me care about them. A slight dark comedic undertone within the script but it's extremely subtle. The star of the film is the makeup design. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it. Blood is spewing out everyone eventually, bodies start to decompose in rapid stop cuts (great editing during those scenes) and when the teenagers start to become possessed...some of them looked damn terrifying! The prosthetics were innovative as well, particularly the infamous tree rape scene which had been originally cut in several countries (I wonder why...). Let's face it, in 1981 no one ever saw anything quite like this in terms of gruelling horror...it was bound to be cut and edited to make theatrical releases in different countries. This isn't so much a scary film, more aimed towards the gore sub-genre. Some of the characters felt way too calm given the circumstances. Seriously, who would be relaxed if they disembodied their friend? An effective and inventive gory horror that just lacks technical finesse and memorable supporting characters."

","'The Evil Dead (1981)' had a very low budget and it certainly shows. Yet, despite this, it looks and feels very convincing. Some dialogue is hokey, the acting can be hammy and wooden at times and a couple of scenes made me laugh due to their slightly campy nature, but the overall experience is charmingly entertaining. There's this mix of genuine horror and trash-induced bemusement, with some moments causing full-on unease and others provoking unintended chuckles, but this actually all adds to the off-kilter vibe of the picture. It's admirable that a group of people went into the woods and made a film, despite all the issues that befell them, and that adds to its ornate allure. You can almost feel the passion coming off the screen, and this (ironically) gives it a soul so much warmer than any studio ever could. It's well-made (especially for the shoe-string budget), gory, iconic and can be pretty tense and suspenseful, too. There's something to be said for the fact that, for the most part, it pulls you into its world and doesn't let you out until its credits roll. Even when it lapses slightly, the laughter it causes adds to the experience as opposed to detracting from it, and the occasional paint-peeling just proves that the film was made by a rag-tag team of friends. And if they can do it, so can you. 7/10"

For me, the first one of the trilogy of the deadnites is the best one.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell played the role of his life in those movies and with the new show Ash vs. Evil Dead, he is on top as a B-movie actor again."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","2","2 April 2017"," Sam Raimi's Breakthrough Feature Is An Absurd Mix Of Chilling Horror & Ludicrous Comedy
","Horror comedies aren't really my thing. It's a mashup of two polar opposite genres that works for me only when it's more a comedy than horror i.e. the latter aspects are diluted to a great extent. However, when the horror part is expertly executed & genuinely effective, the presence of humour in the subsequent moments feels like a spoilsport.<br/><br/>And that's exactly what happened with The Evil Dead. The entire build-up, the ominous ambiance, the jump scares, excess gore & violence, and almost all the aspects that make a horror film stand out are utilised to near-perfection but their impact is instantly doused by the ludicrous sequences & surplus campiness and it pretty much ruins the whole experience.<br/><br/>The story of The Evil Dead takes place at a remote cabin in the woods where five college students arrive to spend a peaceful weekend. While exploring the place, they come across an ancient book & an audiotape and inadvertently release a demonic force from the surrounding forest which takes them one by one, and turns their vacation into a nightmarish race for survival.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Sam Raimi, The Evil Dead is his breakthrough feature film and combines the elements of horror & comedy in a wicked manner to provide an experience that's as spine-tingling as it is absurd. It's a weird state to be in, shocked at one moment while laughing uncontrollably at other times and it may be the very reason behind its strong cult following over the years.<br/><br/>The film's isolated surrounding evoke a sinister aura from the beginning, and the way Raimi builds up its tense atmosphere is worthy of a mention. The jump scares keep surfacing from time to time and the inventive camera-work only adds to its eerie mood. But all of it is diminished by its farcical wit while the exaggerated performances from its cast leaves you wondering what it aims to do.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Evil Dead is cited by many as one of the greatest horror films ever made but I don't share that sentiment. I do believe, however, that it would've been a downright thrilling chiller had Raimi aimed for a full-fledged horror than his patented mix of two opposing genres. All in all, I'm sure many dig its uniqueness & the jarring experience it provides but I'm equally certain that it isn't for me."

","Watching The Evil Dead in 2010s is kind of weird. It feels like one hell of a trope fest, but you can't help but think, how many of these tropes did this movie start? How can I judge that when I don't know, and it's for a review on a blog and I'm too lazy to do some research? And it's better to not actually address all that, because then I'd have to talk again about how stupid the characters are, because everyone's always a total idiot in horror movies. If I had to address that every time I watched horror movies, I'd probably never watch another horror movie again.<br/><br/>While the story is great, and this is an excellent things there are few things that bother me. One of them is the cinematography. It's sometimes so weird and bad it ruins the mood. And sometimes it feels like the movie is a bad home video made by my dad. That is an eccentric look and it could be either good or bar. In this movie that look did work, but then most of the cinematography was just weird.<br/><br/>Another thing was the effects, but hey, it's the 1980s, so it's not like I was expecting something hyper realistic. And I think it's better this way. All that crappy make up and stuff makes everything even more horrifying. You can't really get that same feeling with CGI.<br/><br/>While I notice and can acknowledge why The Evil Dead has that reputation as cult classic, and I see why it was a big deal when it came out, it kinda leaves me cold. Could be the fact that it's kind of short, and I'm hoping to see more of Ash. There's something really charming about Bruce Campbell as Ash, and I don't know what it is yet. But even if I'm not a big fan of the Evil Dead, I'm definitely going to see the second movie, and also The Army of Darkness."

","Evil Dead 7/10 If one were to go out and search top ten horror movie list on the internet, you'll without doubt find Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead appear more often than not. The Evil Dead is made cheap, free and easy at the same time introducing some interesting camera tricks to create great suspense. The camera zig zagging throughout the woods at just above ground level chasing its actors still holds up as a great technique. However, there is a bit of absurdity to the nature of this possession when trees rape and lamps talk, all the while taking itself really seriously. There is also an overuse of gore with bodily fluids and blood that didn't match well with the bright colored demon makeup. Many scenes dragged on for too long and some of the actresses really overacted the crazy all-out horror scenes. If it wasn't for the innovative camera work, creepy location and Bruce Campbell, I'm not sure we're talking about this cult classic that still gains popularity to this day."

","When five students; Ash, his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, his friend Scotty and Scotty's girlfriend Shelly, go for a weekend away in a remote cabin in the Tennessee woods they anticipate having a good time it soon becomes apparent that they will be getting something very different. Things get slightly creepy before they even get into the cabin and this quickly escalates when they explore the cellar and find an old book and a tape recording made by a previous resident; an archaeologist. It tells how he found the 'Book of the Dead' on a dig in the Middle East and how reading a certain incantation summoned evil spirits; the recording includes the incantation and soon evil forces are making their presence felt. Cheryl hears something and goes into the woods to investigate; here she is grabbed by the trees and raped! She manages to get away but it later becomes apparent that she is possessed by an evil spirit; a spirit that is determined to possess each of the others. Before the night is out they will experience a number of grizzly terrors as they are attacked and more of them become possessed.<br/><br/>This low budget horror has become a cult classic; helped by the fact that it was banned here in the UK for many years as one of the so called 'video nasties'. No doubt this also added to its scariness as I was constantly expecting something horrible to happen! There were plenty of good scary moments as well as some fairly gruesome scenes and the infamous 'tree rape' scene is genuinely disturbing even if nothing really offensive is shown. The story is simple, which isn't a bad thing in a short horror film. The effects are distinctly low budget but still effective; frequently the creepiness is provided just by unusual camera angles, lighting and a few strange sounds which keep the viewer on edge. Director Sam Raimi did a great job creating such an atmosphere. The cast does a decent enough job, most notable Bruce Campbell in the role of Ashley. They are perhaps a bit old to be playing 'college kids' but that hardly matters as their age doesn't affect the story. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to horror fans at is a classic of the genre."
"tankace","8","0","1","7 November 2016"," Small budget ,huge pay off and copycats!
","Evil Dead of 1981 is among the most historic horror movies and low budget flicks alike.The 22 year old back then Sam Raimi with only 350 to 400 thousands dollars at his disposal and his closest friends, among them the now legendary Bruce Campbell, he made the ground zero for the cabin in the hoods archetype we all know and frankly had ourselves full of it. So that is a bonus reason why to watch it or re-watch: to see how this sub-genre of horror is done well.<br/><br/>The story is simple,nice and neat, five friends go for some days in a cabin in the hoods and during their stay there are attacked by demonic spirits and do their best to survive this onslaught of demons and gulls.And there is the stuff that imitators are made of ,for many future directors and studios just saw the low budget and high score (with only limited release it made 2.4 millions, which means about 6 times its budget) and went berserk to carbon copy the formula in order to get a piece of this new pie.<br/><br/>As I have wrote before this one of the issues with the movie making business, when something new comes into view and critics, audiences and even the Oscars love it, studios don't look why the movie or series of movies made money, for the causes like ,good script, nice characters, captivating scenes which made sense in the story, the original or good- looking or interesting cinematography. No they focused to the gore, locations of the incident and genre, the external features of the flick and not the ones that matter. For the people don't love Star Wars, Deadpool or Saving Private Ryan ,because are science fiction, gory and R-rated or brutal respectively, they like them for their unique style, story and characters.<br/><br/>Anyway to finish my rant about this issue ,when something is popular don't carbon copy it, made the style your own and give it something of you, this why City of God is praised like the movie from which took inspirations The Goodfellas and Legends was boring as hell.<br/><br/>As for the legacy of Evil Dead, it is huge and has got a cult status equal to the Clockwork Orange, Fight Club and Labyrinth and today is put at the same category with classics of the horror genre like Dracula (1931), Psycho (1960), Halloween (1978), Jaws (1975) and Scream (1992). To add to that even nowadays we see it in its great sequels and TV series which as far as I heard of is pretty groovy.<br/><br/>All in all I recommended for anyone that likes horror movies and new directors who want some idea how to make their first horror flick. Also to the latter group if it isn't as good as you wanted to, don't be too hard on yourselves, usually the first time is the hardest and the one with the most mistakes, the next one will be better, expect from Syamalan then it is the other way around lol!"

","It's always fun to go back and watch films with a mass-cult following. Perhaps no horror film in history has a bigger cult following than The Evil Dead, and rightfully so. Director Sam Raimi and the small cast made one of the most intense and original films to date.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's hard for myself to go back and watch horror films from decades ago, especially those with a smaller budget. Most of the time the lack of sufficient funds to edit horror pictures make the end product a lot less re-watchable. With The Evil Dead, the one-setting and minimalistic story actually adds to the film and makes it all the more terrifying. Yes, 5 friends spending a night in a secluded cabin in the middle of the forest with little lighting is unsettling, but with Raimi's amateur directing style, it's horrifying.<br/><br/>Of course, I mean amateur with the best intentions. This was essentially a film funded using what we call 'kick-starter' now, with a bunch of his friends. Bruce Campbell being the one friend who went on to do extensive acting. Although Raimi didn't have the proper funds necessarily, there's actually a lot more skillful directing than you may think. You imply just have to look at the effective camera placement in suspenseful sequences to know this guy had a future in the filmmaking industry.<br/><br/>The first act of the film is played out a lot like an old Hitchcock suspense thriller. It's all about ""what you don't see"" that make the hairs raise on the back of your neck. Until the film changes into a contained gore fest for the last hour which is among the best slasher pictures of the 80's. The dialogue and acting isn't all that great but it makes for a solid B-movie atmosphere, which was common for plenty of horror films of that time. It's great on its own, but the story behind the making of the film certainly certifies this as one of horror-cinema's crown jewels.<br/><br/>+You can already see Raimi's talent<br/><br/>+One cabin, one forest, one friend group<br/><br/>+Atmospheric <br/><br/>-Dialogue<br/><br/>8.2/10"

I still love the atmosphere that this film creates and how it really is ahead of its time in terms of character development and playing with the horror movie tropes.

Yes, The Evil Dead is a plain slasher and in the name of horror it is being praised a wrong word. You might get some hint of horror-pass plot line but isn't actually. In fact, from the very first half an hour, stupid points of haunting elements are depicted which nowhere takes a spectator to feel a real charm of horror. It's just straightforward, rubbish extraction of big horror names. <br/><br/>Gibberish! Story has nothing much to offer. Direction is wasted. Characters are way gibberish. Their acting is nowhere near to make a smooth flow of movie. Only Bruce Campbell was up to the mark for which the movie can be taken to the last scene and get a bite of satisfaction. Cinematography is alright for what thrilling scenes have to offer. And it was an icing on no ice-cream for keeping it short to less than 90 minutes. Though Sam Raimi improved a lot and made few other smarter movies, I guess but this is definitely not his gem. This was a pure insult to horror genre."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","3","9 July 2016"," The ultimate in raw, independent film-making
","Sam Raimi's acclaimed horror debut is certainly not for the faint of heart. As the advertising slogan goes, what many consider to be ""the ultimate experience in gruelling terror"" is a gripping, frightening, gory roller-coaster ride through all manner of unbelievable and scary happenings. I actually think the first half hour of this film is the best, just before all hell breaks loose and the special effects guys have a field day. The first half hour is the set up, an atmospheric sequence full of dark shadows, spooky cellars and the eerie isolation of a remote cabin in the woods - the film manages to tap into the same fears that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT later exploited.<br/><br/>The amateur nature of the film means that the acting can hardly be called ""refined"", although most of the youngsters manage to make their characters likable and convincingly portray terrified people. Favourites include Cheryl, who is the first to get spooked out and who draws a picture of the book of the dead; Scotty, the joker and natural leader of the group; and Ash, who overcomes being a wimp in the first half to become a shotgun-wielding executioner in the second. The amateurish aspect does have its strong points however, as the film exudes a kind of ""raw terror"" in which the viewer can really relate to the characters and their situation.<br/><br/>The graphic gore content certainly earned the film a notoriety - it was very nearly classified as a ""video nasty"" - and of course it got heavily cut by the BBFC. Seen uncut, it's a surprisingly nasty and gruesome little film where the gore may not be convincing but is certainly disturbing. Watching a zombie biting off its own hand from which a white liquid then sprays is one of the most horrible things I've watched. Other ""highlights"" include a scene where a zombie is dismembered with an axe and the body parts continue to wriggle like jelly, a woman getting stabbed in the ankle with a pencil, an eye-gouging, a zombie getting its face burnt off in a fire, and the celebrated ending in which the final zombies suffer total meltdown - achieved via some natty stop motion animation for total disgustingness.<br/><br/>It's rare when a film manages to combine both old-fashioned atmosphere and new-fangled gore so successfully, but this is a milestone in that aspect. Black comedy is also thrown into the brew to lighten up some heavier moments, such as when Ash tries to give the mortally wounded Scotty a drink - but the poor man is unable to swallow. The demon/zombie creatures themselves are covered in a crude blue makeup but achieve their desired scariness by having some horrible looking blank yellow eyes which really makes them look sick. Their mocking of Ash also provides some chills as they sing ""we're gonna get you, we're gonna get you!"" and laugh at his situation. Two scenes involving the zombies stick in my mind; the first ""shock"" moment where a card game is interrupted by a girl suddenly possessed, and the scene where a zombie smashes up from the basement taunting Ash with the words ""It's your sister Cheryl!"". These guttural demon voices have to be heard, but they're just another highlight in a film full of great, memorable scenes.<br/><br/>In the film's most notorious scene, we see an innocent girl run out into the woods - to promptly get tied up by a number of branches and shoots and then suffer a supernatural sexual assault. In a startling display of bad taste and misogyny, we watch as the possessed tree first strips the heroine of her clothes and then attacks her with a branch. Followed by a brilliant sequel and a not-so-brilliant second sequel, THE EVIL DEAD really is a sick modern classic and a must for all gore fans. And on top of that it's darned scary with it. A true horror film then."
"schroeder-gustavo","10","0","1","12 March 2016"," The Evil Dead Review
","I'm just gonna go ahead and say this, I truly believe The Evil Dead is one of the greatest movies ever made. I admire this movie on so many levels it's insane. Quick back story on The Evil Dead: Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi grew up together and made several low budget Super-8 mm films. Sam Raimi then had the idea of directing a horror movie and had a budget of about $1500 and he made a short film called Within the Woods. The idea of that film was to attract producers and use the money gained from that to create a full-length film. He then even asked friends and family for money to create his project. With around $350 000, Raimi set out to make a remake of his short film. What we got was The Evil Dead. The thing that interests me about the film so much (other than the film itself) is the production. With limited budget, Raimi had to cast friends of his (including Campbell) for the film. The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The team had absolutely no assistance from location scouts and they had to find a fitting location for the film. They found an actual abandoned cabin in the woods in Tennessee to shoot. During pre-production, the entire team had to stay in the isolated cabin that had no plumbing, no heating and was far away from any medical assistance. Due to the crew's inexperience, many of them got lost in the woods and several got injured. One of the actresses even had her eyelashes completely torn off while taking off her mask. Because of the low budget, contact lenses to create the ""demon-eyes look"" were very thick and had to be taken off every 15 minutes because they eyes could not breathe. They could not afford a camera dolly so they had to build several things to create the desired camera movement, including attaching the camera to lumber. On the last few days of shooting, the conditions were so terrible, they began to burn furniture in order to stay warm. The actors went weeks without showering and many caught a cold because of the poor conditions. Shooting took 3 months and shortly after that, looking at the footage Raimi realized there were holes that needed to be filled (no pun intended) but the actors had already left the set and were already busy with other projects. So family members of Raimi filled in for the actors for the re- shooting of some scenes. Several sounds were not recorded properly, so dead chickens were stabbed to replicate the sound of mutilated flesh and Campbell had to scream into a mic for several hours. After months of torture, the project was finished. <br/><br/>So, is the film any good? Absolutely. It's a staple of modern horror. It's a clichéd script by now but it's executed perfectly. The movie knows what it is and it never tries to be anything else than what it needs to be. It's gory, silly and unapologetic. It has just the right amount of gore, horror, and black humor to be great. Campbell's great in the film, although he doesn't really shine as much in this as in Evil Dead II. But the film isn't about the acting. As a matter of fact, the script is minimal and so is the acting, but the movie's purpose is to be campy horror schlock and it succeeds in every way possible. Every jump scare is earned through tension. The gore is so ludicrous, it's great. I love the creative angles they used with the camera, as well as the use of fog. This is a perfect example of an extremely low budget movie executed to perfection. The Evil Dead isn't really that scary (at least to me) but it's so much fun and so much effort went into making it, I love it for that. The Evil Dead is one of my favorite films of all time and to end this review I want to quote critic James Berardinelli from his review of the film: ""The extreme nature of the gore isn't beside the point - it is the point. Raimi goes so far over the top in presenting these displays that they take on a campy, almost humorous appearance. It's impossible to take all this blood seriously. So, instead of being sickened, we're strangely amused - and this is all intentional.""<br/><br/>10/10"

This film takes it further with a possessed forest that possesses people into a zombie like state. It opens with a car load of college kids heading to the mountains to a remote rundown cabin. The moment they arrive to a bridge that nearly crumbles beneath them they should have turned back. At any rate they get acquainted and find the book of the dead in the basement. From there the words are enacted and all hell breaks lose. One of the females ventures outside and is raped by vines and possessed tree branches. This is a highlighted moment and perhaps the most disturbing scene in the entire film. This is truly weird and soon enough the other three women are possessed and acting weird. One of the males attempts to flee and is attacked and barely makes it back. Bruce Campbell is the only actor with anything to work with and he is constantly blasting giggling female zombies with a shovel to the head and burying them. This does not end well but director Sam Raimi is innovative with passable special effects that are more applause worthy than not. This is a satire of the classic Living Dead films that contains a few laughs and promises greater things for Raimi. Score: 6 ½ / 10"

","I wish I hadn't heard this since I like to go into films without expectations, but right before the movie played in class my buddy talked it up as a really campy film that I would enjoy. Yes there were cheesy and flat-out stupid lines in the film that I laughed at, but these were mainly at the beginning. Also, according to my professor this was supposed to be gut-wrenching scary, but I was ultimately unimpressed with the horror aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>Apparently this title has a rating of NC-17 because of the horror/gore aspects of the film, but I didn't find these elements to be even remotely scary - though I could see how they would be frightening in an early 80s movie. For me, though, when the teens were infected by the spirits, they looked exactly how I expected the un-dead in early 80s movies to look, if not even worse since they had strange tints to their skin. Also, in the second half of the film, there are moments when the spirits just kind of decide to make the infected appear normal for a minute just to fool the main character. So, the un-dead are only un-dead when they choose to be?<br/><br/>I think if there were more funny moments (whether intentionally or unintentionally funny) it would have made the film more enjoyable since I expected to see something very campy, but this was just a plain bad horror film, though nowhere near as bad as Night of the Living Dead. In fact, when I watched Night of the Living Dead it broke so many continuity rules and had so many cheesy parts that I was laughing throughout the film. I guess something like that experience is what I expected, but to me this was just a standard horror film with a low budget."

","It has corny effects...that are awesome! It has hammy performances... that are great! And some of the most atmospheric direction and creative use of limited resources you'll see in any film. On a budget of somewhere between 350 and $400,000, Raimi was able to churn out a film that received praise from Stephen King for being ""terrifying"" and went on to gross $2.4 million on its original release. So let's dust off our old VHS, get our box tellies out of the garden shed, dim the lights and take in this horror classic: Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.<br/><br/>Our story begins with our hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) going with his girlfriend Linda, her sister Cheryl, and another couple Scott and Shelley to stay at a cabin in the woods. These early scenes are a little painful, with Ash failing to gain much interest..or anything.<br/><br/>Some typical foreboding things happen on their way to the cabin (a near hit car incident and a semi-collapsing bridge) but they make it the cabin safely. Upon getting there Cheryl's hand is possessed by Satan (or something similar) and she draws a weird picture. Inexplicably finding this normal, she mentions it to no one. Later on at dinner time the attic door in the cabin flings open, Ash and Scott decide to check it out, again because there's nothing abnormal about an attic door flinging itself up for no reason. In the attic they find the Book of the Dead and an old tape player with some incantations on it. Needless to say these incantations release evil and demonic spirits.<br/><br/>Cheryl was already demonically possessed earlier and so naturally she is the first to really have horrific things happen to her, like a pretty full on scene where she is violated by a tree. She gets back inside and no one believes her. This is pretty good gradual revelation as the audience and Cheryl know more than the other four characters. Cheryl is understandably hysterical and so Ash tries to drive her back into town, but they realize that the semi collapsed bridge has fully collapsed and they are trapped at the cabin.<br/><br/>They arrive back at the cabin and Cheryl turns full zombie. From there they turn one by one until it's just Ash remaining trying to survive the night and survive the zombies.<br/><br/>As classical as a horror film plot that is, and I hope from that synopsis of the setup that it comes across just how well this movie builds in the first act, the real star is the awesome shots of the camera zooming through the woods. Now, they couldn't afford dollies on their budget so apparently Raimi tried everything from improvised wooden sliders using trees to getting two guys to run around in the woods holding a camera attached to a wooden rail sleeper. However he did it, Raimi and his virtually novice crew are able to create the sensation of a spirit or force moving through the woods. These shots are unsettling in the first act and downright frightening as the film continues.<br/><br/>Another star is the gore effects, even though there are some scenes where you can see blood capsules and melting plastic. In the end, these zombie looking things actually are pretty scary and do work, at least within the world this film happens in.<br/><br/>Campbell does grow on you as the film continues and his panicked flailing near the end of the film is excellent. The rest of the cast are inexperienced and do what they're asked by a director who appears to be taking great pleasure in subjecting them to all manner of discomforts and indignities.<br/><br/>This film was widely praised when it came out and still highly regarded now. I think I've revealed the most unexpectedly disgusting part, but there's a lot of stuff in here that may offend. With this type of story and budget, you know what to expect, but you can also expect to get a film far better than you typical horror outing. One of the very best the horror genre has to offer."

","Again, a film of which I'm certain I've seen it before - probably a long time ago - but manages to blow me away as if it were the first time. Sam Raimi's much acclaimed feature debut is a gory, filmicly orgasmic shocker that is built around a simple, but effective given. There was only one little part of the gore that was too obviously fake, which was a zombie face (I think it was Cheryl's) that too clearly a mask. Effects-wise, of course, you'll have to accept this film as being a product of the eighties, but for me that is no problem; this is a rare one that even scared the bejesus out of me at times. Of course, horror icon Bruce Campbell shows why he deserves to have become just that, but also the rest of the cast is utterly convincing. And then, the direction: Sam Raimi proved to be nothing less than a grandmaster at a young age (though I'm not that curious about 'Oz the Great and Powerful' or the Spider-man trilogy), using fantastic angles, music, zooms and such for maximum horror pleasure. I can't leave you without mentioning, nay praising the 'tree' scene, wherein a beautiful young female is being... just go see it, and see for yourself if you disagree (I just read, shockingly, that there are indeed people who didn't like this...!); then, and only then, you could try the remake - I haven't made up my mind about it, yet...<br/><br/>A big 9 out of 10 for this justified classic. By the way, this is my 200th review for IMDb. Thank you for reading, I hope I can be of some small service; best wishes for 2014!"
"phubbs","8","0","2","21 November 2013"," The Evil Dead
","The biggest cult film ever? well maybe. Back in the good old days of the 80's this film was seen as the biggest splatter fest flick ever here in the UK, it was banned in some countries and labelled the number one video nasty, top of the hit list. There was just no way in heaven or hell you would get to see this as a kid back in the day, it was just as bad as porn...if not worse!, will someone please think of the children!!.<br/><br/>Well those days are long gone now and the film is looked upon as jokey and tame! a horror comedy with an iconic central character and bucket loads of hammy gory visuals. What is interesting for me is the fact this first film wasn't suppose to be a horror comedy, its not a horror comedy at all. Its only since the sequels that the franchise kinda leaned that way, this film was an all out horror which was suppose to scare people, and back in the day it did just that.<br/><br/>The main hook with this film is obviously the effects, its a horror film, ergo its effects are the main crux. The effects in this film are in places bad, they look cheesy, badly animated with dodgy editing. But the key thing to remember is this was because of budget restrains and limits on technology...but mainly lack of money. All the effects were made as best as they could make them, using every penny, every drop of fake blood, every piece of material gathered and utilising as much imagination as possible in both camera usage and illusion.<br/><br/>This ultimately makes the effects terrific despite the fact they do look very dated and highly dubious now. The films visuals are a success because of the fact Raimi and co had to be creative to get them done, they had to think out of the box with little money. This is why some older films work so well as they couldn't just sit back and rely on CGI to do it all for them, they had to really work and show real craftsmanship to make it work. All the blood, bone and goo may look corny in places but its real, its really there and basically that will always look better than CGI.<br/><br/>Of course back in the day the effects were seen as reasonable slick to a degree but still hokey, they weren't groundbreaking by any means. But the flair, creativity, ingenuity and sheer amount of gore was groundbreaking. Worst bit in the entire film for me? when a possessed 'Cheryl' stabs 'Linda' in the ankle with a pencil, oh my god that sound effect when the pencil punctures her foot!. I think it was the sound of an apple getting pierced?. Then the fact she twists and pulls on the pencil opening up the wound!! that always makes me wince.<br/><br/>The plot is so damn basic it hurts, plus what we see half the time is so stupid you can't help but laugh. Why would anyone want to spend time in a tiny remote cabin like that firstly, secondly when things get creepy why does one girl wander off into the dark dark woods alone? errrr hello?? and then there's dumb ass 'Ash' falling for the old 'help me I'm OK' trick from his possessed friends. Did I mention continuity errors like Ash's hair?. Have to remind myself this film is very dated and was the first of its kind of sorts, this is the original horror in the woods.<br/><br/>For me its not as strong ever since the comedy themed sequels but its still a powerhouse of originality no doubt. The gore isn't shocking these days but more of a really good example and lesson in how to go about creating your own special effects. See what can be achieved with a little thought. Its not even particularly scary these days either, that ship has sailed now for most adults methinks, but its not about that, its just the cornball horror ride you get out of it, the thrills and the fact its such a classic now.<br/><br/>8/10"

","So a party of friends play innocent in a haunting that is so out-of-the-way up the hills. A typical set up for terror. At the beginning it's easy to get lost in the character's stories, understandable for what's really in store. Just minutes it already tries to creep you, but the 'good' stuff really comes in later on. Basically the movie will try to haunt and creep you all the way to the end. It does a good job at that. The setting feels somewhat clamped in, which adds to the overall ambient horror. Acting may be cheezy and visuals korny. I enjoyed the film although they could have done things better but what more could they have done back then?<br/><br/>Because of modern horror films of late, many may not appreciate the movie. I have to admit I can't deny being jaded. If you see beyond that then you can appreciate the smart visuals, gore and terror material, which is what highlights this movie I believe."
"nesfilmreviews","8","0","2","14 October 2013"," Raimi's debut might be short on budget, but it's hardly bereft of ideas or spirit.
","Nauseating and amusing in equal measure, ""Evil Dead"" is one horror movie that easily obtains its cult status, managing to surpass even your wildest imagination of gore and visceral violence. This is the first installment of the popular Evil Dead trilogy -- a low-budget, B-grade gore-fest horror film with the Stephen King quote-tagline: ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror."" A thinly scripted screenplay becomes a kaleidoscope of skewed camera angles and energetic panache under Raimi's remarkably assured guidance and direction. His debut might be short on budget, but it's hardly bereft of ideas or spirit.<br/><br/>Five Michigan State University students spend the weekend in a remote Tennessee cabin, and inadvertently unleash dormant, demonic, evil spirits. In the cellar of the cabin, they find an archaeologist's tape-recording describing the contents of the Naturon Demonto (Book of the Dead). Unaware they are unleashing demonic forces -- one by one -- they must fight off evil spirits, and avoid becoming demoniacally possessed. <br/><br/>It's obvious that Raimi takes great pleasure in all of his demented material, and he's eager to share it with an audience that's left equally shocked and thrilled. ""The Evil Dead"" is much more of a straight horror movie than its successors, but it's no less fun. Heads and arms are frequently severed, but it's all done in such a fun spirit, and in a over-the-top manner that it's difficult not to grin. ""The Evil Dead"" is at times genuinely creepy, due in part to the imaginative camera-work devised by Sam Raimi, and cinematographer Tim Philo. The ""shaky cam"" (in which the camera gave us the point-of-view of the demon rushing through the woods), became a staple of the Evil Dead series. Raimi and company empty the tank of all its gore, make-up, camera, and stop-motion tricks into an unforgettable, resounding success of entrepreneurial filmmaking."

","If you look at the budget Sam Raimi had to make this, it is incredible what the end result it. Of course having a good friend with the name of Bruce Campbell always helps. That's some value right there for almost no money at all. But Sam puts Bruce in every one of his movies, so I'm pretty sure he made up for the thin salary on this one. On the other hand, Sam likes to put Bruce through some ordeals and this movie is not different in that approach.<br/><br/>The movie though is straight horror. The sequels became much lighter in tone (especially the third one). It's also one of the movies that hasn't been released completely uncut in Germany! I won't spoil anything, when I say the two key scenes that are missing involve a pencil and a tree! If you've seen the movie, you know those scenes are pretty horrific and make the movie what it is too. Make up is great and the camera on the water device Sam came up with is just one of his technical ingenuities!"
"mrrockey","8","0","1","15 August 2013"," Amateur Filmmaking at its Finest
","The Evil Dead is amateur filmmaking at its finest. It was directed by an amateur filmmaker at the time, Sam Raimi and had a budget of only $375,000. So we have a director who has basically no training whatsoever and only made amateur short films prior to this, a budget of only $375,000, and a cast of actors who were just friends of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell and had no acting experience prior hand. This should have been a recipe for disaster but instead we got a fun, original, atmospheric, well-shot, and spooky horror film that proves once again that small budgets can still make great films. But why is that? Let's take a look and find out!<br/><br/>Firstly, the story. This film tells a very simple story about a group of college friends who decide to stay in a cabin together for a few days but end up encountering all sorts of demons when they open up the Book of the Dead. It all sounds very basic and simple but it works because unlike most movies, the story isn't really the meat of this movie. Most movies would have the story continually develop the characters but here, the story is just used as a setup for all the scenarios this movie throws at us. So in a nutshell, the story isn't especially deep and complex but it's not a problem because this movie really isn't about the characters, it's about the horror and that's what this movie delivers.<br/><br/>This movie's horror is very effective because of the way it's shot. Sam Raimi uses a lot of POV shots for the demons in this movie and it makes the forest seem really creepy because you can tell there's something out there but you don't see it, your imagination fills in the blanks for you and it makes it way scarier than if they just had some sort of optical printer effect or an animatronic because you picture whatever scares you to be in the forest. So the fact that this movie had a baby-size budget actually made it better because it allowed Raimi to think of more creative ways to create chills rather than just throwing in some cheap special effect. Kinda like Spielberg did with Jaws.<br/><br/>While the film is a horror film, it still has a campy feel to it which makes it more fun than if they played it completely straight. The demons are very over-the-top here with all their manic laughs and depraved faces but it makes you feel like a kid again watching this movie and that's always a good thing.<br/><br/>The sound design is also quite good in this movie. It creates an eerie mood with the strong wind blowing outside and the quietness in the cabin, it's really spooky! This makes for a good movie to watch late at night, all alone in your room in the dark, with no sound other than the movie. That's probably the best way to watch it.<br/><br/>The special effects here are actually pretty well done for such a small budget. They look cheesy but that's what makes it fun. It's okay to be a little cheesy sometimes and this is one of those times.<br/><br/>So this film is actually quite good in terms of its direction, camera- work and other technicals but it is flawed in some areas. The makeup on Betsy Baker looks a little cheap compared to the other makeup effects in this movie. Bruce Campbell's acting is a little hokey at times but it's expected for a first-time actor like him and it doesn't ruin the film. And the girls here aren't well defined enough for me to differentiate them. Towards the end of the movie, I had no idea which demon was which girl but it really doesn't matter because once again, this film isn't really about the characters, it's about the scares.<br/><br/>This film is also not for everyone. Not everybody will enjoy its campy tone, over-the-top style, and excessive gore but if you are in the mood for a good spook show then this movie is for you. I'm gonna give it a 8/10."

","If not for The Evil Dead (1981), The Cabin in the Woods wouldn't have a spot on the GPS. Or, dozens of other movies, for that matter.<br/><br/>I understand this is a cult hit, for many, many years. While I never was a huge fan –in fact, it took me a LONG while to finally see this (my first viewing was probably in the late 1990s,) I still appreciated its upbringing. Seeing it today, in 2013, I think I appreciate it even more.<br/><br/>The movie is pure craziness. It contains no sense of realism, the characters act like they know they're in a B-Movie and the ""joke's on them."" And the special effects, while fantastic for the budget they had, didn't always hold up today. Lightning from Plan 9 from Outer Space-type movies, anyone?<br/><br/>We have three girls and two boys headed towards a secluded cabin in deep woods when all hell breaks loose following a playing of a tape-recording of words from the Book of the Dead. From those words spoken, or replayed, craziness ensures, such as possession, Exorcistrees and, ah-hem, a wooden rape scene. Man, the dead play back.<br/><br/>Despite the maximum level of insane carnage, there is so much to appreciate here, from both an independent film lover and all horror connoisseurs. The cinematography was actually very well done – you can tell this young film maker/unknown at the time: Sam Raimi, had a future. The special effects and gore, in spite of the low budget, was beyond what it could've been. Like Raimi, you can tell these people knew what they were doing, even with the dollars they had to spend. And the cast gave it their all, with what they were given and the direction from a newbie, albeit someone who knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>That all said, in regards to the cast, unfortunately, as good as Bruce Campbell was, he will eventually, following this, of course, have even better charisma and show much more of his eventual talent. He just wasn't as developed here, as I would've liked to see of him.<br/><br/>And, the movie isn't perfect, and some of the scenes, ideas don't add up, such as a small Doctor Who'ish cabin that seems to have more rooms than the White House. But, if you just let yourself go, and remind yourself of the timeframe and budget, you can have a good time. And best of all, (SPOILER – sorry, but it has been 32 years, for the love of the dead) it was refreshing to have a male hero at the end of a horror tale. As much as I loved Halloween, or the numerous horror franchise films to follow, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, the heroine is always the take-down-the-villain character. For once, it's nice to have it be a male.<br/><br/>At any rate, it is recommended for horror and low-budget 1980s fare fans out there.<br/><br/>Side Note: I have listened to very few audio commentaries in my lifetime, to my dismay. But, one of the all-time favorites of mine, and most hilarious, was one of the 150 DVDs re-releases of The Evil Dead and it was a solo-Bruce Campbell commentary. I cannot state which DVD it is on, but I was laughing so hard with his words on it. It was one of those: Press play on the commentary, and if it picks up, continue. Well, it did ""pick up"" on minute 5 and Bruce never let up. He was absolutely uproarious. Not to miss his, if given the chance."

Thus, Ash has no other choice but to mutilate the living corpses of his sister (Ellen Sandweiss), girlfriend (Betsy Baker) and two of his friends (Sarah York & Hal Delrich).<br/><br/>While overcoming the problematic shoot for the cast and crew, Raimi unwittingly made horror film history in making the final survivor a male instead of the typical female victim in most '80s slashers. And Bruce Campbell is seemingly perfect for the role of Ash Williams. With his blue work shirt and all-American looks, Campbell played Ash as the average Joe who is not a jock or a ladies man but as someone whom we can root for. Stylistically, Raimi balances slow-moving suspense with his signature brand of humor more understated than the over-the-top aesthetic of the later sequels. Unfortunately, the filmmakers would soon find themselves in hot water.<br/><br/>When ""The Evil Dead"" hit movie screens in the United Kingdom, the film received an X rating and being named as a video nasty mainly because of the notorious ""tree-rape"" scene. I found the whole video nasty controversy to be ridiculous because Sam Raimi was out to create a horror film he wanted to make without executive interference and egotistical actors. And it doesn't deserve to be categorized along with the exploitative likes of ""Faces of Death"".<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" is a $350,000 masterpiece of American horror that must be seen to believe."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","0","2","21 March 2013"," A very strange break into film for Mr. Raimi
","Every famous moviemaker has a start somewhere. Some have greater beginnings (Steven Spielberg), while others are not truly recognized and are left with a strong cult following (Clive Barker). For Sam Raimi, he has the luxury of both. Not only did his first theatrical film gain popular momentum, but it also has such a large fan base that it spawned two sequels and a remake, not to mention it made the name Bruce Campbell a family name. Sam Raimi is a lucky man, but I was actually surprised to see that his first film was not what so many viewers have praised it to be. For me, it was scraping the surface of entertainment.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead (1981) story, written and directed by Sam Raimi himself is about five friends who decide to spend some time in a cabin secluded in the woods. Little do they realize that not only does the cabin contain a deadly secret but the entire area surrounding it is in need of some serious pest control. They should've called the Ghostbusters (1984),...oh right, that company was established three years later. Anyway, this dark secret has the power to unleash deadly spirits that can inhabit any host when read from a mystical book.<br/><br/>The thing I found the most troublesome about this movie was the fact that for everything I wanted to give full credit for, ended up only being partial credit. For example, I found the makeup effects noteworthy because it made the victims of the demons look really supernatural. However, what I could not take were the voices of the possessed victims. Either screechy and raspy, or deep and gurgley, I would prefer to hear one kind of demonic voice. At one point, one of the voices sounded like an upset stomach. I'll admit that it did make the possessed victim seem more unnatural but it still was hard on the ears.<br/><br/>But for a film with such a low budget, it does get creative with its practical effects. At some parts of the film, it even uses stop motion animation. One of those scenes is the vine-raping scene. Unfortunately, this is a particular part of the film I really wish Raimi did not include. It's one thing if the character gave consent for this kind of thing but watching a rape scene is a tad bit too far on the ""entertainment"" description. I just felt uncomfortable watching it. Why would anyone consider it fun to watch?<br/><br/>As for blood goes, audiences will get their fill of grossness. It's not a bloodfest but it is nasty. Just nasty. Bruce Campbell's character can't escape having buckets of blood thrown into his face every ten minutes. But here's where I get frustrated again. What is Raimi's icon? Is it Ash (Bruce Campbell)? Or is it the demon spirits that inhabit his friends? For most horror films, the antagonist is the icon that represents the franchise but in this film, I can't figure it out since the audience will never get to see the demon that inhabits Ash's friends.<br/><br/>Lastly, the score produced by composer Joseph LoDuca, (his first theatrical score to be exact) was half hearted too. I know LoDuca can produce good work because he did it for the Xena and Hercules TV show. Did he just not have enough equipment in 1981? The only two times I hear an actual tune is in beginning and ending. This proves he knows how to make themes in music. But besides that, LoDuca relies way too much on the strings to make any kind of music. And majority of the time, I enjoy the strings. The problem is that LoDuca arranged their music to create either scratchy or plucking noises. That doesn't create tension. Besides of the fact that they were only used for mainly transition scenes. The score was barely there to begin with. <br/><br/>This was a project I was really looking forward to enjoying but instead for every good part, there was a counter. It's by no means awful but for all the praise that it's been given, I was expecting more."

"jcbutthead86","10","0","3","13 February 2013"," One Of The Greatest Horror Films Of All Time. Sam Raimi And Bruce Campbell's Best Film.
","The Evil Dead is one of the greatest Horror films of all time that is not only a Cult Classic,but a Horror Classic as well.Made on a low budget of 350,000$ and filled with Great direction,great special effects,originality and Dark Humor,The Evil Dead is in my opinion the best and my favorite of The Evil Dead trilogy,Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell's best film and is not only one of my favorite Horror films of all time,but one of my favorite films all time.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead tells the story of five college students who are on vacation and rent a cabin in the woods. While there the five students unintentionally bring back evil demons from the dead that wants to possess the students one by one. Now,it's all up to Ash(Bruce Campbell)who has to fight off the demons and survive...The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>I think one of the reasons The Evil Dead is a Horror classic was because when the film came out in the early 80s slasher films were all the rage at the time,but The Evil Dead was a different animal. Instead of making another slasher film,director Sam Raimi,decided to make a movie about demonic possession and give viewers a scary,horrifying and original experience. One of the reasons ED is such a scary and frightening film is because like some of the best Horror films you never know what to expect and don't know what's coming,with the scary situations in the film are insane,wild,creepy and frightening. The scares in the film are done with great timing,imagination and effect,using creepy sound effects for the demons and strange noises outside in the woods giving viewers an uneasy feeling because with ED there is great build up to the to the Horror and once the Horror starts it never ever stops and for 85 minutes you are put on a terrifying and scary thrill ride that doesn't quit until the very end. The atmosphere in the film is excellent,showing the woods not as a beautiful place you want to be at for a vacation,but a place that's ugly and evil filled with fog and smoke and pulsating with darkness and dread. What also makes the atmosphere in ED scary and excellent is the POV shots of the demons and the unique camera angles smartly not showing the faces of the demons when they're chasing and stalking the main characters but showing the faces of the main characters when they're being chased. The camera angles and shots from Raimi are unique and stylish with tilted angles and over the head shots adding to ED's brilliance and making the film rise above most low budget Horror films. Ash in this film is a character we can relate to because while Ash is the hero of the film Ash goes through a lot of pain and terror that most human beings can stand to bear. Although Ash isn't the tough guy(he's still scared in the other films)he became in the sequels Ash still finds a way to fight the evil demons but still realizes he's in way over his head and that's one of the things that makes Ash an iconic character The violence and gore in the film is not for the weak at heart,it's effective,bloody, gory and disgusting and when the blood and gore comes into the film the blood flows and never stops. ED is one of the most politically incorrect and craziest Horror films ever made and I don't know if it was intentional or not,but the film has a dark sense of Humor about itself because while the film is pure Horror there are some things in the film that are so over the top you can't help but laugh whether it's the demons taunting the main characters or the slapstick suffering the characters go through. The dark Comedy and Humor were pushed even further in the sequels Evil Dead 2:Dead By Dawn and Army Of Darkness and it's one of the things that makes this series great and unique. The ending of the film is insane,bloody,twisted and full of energy and will be something you'll never forget and is one of the great things that makes ED a Horror classic.<br/><br/>The cast does a good job with their roles. Bruce Campbell does a wonderful job as Ash,the hero of the film,bringing sympathy and likability to the role. Ash isn't the tough-talking shotgun using hero he became in the sequels,but Ash still does heroic things in the film. Ellen Sandweiss does a good job as Cheryl,Ash's frightened sister. Hal Delrich does a fine job Scott,Ash's friend. Betsy Baker is good as Linda,Ash's girlfriend. Sarah York does a fine job as Shelly,Scott's girlfriend.<br/><br/>The direction from Sam Raimi is just excellent and stylish,using great angles,POV shots,intense close-ups and also does well in the scary scenes. Great direction from Raimi.<br/><br/>The score by Joe Doluca is scary,effective,frightening and fits in with the film's creepy tone. A great score.<br/><br/>The special effects by Tom Sullivan is amazing,disgusting,frightening and unforgettable and are well done for a low budget.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Horror Films,Cult Films,Sam Raimi,Bruce Campbell or cinema in general,you'll love The Evil Dead,a brilliant Horror classic from beginning to end that will stand the test of time. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"ernesto-garcia","10","0","1","11 February 2013"," A Genuine Review of The Evil Dead
","In honor of the new Evil Dead remake I will be reviewing the original Evil Dead trilogy. Evil Dead is the 1981 horror classic directed by Sam Raimi. Many people think that The Evil Dead is more comedic like it's brother,Evli Dead 2, but the original Evil Dead is quite scary. Evil Dead is about a group of friends who go to a isolated cabin deep in the woods and are attacked by an evil force. Evil Dead has a very distinct feel to it sort of a realistic tone to it. Evil Dead not only gave us the ""Cabin In the Woods"" genre but it also gave us one of the grooviest horror movie heroes ever Ashley or ""Ash"" if you prefer. This is one of the best,scariest films ever created. The only problem I can imagine one having with this film is that it is dated and very campy. Other than that it is a near perfect film. 9.5/10"
"RecceR","8","0","1","30 October 2012"," Campy horror classic
","Five friends go to a cabin in the woods; only to unintentionally release evil demons that slowly begin to posses them. This movie was a labor of love and it truly shows. Dead is a very important movie in the horror genre since it remains to be inspiration for so many subsequent ones. I remember several people suggesting I see this movie because I am a big horror fan. When I finally saw it, I was very impressed and enjoyed it a great deal. It's very in-your-face and is loaded with dark humor. The gore is also pretty disgusting, which goes well with a campy movie like this. I think I really appreciated the movie years after first seeing it and finding out how much went into making it. They took years to film and piece it together, actors left due to scheduling issues, they filmed in poor conditions. It really was a labor of love made by a handful of horror nerds that any filmmaker should appreciate, considering most first-time feature films turn out so horrible. The Evil dead will always remain a horror classic in my book and is always fun to watch."

"darkness_is_your_ally","6","0","4","14 August 2012"," scary, violent, creepy soundtrack and bad acting!
","Having recently just watched this film for the first time and seeing a 7.6 rating on IMDb before hand, i have to say that this film did not live up to those expectations and mildly disappointed me. I did not hate this film, nor did I love it, what I can say is that I understand its cult following and I can appreciate it for what it is, and that is a decent horror flick, written and directed by Sam Rami. Now to begin, I was never expecting solid, performances or an Oscar winning role, but for what it was i just couldn't feel much more than, these people will eventually die (basic horror logic) and to be honest i'm not that bothered about it either,and that to me is down to a poorly written script or down down to bad casting, but none the less, i felt No sympathy for any of them, apart from the only believable character, to which i could believe is the point, and this would be ash; who was a bit more three dimensional and stood out more than the others, rather than using clichéd horror thinking and doing stupid s**t (ignoring the basement scene). Now putting acting aside and looking at it for what it was it was otherwise pretty good; one thing things I especially loved was the score that was pieced to each and every scene, it really gives the film that horror edge and makes you quiver with fear, even if there is nothing particularly haunting happening in that given time; pretty much that I know somethings going to happen but when; and the score builds this up perfectly for say when two arms smash through a door. another thing that I though was absolutely great in this film was the special effects, oh how I miss the simpler films, where things can look better than CGI and at the same time not be spending wad loads of cash on it; going back to the special effects, the make up for the zombified humans was disturbingly frightening, especially Cheryl and creepy ass laugh. the ending scene with the melting corpses clearly made out of plaster scene (or clay for the Americans) was so cool, and because it looked like it had that skin like texture, it made it seem more like it was melting than if it was being done nowadays in CGI, thing is to me, is that realism can ruin things like that and thats why this film is very entertaining for the genre that it is. however another small gripe I have is the way the film is shot, the camera annoys the hell out of me, reminds me of home videos that have been shot by a budding film maker in his teens. The whole floaty cam and as if it is the evil spirit, it just bugs me, and I don't really know why. Overall I really enjoyed the story, because if you don't read any synopsis' it really does help to make it a better story, the special effects are awesome, the music is incredibly creepy and frightening, yet the acting lets the film down. well worth a watch though, and for some classic 80's cheese horror, i would certainly recommend this film, as long as you remember it is not meant to be a masterpiece. I'm off to watch Evil Dead 2 to see what happens in the continued story. 6.5/10"

","This is an excellent film in every way possible! It has the low-budget feel to it with a top-budget atmosphere. It starts with a group of teenagers staying at a cabin when they start to turn into zombie/ demon things. The graphic violence is really in your face and makes sure you see exactly what is happening. The gore in this film is very well done and convinced me that I prefer This kind of FX over CGI. The use of stop motion/fake body parts just adds to the overall creepiness of it. The camera shots are very nice and are noticeable for being so creative. Everything about this film was phenomenal except a couple of points (nitpicking):<br/><br/>I HATE jump scares(this film has some) The reason as to why they turn into demons/zombies is never explained and the book/tape recording is never fully explained (Doesn't really need to be anyway since it's a horror film) The sound is mostly either dead silent or knock-you-out-of-your-seat- loud. <br/><br/>It took me a while of thinking to actually come up with a couple of points of things I didn't like about it; now that's when you know this is a good movie. This movie helps define what horror movies are all about."
"wiggie-5","9","0","2","13 May 2012"," The Evil Delight!
","I'm just going to come right out and say it this is a scary movie!<br/><br/>Even though it's Sam Raimi's directorial début, and filmed on a low budget, The Evil Dead (1981) is filled with enough atmosphere and gore to turn the stomachs of even the most hardcore horror fans. It's grittiness and over the top violence is a delight that can't be found nowadays.<br/><br/>Following the exploits of five college students, the audience is lead into an isolated cabin in the woods, where something evil lies in wait. What is this great evil, you ask? Well, it's a book. But not just any book, 'the Book of the Dead', inked in blood and bound in human flesh! Using a book as the source of evil was an ingenious decision. It takes a familiar image, one usually associated with wisdom and knowledge, and completely turns it around, creating an item of evil and torture. We find it hard to believe that such a simple, inanimate object could be the source of such terror, leaving the audience wide open for when the real baddies show.<br/><br/>The film gives birth to one of Bruce Campbell's most famous movie roles, 'Ashley J. Williams', a fan favourite and icon of the horror movie genre. Campbell brought this character to life, walking the line between fearless hero and sheer incompetence. Our protagonist is a man scared out of his wits, whose only talent seems to be dismembering the bodies of his possessed friends. Raimi and Campbell would later take the character in a completely different direction for the sequels, making him goofier and even less reliant.<br/><br/>Raimi's creative use of the camera has become a staple in his movies, to the great joy of the audience. One such technique is the constant use of 'point of view' shots, showing the audience what it's like to be the monster. These shots are clever, because we never see what is chasing the protagonists. This is a great horror technique because the audience has to use their imaginations to fill in the gaps. The monster can be anything that the audience can think of, which is especially frightening because people have a tendency to imagine the worst.<br/><br/>The cabin in the woods, the central location for the film, completely isolates the characters from any kind of salvation. This does for The Evil Dead what the boat on the ocean did for Jaws (1975), a small oasis in the middle of nowhere, the monster lurking just outside. The audience is never shown any scene that takes place outside the woods, making them feel just as trapped as the characters.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the highlight of the film is the stop motion scene towards the end. In the early 80's, stop motion was the closest that a low budget film could get to CGI, due to the lack of technology. The scene was unexpected, disgusting and incredibly fun to watch! The Evil Dead seems to be aware that it's a very simple movie, almost parodying itself and the genre. This would be built upon in the later sequels, taking the humour to all new levels. But the first film in the trilogy is a far more traditional horror film, relying on atmosphere, suspense and tension building to get a reaction from the audience.<br/><br/>It's cheesy at times, filled with the usual horror clichés, but this is what we love about it. It never takes itself seriously, and doesn't expect the audience to. There are many big budget horror films today that try to come close to The Evil Dead but fail miserably.<br/><br/>This movie will forever be a horror classic.<br/><br/>So, switch off the lights, grab a bowl of popcorn, and maybe even a change of underwear, because this is one horror movie that won't disappoint its audience!"

","When I first saw 'Evil Dead' I was maybe 10 and I was too scared to finish at the part where the pull the possessed girl out of the fire and then chop her up. A few years later when I was 13 my friend only made it to the part where they jam a pencil on the one girl's heel... This is one of those movies that the first time you see if, if you're very young, it might just have that effect on you. Unlike Halloween which I'm in love with, but even at 11, I never got too scared to keep watching. In fact, this is the only film I remember having such a profound effect on me.<br/><br/>'Evil Dead' is a campy 1979 (released in 1981, but mostly filmed in 1979) low budget B-Grade horror film. But one that works. The effects are creative, the camera work is interesting and the pacing is unlike many movies done today. It will go instantly from silence to high action, then back to silence, and it won't be in any rush to scare you again. But unlike Paranormal Activity, which was ""high tension, low payoff,"" this one won't disappoint you when the scare comes. There are some great high-tension moments, some screamer moments, and some parts that are just truly creepy. It has a little of everything in the scare department.<br/><br/>But, this IS a b-movie. So yes. The acting is bad. Yes. The claymation at the end is awkward. It's far from a perfect film. But it's a great one. And maybe the perfect B-Film. Most of what it tries works. And even when it doesn't come off so well, you still have to be impressed with their ambitious ideas for a low budget independent film made in 1979.<br/><br/>This one is truly a classic. Flaws and all, I wouldn't change a thing.<br/><br/>As a side note: This movie is originally in Full Screen. Widescreen release DVDs simply bar off the top and bottom rather than pan-and-scan or adding anything. This is one of the few movies I recommended Full Screen.<br/><br/>(Altered from my review from RottonTomatoes.)"

","THE EVIL DEAD sits right up there with other horror films such as the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. But though all three of these films are horror films, they couldn't be more different in plan of attack or in effect. NOTLD, a real gross-out when it first came out, seems somewhat tame in the shadow of movies like the SAW series. And BLAIR is sort of in a class by itself; it does things that no one ever attempted, and is nearly always not only successful, but brilliant.<br/><br/>Which brings us to THE EVIL DEAD, the feature film debuts of both director Sam Raimi and his favorite star Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film was at a New Year's Eve party (of all things); we had had a bit to drink and consequently the six or seven of us that watched the movie found it hilarious. And this is oddly enough a valid response, but uniquely, the opposite is true. Because some time later, being home alone for the evening and with nothing in particular to do, I took a second look, and this time the story drew me in and I had to watch the last forty minutes or so with the lights on.<br/><br/>Made for less than $400,000.00, nearly eighty per cent of which appears to have gone into the visual effects, this is a film that has a strange and inexplicable power to it despite amateurish acting, an often terrible script, and variable special effects (mostly the result of poor editing, as in the obvious cut between the live actor in makeup and the model after the Book of the Dead has been thrown into the fire.<br/><br/>They didn't spend money on originality either: the plot is so familiar it was trite when the film came out: five friends (college buddies?) head for a remote cabin in the woods; the exact location is never given but one suspects the Smokey Mountains as a passing reference is made in the car to having ""just crossed the Tennessee border."" Little time is wasted on setting the scene. There is a moment in the car when ""something"" wrenches the wheel from the driver's hands and they just miss a collision. Upon turning onto the dirt road leading to the cabin, the background music suddenly falls silent and all we hear is a rhythmic thumping. It turns out to be the porch swing banging against the side of the cabin although there is no breeze; the movement stops as soon as Ash (Campbell) locates the door key.<br/><br/>Pretty soon they are seated around the dinner table, eating and getting pleasantly loaded, when all at once the trapdoor to the basement opens. Predictably enough, Scotty (Richard DeManincor billed as Hal Delrich) and Ash decide to explore. And they find something: An ancient Sumerian book of the dead and a tape recorder which, when they listen to it, speaks of evil spirits in the woods. The fact that the Sumerian civilization was located in the Middle East and therefore such spirits would hardly be likely to be found in the mountains of Tennessee is not even mentioned.<br/><br/>Anyway. They play the tape, which has on it an incantation to wake the spirits. And they keep listening despite the pleas of Ashley's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) to ""SHUT IT OFF!!!"" Then a tree limb crashes through a front window and the contents of Pandora's Box literally take over the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't need to go into detail except to say that the spirits pick the kids off one by one, possessing them and turning them into hideous monsters that look like a cross between Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST and Gary Conway in I WAS A TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is an utter bloodbath, complete with bodily dismemberment and other equally disgusting stuff. But there is a certain tongue-in-cheek humor about the proceedings as well, with an abundance of in-jokes and horror movie clichés like Cheryl going out (ALONE!!!!) to explore the woods (and you won't believe what happens to her out there!).<br/><br/>I won't reveal any more. But whether you think the movie ridiculous or one of the scariest things you ever saw (or both depending on your mood), it remains an audacious debut both for Raimi and for Campbell; his acting here is still that of an amateur, but of the entire cast he was the one who broke into the mainstream, though the three women have remained active in films.<br/><br/>I love this movie, and probably for reasons I would rather not know."

The tongue-in-cheek humor, gore and often hilarious shock tactics work together to create a rather awesome experience.

I rate my movies in 4 categories; cinematography, Film-making,Acting and the Overall experience.<br/><br/>Cintemography: The cinematography is this movie is cheap. Cheap budget gives cheap lighting and cheap visual effects. Ha ha I bet your thinking ""Why would you like it then?"" But that's the catch, the cheap effects in this movie MAKE it so good. The way everyone is cheap brings out true horror effects,it gives a disturbing undertone. so who needs a large budget? 25/25<br/><br/>Film-making: Despite the cheap cinematography, the camera angles are amazing. They're very dramatic, especially the flying camera intro scene, that give the movie an eerie tone. 25/25<br/><br/>Acting: For people who aren't even real actors, this is amazing. Not just when they're casually talking to each other, but when they're possessed demons. They're truly brilliant. 21/25<br/><br/>Overall Experience: This movie is very entertaining, very. It keeps you on your toes trying to intercept what will happen next, who is possessed or really immune and who will survive. Marvelous horror movie, especially because the budget is so small, this Horror movie could teach modern horrors a thing or two. 25/25<br/><br/>Overall score: 96/100"

","You don't have to be some sort of massive horror nerd to know that The Evil Dead is quite an important film (although it probably helps). Originally called Book of the Dead (until that title was deemed 'too boring' by studio bosses) this spooky, shlock-horror shocker was director Sam Raimi's very first full length feature! Not only that, but it was one of the first of the 'splatter' type films of the eighties and gained infamy as one of the, um'infamous' video nasties which burst onto the scene like a squishy wound due to the availability of home video players. It was made with a very low budget for this type of film, with a small spattering (or splattering) of cast and crew members, many of which taking responsibility for multiple jobs during production; star (and king of B-movies) Bruce Campbell was chief contact lens fitter during the shoot, for example. <br/><br/>The film was released in 1981 and tells the story of five college friends spending the weekend in a creepy cabin in the middle of the Tennessee woods. Everything is peaceful and idyllic (for about 10 minutes) until they discover a tape recorder in the creepy cellar and decide to see what's on it! This turns out to be as bad an idea as it sounds, as the tape contains a passage read aloud from the Book of the dead (see, that's why they wanted to call the film that). This passage awakens and seemingly 'pisses off' a malevolent spirit in the woods which wants to come back from the dead by possessing the living.or something, I think that's its plan! The spirit 'force' (as it's often referred to by geeks) is never actually seen and is only present throughout this sticky adventure via 'point of view' camera shots and sound effects – many of which were just director Sam Raimi adding his own vocals to various sounds. <br/><br/>One by one (by one) the five friends are consumed by the evil force and transformed into demons of sorts, they aren't officially zombies as such, as they can fly around and are incredibly agile and strong. Also, they aren't interested in eating brains or any other bits and seem to want to taunt and terrorize the survivors rather than simply kill them off (or un-undead them off, to be more accurate). The 'Deadites' (as they're referred to, also by geeks) tend to have 'fun' with their victims and play psychological games with them before trying to 'off' them spectacularly! The sole survivor Ashley Williams (played by Bruce Campbell) has to fight off his former friends, girlfriend and sister in an attempt to stay alive until morning, when the spirits can be driven away, with each confrontation getting bloodier and more graphically violent (yay). <br/><br/>Some of the film's highlights include Ash's newly 'turned' sister taunting Scott from the cellar (""You're not gonna' leave me here, are ya'are ya' Ash?""), the woods themselves coming to life and attacking anyone attempting to flee the cabin and Linda (Ash's girlfriend) transforming into a giggling, porcelain doll thing, shrieking with laughter as she tries to stab him with a knife that's almost certainly entirely too big! The film really doesn't let up after the awakening of the evil spirit and the constant action, bloody violence and imaginative camera moves and sound effects leave the viewer practically exhausted by the closing credits! <br/><br/>Sam Raimi is well known (by geeks and um, 'norms') for his strategic use of camera angles and clever shot set ups and his films are instantly recognizable as 'his' due to the specific look of his movies (also because they usually either have Bruce Campbell or his 'classic' car in them, or both). This film is no exception, as there are lots of sweeping, frantic camera moves and some disorientating shots which add to the atmosphere and main character Ash's rapidly deteriorating mental state! <br/><br/>The creepy sound effects and music also add to the unsettling atmosphere, with the possessed friend's voices and sound of the main 'force' spirit being particularly effective and chilling. <br/><br/>Overall then, this is a film that's aged well and just won't stay dead (like a lot of Ash's friends) and considering it's over 30 years old it still holds up as a well made and quite creepy horror classic. The effects are still, umeffective, especially the 'deadite' make up (creepy white contact lenses etc) and the spectacularly squelchy end sequence (which is one of the messiest endings to any horror film, possibly trumped only by films like Braindead and Bad taste). Upon release this must have been incredibly scary and effective and it's doubtful we'll see any horror films coming out in the future that will have anywhere near as large an impact or influence as the Evil Dead has had over the years!"

","Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' is among the pioneers of horror movie spoofs and what fun it is to watch. It does start off a little slow but the pace picks up rapidly and Raimi's inventive ways of combining scare jumps, humour, hilarious and gross makeup and props had me laughing out loud. It starts off with five friends going on a trip through the middle of a forest. They decide to spend the night in an cabin after which spooky things start to happen. The story definitely follows the formula of the B-movie horror slasher genre The characters are definitely the airhead clichés one has often witnessed in such films. Raimi's addition of a good dose of humour to the ingredients makes it highly enjoyable. The production design very successfully creates a creepy and comic atmosphere. The actors do a terrific job of 'acting bad'. Bruce Campbell stands out showing a natural flair for comedy and he would reprise the role in the equally amusing sequel. 'Evil Dead' is one of the few films of its kind that has good repeat value. Raimi has a knack for this kind of movie and his films show how good he is in combining horror, gore and humour, something not many directors can do."

","It's always interesting to go back to a famous director's early days and see the film that showed all of his/her promise. In Sam Raimi's case, that film would be the 1981 gore-fest ""The Evil Dead"".<br/><br/>Five college students steal way for the weekend to an isolated cabin in the woods of Tennessee (what could go wrong?). Stashed in the cellar is an old Sumerian text, better known as the Book of the Dead. Also with this book is a tape recording that, when played, recites the written contents of the book . . . and summons the spiritual evils that lurk within the woods. In no time, the cabin turns into a haunted house, the woods become alive and demons start possessing the new tenants.<br/><br/>It's a horror film that's heavy on scares and bodily fluids and light on character development. The college students aren't so much characters as they are archetypes (even Bruce Campbell, who will go on to play the memorable hero in the sequels, is just the token gangly dweeb here). But it's not a movie about character. Five kids get trapped in a cabin, surrounded by evil, and all manner of horrors ensue. That's it. And the filmmakers deliver.<br/><br/>The film's strength lies in Raimi's ability to make the absurd (i.e. a woman being raped by vines) uncomfortable to watch - if not downright scary. And on a shoestring budget, no less. It's a scary movie laced here and there with some comedic touches - but things won't get funny until ""Evil Dead 2"".<br/><br/>7/10"

","Its always interesting watching future greats in their feature debuts. When talents at the start of their careers are forced to work with minimal resources some of them turn out superb work as a result. Like Steven Spielberg with Duel. John Carpenter's Dark Star. James Cameron and The Terminator. And Sam Raimi with The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead was a film Raimi set out to make on a virtual shoestring. The cast are unknowns. Its confined to a single setting. And its scraped together by a next to nothing budget. But films like these, free of the ministrations of heartless Hollywood often turn out better than they're bigger budgeted cousins.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead has nothing that one could really call a plot. But it works because of what Sam Raimi brings to the film. What it lacks in plotting it makes up for in entertainment. Its not a terribly original film, and Night of the Living Dead was almost certainly an influence on it, but The Evil Dead holds its own as a ferocious, bloodthirsty horror movie.<br/><br/>Five teens holed up in a cabin are besieged by spirits from beyond the grave. After reading from a Book of the Dead that was in the cabin, the five of them wind up possessed, one by one becoming demonic zombies. The only one not affected is Ash (Bruce Campbell's feature debut), and as his friends and loved ones turn before his very eyes, it becomes a non-stop fight to survive the night.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is a textbook example of how monolithic budgets are not the beginning and the end of Hollywood cinema. All this film needed was a passionate director, a dedicated cast and a loyal production crew. Add to that plenty of blood, guts and pus galore. From what I've read, The Evil Dead was a difficult shoot on everyone. The hours were long and the weather was terrible, but Sam Raimi roused the crew into shape.<br/><br/>Its the sheer confidence he brings that transforms the story. Raimi directs with a fierce energy that enervates the entire movie. The camera seldom stays in one position. It prowls around the cabin, darting into closeup. The restless setups Raimi keeps springing on us make for an intense, almost unbearable experience.<br/><br/>Raimi is content to let the camera do much of the work in the first half. Its in the second half that The Evil Dead opens up and takes on the intensity of a nightmare roller-coaster ride. Some of the scares Raimi dreamt up are totally out there. The one memory people take away from the film more than any other, and what had the film classified as a Video Nasty here in the UK, is the scene where Ellen Sandweiss wanders into the woods and is raped by a tree. Its a wrenching, squeamish thing to watch that not even the climax manages to top. Even Raimi regretted putting it in the film.<br/><br/>But Raimi doesn't stop there. In the latter half, he goes all out to shock at every opportunity. Considering the film was made on a $350,000 budget, the results are astonishing. The cast vanish into makeup jobs, eerie voices, and blood spurts, spits and showers us in a non-stop orgy of mayhem.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead deservedly brought Sam Raimi to attention. But the only member of the cast who went on to any kind of success, and became a mainstay of Sam Raimi's is Bruce Campbell. A childhood friend of his, Campbell mapped out a career as a B-Movie actor. He came to specialise in playing parodies of the lantern-jawed, All-American hero. And later starred in one of this author's favourite TV shows, The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.<br/><br/>But here, Campbell is a little flat. Campbell hadn't mastered the ability to remain deadpan in the face of absurdity. He would come to hone that on the Evil Dead sequels, and by the time of Brisco County Jr, he had it down to a fine art. Nevertheless, Campbell was a real trooper. <br/><br/>One thing you can count on when a director is a good friend of the lead actor is that they inspire them to do things no inflated paycheck could ever do. Campbell went far, above and beyond the call of duty for The Evil Dead. Constant splatterings. Drenched in blood. A merciless work schedule. But it all paid off in the finished product.<br/><br/>The one other person on the crew who was propelled to success (arguably more than Raimi) was Joel Coen. Before becoming a directing team with his brother Ethan, and carving out an original, consistently brilliant career, Joel Coen served as editor on The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>Although principally a Raimi film, there are times when you can see some of the trademarks of a Coen film. There's none of the idiosyncratic pleasures of Barton Fink and Fargo, but the way the camera observes at a neutral distance the mayhem unfolding before it is classic Coen.<br/><br/>Raimi plays The Evil Dead to a shrieking excess and that's really as it should be. The wild overacting from the amateur cast will no doubt provoke fits of the giggles from some and the gore will invoke revulsion from others. But Raimi maintains a perfect lunatic energy that never flags for an instant. The stuff cult classics are made of."

","This is THE classic low-budget horror film in my opinion. Definitely a must-see if you really like classic horror movies, or if you're just into really campy amounts of gore and violence. And let me assure you, this movie is extremely campy. The acting is for the most part awful, despite a star-making performance from Bruce Campbell. However, your not seeing this movie for how well its acted, your seeing this because its a horror film thats meant to scare you, and on that front it certainly delivers. This movie will definitely make you jump as well as squirm. From the creepy, prolonged sequences of wandering in silence to the actual bodily dismemberment scenes, this is a pretty terrifying ride. Sam Raimi's directorial debut with this movie is one of the best debuts ever. From the way its shot, right down to the music, this movie was executed and designed perfectly. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It is a must-see movie for horror fans everywhere. The direction is great, the scares/kill scenes are original and truly frightening, and at times it's really funny and campy. The only reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because the acting was really cheesy and I didn't feel emotionally attached to any of the characters and didn't care when they died. Otherwise, great low-budget horror film, easily one of the best."

","You might never suspect a relationship between horror and comedy — which means you've never seen a Sam Raimi horror film. Although some of us have drawn a line in the sand between the two genres, those who haven't will appreciate if not love ""The Evil Dead."" Raimi recognizes that horror is kind of an absurd genre in itself and that our capacity to fear and to laugh exist on the same spectrum. If you let yourself experience both on the wacky 85- minute ride that is ""Evil Dead,"" you're bound to appreciate the way he plays with both.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly inspired by ""Night of the Living Dead,"" the film centers on five young adults who decide to stay at a cabin (arguably a shack) for a weekend in the middle of nowhere Tennessee. After experiencing some strange activity they come upon a book and a recording of a man reading incantations from it. These incantations awaken flesh-possessing spirits that live in the woods.<br/><br/>Rather than an ""us against them"" horror film where a group of people have to avoid getting picked off one by one at the hands of something(s), the film takes more of the zombie angle with characters ""turning"" into evil undead creatures. The cast is also small, so the events are character-focuses and more intense. Bruce Campbell leads the way as Ash. There's no real way to describe Ash, except he's more of a softie for a leading character.<br/><br/>Part of the great/annoying part about ""Evil Dead"" is how the main characters never act like you want them to. You want to scream at them to hurry up and grab something that can be used as a weapon and pound the crap out of the possessed undead people. Because the characters are a bit hollow and we've been exposed to films like this before, we have no sympathy when a good character turns. They need to die and die fast, but the characters remain hesitant because technically these possessed gnarly creatures are their friends. Consequently, Ash is a dumb sucker that probably deserves to die with everyone else in the cabin.<br/><br/>That said, there's an odd pleasure in that kind of psychological toying with our minds. Raimi executes horror with strong build up and off-the-wall payoff. We writhe until the last second and then the zombie guts hit the fan time and time again. And he never completely lets go of the leash; everything goes back down to an eerie calm and builds back up again until the climactic scene. Although for all intents and purpose ""Evil Dead"" is a camp-fest, that technique suggests Raimi's interest lies in keeping us spooked.<br/><br/>All things considered, any film that can depict a woman being ""raped by the woods"" (yes, the collective entity of ""the woods"") that still manages to leave a good lasting impression deserves its cult-classic status.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","Mostly respect regarding the achievement of Sam Raimi. This guy was 21 years old when he made this film and that's impressive to say the least. I'm around that age at the moment and I sure as hell haven't pulled it off yet...I strongly doubt I ever will, actually. No, when you're able to come up with such an original and dared idea for a horror film, you belong to the greatest minds in the film industry. Sam Raimi did it and his further career only confirmed his status of being a genius with every single movie he directed afterwards. Tons of respect towards Bruce Campbell as well. Sure his performance in this movie is far from great, but at the time, he did it because of his friendship with Sam Raimi. And because The Evil Dead became a big hit, his career was launched too and he certainly grew as an actor. Bruce Campbell is now in the favorite actor-list of many B-movie fans...And I'm one of them.<br/><br/>Then there's Tom Sullivan...responsible for the make-up. What a fine job he did. The Evil Dead gave a whole new meaning to the word ""gore"" and we have this man to thank for that. Most nowadays horror films still can't live up to the standard of Evil Dead...not even close. <br/><br/>The plot of this film is as simple as can be...but it works. Five friends drive to a small cabin in the woods to spend a small vacation. They find a tape recorder with a message...Out of curiosity, they play it and pure evil is rised in the woods. One by one, they become possessed and turn into horrible demons who try to kill those who're still alive...That's it !!! And that's all there is needed to create a fun and very original horror movie. The same story already came out in 1978 as a short film called ""Within the Woods"". It was meant to fund money for this film and it's great B-movie fun as well. If you're a big fan of The Evil Dead trilogy, it's certainly worth searching for.<br/><br/>Anno 2003, Sam Raimi has grown out to one of Hollywood's favorite directors. He became immortal in the eyes of the big budget audience with his movie Spiderman. The sequel of that one is in production while I write this. I'm sure it will be as decent as the first Spiderman was, but I'd still prefer to see Evil Dead 4 coming from the brain of Sam Raimi."
"filmworld1","Null","0","1","19 July 2011"," ""The Evil Dead"" is a horror masterpiece
","""The Evil Dead"" is about a group of young adults who travel to a cabin in the woods and discover a 'book of the dead'. No prizes for guessing what happens next as each character is possessed (except for Ash) and disposed of via an intriguing variety of methods. Considering its budget, unknown director (at the time), and typical slasher plot ""The Evil Dead"" would almost certainly seem headed towards forgotten B-movie status, and yet it has stood the test of time and remains one of the most widely acclaimed horror films of all time. Why? It's simple. Although ""The Evil Dead"" is nowhere near as funny as its sequels, it's still a humorous self-satire while also being terrifying despite its age. This odd combination (only perfected in this film's sequels and ""Creepshow"") works because Raimi crafts a tense and moody environment, puts his characters in there, and then ruthlessly disposes of them, sometimes doing so several times for the same character. What's worse is that there's nowhere to go. Raimi creates a claustrophobic feeling in anyone watching, he wants you to think about being in a situation where you're trapped with nothing but death and destruction surrounding you. For most people, he probably succeeds. As far as acting goes, none of it is really very good but Bruce Campbell is instantly likable as Ash, who just has to be one of the most memorable horror film characters of all time.<br/><br/>Gory, desolate, hopeless, and still funny, ""The Evil Dead"" is a horror masterpiece that isn't quite the strongest entry in the series, but is shockingly accomplished and entertaining despite its low budget and inexperienced cast and crew. This is a film everyone must see, along with its sequels."

","'The Evil Dead' is a wonderful combination of horror and humour. Made on a shoestring budget, it is extremely entertaining and very fast-moving. Bruce Campbell is excellent as the put-upon hero who must do battle with some very nasty and resourceful zombies.<br/><br/>When five friends drive to a secluded cabin in the woods of Tennessee, they are looking forward to a fun weekend. But upon arriving at the aforementioned cabin, they discover a tape machine. When they play the tape, they hear a man reciting from the Book of the Dead. It is these recitations which awakens an unspeakable evil in the surrounding woods which possesses several of the group and transforms them into hideous, homicidal zombies. Pretty soon, Ashley 'Ash' J. Williams (Bruce Campbell) is the only one left who has not been transformed, and he must fight for his life.<br/><br/>This is a thrilling and imaginative horror classic whose camera-work - like that in Peter Jackson's first film, 'Bad Taste' - is really splendid and cleverly conceived. The special effects makeup is very impressive considering the limited budget, and the film's most notorious scene - in which a major female character is raped by a tree - is completely unexpected and very twisted.<br/><br/>That first-time director Sam Raimi should go on to such massive box office success with the 'Spider-Man' franchise is no surprise; you can feel a lot of fledgling talent at work when you watch 'The Evil Dead'. If you are a fan of horror, then this film, subtitled 'The Ultimate Experience in Gruelling Horror' is required viewing."
"jones-ben42","4","0","4","15 February 2011"," Plot Holes Galore!
","Sam Raimi's very first film seemed to get a pretty strong fan-base, so I decided to check it out. While the movie is scary at times, it is also insanely predictable and the characters are so stupid that it's astounding.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie, while it seems somewhat like the Exorcist in the sense of the demons infecting living bodies, is pretty creative for the time. Basically, cursed words are spoken while a group of teenagers (or young adults, I can't really tell) are at a isolated mountain cabin and this wakes up demons which inhabit the bodies of the living. While the premise is pretty interesting, it is very formulaic. First off, there are FIVE friends as the main characters, the main character is a quiet, reserved guy, there's the arrogant, ""I can do anything"" type friend, and for Christ's sake, they're young adults ALL alone in the mountains in a small, creepy cabin. This movie just screams the HORROR genre. To the movie's credit though, the characters were picked off in an order I didn't expect, so it's not completely formula Horror style.<br/><br/>Let's get right into this, plot holes and characters' decisions are the big downfall of this movie. I don't know if I ever rolled my eyes so much when watching a movie. There are a ton of them, so I list the ones I can remember. First off, why does the guy from the past on the tape actually say the cursed words that summon demons? Was he trying to bring horror to a bunch of random people in the mountains? I'd think that they be on a level beyond swear words, like since swear words are said on occasion when you're really mad, these words would never be said because they bring about the freaking apocalypse. Next, after they realize that the only way to get rid of these demons is body dismemberment, why don't they just take a shotgun to evil Cheryl's face then chainsaw her in pieces? This also brings up the question, why didn't evil Cheryl break out earlier? She showed at the end of the movie that she could just break the lock on the cellar, so why didn't she break out and sneak up on them when they weren't looking and just kill them all? It's obvious that that was the demon's goal was anyway, so why put it off? Then, once stupid Shelly becomes demon person number 2, the arrogant character seems to know what the hell he's doing and starts trying to kill her in many different ways, but the main character is just standing on the sidelines holding a dang ax doing nothing while his friend is beating up, and getting beat up by his girlfriend. Where the heck are this guy's balls? He knows that this isn't the same chick that he knew, so why doesn't he just help him out? You know this would be a great time for Cheryl to ""surprise"" her brother. Then the friend has to take the ax from him to kill Shelly for good. During this whole time, Linda has been snoozing up a storm not batting an eye. Why? Wouldn't she hear a demon screaming in the other room? Then Linda wakes up as demon number 3 after being stabbed by a pencil by Cheryl. This begs the question, how come Ash can have their blood all over him but not turn into a demon and Linda can just get stabbed by a pencil, not even like physical contact with the demon, and become infected? Then, once Ash finally seems like he's getting some balls and is about to dismember his girlfriend with a chainsaw, he stops because he looks at a necklace which holds no significant value, except that he gave it to her. Doesn't he know that she'll just come back as a demon and try to kill him? And on that note, for a large portion when Linda is a demon she just sits and stares at him and does nothing at all to try and kill him. Why? He's already dealing with another demon so why not just double team him to take him down? That was their goal, so why not set out to accomplish it? Skip ahead to the end, and all it takes to bring these guys down is to destroy a book that they found in the basement. If that's all it took, then why didn't he do it earlier? Nothing told him at that very moment to burn the book, so that tells me that he knew about this beforehand, so he could have just ended the crisis from the start by just burning it when Cheryl became a demon. Then in the last shot we see that everything seems fine and resolved, but then something comes up from behind and scares Ash white. What was it? It couldn't have been a demon, or at least it shouldn't have, because he burned the evil book, which seemed to do wonders to the other two in the room at the time. Maybe it was a scarecrow. I assume that we're suppose to believe it is another demon, but that doesn't make sense given that their book was destroyed. Maybe it was explained in the sequel, but the ending just doesn't make sense to me at all.<br/><br/>There are tons of holes in this movie, and I don't get how people can just sit through all the BS that these characters do. I've heard the sequel is better, but I'm not going to hold out much hope given how disappointed I was with this one."

I watched this as a an early teen and repeatedly viewed the video in my aunties video cupboard in summers and had known the infamy attached to this cult classic. Admitidly, I had to fast-forward through the first half hour through wanting to see the gore and even the, had to fast-forward through the horror I was subjecting to my 11/12 year old mind! However, it was the later years I picked this film up from the original days of the films release on video where I watched it in full and witness a less cut-up print (BBFC has had a field day with this title for 20 years until being uncut on DVD in 2001) and appreciate why film makers and Indy horror fans hold this film so close after all this time.<br/><br/>The film is made so tight on a budget that was small. Joseph LoDuca's music score was one thing that set a rich atmosphere and Sam Raimi's twisted and interesting camera angles tells a story of madness and suspense with each scare and jump, which brings me to the sound effects: they are so up front and scary for any youngster watching this film for the first time!! It will creep you out, or make you go on to make your own movie and that IS the influence of The Evil Dead in this day and age. A gem of a splatter-fest with comic book violence which, when cut-up by censors makes it even more shocking compared to what might be a gore fans dream with all the blood-letting left intact on DVD these days. I only watched this again last night on British TV and was still shocked in some ways that a horror film like this could be left intact, even for 10pm on the Sf-Fy channel - which proves this film is still full of IMPACT... 30 years later!! The sequels made, tell a different story and another review... STAY TUNED!!<br/><br/>UPDATE: As of April, 2013 a remake/Reboot of The Evil Dead hit cinemas and for the summer of that year, Sam Raimi had spoke again in a recent Interview about writing Evil Dead Part IV."

","Everyone should already know the general plot line here; five students head out to the abandoned cabin expecting a fun time but suddenly it all goes wrong, terribly wrong, and suddenly people are evil, dead and evil incidentally, which is much worse than merely being one or the other.<br/><br/>Actually it could have better atmosphere because once they arrived, it doesn't take long before the zombie/demon creatures begin attacking, although the concept of demonic spirits possessing people who simply don't know the demons are there is scary, it's something with limited plot potential so naturally the possessed people begin trying to slaughter those unaffected. Fortunately it seems dead people could also become possessed so killing everyone makes sense from the demons' perspective.<br/><br/>I consider it overrated but pretty good regardless."

","I remember as a kid watching this movie late one evening after midnight. It had just come out to VHS and I had rented it from the local Movie rental store. I could've never known how much this film would affect me and turn me into even more of a horror buff. I actually never even returned this movie. I happily paid for it saying it was lost somewhere and I still have the copy which is worn out in parts because I seriously mustve watched it 100 times in my life(literally). <br/><br/>I see kids today trying to watch this and saying its no good, has bad acting, etc and by todays standards this movie wouldn't make it very far, but back in 1981 this was the most horrifying thing in the world. I don't epect kids to understand with all the effects they have today. If you put yourself in Ash's shoes stick up in thew woods,all alone, having to kill all his friends, and having absolutely no one. Some people don't understand too that this movie wasn't meant to be real campy and there is little or no humor in the movie unlike Part 2 and 3. This movie was dead serious in 1981. Believe me I watched it over and over again and it didn't start being funny till years later..and even then its still scary. This movie reserves a place in my heart as one of the Best Horror movies EVER! From the reviews here I can see I am far from the only one! <br/><br/>10 out of 10 stars. I wish I could give it a higher rating because this truly was a time piece and will remain a revered classic forever!"

","""We're gonna get you. We're gonna get you.""<br/><br/>The Evil Dead is ultra low-budget, ultra gory, and ultra entertaining. I recently saw the Night of the Demons remake, which has a similar premise to this movie, (group of young people trapped in a house with demons and forced to try to survive until dawn) and I hated it. It's impressive how Evil Dead did right what Night of the Demons failed at miserably so many years later (and with the advantage of a bigger budget, I'm sure). <br/><br/>As the number of survivors in this horror flick fall to one, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is driven close to madness as he's forced to fight off the nightmarish attacks of his former friends, who have all become possessed Deadites. The demon-like creatures aren't content with just trying to kill him, they seem to take great joy in torturing him mentally as much as possible <br/><br/>The special effects and make-up are extremely well done. The Deadites all look quite gruesome, and there's a great sense of foreboding atmosphere before they even appear. It bears repeating how great all this looks, considering how low of a budget it had. Even if it wasn't as entertaining as it is, it still would be worth seeing just as an example of what can be done with creativity and not very much money."

","This movie is a very brutal horror movie. Some viewers may find the scenes of extreme violence an ordeal to watch though. And I recoiled in absolute terror at some scenes in this movie (And it takes allot for me to do that).<br/><br/>This movie is certainly not for everyone. If bone crunching violence & suspenseful horror is not your cup of tea stay clear of this movie. But if you want a good suspenseful thrill ride give this movie a go.<br/><br/>Also the make-up on the possessed people is very scary and I think is almost as good as the make-up in ""The Exorcist"". <br/><br/>Whilst this movie is not as good as its sequel Evil Dead II, it is still an alright horror movie. So if you can handle the very graphic violence you may find this movie very entertaining. I certainly enjoyed this one."

","Sam Raimi's classic horror-comedy still holds up after almost 30 years. Even though the plot may now sound very clichéd, and it probably did in 1981 too, it never hinders the fun of horror: A group of five friends, Ash, Cheryl, Scotty, Linda and Shelly (played by Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly respectively) drive to a remote forest cabin for a fun weekend but their plans are quickly put on hold by the presence of sinister forces from the unknown. After having inadvertently summoned the evil entities with the help of a strange book and audio tape found in the cellar, everything turns against them: the forest won't allow them to leave and starts assaulting them in gruesome ways, turning them into zombie-like freaks one after another. Ultimately only one of the friends remains human, intent on making it out alive...<br/><br/>The movie starts as an atmospheric suspense-driven horror film: the camera crawls near the ground like a preying animal, there's focus on creepy little details like a swing banging against a wall, a clock pendulum stopping by itself, a bridge ominously falling apart even before anything out of the ordinary has happened. Once the gore starts after about 30 minutes, it keeps evenly escalating into ridiculous amounts, conveniently shifting the tone towards comedy without awkward mood changes. The infamous vine rape scene looks genuinely nasty, providing maybe the most horrific moment in the story, and while the wild dismemberments in the latter half of the film are intentionally over the top, the tone maintains a feel of tragedy throughout – the freaks were once human beings, more than fodder for axes, bullets and chainsaws. Despite the excessiveness of the gore, the suspense is never allowed to fade away even at the very end, thanks to Raimi's skillful direction and the frequently oblique camera-work.<br/><br/>The effects still look excellent for the most part; only the stop-motion transformations of the climactic scenes at the end have dated notably, but I think their old-fashioned cartoon-like quality is really charming in a way. The screen-presence of the pus-oozing plastic monsters is on a wholly different plane of existence than the obviously non-existent CGI creations of many modern action movies.<br/><br/>Even though the actions of the characters aren't exactly believable, it comes across as awareness of the conventions of the horror genre instead of lazy writing, and surely provides a strong basis for a both funny and creepy piece of entertainment. The direction, music, effects and acting make sure The Evil Dead is still just as enjoyable as it was in 1981, completely deserving of its classic reputation. Essential viewing for any horror fan."

","As a horror movie fan you have to give props to ""evil dead"" and it's creators for beginning ""the ultimate gross out horror movie genre"" which scary movies today emulate. For example look at Cabin Fever, it's the same premise: group of friends take a nice vacation out in the woods at a cabin that turns into a disgusting blood bath of guts and gore with it's cause seeming to never end but back to Evil Dead; the film its self is incredibly cheap, the acting by the supporting cast is for crap but the horror element of it remained. I thought Bruce Campbell was extremely convincing and his reactions through the whole movie at times made it absolutely frightening. I still to this day have to fast forward through the part where Linda is possessed by the demon and she's singing ""we're gonna get you"" oh it gives me the chills!! The other 2 sequels weren't as creepy as this one but for those who aren't fans of Evil Dead 2 and Army Of Darkness b/c of that lack of creepiness it allows you to watch Evil Dead all on it's own without wanting the story to continue and be perfectly fine with it. This series reminds me of the Return Of the Living Dead series where although different movies entirely they still have an element of same plot, same characters, same outcome.it's a great combination of horror and dark comedy making it truly classic."

","Not quite a perfect horror film, but definitely a great and solid one. If you're looking for an extremely gory movie, you've found it. ""Evil Dead"" is a legendary cult classic that will both scare you and make you laugh. Some people argue that ""Evil Dead 2"" is better, but I disagree. The original ""Evil Dead"" is quite gruesome, thus it is very entertaining. Demonic zombies? People possessed by evil spirits? Evil trees? Now that's a movie for you. This is a great movie to watch late at night in the dark, and it is classifiable as a ""midnight movie"". Evil Dead is not like any other zombie movie that you may have seen; this one is quite original, and it lacks elements of the generic and clichéd zombie movie elements. Instead of your stereotypical zombies, you get scary, deformed monsters. Even murderous trees."

"Jacques98","7","0","6","31 August 2008"," Boyish childhood fantasy violence.
","Let me be blunt: I ignored this movie with my life for years because I assumed it was just another cheesy zombie movie that would amount to nothing more than yet another night of boredom that I'd end up falling asleep to. I LOVE zombie video games, but I have never once seen a zombie movie that could fulfill that awesomeness and utter zombie carnage that games like Dead Rising and Resident Evil did. Until I saw The Evil Dead, I assumed it was simply impossible to put that much awesomeness that zombie games have on film. Dawn of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead both bored me, were pathetic, and couldn't come close to filling that hole that zombie games put in my heart. So, why would I want to watch something like The Evil Dead? I only watched it because one of my favorite critics, Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation, suggested it. To my shock, The Evil Dead is the first and only zombie movie I have ever enjoyed. Ever.<br/><br/>Unlike boring George A. Romero films The amount of punk carnage was not toned down, much like the games I love. The characters actually have some personality and had something to say other than: ""Oh, God, zombies!"" over and over again. They didn't bother to ask what is going on, giving them a sense of self-aware realism. This movie was also purely for ENTERTAINMENT. Let me repeat myself: ENTERTAINMENT. Do half the directors/writers out there even know what that world means? There was no brainless social commentary we've heard since we were old enough to pee on our own, as seems to be included in every movie ever made by law or something. I think that is why I like Sam Raimbi so much, because he clearly states that his movies are for ENTERTAINMENT (I'm going to put that in all caps from now on in hopes some random director who stumbles on this will remember what it means) and not for retarded critical acclaim or some pointless social commentary.<br/><br/>As for the violence, for an 80's movie, it was freaking childishly amazing! This is the kind of stuff I'd dream about as a little boy. Some of the gore effects were hard to look at because they were insanely outdated, but they were few and far between. At times, they even added to the cheese atmosphere. This is just as violent as modern horror movies like 30 Days of Night and The Hills Have Eyes remake, if you can look past the armature blood effects. (I'm mainly referring to the lack of decent blood on the severed limbs/heads.) Also, the cheesy disturbing factor added to it. But unlike modern horror movieslike Mirrorsthere was no cheap cliché scares. The clichés that were there this movie created, which I can ignore. The idea of being raped by trees was pretty original and laughably disturbing, in a good way, as well. Also, the idea of zombies that . . . umm, shape-shiftedis that what they did?was both original and just awesome. I'm not even sure I'd call them zombies as much as vampire-evil-doll-clown-zombie-demon . . . things.<br/><br/>Overall, this gave me a new hope that zombie movies could be truly amazing and gory. This really is THE best zombie movie EVER. Why? Because it remembers ENTERTAINMENT.<br/><br/>What more can I say?<br/><br/>5/10"

","When Evil Dead came out first I was only a teen. A friend of mine got a copy of the film on bootleg and we watched it in his house when his parents were out. Back in its day it was considered a video nasty and pretty tough going. At the time, I found it terrifying - especially the bit where the demon is locked in the cellar. I got to watch the film again recently and I thought that it had dated badly. The special effects look very wooden nowadays. However, it is a landmark film and one of the first of the zombie genre. It will always hold a place in cinema history. Sam Raimi is to be applauded for making such a successful film for such a small amount of money. The sequels were rubbish and turned the franchise into a comedy show. I would love if someone competent were to do a remake of this film. Sam Raimi himself would be ideal...."

","I realize that 'there's nothing new under the sun', and 'it's ALL been done before', blah, blah, blah. But when dozens of EXACTLY the same scenes, dialogue, cinematography techniques, etc. throughout Evil Dead suddenly appeared before my eyes while I watched 1969's 'Terror Creatures From The Grave'--one HAS to wonder, '...what is up?' I've done some fairly in-depth research trying to locate a point in either Robert Tapert or Sam Raimi's careers where they even acknowledge the schlocky, black and white, barely-coherent 'Terror Creatures...', but alas, No mention has EVER been made by either of them of this movie that is obviously a HUGE influence if not straight-up SOURCE for their film Evil Dead. Why wouldn't they just say they were influenced to the point of plagerism? Probably not a wise career move, I'd guess. But to seemingly go out-of-their-way to conceal the connection between their movie and the old 'T.C...' is kind of strange, and I think frankly needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm a HUGE fan of the film Evil Dead, and it changed my life as well, so don't think I'm coming on here to destroy this film. It's a great film. It blows 'Terror Creatures...' out of the water. It also, unfortunately looks EXACTLY like it in so many places, I'm simply wondering why they took this much liberty at 'borrowing' from another film without ACKNOWLEDGING it's INFLUENCE.<br/><br/>I guess if you aren't a particularly creative person yourself, you wouldn't really understand how much this could be a very personal violation of one's time, energy and talent, when it is so casually borrowed and then tagged as someone else's stuff. Well, it really is one of the most horrible feelings you could ever imagine. I think the people that knowingly do this are some of the worst human beings on Earth. If this is a coincidence, I would just like to hear Tapert or Raimi's quote saying so, and my accusations are unfounded and out-of-line. However, until then, I am on a crusade to find out if this was intentional and has duped us all for all these years.<br/><br/>Thanks for taking time to read this.<br/><br/>Martha"

","As I sat down to watch The Evil Dead for the first time I was expecting to see an older version of Army of Darkness (since I had originally seen Army first).<br/><br/>As I watched I became more and more transfixed on how this movie (unlike Army's adventure, Sinbad, cheesy goodness) was truly disturbing and shocking. The movie held my ADD attention span for the entire length, with me begging for more by the end.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised as I watched a possessed character stab a pencil into another's ankle and TWIST (which makes me quiver every time I see it), another character dragged mercilessly through the woods by possessed vines to ultimately be raped by a TREE (you heard right), and another possessed character pounding and screaming while trapped underneath a cellar door, antagonizing the poor Joe Schmo character of Ash.<br/><br/>This film, needless to say, is not a happy tale and not for the family (other than the Manson family, of course). It's so shocking that I find it refreshing to watch every time I do so that I can get a break from the high budget ridiculous world of A movies.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi makes an outstanding directorial (feature length) debut with this very original movie. Shots and angles are set up beautifully, most of which are skewed on purpose for the reason of showing the characters in a world that is unreal, which, I thought, was proper training for his future Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>The average movie goer though may not appreciate this film. Do you see films once every 6 months or so? Films like ""The Notebook"", ""Little Miss Sunshine"" or ""Lady in the Water?"" Movies that you take your mom or girlfriend to? Yes? Then this movie isn't for you. The only people who can really appreciate this movie for what it is are the kind of people who have seen, and love movies such as ""Bubba Hotep"" and ""Man With The Screaming Brain"". The B movie fans.<br/><br/>This film is loved for all reasons. Most of all because of Bruce Campbell who portrays (beautifully) the Wimp to Leader of Men roll in this movie and it's sequels, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>What I like about this film is that it stands alone from it's sequels in that it was low budget and straight horror - no slapstick here, folks. Just pure gore, gore, gore. Story? Ha! Not here, sir. Too much grueling horror to take in all at once for there to be an Oscar worthy story here (Oscars are for snobby A list Hollywood types anyway). Again - that's what I love about this movie - it's simplicity, which, I think, was caused by the more than modest budget.<br/><br/>This film, along as entertaining, is also educational in the sense of film-making. This film is easily one of the most influential for filmmakers who just want to make a good movie. Someone could easily be influenced to make a movie if they were to watch three movies - Robert Rodriguez' ""El Mariachi"", Kevin Smith's ""Clerks."" and this movie, ""Evil Dead"".<br/><br/>In a world that's over saturated with $50-$250 Million epics, it's good to see a GREAT movie made for *only* $350,000. The lower the budget, the greater the movie, in my opinion as there's no option for money to save the day should a problem on set arise. As a filmmaker I know that no money means more creativity - you have to THINK your way out of problems, rather than buy those problems away (as most movie production crews seem to do) and, believe me - this movie is creative - you'll never look at milk, creamed corn and applesauce the same way again.<br/><br/>With talks of an Evil Dead 4 (possibly a remake) I cannot wait to see what Raimi, Tapert and Campbell have in store for us."

","This is the ultimate horror movie for teenage boys and a good place to get a horror obsession off the ground. It is well shot with a plethora of crazy angles and wacky point of view shots, it ladles the blood on thick, it has the King of Goofy (Bruce Campbell) in the lead role, and it's not afraid to be nasty. The special effects are more enjoyable than realistic and the rural setting works a treat. The film, shot on 16mm and blown up to 35mm, had a big technical influence on many directors and broke new ground in terms of horror-comedy. Campbell, as usual, delivers a tongue in cheek performance and wants us to have as much fun as he's having. Director Raimi went on to very big things (""Spiderman"", for example) and followed this up with a more technically polished sequel. My only complaint is that Raimi steers well clear of any female nudity. He should have known that teenage boys eat that stuff up. Bigger boys don't mind it, either."

","The Evil Dead. Ah yes. The first installment.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a group of people going to a rundown cabin in Tennesse. After looking around the place, they find a tape recorder, That's when it begins...<br/><br/>The acting is wooden. They are not the most experienced actors out there, but it's not really bad. The ladies are fine eye candy. Horror movies always deliver them well and this is no exception. The Violence is gruesome. The amounts of blood here are quite excessive. The makeup is good. The people indeed look quite disgusting. So far so good.<br/><br/>There is however a scene involving a tree and our first victim. What happened there was.....original and will definitely get your attention. Trust me. The movie is unrated for a reason.<br/><br/>We meet Ash for the first time here. Don't expect the calm and cool one here. He starts off as kind of a wuss. This is the first time he is witness to the awful events that unfold and how would anyone react to horrible things like this? Sam Raimi is a talented director. He already shows major promise here in his first big movie. The many things he does with the camera are unique. Don't forget the fake shemps. Even Ted Raimi makes his film debut here.(You have to listen to the commentary to find out where) <br/><br/>The Last Word: A good start. The cult following begins. Although not perfect, this is a fine campy flick. Good for a Saturday night party flick. Remember, this is not a comedy. A few funny scenes otherwise, it's pretty graphic."

","words cannot express how much i love this film. being an avid horror fan i gotta say this is the best one there ever is period. The scene where they drive through the woods in the middle of nowhere ( was actually in the middle of nowhere) to the cabin and the eerie music starts in the background still sends shivers down my spine cos it signifies we are in for a hell of a ride. Bruce Campbell (Ash) is the quisessential demon ass kicker how the hell he did not get a bigger push after this film is beyond me the guy is a legend, he goes from being a sissy, cowardly shop assistant to a bad ass in the space of about 30 mins. one word for Ash LEGEND. Cannot forget the support either absolutely magnificent and some of the scenes in that film will go down in horror folklore most notably the infamous tree rape scene or the pencil in the ankle and of course who can forget the scene where Scotty (Hal Delrich) chops up his former girlfriend into a million pieces, and oh yes how can we forget the underrated star of the show the howling wind that actually came about when Sam Raimi (Director) LEGEND, was asleep and he actually taped the wind that was creaking through his window and used it for the film. a stroke of genius. A lot of indie horror fans might think Sam Raimi sold out for doing the two brilliant spiderman films but not me. No for me it just proved what an absolutely fantastic director he is and he can only get better in face HE WILL get better the guy is a god. This film was made on an extremely tight budget and it became on of the scariest if not THE scariest horror ever made whereas these days Hollywood plough millions and millions of money into horrors purely for special effects, lots of blood but no suspense, but thats what Raimi did and thats how EVIL DEAD didn't just became another run of the mill horror. Go see this film, don't rent it, buy it and keep it for ever."

Sure, Sam Raimi's shaky camera movements may get irritating, but through all the action, gore and suspense, who really cares?? This movie is a fantastic B-graded horror. I was surprised at how far this movie went with only having 3.5 thou to make it! The gore was mind-boggling! The guts, the blood, the decapitations and the ankle part (You'll Know what i'm talking about when you see it!) The actors were a fantastic choice as well! Bruce Campbell... who could ever forget him for staring in this classic. He was the perfect person for it and always will be. Even when they do the remake of Evil Dead (approx. 2007) I'm sure it will never outlive the original. I suggest this movie to every horror fan out there!"

The movie takes you on your grip and don't let go until it ends. Now this is a gruel movie and many people don't like cause of that, but you have to remember that if you take this movie too seriously the experience will be shattered no doubt about it.<br/><br/>Also the simplicity of the plot is plus for me in this kind of movie. 5 young people a forest + Book Of The Dead + Evil Spritis + Remote cabin.

","The evil dead, one of the great low-budget horror films, proves that everyone can do something in a film, that little too no money shouldn't stop you from achieving your goals, and people who don't have sex in horror films can die.<br/><br/>Ash(Bruce Campbell) is camping out with his friends in an old creepy cabin when they find a tape recorder and a ugly-looking book(book of the dead). the voice on the recorder reads out a spell that brings out the demons of another world. Ash is now made almost the antihero when he becomes the last person alive from the horrible ordeal.<br/><br/>This film wasn't always smooth sailing(as if any low-budget film is), the movie in whole took 5 years to make because of lack of funding. You can see Bruce age from age 21 to age 26, you also see him sustain real injuries and many of the cuts on his face during the film are real. Also many of the actors left the film during filming, so many locals were called to finished the characters role, including Sam Raimi(director) and his brother Ted(who is in almost everyone of his brothers films).<br/><br/>Unlike other horror films, there is no sex,(""there's no hanky-panky in this film, kids!""-Bruce Campbell). Which makes the film more professional, But Sam still flashed a girl topless just for laughs. Sam tried to capture what real teenagers would do in a cabin miles from the nearest town, But when Bruce inhaled real marijuana smoke in front of the camera for a scene, he was totally senseless(he'd never done drugs before). But still the totally untrained actors tried there best to do every stunt, every emotion, everything that Sam threw at them for as little pay as $100 a week. One of the hardest scene to shoot was the last. How are we to end this film with a good kick? how about...The ""Force"" running through the house and into Ash. True non-acting locals were called in to do the sequence of doors, noises and Sam himself was behind the camera. He started at a shot of a leaf on the ground, then started running through the woods, through the back door, through the closed doors of the house, out the front door and straight into Bruce. Although there was a rumor that Sam did the whole scene on a motorbike because of the speed the camera seems to be going. The Evil Dead, a real start for Bruce Campbell and for Sam Raimi(who directed Spiderman+Spiderman 2), a true masterpiece for low-budget film history."

How can any filmmaker/video maker not respect Sam Raimi in that time for accomplishing what he did in 1983?! I have been making short videos/music videos since 1994. I have always had the taste of horror/gore, but was never ambitious enough to go full on and make a feature. Any movies i have made have been shot on video, and have been no longer than 40 minutes.

","The Evil Dead is one of those movies that sets out to offend. It certainly succeeded in offending the British censors in the 80s who promptly banned it! Whilst most of the film now looks hideously dated and isn't at all harmful, there is one scene which even I feel went a bit too far. The scene where a young woman is 'assaulted' by a tree, was, I felt, in very bad taste and really didn't need to be included. Aside from that, the plot is the usual 'five youngsters go to a remote house and get attacked etc'. It's all done fairly well and with extreme gore. The special effects are cheap and nasty, but they do the job. As horrors go, this is one of the best. No character will escape unharmed. It shouldn't be banned, but those who easily offend will not like it so stay away. More of a cult hit than a family film..."

For example the effect of the camera creeping through the bushes was not used as much when this film was made, and the production team managed this by attaching the camera to a plank and they had someone running around with it.<br/><br/>The script isn't great, and to tell the truth there aren't a lot of lines anyway apart in the first half an hour or so while the story is set, but as time goes on there's more bloodshed and less chat, which is good in a way.<br/><br/>There are very few special affects, and the while the appearance of the zombies is good it is basic, but as i said before, where it lacks in story and script it makes up with gore and pure violence. <br/><br/>Shortly after it's release it was banned for many years, and even after it was re-released there were many scenes that were missing, luckily not for ever. For example a scene where this woman is led out into the woods, wherefore the trees and plants come alive and rape here, called "" the tree rape scene"", or another scene where a woman gets a pencil stuck in her ankle.<br/><br/>Luckily though the full version is being shown on television, as it was last night where i watched it.<br/><br/>Towards the end as the number of characters diminish due to being killed or turned into zombies, the amount of talk lessens which leads the way to a climax of gore and violence.<br/><br/>This is a good film which is enjoyable despite a few faults, and i am looking forward to seeing the two sequels."

I found that after this film was released, an abundance of followers tried to match the rawness and ferocity of Raimi's picture but failed to achieve a level of belief. For a film with a small under used budget, unknown cast and a fresh director, this film achieved quite a lot in the ""critically acclaimed"" department.

The movie is difficult to like for many people because, yes it's effect are, we'll say low budget, but it's not in-your-face low budget, you can really see that they put the time into this movie. The premise for the movie is great, the horror in the movie is great, the demented nature of the movie is great, and Bruce Campbell is great.<br/><br/>While watching this movie you will either see what is in front of you and judge it accordingly, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this, I do it my self sometimes, where you may see cheesy effects, unoriginality, bad acting and something too silly to be scary. Others will watch this movie and see the TLC the filmmakers put in to it and the effects will be awesome, the story will be original, the acting will still be bad, and the silliness will be very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I know people who have been frightened by this movie, and I know people who hated this movie, I simply cannot tell you which kind of people like and dislike it, you'll just have to find out for yourself to which category you belong.

Catch ""Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn"" and ""Army of Darkness: Evil Dead 3"" for some of the same body horror but also some unequaled comedy, they are extremely funny ""Give me some Sugar, baby"" THE EVIL DEAD was perhaps for me the first and only movie I have had to genuinely physically leave the room (in daylight)because i was always haunted by it as a kid; not so much now but my VHS copy has disappeared so i will be getting DVD version soon. It is set up nice and slowly; with the five main characters arriving in (DIRECTOR SAM RAIMI'S) battered oldsmobile to a small isolated, derelict cabin in the middle of the woods. (BLAIR WITCH PINCHED THIS)Unfortunately it is home to a series of GHASTLY, PERVERSE, DEADLY, ROTTEN, Horrific, and downright URGH! DEADITES; or the Evil Dead; spirits, poltergeists, zombies and anything you can think of (TREE ROOTS) that in one night make it their mission to terrorise and kill, murder, bludgeon, butcher, massacre the group before daylight. Every room is haunted ground and even the surrounding woods are brought to life where a young woman is raped by the roots; SAM RAIMI'S trademark POV and ATHLETIC camera shots give the piece a macabre air in which every climax is paid off by screams from the audience; ASH (everybodys favourite cult hero BRUCE CAMPBELL) soon becomes an unwilling leader of the group and is forced to fight against the nightmare before they all die. This movie features dark, cramped, claustrophobic cinematography and some chilling BODY HORROR as seen in the likes of John Carpenter's 'The Thing' where the emphasis lies on the destruction of the flesh rather than the soul. The soundtrack (DIEGETIC AND NON-DIEGETIC) is memorable simply for the fear effect it induces on the audience throughout; the initial thuds of the synth score cruelly seem to give the woods life before the horror as you'd imagine a large tree moving would make the similar sound; and of course it's also the result of a possessed swing-rest hitting against the side of the house. One of the few horrors that never lets up; it simply moves from horror to horror and forces you to deal with it."

","Let me start by saying that this is not a movie for nine year old. it was not made for children. also avoid it if you are squeamish. this movie is Gory. I love gore so you can see why I like it. but it has an undeniable charm to it. This movie is not going to be every thing you heard it was. period. it is over-hyped just like everything else. but is one of my favorite movies ever. I've seen lots of horror flicks since i was little but this is what it's all about. if your ready to lower your expectations and have a good time on halloween see this movie. For everyone else don't watch it.I give this movie an 8/10 and a special place in my movie collection"

","I remember first watching this film as a ten year old kid, who had snuck a peek at his father's horror collection, and I ended up being absolutely terrified after seeing it, with it's utter scariness and blatant use of gore and decapitated limbs staying in my mind from years to come.<br/><br/>Recently I bought the Necrominocon Edition of the Evil Dead Trilogy, and this film is still as scary and brilliant as the day I first saw it (the same can not be said about it's commercialised sequels Dead by Dawn & Army of Darkness though). <br/><br/>One of the great things about ED is it's simple timeless tale of a group of friends going away for the weekend at a secluded and seemingly run-down cabin. The horror begins even before they get there, with a near fatal car crash, and a porch chair that seems to have a life of it's own. That's probably one of the great things about the ED, we are led to believe that all the trouble starts with Professor Knoby's reciting of text from the Necromonicon, but it's quite clear there is something evil in the woods, with Professor Knoby's recording only giving it the kickstart it needs to start Mayhem.<br/><br/>One stand-out performance in this film is Betsy Baker, who plays ""Linda"" - the ill-fated girlfriend of Ash, who when possessed by the ED is turned into a giggling demon who chants hilariously ""We're gonna get you, not another peep.."". It is an absolutely brilliant and comedic portrayal, especially when you see Baker as Linda before she becomes possessed, in which she is a quiet and reserved. <br/><br/>The horror and gore in this film isn't as gruesome as some of the stuff we see these days, but to put it in retrospect at it's time ED was rather controversial and was put in the same category as snuff-films by a lot of right-wing anti-movie violence and horror protesters. Though some might find the scenes with demons biting off their own arms, genitals being mutilated(the scene with Ash & the Scott-Demon) and a tree raping one of the females a bit too much to stomach.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a classic horror film. Although it doesn't have state-of-the-art SFX, or high production quality of mainstream horror films made these days, it's all about the atmosphere of the film, the comedic scenes of a possessed Linda and Ash and his buckleys hope of making it out alive."

","This film is a great example of what young determined filmmakers can do. Unlike ""13 Seconds"" This small time film was and is great. The writing was good, and acting for the most part was pretty good. It stars Bruce Campbell, who does a great job for his first feature film. The plot is exciting, and it has a good amount of scares. Evil Dead is a great movie for it's budget and time. It's fun to watch the begins of Sam Raimi's directing style. The film is slow at parts but over all it's a satisfying experience, that I would recommend to any lover of horror films, Bruce Campbell, or Sam Raimi. In my opinion it's one of the best horror films to come out of the 80's."

","It was a good movie for it's time and genre. Looking at it today, one can really see how truly funny and ridiculous it is. Contains all the standard clichÃ©s (ie: kids hears strange scary noises in the dark woods; naturally they must go out & investigate..!, etc). <br/><br/>Still it is a must see to appreciate the early years of this particular genre. Although the acting was atrocious at times, at least there was a plot. To give credit to Sam, there were quite a few inspired moments and subtle nuances throughout the film. The tree rape scene makes you wonder what was going through his mind to come up with such a concept. I think this scene alone accounts for most of the accolades this movie gets.<br/><br/>Overall, it is still an enjoyable ride, if you keep it in context.<br/><br/>Most subtle scene: The yokels they pass in the car and flip the ""boid"" to aren't waving hello...they are waving goodbye...."

","I first saw 'Evil Dead' way back at a guys' sleepover in the 7th grade. Up until that time, I had only been exposed to intelligent, PG-13 psychological horror films. I remember my friend showed me the 'Evil Dead' VHS slipcase and it read NC-17 on the back...wow, how exciting at this age...practically a porno! <br/><br/>Anyway, I prepared myself for the scare of a lifetime, only to come home the next morning with nothing but unsatisfied thoughts. I thought it was cheap, and went for all the blood and guts instead of plot. Years later, I came across the limited edition 'book of the dead' DVD edition of the film at Suncoast. I thought, ""Wow, I remember that movie. Too bad I'm not into it, because that looks like such a creative and fun release.""<br/><br/>Well, one thing that had happened since I had seen it back in the 7th grade, was my increasing taste and interest in old low-budget splatter films. So I went back home, called up my friend, and asked if I could borrow his beat up VHS copy to give it another viewing. Bam! Suddenly, something just came over me and I starting loving the movie. It was like I had never seen it before. So I went out later that week and ordered the very expensive 'book of the dead' DVD. Since then, I have seen it countless times.<br/><br/>I tried explaining Sam Raimi's grungy horror film in one sentence above, and I think I pretty much summed it up. It will seem like complete trash to some people, while it will be a treasure to others. The plot is simple, giving Raimi the energy to showcase his gore and distinct visual style. It's obvious he loves the camera, whipping it every which way and coming up with new techniques to shoot a scene.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the Three Stooges, Raimi injects the film with slapstick humor and laughs galore. This film represents the birth of one of the most popular cult icons ever: Ash. You know, the character played down to the bone by Bruce Campbell who eventually acquired a chainsaw for a hand and a shotgun in the other. The guy whose adventures with the dead continue in both Raimi-directed sequels; 'Evil Dead II' and 'Army of Darkness.'<br/><br/>'The Evil Dead' has lived on the back shelves of video stores for years, being cherished and kept alive by all those rabid fans out there. Even though Raimi is up to bigger things these days (the Spider-Man movies), I truly believe that this remains his best film. The one key to all of his movies. It will forever be his roots.<br/><br/>Yes, while the beginning may seem slow and extremely low-budget, stick with it. If you are an avid fan of the splatter genre, this may become your new favorite film."
"futuramafan105","Null","0","1","9 July 2004"," One of the best horror movies ever
","This film might not be appreciated by today's generation, who are only concerned with stupid slasher flicks with the same overused characters and plot. To some younger audiences (15 or so) this may seem unoriginal, considering this plot has been used so many times. Actually, this film was extremely original when it was released. Sure, it had bad acting and cheesy special effects, but that was only because of its shoestring budget. The film has been recognized as one of the best horror films of the 1980's, and because of the god-awful horror films being released today, it may be one of the best of the 90's, and even now. This film ranks up there with the true legendary horror films, such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (not the stupid remake, mind you). Be warned though: the film's pretty gross and gory, and there's one scene in the woods that may offend you. I wouldn't recommend it to children under 17. Rating: 5 / 5"

"writermage","Null","0","1","27 May 2004"," Trend-setting on a low budget
","I'm a huge Raimi/Campbell/Tapert fan for many reasons, but this film is the first and foremost. It's because when these three guys get together and rally their friends, the magic echoes in the higher-budget versions of the results Rennaisance Pictures achieves.<br/><br/>Case in point: Hercules and Xena were both filmed in New Zealand, years before that country became the locational mecca it is today. Granted, it took a movie like LORD OF THE RINGS to really bring New Zealand to the forefront, but it was the discerning eye of Renn Pictures that first brought us Middle Earth, back when it was Ancient Greece, back before all but extreme sports enthusiasts and avid travelers had ever heard of such a place as New Zealand.<br/><br/>But EVIL DEAD is our first glimpse of the influence Raimi has had on moviedom as a whole. With the use of jagged camera angles, a few stage-magic tricks, and some interesting composition, Raimi's direction really set the stage for a lot of now commonly-used techniques. Take the eye close-up: these days, a trick used so often to let us know what a character is really thinking or hoping for, turning up first in this movie. Another technique of Raimi's that has seen use in other films, one of them again being LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS, is the effect of dual personalities communicating with one another. Granted, this was more from EVIL DEAD'S two sequels, but it's just another example of the influence Raimi has had on film in general.<br/><br/>What is amazing about this film, however, is its effectiveness. While Lucas and Spielberg were creating fantastical spacecraft with the predecessors of CGI, Raimi was using two x fours and Karo syrup to make us scream. Even viewing it a few weeks ago the movie is still more gruesome to me than anything Carpenter ever did with ten times Raimi's $300K budget (Carpenter did a movie with the same theme, a little one called THE THING; EVIL DEAD is much scarier and more genuine).<br/><br/>One last thing that is worth noting is the acting of Ellen Sandweiss, who plays Ash's sister, Cheryl. (Nothing needs to be said of Bruce Campbell's performance, he's The Man and that's all there is to that!) Sandweiss's panic and terror were incredibly real, and her performance was amazing. It's too bad she decided not to pursue acting as a career, because she would have gone on to be great. Note her reaction to the vine that falls in her path as she follows Ash to the bridge when he tried to take her into town for an example of what I mean. And those of you who saw WITHIN THE WOODS, the demo picture shown to the investors of this movie, will also know what I mean.<br/><br/>All in all, I consider EVIL DEAD one of the best works of all time, not because it's CITIZEN KANE or GONE WITH THE WIND (hahaha), but because it is a movie that is purely made on the talent and imagination of its cast and crew. And a billion-dollar budget can't replace that."

","A first from a common favorite of mine, director Sam Raimi, and it shows. This movie is amateurish in many ways, the acting is subpar (but eventually leads to the rise of horror icon Bruce Campbell), and the story (now at least) is recycled.  What stands out about this gem is the directing, this film is double-dipped in style and I would see it just to experience that aspect of it.  This film also reeks of blood, the gore, even by todays standards, is astounding and the violence is quite startling (it is unrated mind you).  Other than that, the little score that is used in the movie is also quite chilling at times.  Check out this B-Movie classic and get a good thrill (also see the sequels)."

","The Evil Dead takes a not-so-new premise (young people go to a secluded<br/><br/>cabin and are killed off) and gives it some new twists.  The fivesome, not content with the usual distractions of alcohol and sex, instead lug an antiquated<br/><br/>recording device up from the sinister cellar and start listening to the tape which is still loaded up on it.  The recording, made by the previous tenant, details his discovery of a Book of the Dead, bound in human skin and inked in human<br/><br/>blood.  When the incantations within are spoken aloud, ancient demons arise<br/><br/>from hell and possess the living.  The recording awakens the semi-dormant<br/><br/>demons who are lurking outside the cabin in the woods and soon, the fivesome<br/><br/>are under attack from outside and from within.<br/><br/>This is a low budget effort filled with black humor and innovative special effects. It is one of the first films to feature over-the-top gore, as the possessed literally explode in showers of pus, vomit, guts, blood and oatmeal-y goo.  The plot is nothing special, but it doesn't really matter: it's all about the gross outs.  A girl is raped by a tree, another girl slowly chews off her own hand, a pencil becomes a deadly weapon and the possessed all sport milky-white contacts and layered<br/><br/>demonic voices that rival Mercedes McCambridge.  There's also some great<br/><br/>camera work here, as demonic POV shots skim over murky swamps, crash<br/><br/>through windows and race through the house to sneak up on the last survivor. This isn't a film about plot or performances; it's all about effects and this film boasts some incredibly good ones considering it was made in 1979.  It also<br/><br/>manages to create a great, menacing atmosphere  as the forest and even the<br/><br/>architecture turns on the group, trapping them all within the cabin and<br/><br/>preventing their escape.  <br/><br/>Followed by Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, this is still (in my humble<br/><br/>opinion anyway) the best entry in the series.

An old house somewhere in the dense forest infested with the malicious ancient spirits, that were waken from their eternal sleep by a group of teenagers that had come to the house to spend there some time making love and enjoying themselves. As all the spirits are wont to avenge their disturbed silence, that case wasn't an exception,  the manslaughter started taking place both in the house and outside it. Human beings paid for their intervention. It took almost an hour and a half for blood-thirsy ghosts to deprive themselves of intrusive people. During the film baths of blood are poured on the scene(the action mainly takes place in the house), main hero is just soaked to the skin with blood, some of his former friends are chopped into pieces etc. Trash horror classics, some moments are brilliant:struggle inside the house, Ash's possessed laughing  girlfriend; Campbell is just GROOVY."

I could go on about how Bruce Campbell, the movie geek's hero, puts Carrey to shame for one of the finest slapstick 3 stooges performances of all time. Or I could banter on about the innovative shots, that makes the film play like the Citizen Kane of 80s horror.<br/><br/>What I really love about the movie is the pure enthusiasm Raimi and his team pour over every moment. You can literally feel the presence of a young, nervous but confident and strikingly talented director at the helm, throwing his heart and soul into the production, with a genuine love of horror movies, comedy and film itself.

","THE EVIL DEAD is a scary horror film. It succeeds as one of the best in the genre because of extreme low budget made to great use in gore, action, and directing. Sam Raimi, director, has even said this is one of his best films. There is not a lot of flaws one would expect for a B movie like ""Evil Dead"". Instead, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses. Bruce Campbell is not as heroic as the sequels would show, but he still is great as a defensive fighter against the dead. It shows he is more vulnerable and at the time period, (79-81), nobody knew what to expect from Bruce.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is good to watch as the stepping stone to future horror movies. I'm sure Jason, Freddy Kruegger, Halloween, and other horror movie chain directors have used a page from Evil Dead with its mix of comedy and horror. I recommend you seeing Evil Dead II however, out of the Evil Dead trilogy, because it is a pictureque remake of this movie and a lot high-paced. Most importantly, it looks better on screen as the DVD for Evil Dead is still not as clean as one would expect."

","""Evil Dead"" will be known for its classic merits in the horrorgenre and it might be one of the pioneermovies in the slash and splattergenre but this doesn't take away the fact that this movie is hopelessly dated. Sam Raimi worked with a very low budget and was helped by the Coen-brothers with whom he was living on a flat, the theory says that they even used motorbikes to film some shoots. Anyway, the guts are there and it is great to see a movie just like it's been made by some students but the horroreffect I read about here on these pages isn't here at all (just watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to see the difference) and it's not very funny (sometimes you can't help of thinking to see some creepy Muppetcreatures rather than scary zombies, especially when the zombies are completely destroyed...blood never looked as much as ketchup as here).

Bruce Campbell says he was just learning how to act for the movies when he made it but he shows that he has talent that Hollywood missed out on.  I always wonder how much work the women of Evil Dead put into it.  Did they play their demon selves or are they just themselves as humans?  The directing of Sam Raimi's is undeniably great for a then young man.  When watching this, I wish I could be a film director and have this man's genius ability behind the camera.  Extraordinary!"

","If you dont like horror and gore and the woods at night you might not care for this film too much. I myself love the film. Being a horror movie buff i would hve to recommend tis film. I enjoy it very much. Most people i have seen this movie with jump at he height of a horrifying moment. To most people i saw this with hey told me that evil dead and texas chainsaw massacre were he two scariest movie ive shown them. Ill have to agree. Not only am i into horror movies but i love to hike in the mountains and woods and stay he night in  cabin. I think that is what freaks me out evn more about this film. Sam Raimi has made spider man which is critically acclaimed an so forth but i like his horror movie work a whole lot better. Evil Dead and The Gift were two of my favorites from him. Above all i recommend this film but dont be goin to any cabins anytime soon."

","The Evil Dead caused a lot of controversy when it was released in the UK. It was banned by the BBFC and was put on the list of obscene videos by the Director of Public Prosecutions. <p> This only increased it's popularity with the viewing public. The Evil Dead tips it's hat to a lot of earlier genre movies, and also has a lot of influence from other genres, notably the Three Stooges. <p> Whilst the production values are not up to Hollywood standards, there is no denying that the Evil Dead did prove a point. It was made on a low budget, it was made by people who had only ever made Super 8 movies. It wasn't intended to be a blockbuster at the Box Office. <p> Yet it gave a lot of cinema-goers thrills, chills, scares and gore. The soundtrack is very fitting, and just adds to the charm. <p> The Evil Dead is a classic. It will stand the test of time as a low budget, shocking yet funny horror film."

","I know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me on this, but I think this one beats THE EVIL DEAD II and ARMY OF DARKNESS by far, in my opinion. It's far simpler and less elaborate, not resorting to as many campy cheap thrills that those latter films resorted to.  Sorry, but I'm not into black humor, especially when it appears forced and contrived and silly.  If I want silly, I'll watch BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY.  This film has some of that, put it's played down and kept to a minimum.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone knows what this one's about by now.  Two dudes and three chicks go up to a cabin in Tennessee and find a book made out of human skin left behind by an anthropology professor, along with a tape recording of his last and final words.  The evil spirits then take over these guys and they start to kill each other off.  All except Bruce Campbell, that is...<br/><br/>It all is pretty standard stuff until the last scene where Campbell throws the book into the fire and the corpses of his dead friends start to melt and decompose.  It reminds me a lot of the claymation Ray Harryhausen used to do with stop motion photography.  Looks like they spend a lot of time setting that one up.<br/><br/>That scene looks pretty cool and imaginative, however I think there were far scarier 80s horror films out there, done by the likes of David Croneneberg, John Carpenter and Wes Craven, so I think this one's a bit overrated.  And nothing was more scarier at the time than the first TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. That one scared the living fu#k outta me.<br/><br/>The Anchor Bay DVD uses a pristine print and has all kinds of extra goodies on it, including unused footage, stills and posters, pictures of theater marquees at some various premieres around the country, Raimi and crew on location, etc.<br/><br/>Even though I think there are greater shockers out there, this one is still entertaining as hell.  7 out of 10."

The evil dead is not only a movie with blood that splashes everywhere and zombies and all that, but on the technical side, Raimi used camera and special effects processes to make his movie a piece of art on this side.. Maybe the story is not so original but remember in the Evil dead II, when Ash got his hand possessed by evil, if Evil dead is so lame, why they copied it in ""Idle hand"" with Devon Sawa and Seth Green? Devon's hand become possessed, he cuts it off and then the hand try to kill everybody, so, a girl come from somewhere with a dagger and a strange book to beat evil...

It is certainly not the 'masterpiece' that the ""Cult of Bruce"" touts it to be, but still I was impressed.  This really is more than just a ""kids-in-the-woods-slash-em-up""; if you pay attention you can see some clever writing.  We see a budding Sam Raimi becoming a true artist at his craft.  We see a young Bruce Campbell in his first big acting ""gig"".  I was even impressed with the other never-heard-from-again actors.  I expected hammy performances all around, but it wasn't that bad at all.  Considering the pathetic budget and constraints they had to work with, this is a very watchable piece of work.

","In my life I saw 2 movies who scared the sh*t out of me. The first one was CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, in '79. The other was EVIL DEAD, a few years later. Although HOLOCAUST is even harder, EVIL DEAD still is one of my favourites. The story is origineel, and it's perfect directed by Sam Riaimi, who also directed movies such as THE GIFT (with Keano Reeves). Bruce Campbell is excellent as Ash, a man who doesn't know what danger's ahead. Remarquable is the fact that a member of the Riami family also plays a role in the movie. Really scary music. This movie is a must for every horror freak like me, but still I've got to say that you've gotta be careful with the UNCUT-version. At the backside you see Ash without a leg, but that scene isn't in the movie on that particular tape. Be sure it's really UNCUT before you buy it, is my advice.

"grahm_cassius","8","0","1","19 February 2003"," Mysteriously evil, good but hurried and predictable.
","The filmmakers succeeded in every aspect of this film.  It gives off that nice evil tingle and leaves the mysterious, eerily evil woods a deadly substance.  It does, however, seem rushed as a whole and fairly predictable in general.  What is not too ""general"" or common is exactly what and how the things happen that do happen.  The Evil Dead clearly has an undeniable imagination behind it.<br/><br/>A small group of feeble-minded college kids go to a cabin they ""got for cheap"" in the deep forests of the hills out in the middle of nowhere. Upon exploration, a couple of them eventually find a book, ""The Book of the Dead"", in the cellar.  It is made of dried human flesh to bind it and its pages, which contain codes and dark yet skillful sketches, all strictly written in the blood of its flesh.  The man who last repeated the codes found in the book made a tape recording of his discoveries.  This tape is also found in the cellar.  The young men show everyone else in the group and make the mistake of playing back the tape, just out of curiosity. Unfortunately, the man recorded his readings of the codes found in ""The Book of the Dead"", so when these kids play them back out loud it is like a call to the evil within the forest, unleashing it.  This evil then turns brilliantly acted, by Bruce Campbell, Ash's friends, 1 by 1, into demons. The way these incidents occur are shockingly heartless, gross, nasty, and simultaneously convincing.  Ash is the focus as he is challenged by his ""proper"", heartfully caring sense of personality.  He struggles with his loyalty to his friends and inner strength is forced upon him as things become do or die.<br/><br/>Why a 7/10? The ignorance of potential.  The filmmakers had the ability to make it even more, and to make that ""even more"" shocking, as they have proven.  The sequels put this film in a comic book, which is not where this film should be.  The Evil Dead was a 9 for where the filmmakers were at when it was created.  Then the same creativeness applied to a slight ""don't make things be overwith so quickly"", for the sake of affective substance, would easily knock it to a 10.  Easily place it at the top of all horror films, period.  That is amazing, considering the fact that the entire movie practically happened in the area of a cabin and its wooded yard, combined with its group of 2 actors, 3 actresses as well.  How do you make a classic with that?  Upon answering you will realize the brilliance it took for The Evil Dead to accomplish what it did, has, and still is."

","This movie and ""The night of the living dead"" has to be the scariest movie in the 20th century. Slasher films have nothing on these zombie films. Slasher films are too predictable and zombie films are suspenseful. Just the fact of not knowing what's going to happen brings more fear to the viewer. When the incident occurs it's more surpising. Overall horror films of the 70s and early 80s are the best because the setting of the movie is dark, the sound effects are eerie, and at the time the movie can give you some restless nights. Nowadays horror movies are high-tech and computerized which takes the horror out of content and becoming more comical. There's nothing like that good low-budget film that gives the movie that gloomy look. This is coming from someone who was brought up watching horror movies in the late 70s and 80s."

","Released twenty years ago, 'The Evil Dead' is still a film that holds<br/><br/>up today. An unusual mix of grim horror and laugh out loud black<br/><br/>comedy, this first film of a trilogy has got more cult followers than<br/><br/>you could imagine. Girls, women, men, boys and children flock to<br/><br/>see this movie. While some moments aren't as shockingly original<br/><br/>as they were back then, most of it is still scary and holds up well.<br/><br/>The film opens with our hopeless hero Ash, his girlfriend Linda,<br/><br/>his sister Cheryl and their friends Scott and Shelly heading off to a<br/><br/>deserted cabin in the woods supposedely for a weekend of fun<br/><br/>and games. However, what starts off as fun turns into terror with<br/><br/>the discovery of the 'Book of the Dead' in the cellar and the tree<br/><br/>rape attack of Cheryl (an amazing scene, by the way). With his<br/><br/>friends possessed, all Ash can do is kill them without mercy<br/><br/>beforeb he becomes the evil dead's next victim. Many people over<br/><br/>the years have complained about the violence but upon watching it<br/><br/>today, it seems surprisingly tame for an 80's horror picture. And<br/><br/>yes, I AM watching the UNCUT version. To me it doesn't seem as<br/><br/>shocking as it would have been twenty years ago. Bruce Campbell<br/><br/>is genius in his role as Ash. In this film, he plays Ash as a witty,<br/><br/>intelligent, good looking college student who likes to hang around<br/><br/>with his pals but in the next two, he would be a bumbling idiot who<br/><br/>gets hit on the head a lot. Here, Ash is a normal guy who finds<br/><br/>himself surrounded by dead incarnations of his friends and there<br/><br/>is a great look on his face around the middle of the film that says<br/><br/>perfectly ""I'm all alone and surrounded by the living dead"". A lot of<br/><br/>these character traits are thanks to Sam Raimi, writer and director,<br/><br/>who has wrote a genius script and directed it like a pro. He's even<br/><br/>created his own type of shot! For me, 'Evil Dead' is my least favorite<br/><br/>of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy with 'Army of Darkness' being my favorite<br/><br/>but that doesn't mean to say it's a bad film.

","(BEWARE OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>
Well, watch this movie to find out.  Why is it in horror films when creepy things start to happen, the people always have to go out in the woods alone or go down into the dark basement.  As soon as some door flies open, I'd be out of there.  But of course, in this movie, when Ash's friends start turning into possessed zombies, he just wants to hit them over the head or lock them in the basement instead of getting the ax or chainsaw and dismember them like the tape said too.<br/><br/>
There are some jump out of your seat moments and quite a lot of gore. It is more serious than funny. I did think it was funny when Ash knocks the head off his girlfriend and the body falls on him and all this blood just flows all in his face. That was so ridiculous. Just like when he pulls that stick out of the zombie guy's leg and blood gushes out and the guy keels over. And of course, when Scotty gets the ax and really takes it to his girlfriend. Pieces of her are just flopping on the floor and both guys are like ""we should bury her."" What! How stupid can you be to go outside in the foggy, creepy woods when your friends are being possessed by demons.  But the stupid award for this movie goes to Shelly because after being basically ""raped"" by a bunch of tree limbs, she still agrees to go back to that cabin after her and Ash find the bridge destroyed, and she doesn't even tell them what happened to her in the woods.  She even gets ready to go to sleep! Who could sleep after that!<br/><br/>

","This ultra low budget quicky could very well be the best horror movie ever made. This is the first and best of the trioly that was followed by Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn and the fantasy/comedy Army of Darkness. Where Evil Dead 2 took a more comedic aproch this movie is a little more horror and a little less slapstick. Sam Ramai gives the viewer a lot from very little, Ramai has always been known for taking his films one step above anything out there at the time and he does just that here. The special effects are beoynd belief considering this was made in the early 80's and some of the most unique camera angles of all time. The most original thing about the whole movie is that we never actually see the spirits, they always take the form of the camera adding to the suspense. The movie also may be one of the goriest of its kind, there is constanly blood and limbs flying in every direction. But of course there are some scenes that will turn some people away like a scene where a girl gets molested by a tree. Bruce Campbell is excellent as the lead who's slapstick style reminds me of an early Jim Carrey. Although it is probably too weird for mainstream horror fans this film have become a cult classic over the years and for good reason."

","I love horror films, but finding a good scary horror film is not something that occurs very often. Then I hear about the Evil Dead,- a film for which I haven't seen a bad review so I thought I would pay out some of my hard earned money for a copy on VHS. Were my expectations too high? Maybe. In the opening scenes, the acting is wafer thin, the script not too good either. Then the scene with the cellar was genuinely creepy,- if the rest of the film was left to the imagination like this scene then I think maybe we would have a timeless classic on our hands. Very tense. Some of the special effects are still impressive (even 20 years on), but the make up is just hillarious. It isn't scary, it just seems like a joke. The reactions from the cast when they encounter the ""undead"" is so annoyingly bad,- imagine one of your best friends/your girlfriend has been possessed by an ancient evil spirit, i'm sure you'd look just a little bit concerned/frightened/confused. Not just ""lets kill it"" without an element of ""what the hell is going on?!""<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being harsh, as apparently the film was made with a reasonably small budget,(which would perhaps forgive the amazingly non-frightening make up), but how hard is it to look frightened or to look surprised? This film could've been brilliant, but it is two dimensional with a poor script with mediocre acting - and this comes from somebody who loves horror movies. That aside, if you've had a few beers and you are with your mates this film would definitely be a good laugh. The disappointing this about that is it isn't intended to be a comedy. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible film, just not as good as it is made out to be,- don't believe the hype. Watch it without expecting much then you will probably enjoy it. 6 out of 10 for effort."

It is about 5 friends that go out to an old cabin in the middle of the woods and stumble upon an old tape recorder which recites ancient words bringing an evil spirit into this world.  Although, it is one of the scariest and gruesome movies I have ever seen, It also has its comedic moments as well.   This has got to be the greatest horror movie I have ever seen in my life.  Bruce Cambell (Ash the hero) gradually transforms from an everyday-joe into a rough-and-tough killing machine (not to mention his dwindling sanity).  I totally dig the special effects and the mix of horror and comedy.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an original scare.  Overall: Great movie (10 stars)"
"uffe-5","Null","0","1","4 January 2000"," I loved it!
","Where I come from, ''The Evil Dead'' is hard to find. So, it was clever luck that I happened to see the uncut version with a friend at my place. You can say what you want about cinema-art but I really liked this movie. It was so simple made, but it got so exciting and entertaining. The cheap (no offense Sam, this is a minimum-budget movie) special effects are a tribute, cause the better the effects in a horrormovie are, the worse the movie itself get. **Minor spoiler** In the end of the movie, when the dawn raises you feel calmed, since Bruce is safe now when the sun is up. That is why you get even more horrofied when something runs up at him from behind. **End of spoiler, keep reading** The movie is very caotic, but realistic enough to think that it is scary. I should have seen it late at night, and I'm still sorry for seeing it 16.00 pm. But I can imagine seeing it at the night!<br/><br/>
Classic! 4/5"
"jr1bd","Null","0","1","3 November 1998"," An excellent low-budgeter
","Sam Raimi's classic The Evil Dead is not like any other bloodfest. Raimi focuses mainly on the suspense, and this he does well. In my opinion, he is above any other horror director such as John Carpenter or Wes Craven. Even the infamous rape scene is as beautifully directed as Hitchcock's Psycho shower scene. He is certainly a director with much potential, and this can be seen in his other Evil Dead films. However, like many other Horror films, it loses much of its touch when viewed with others. You've got to love the Play-Do special effects."
"That Guy","9","0","1","30 October 1998"," One of the BEST HORROR movies ever!!!
","Remember in 'Halloween' where Michael Meyers is in almost every scene and you're screaming at the screen ""Look out!  He's right behind you!""  Well, in 'Evil Dead' you're screaming that, but you don't exactly know what they are supposed to watch out for.  The evil in the movie has no real identity other then it possesses.  And this possession is a lot more frightening then the one in the 'Exorcist' because we don't know what it is.  At least in the 'Exorcist', someone could stop the devil.  In this movie no one can stop the 'Evil Dead.'"
"JeffG.","9","0","1","30 August 1999"," Low-budget horror classic!
","Despite the incredibly low budget of this movie (which shows in everything from the superimposed moon to the obviously fake blood and gore), this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made. Unlike most horror movies made back then, and now, this film is sprinkled with touches of dark humor. One of the things that sets the ""Evil Dead"" movies apart from most horror films is their unique combination of traditional horror fare with dark comedy. This is a film you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it. One of my favorites! The other two films, ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness"" are also well worth watching."

","In Raimi's first movie you can already see his directing qualities. Conceived as a ""This is cheap, but let's see how many people are going to throw up their lunch"" film it features extrodinary camera work and a brilliant actor (Bruce Campbell) and Raimi did well in concentrating on them. Because of the bad script and the lousy co-actors, this appears indeed as a first try and in his second try (Evil Dead II) he adds what is missing in this film: humour. But with a few beers and friends it still is a sweet little movie, but nothing more (I give 6 out of 10)."
"Mel-61","Null","0","1","16 October 1998"," The last great horror made so far!
","This was the first of the three Evil Dead movies. It is also the scariest as the other two are really comedies disguised as horrors. I first saw this movie while in the mountains on an Army exercise with two other males and I can tell you that no matter what type of false bravado there was between ourselves, this movie had all of us looking over our shoulders out there.<br/><br/>A group of young campers visit a cabin in the *mountains* (now you see why it had us nervous) and unwittingly releases demonic spirits that take over the souls and bodies of these young campers. The premise from here is sort of like the Exorcist (MAGNIFIED). From there the film will have you on the edge of your seat. The make-up and special effects are average but this was a low budget film. This type of movie was made to be seen in a nice secluded place, or on a miserable rainy night with all of your lights off, not during the day with a whole lot of people around you (It's easy to *act* brave when you watch a horror movie with several other people). I've exposed a lot of people who thought that they could watch this movie in the house alone with all of the lights out and they ALL haven't watched it a second time that way. Also for the guys, trust me on this, if you've just met a nice woman and invited her to your place to watch a movie, (if she agrees to watch a horror) ""THIS IS THE ONE!!"" it'll have her clinging on to you throughout most of the movie. It's happened to me several times. This is the last GREAT horror film that's been made up to this time!"

"Michael_Pilkington","Null","0","1","12 March 1999"," Too long and gory
","At 85 minutes of running time, ""The Evil Dead"" seems pretty long.  It seems to go nowhere.  Five friends travel to a remote cabin and stumble on to a book titled, ""The Necronomicon"" (a.k.a. ""The Book of the Dead"") and a recording causing the dead to rise.  One by one, everyone is possessed and starts killing each other in gory fashion.  There's more blood and gore than suspense in this first installment.  A little bit of humor would have helped; it worked for the next two sequels.  The only good thing I can say about ""The Evil Dead"" is that it doesn't suck.  My evaluation: ** out of ****."
"Chris-332","10","0","1","23 February 1999"," Good, but not as good as 2 and 3
","Evil Dead is a good cult movie, but has many errors. One of them is that it's supposed to be a disturbing and scary movie, but has an over the top and pretty cheesy plot. That's probably why 2 and 3 added loads of comedy which turned those two into marvelous movies. But having it serious, though, it doesn't really work. I give it credit for the directing and sort of disturbing scenes, but I highly recommend that you see Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness first. Evil Dead 2 is sort of a remake of it, so it won't hurt you at all by seeing those 2 first."

","For some strange reason, this film didnt really do anything for me. That's kinda sad, 'cause I was really looking forward to seeing this film. I had read some great reviews, and word of mouth among mates was good, and I know it's become a hell of a cult classic, so why didn't I like it?<br/><br/>The simple fact is - I just didn't care about the main characters. I didn't CONNECT with any of them. I know it was an independant film, and on that basis it deserves a 10 for special effects and make up and so on, but if I am to judge the film as whole, then it hits just over average. I firmly belive that the main factor that NEEDS to work in a film if it is to succeed, is to have the audience relate to or care about the characters in the film. This, to me, fails to do so, and I was left wanting a few of them to die!!<br/><br/>The story was good, with some intelligence, and the acting was deliberately OTT - Bruce Campbell is the king of Ham acting!! So I didn't mind these small trivial facts, I took it for what it was. I enjoyed it, but maybe it was hyped up too much?<br/><br/>There were some genuine frights as well, I have to admit. The 'tree rape sequence' was, for me, slightly disturbing, but I had been warned that I could either view it that way, or just laugh, I'm glad I didn't react the latter way.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an average horror film. It's not amazing and it's not trite.<br/><br/>You need to watch this film so you can say that you HAVE seen it, but don't expect much, go in with an open mind and just take it for what it is - a B movie spoof. Which, if you put it that way, is kinda interesting...<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit on your grave and other classics were classed as Video Nasties' in England.

Anyway finally saw and was scared to death, something that never happens and unfortunately has never happened since.<br/><br/>Ever since then I have loved this film, made with such passion, yet with so little money.  So much in your face' horror.<br/><br/>I'm sure in this modern age, some will even laugh at this movie, but at the time, for me, it was wonderful and scary.<br/><br/>I remember a number of people remarked on how Sam Raimi would go on to become a hugely successful director, it never happened as every other film he made was quite poor."

","Stephen King has called it ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror."" It certainly lives up to and exceeds that. The Evil Dead is one of the greatest and funniest horror pictures ever made and an inspiration to filmmakers everywhere. It's an undisputed classic. Shot in 1979, it's still just as effective today. The gallons of blood, the flying body parts, the evil laughter, it's all in good fun. And, yet, it's all horrific. The movie works so well largely because of four factors: the genius of Rob Tapert, the stylish direction of Sam Raimi, the crude make-up of Tom Sullivan, and the facial expressions of Bruce Campbell. Everything is forced to blend together seamlessly. It's all beautifully and brilliantly done. The Evil Dead is a cult favorite for a reason. And if you've been living in a cave, check out the sequels.<br/><br/>""Why have you disturbed our sleep, awakened us from our ancient slumber? YOU WILL DIE...like the others before you.

","Five chums vacate to an old abandoned cottage, only to wind up inadvertently summoning some nasty demon spirits who have a tendency to possess the lads. Mind-blowing special effects and stunning cinematography highlight this cult classic, especially considering its meager $50k budget.  Writer/director Sam Raimi really shows off his talent here, effectively combining gut-wrenching terror with stomach-churning gore to create a certain feeling of uneasiness in the viewer.  And even though the actors tend to overdo it a bit (a quality which actually adds to the creepiness of the demons, but detracts from the movie as a whole) and some sequences are just a bit drawn out, anyone who appreciates a good scare will no doubt dig this film."
"Chris-375","6","0","2","20 January 1999"," Not the movie I expected to see...
","The Evil Dead was a movie that I had wanted to see for a long time before I actually saw it.  I read many plot outlines and reviews of the movie and I still couldn't really piece together what I thought the film would be or how good it would be.  There are cult followings to the film so I thought it must be pretty good.  When I finally did see the film I was surprised to find that it did not grasp me the way I thought it would.  There is nothing really scary or funny in this film.  The deadites are kind of weird looking but it's nothing I would scream or laugh at.  Now I know that the first in the Evil Dead Trilogy is not supposed to be a comedy but a horror film but the monsters are very fake looking and there is no creepy music or anything. I actually found myself easily distracted from this movie because of the lack of interest I had in the characters and lack of suspense.  I found the film inconsistent with how one could become possessed by a deadite.  I started wondering if you had to be bitten, touched or just in the same room as one of the deadites.  And if so why did Ash (Bruce Campbell) not suffer the same fate as his friends.  There is a lot of blood and gore in this movie so kids would most definitely be frightened by it.  For people who love blood and gore you might like this movie but it just doesn't have enough good qualities for it to be a top notch horror movie.  So if you were like me and listened to all the buzz about this movie I say don't watch this with really high expectations.  It's not bad but I don't think it's deserving of all of the praise it has received.  ="

","When I was a child and this film came out a lot of rumors were going around: that it was one of the goriest and sickest movies ever made and only the toughest guys had stick it out till the end. Nineteen years have passed and I´ve seen Raimi´s flick about 6 or 7 times. As you see, I have survived and ""The Evil Dead"" now belongs to my favorite horror movies ever! This film is really sensational: realized with nearly no budget it became one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. Sam Raimi´s work is gory as hell, the make-up F/X are well done and the ""flying camera"" and a lot of unusual camera angles make this flick being a unique masterpiece! This film was banned in Germany for a long time until an annoying cut version came on the market. Author Stephen King called ""The Evil Dead"" one of the best shocking movies ever made and main actor Bruce Campbell became the greatest cult star of the modern horror genre. Together with director Sam Raimi he also filmed ""The Evil Dead II"", which is a very enjoyable shocker, too, but after all more a remake to the original. ""Army of Darkness"", which is the third part of the serial, really disappointed me - the original stays unrivaled, an immortal cult classic!!!"

","I'm not a huge fan of messy horror flicks, but when I watched Sam Raimi's bloody thriller, ""The Evil Dead"".  I wondered if I was being too harsh on the film although I did like the sequel to ""Urban Legend"", Wes Craven's ""Scream"", and David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"".  The three films had one thing in common - they were very graphic.  The film takes place in the backwoods of Tennessee where a few Michigan State students drive up to a wooden cabin to spend a few days there.  Soon the students discover that they aren't alone when some demons called ""Shemps"" come after them.  The Shemps don't go down without a fight and take a severe beating (more severe than Stallone took in the ""Rocky"" films and Walken took in ""The Dogs of War"").  Although the violence is very graphic, I wasn't bothered by it and part of that comes from the excellent camera work.  The film made stars of director Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who plays the heroic Ash.  ""The Evil Dead"" is a first-rate shocker."

The special effects in Evil Dead aren't that great but are highly effective for that matter.

And the sound effects are excellent as well. (the wind blowing!!!!) Highly recommended for fans of the genre.

","For years I had heard this thing hyped to the hilt and finally the other night I rented it to find out if I would love it as much as everyone else. I know its inappropriate to compare a sequel to an original work before the sequel came out, but I had been a relatively big fan of ""Evil Dead 2"" for many years so I looked forward to this.  Unfortunately, this thing takes forever to get to the much heralded gore, and when it does, it's just plain ridiculous.  There's the usual blood, but director Raimi also shoots white, green and an assortment of other colored goo at us which eventually ends up looking dumb.  Especially in the last five minutes, where it is literally non-stop disembowling on a couple of the bodies that seemed to squirt anything Raimi could think of.  Stuff I would venture to say doesn't even exist in the human body.  One character even appeared to be shooting cottage cheese at one point as his (or her, the body was so badly deformed I couldn't tell anymore) innards were displayed endlessly.  And for the first time in a film, and I would guess the last, a woman is even forced to have sex with a wooden stick!  This is all happening because of wacko spirits who have been released from an ancient book in a remote mountain cabin where some college students have gone to unwind.  Instead, these spirits, which REALLY delight in possessing and then opening up their victims ad naseum, show up to ruin their fun.  The cast is ok, there are some good spooky shots, but the over the top and ultimately silly gore moments make this solely for serious bloodhounds."

","Typical early-eighties gorefest (a la Rita Mae Brown's ""Slumber Party Massacre"") that aims to be a sly satire of the genre but never begins to transcend it. Sam Raimi's first feature has none of the humor and storytelling skills that would come to be a hallmark of his later work (most notably the romantically swoony homage to the Universal horror films of the thirties, ""Darkman""). It plods along with far too many cliches until the second half when, during the vividly gruesome action sequences, Raimi's inventive imagination comes alive through Tom Philo's camera and Edna Ruth Paul's deft editing. (Joel Coen is Paul's assistant.) Then it gets kinda fun."

Now I'm not saying that every low budget flick has a good plot, nor am I saying that every high budget flick has a bad plot, all I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter.  This movie captures the essence of a good horror movie.  Raimi, Campbell and the rest of the production staff made this film a masterpiece of the modern screen.

This movie is pretty good and very similar to Evil Dead 2, but it lacks the humour that made the two sequels so good. This movie is basically a kinda gory suspenseful horror. You don't even need to see this one to enjoy the other two because Evil Dead 2 summarizes this one pretty effectively. By all means, go and see it, but don't expect the humour and camp of the other two, which are much better. What you will see is all the same great camera angles and techniques, which work really well in all three movies. Worth seeing."

","What else can I say about the story that everybody else hasn't. But I do disagree with a lot of people, because I do consider this to be a so-so horror film. Effects are decent considering the budget, and their some really off the wall humor, but that's about it. Movie is not able to substain interest till the end. 5 out of 10."

","The first bane of the infamous Evil Dead Trilogy aims distinctly at disturbing and frightening the unwary audience.  However, dispensable body parts flying routinely through the air under buckets of blood, as well as, a shrieking ominous-eyed zombie endeavoring to break through a locked trap door in the floor make this movie disorganized and chaotic. Perhaps this apocalyptic state of despair in an abandoned cabin is supposed to jolt us. Instead, a Romero-experienced viewer will nod in yawning recognition at this mediocre flick of tedious gore. The only marks I'll give credit to are the scenes when one unfortunate damsel is raped by tree roots, and the unique ending scene which is truly a marvel of modern camerawork.  Bruce Campbell gives little comic relief as the bewildered Ash, but he gives signs of being the epitome of a horror hero: strong, tenacious, unforgiving.  Take my advice, see the following two (""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army of Darkness""), they are gems!"
