","I am 31 so I was 3 when this movie came out. The first time I saw Saturday Night Fever was the ""Edited For Television"" version probably when I was 6 or 7 years old. At that point, it was about the music, the dance scenes and the clothes.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be until years later that I understood what a great story this is. It's a coming of age movie. It's a modern day tragedy. It's a love story.<br/><br/>The first thing that people think about when they hear Saturday Night Fever is disco and bell bottoms, but the story is timeless. Travolta plays Tony Manero, a loser in a nowhere job who only feels alive when he is on the dance floor at the local disco. There he is adored by his friends, by women and by strangers. There he is king. Everywhere else he is nobody. Even at home.<br/><br/>Tony becomes infatuated with a woman named Stephanie. On the surface Stephanie appears to be much better off than Tony. For the most part Stephanie is a big talker, but Tony is bothered by her observations.<br/><br/>""Let me guess. You work all week long at some dead end job and then you go and blow it at all at 2001 (the disco) on the weekends. You're a cliché. You're no one, going nowhere."" As much as Tony is upset by her words he can't argue with them. Soon Tony becomes frustrated with his ""station in life"" and tells Stephanie he wants out (of Brooklyn).<br/><br/>What makes Saturday Night Fever work so much for me is Tony is very typical of a lot of males who would rather have a good time and party now than build something toward the future. Bars are full of guys like Tony. Guys who are super stars in their local drinking establishments, but have no life outside of the night life.<br/><br/>And of course there's the superb dance scenes that most people remember Saturday Night Fever for. The soundtrack is also one of the best out there.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, Saturday Night Fever also has my favorite closing shot of all time. It's really nothing special, but I get choked up every time I see it.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is also a snapshot of a period in recent American history. The movie took place in 1977. The country was a mess after the Vitenam war ended and before Reagan stormed Washington and once again instilled a sense of pride in Americans. There was no longer a war to protest, but the average American didn't have much faith in our country. I think Saturday Night Fever does an excellent job of capturing what was probably a common attitude among young adults during the late 70's. Live for the moment because the future is pretty bleak."
"Det_McNulty","8","73","85","20 March 2007"," Beautifully Defines An Era On The Backdrop Of A Realistic Class Study and Dynamic Music
","Although it may seem dated and cheesy to some viewers today Saturday Night Fever remains one of the most underrated examples of '70s pop-culture. It is undoubtedly the quintessential dance flick and remains one of the most entertaining films of all-time. Yet, behind all the music and entertaining aura you are actually viewing a drama studying the American class system and young rebellion. Though at times it is slightly exaggerated, it still manages to capture a vast amount of authenticity and ultimately the sights and sounds of the time.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever follows self-proclaimed ""dance king"" Tony Manero (John Travolta) and his love of dancing and the trials and tribulations of his life in the Bronx. He soon meets an arrogant fellow dancer named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Quickly becoming attracted and influenced by the women he starts questioning the way he lives his life.<br/><br/>The film is not always upbeat and at times can be depressing, particularly the scenes depicting peer-pressure. Although both have their differences, both are very alike and ultimately want to be something ""big"". There are also the elements of jealously, rivalry, religion, rebellion, respect and racism added into the film. This captures the realism of the time and with more accuracy and honesty than a lot of films. Just take a look at the brief scene where Tony is on the tube, this is an oddly poignant, effecting and compelling scene presenting Tony's confused emotions.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever still carries the vibe, rhythm and atmosphere it did back in '77. It remains one of the most influential films for both the film-world and pop-culture. Infamously holding some of the greatest dance sequences ever committed film; you can feel the energy, emotions, time and determination that were spent perfecting the dance scenes to the finest detail. The lighting is perfect at creating the ""disco world"", the set-piece of the 2001 Disco is one of the film's many iconic highlights.<br/><br/>John Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character, fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too, it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the ""strut"" in their walk, representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being ""cool"". All the characters want to be something, while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their working-class backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American social-comments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.<br/><br/>The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love, drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect, it has intelligence as well as entertainment, which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets."

","An uneducated Brooklyn teen (John Travolta, in an Oscar-nominated role) lives in a dream world over the weekends as the king of a disco dance floor. Disillusioned, quietly upset with where his life is, Travolta finds solace by dancing in public to Bee Gee's music and finds love with his newest dance partner (Karen Lynn Gorney). The duo practice for an upcoming contest that could mean total success at last for Travolta and the opportunity to get discovered doing what he really loves. Travolta and his friends seem destined to go down a path of destruction though as a soap opera develops for all the key people found within. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a total over-achiever as it could have fallen to exploitation tactics of the 1970s, but becomes one of those iconic films that still stands the test of time. Travolta is a revelation in arguably his greatest role. The other players are adequate and the screenplay is deceptively smarter than it appears on the surface. The movie also works as a time capsule to a part of contemporary American history where discos and bell-bottoms were all the rage. Still one of the finer films of the time period. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"notarepublican","9","43","50","17 June 2003"," Modern, and Misunderstood, Classic
","While the movie is more apt to be recalled for its impact on American pop culture, few who watch the movie will ever see beyond the admittedly fantastic dance sequences.  As a result, many people might never recognize Saturday Night Fever as perhaps one of the best movies ever made about class struggles among white ethnics.  <br/><br/>While his quick study under Denny Terrio for those dance sequences showed a great deal of determination, Travolta's Tony Manero shines in so many other way.  The looks of embarrassment and exasperation that his character expresses when confronted with the possibility of working in a Bay Ridge paint store all of his life, or the prejudice and regional chauvinism of his friends, or the behavior of his friends at White Castle or his initial inability to express himself to Stephanie in any way that might impress her, all of these and more contribute to a fully realized character. <br/><br/>
While Tony's friends idolize him, the movie never really does, but it does allow empathy for his plight, because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence.  While much might be made of the homophobia, racism, and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends, these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character, but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.<br/><br/>Forget those who call this a musical.  While the music is an intricate part of the film and setting, Travolta's performance is what sets this film apart."
"MovieAddict2016","10","104","130","14 January 2004"," ""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" - Tony Manero.
","I love this movie.<br/><br/>I love the way it focuses on dancing, yet it isn't about dancing at all. Yes, long amounts of time are given to showing John Travolta light up the dance floor, but the story's fundamental point is the most subtle: Trying to escape from your boring daily routine, even if it is just for an hour.<br/><br/>
That's exactly what Tony Manero does. He saves up his weekly earnings from where he works in downtown Brooklyn at a crummy hardware store, then blows it all in one day at the local disco joint, where he reigns as king. His female dance partner calls him a walking cliché. In a sad sort of way, it's true.<br/><br/>But this is Tony's dream. I quote an aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin: ""Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime."" ""Saturday Night Fever"" is based entirely on this idea. In an odd sort of way, Rupert Pupkin is a lot like Tony Manero. He just has a different dream. We all do.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Live's"" theme tune, ""Staying Alive"" (the title of the horrendous Sylvester Stallone-directed sequel), speaks as much truth about life as the film itself. ""I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me, I'm goin' nowhere, somebody help me yeah"" chants a voice in the Bee Gee's universally known disco hit. As I listen to it right now, I realize just how perfect it is for the movie. It's a legendary song, and for good reason.<br/><br/>I didn't grow up during the disco generation. But ""Saturday Night Fever"" makes me feel as if I had--and that is one of the fundamental keys to a film so incredibly outdated and yet still poignant in our memories. It was the film that solidified John Travolta as an icon, and the film that eventually led to him being regarded as the King of Cinema Disco. (In the Travolta film ""Get Shorty,"" a criminal threatens a producer by saying that, if he doesn't pay up, he'll be ""dead as disco."" Ironic.)<br/><br/>Travolta is in his prime spotlight as Manero, a Brooklyn kid aiming to make it big on the dance floor. There isn't much to the movie other than the need for fame--as brief as it may be--and the most obvious theme of the film, which is learning to treat women as something more than just sex objects.<br/><br/>Tony and his pals all join together at 2001 Odyssey, a crummy disco club with dizzying strobe lights and a constantly-waxed dance floor where Tony is often encouraged to let loose and show everyone his moves. When he's not doing that, he's sitting at the bar watching a topless stripper do her thing. And he's only 19.<br/><br/>Part of this movie is learning to grow up, and treat women as something more than Tony is used to treating them. But that's one of two primary plots--the other is, of course, trying to break away from a boring life. Tony comes from an Italian background, and he lives in a bad area of town. His mother is proud of her eldest son, who became a priest, and she's discouraged by the fact that her other son doesn't seem to care about making anything out of his life. We get the feeling that Tony's parents once had the same outlook as their son, and fear he may be going down their own path. After Tony gets a raise from $3 to $4, his father tells him that $4 can't even buy $3. His son swears at him and storms away.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite scenes in ""Saturday Night Live"" are the human ones, such as when Tony stares in his bedroom mirror, bare-chested, and combs his hair forever, looking over himself with the same pride that Travis Bickle displayed in the famous ""You talkin' to me?"" scene in ""Taxi Driver,"" released a year earlier. In the background of the shot are posters of Al Pacino from ""Serpico"" and Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa. (Just think, Sly directed the sequel and did a cameo, yet he was, in a way, in the first film, too.) <br/><br/>I also like when Tony is interacting with his dysfunctional family. He's nice to his little sister when he walks through the door after work, but after working for quite some time on his now-out-of-date hairstyle, he barks at his father when he is slapped during dinner (in one of the rare scenes that made me laugh). He yells at him: ""Would you just watch the hair? I work a long time on my hair, and you hit it!"" I know that scene has been quoted before, but I quoted it again since it made me laugh so hard.<br/><br/>In one of the finest scenes in the entire movie, and certainly one of the most touching, Tony has lunch with an older girl (who later becomes his dance partner) and tries to impress her by acting mature. But his immaturity shines through--he doesn't have a clue what he's talking about half the time, and when he tries to act smart she counters his moves with true brainpower. In a way, this is the first time Tony realizes that women aren't as dumb as he thought they were.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures for all the right and wrong reasons. The wrong reasons include the dance floor numbers--I love them, and I probably shouldn't. As for the right reasons...I think we already know what they are. It's all about dreams. Everyone has some. Whether it's dancing or whatever, we all have dreams. And that's why I think ""Saturday Night Fever"" relates to so many different people on so many different levels."

","Watched Saturday Night Fever again last night. It's one of those movies I watch everytime it's on & never get bored by it. This movie perfectly captures the feeling of everyday life in a Blue Collar neighborhood, & the frustration that goes with it. Your caught in the middle not rich by any means, but just getting by & the feeling that your never going to get beyond it. Just existing and getting by is an everyday struggle & in this movie it shows how disco is an outlet. I remember 2001 Odyessy was a real club in Brooklyn. Saturday Night Fever is one of those rare movies you can watch & just enjoy yourself. How can you get tired of watching John Travolta walking down the street with a paint can? That opening captured your attention right from the start. You know where these characters are coming from. Tony's friends have basically given up on doing any better & have accepted there fate. Tony & Stephanie know there's something more out there for them & their going for it the best way they can. By the end of the movie I'm rooting for them to ""make it big"".  Being a big John Travolta fan I am a little bit biased. I'll watch anything he's in. '"
"StarWarsDisco","10","140","180","21 March 2003"," A masterpiece from the greatest era of American cinema.
","There are people who have seen this movie that have not been stoked by it (see some user comments). Personally I can't understand this. I know that there are people who have different tastes, and maybe some younger viewers will not be able to relate to it, or appreciate it. However, at the risk of sounding like a dick, I can confidently say that those are people I would not want to know anyways. This is a film that does what great films are supposed to do; that is to transcend our daily lives and bring us joy. There are a few films that can be called masterpieces because all the different film elements that are brought together have a unique quality and vision and the final result is something more special than the sum of the elements themselves. In a nutshell, this is a simple story about a young Italian Brooklyn man, Tony Manero, from humble roots with a gift for dancing who dreams of something better against all odds. He escapes from it all out on the dance floor, basking in the glow of the disco ball, and the frivolous, moving dance music. He meets another young woman at the danceclub, Stephanie Modano, played by an underrated Karen Lynn-Gorney, who is equal to him in dance ability, and, more importantly, in desiring a better life. The two struggle together, and against each other, in their pursuit of winning a dance contest that may spur on their dreams.<br/><br/>A simple story yes. One you've seen before yes. But after that, there is no other film that can touch it. John Travolta, as Tony, was in his prime, giving a performance that is so likeable because he is so normal. Who can't relate to a character who is so honest, so cool, so goofy, so conflicted; who has talent but doesn't get recognized by the people who should recognize him, like his family, only by his friends whom he knows deep down are all creeps? This is all of us!<br/><br/>The soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made, in terms of making you feel joyous, and impervious to the world's problems. Mostly contributed by The Bee Gees, as well as others, it is the essential element that makes the whole thing work.<br/><br/>John Badham's direction is even; giving the audience plenty of music and show stopping musical bits, yet unafraid to lure you back to the grim reality of what our hero is always up against. But it's never heavy handed. The story is equal parts dramatic, comedic, exhilirating, and pensive, and moves along just as rhythmically as the music.<br/><br/>In the end, literally as well as figuratively, Tony is more alone and unsure than ever in his ever changing world. And so it makes sense that he reaches out to Stephanie for love and support; someone that has at least a little understanding of who he really is, even if they can't be lovers. Simple, realistic, beautiful. The 70's was the true golden age of American cinema. It was the era of the auteur. Great minds like Scorsese, Coppola, Lucas, Spielberg, Badham, and so forth had for a decade or so, the ability to make truly visionary films; in the sense that they had a lot of creative power to express themselves devoid of studio pressure, political correctness, marketing tie-ins, and big budget, sensory offending, special effects. They laid it on the line. And we get to enjoy it for eternity.<br/><br/>Attention younger viewers, don't let the distorted lingering stereotype fool you. This isn't a ""cheesy film"" with John Travolta dancing like a clown to music that ""sucks"". It is as good a film as you'll see, if you can allow yourself to appreciate it as a real film. Disco music was once cutting edge before it ""sucked"". John Travolta was actually a good dancer and actor, and the story really does have depth."
"Poseidon-3","Null","11","12","3 May 2005"," Still surprisingly relevant and engrossing despite it's trappings.
","Few films can claim the status of creating a national (international, even) phenomenon upon release, but this one can. It offers a glimpse into the restless, nowhere lives of a group of young Brooklyn men, particularly Travolta, an hourly employee in a paint store who burns off steam on the dance floor every weekend. At home, he's considered worthless, but in his favorite dance club, he is monarch of all he surveys with men admiring him and women throwing themselves at him (even offering to dab his sweaty brow!) All important to him is an upcoming dance contest which he feels will propel him into another level of notoriety and prestige and he sets out to win it any way he can, constantly practicing his slickest moves. Gorney plays a social-climbing girl who has laid the ground work for getting out of Brooklyn and, though she is attracted to Travolta, is repulsed by the common qualities he represents. He becomes fascinated by her and considers her his way out of his current surroundings. Meanwhile, Travolta's friends dabble in booze, drugs, sex and gang warfare as they wallow in the stew of their existence. It all builds up to the big night of the contest where things may not turn out as expected. Travolta is magnetic in this, his first major film role. He worked tirelessly to perfect the dance moves which (though, at times, look rather silly today) are a highlight of the film. He also, however, brings much heart, charisma and commitment to the dramatic side of his not-always-sympathetic character. Gorney (who is easily a decade too old for her role) is a good counterpoint to Travolta and ably embodies her tacky, but desperate-to-change, character. She attempts to be as classy and refined as possible, yet her accent and crackling chewing gum belies her past. Their somewhat complex relationship adds some depth to what could have been a very shallow film. Travolta's friends are played with much authenticity and verve. Oddly, these actors continued with only marginally successful careers while Travolta went through the stratosphere. Another carefully etched performance is turned in by Pescow as one of Travolta's devoted followers. She goes a tad overboard near the end, but otherwise presents a solid, though pitiful, characterization. (She was one of the few actors in the film to achieve any sort of success afterwards and even that was limited. Gorney fell off the cinematic map entirely!) Travolta's family is played by more believable and well-textured actors. The music of the film (the soundtrack of which was one of the all time top sellers) is inherent to the story and is a compilation of some of the best that disco had to offer (though some might say even the best was still horrible!) Even the ""Disco Sucks"" crowd cannot deny the impact that this film had on the country as it set trends everywhere. Interestingly, some of the group numbers in the disco bear a striking similarity to the more recent country line dancing craze, only with more arm movements. The language of the film is tough, but necessary and realistic. There are two gut-wrenchingly suspenseful scenes atop the Verrazano Narrows bridge. It's a time capsule of a hedonistic and free-wheeling era (pre-AIDS) but with insightful examination of class structure and economic barriers, the nature of friendship among young men and the cost of inhumanity towards one another. A rancid and ludicrous sequel (which is good for some unintentional laughs) can not tarnish the spirit of the original film which still holds up today."
"saturdaze","Null","7","7","2 March 2003"," A lot better than you'd think... (*a couple of spoilers within*)
","There are some people who, at the mere mention of the words ""Saturday Night Fever"" giggle or smirk or give you a ""You actually watch that movie?"" look as if it's a piece of celluloid which people only took seriously from 1977 to 1979. Most of the people who have that attitude either have never sat down to watch the whole movie (these people probably think Travolta wore the white suit throughout all 120 minutes of the film and think that the whole thing took place inside the discotheque), or they've never seen the movie at all and have relied on what others say, or they just loathe disco music (and for these latter people, there's not much that can be done).<br/><br/>But if you look at the movie in its entirety--the R rated version, preferably (the PG version is too watered down and isn't the Real Thing)--you will be surprised at just how genuinely involving and worthy the movie is. <br/><br/>You will also be surprised by how great Travolta is. Yes, he plays a character similar to his Vinnie Barbarino TV character in that both are Italian, working-class, and native to Brooklyn, but the similarities end there. While Barbarino is shallow and awkwardly cool, Tony Manero is deep and smoothly hip; while Barbarino is happy-go-lucky, Manero is seriously troubled and doubtful about many things; while Barbarino is dim-witted, Manero is not only street-smart but also people-smart: he sees right through his dance partner Stephanie's refined veneer, and through his father's superior facade.<br/><br/>The point here is that Travolta proved in ""SNF"" that he's the Real Deal--not just a pretty face or a good dancer or a comic actor but an ACTOR, period. And the Oscar nomination he received for his performance is evidence of that. I personally don't think Travolta has given a performance since then which is as consistently on-target, nuanced, and powerful as the one he gives in this movie (and yes, I'm including ""Pulp Fiction"" when I make that statement).<br/><br/>I won't say much about the music because everybody knows by now how great and attention-grabbing it is. But what doesn't get as much credit are the movie's director and story. John Badham nicely captures the energy of the disco, especially in the Line-Dancing/Hustle scene at the half-hour point: he gives the scene a dreamy quality complete with camera Dissolves and smoke, and he's not afraid to take his time and let the scene play on. Anyone who's ever been on the dance floor knows that sensation: the feeling that time has stopped and all that exists are you and the music.<br/><br/>Many people have said that the movie's weakest aspect is its story. They say it's unnecessarily sordid, ugly, and disturbing. In fact, the movie's original choice for director--another John- John G. Avildsen--declined to do the film because he felt the story was too downbeat. But I think the downbeat quality is just as necessary an ingredient of the story as its disco music. One of the movie's points is that Disco is an escape, a multi-colored paradise in which Tony Manero and everyone else for that matter can forget about the ugly, unfair world patiently waiting for them outside. That's why Tony flips out toward the end at the dance contest when the Top Prize unfairly goes to him and Stephanie instead of to the more deserving Puerto Rican couple. He sees that the injustice of the outside world has pierced through the silver walls of the disco world---a world which he had always thought was too special, pure, and innocent to allow that inside; and now, that world has been tainted...with Reality.<br/><br/>Another quality of the film that tends to get overlooked is the supporting acting. I'm surprised that most people have cited Karen Lynn Gorney's performance as being among the movie's weaknesses. I think people say that because Travolta's presence is so charismatic and overwhelming that her contribution has gotten eclipsed. But if you take a good look at her performance you'll see that she creates a convincing, impressive portrait of a woman fiercely struggling with what she wants to be, what she is, and what she used to be. Gorney's Stephanie is a fascinating character: a woman with a goddess' face but a Brooklyn-gutter-girl's voice.<br/><br/>I saw ""SNF"" when it first came out--I was 5-years-old; now I'm 30, and I will always remember the powerful effect the movie had on me. Even at age 5, I was surprised at how great Travolta was and how engrossing the story and music were. And that's why I keep coming back to it--to relive that experience over and over and over...like a favorite record."
"livewire-6","Null","35","46","30 March 2004"," Sunday morning hangover
","Last night, I saw ""Saturday Night Fever"" on TV. It brought back memories of my own disco days in the mid- to late 1970s. Sad to say, the film perfectly captures the emptiness and superficiality of that era, and its negative impact on people's lives, then and since.<br/><br/>Back then, it was all about how you looked and how you dressed, how you danced and whether you scored. Who knew that the slim, sleek, svelte Travolta would balloon like Elvis Presley - just as all of us were fated to age, lose our hair and expand our waists. The disco culture of the 70s was youth-oriented, but in a brain-dead way, unlike the politically aware late 1960s anti-war youth culture.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Fever"" sends mixed messages. Its soundtrack of BeeGees hits is a siren song of longing and romance, yet the screenplay tells a different story. Tony Manero (John Travolta) rejects poor Annette (Donna Pescow) because she's short and dumpy and not good enough for him. Upwardly mobile Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) spurns him in turn, offering only the possibility of platonic friendship. Tony's friend Bobby gets his girlfriend pregnant, but is too young and immature to assume his responsibilities. And all Tony's other friends care about is humping virtual strangers for ten minutes in the back seat of a car.<br/><br/>Saturday night fever gives them nothing but Sunday morning hangover - without any Sunday morning spirituality to fill the void in their lives. Religion gets short shrift in this film. Tony's brother Frank leaves the priesthood, not because he struggles with his faith, but because he can't live up to his vow of celibacy. Even he has sex on the brain.<br/><br/>Sex was the be-all and end-all of disco culture - witness the soft-core shots of Travolta in nothing but low-rise briefs - and we have inherited its legacy. I say ""we"" because I too am a child of the 70s. For the next 25 years, I lived according to the values I had learned on the dance floor. I worshipped at the shrine of youth and beauty and sex - and it left me as empty as the characters in the film. Like Tony Manero, I found that the only cure for ""Saturday Night Fever"" was to escape that world and that life, and leave all the ""beautiful losers"" behind."

In my small town, mobile discos sprouted everywhere - and we all wanted to be John Travolta....and it was one of the catalysts for me to leave home and explore the world.<br/><br/>Watched it again last night, and as a 50 year old it all came flooding back - melancholia obviously setting in because I felt like a 15 year old again - the memories came flooding back.

He plays a paint guy who at nights (and sometimes days) has a love for dancing, which he is absolutely excellent at (those dance scenes are quite memorable).

","Can you believe that only thirty years ago working-class social realism was a commercial cliché? This movie looks and feels like 'Taxi Driver' when the strobe lights are off, and there's cussin' and humpin' all over it. A lot of it is very fun, including the revelation of hearing that Bee Gees stuff in context, as seventies soundtrack music, which turns out to make perfect sense. And it's truly freaky to see John Travolta fawning over bedroom posters of Farrah, Stallone and Al Pacino, and realize that this guy was the next wave - at this remove he's one of them, but here he's standing outside looking in. And he's been caught in the turnstile ever since, of course. Unfortunately the class politics do get pretty muddled, especially in the love-interest department - however pretentious what's-er-name's upward mobility turns out to be, their partnership does turn out to be a means of 'getting out,' an unnecessary conceit. And in order to justify that conceit, things get laid on pretty thick; the paper-thin ironic distance is suddenly dropped, buddy pulls a Sal Mineo on the bridge, and you half think that Badham takes Travolta's ex for a ""c*nt"" too.In other words, it stops being fun. I had to entertain myself by imagining that Robert Stigwood optioned ""Wedding in White"" and morphed it into this script in one very loud, three-hour story meeting. Coulda happened!"

","There are some movies that are referenced, parodied and talked about so much that when you finally get round to watching them, you go into them feeling like you've already seen them. Saturday Night Fever was one of those movies for me.<br/><br/>After watching all of the pop-culture defining musical movies of the late seventies and eighties (Grease, Fame, Flashdance, Footloose, Dirty Dancing etc.) I went into Saturday Night Fever thinking I knew exactly what I was going to get.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when far from being a lighthearted musical about the late seventies disco scene in the vein of 'Flashdance', it was a story about struggle, despair and desperation that was very dark and sometimes outright depressing - scenes of gang violence, a rape, an attempted rape, an accidental suicide and plenty of racist language - all set against a backdrop of disco music including the now iconic soundtrack by the BeeGees. <br/><br/>I think when I first watched Saturday Night Fever I felt I was in a similar dissatisfied place and situation in my life as the movie's main character, Tony Manero (played with just the right amount of swagger and charm by John Travolta), a Brooklynite in his late teens who plods along in his day job at a paint store and lives for the weekends when he can let loose with his friends on a Saturday night at the local nightclub, where thanks to his good looks and dance talent, he is something of a local celebrity.<br/><br/>Unlike his friends though, who seem to have no aspirations beyond going out, getting drunk and laid at the weekends, he knows that his lifestyle has a shelf-life and by his own admission dancing at the disco is one of only a few times and places he feels appreciated and worthy; even within his family he lives in the shadow of his older brother, Frank Jr., whom his family idolises due to his vocational choice to become a priest. <br/><br/>When the opportunity to enter a dance competition at the nightclub arises he is convinced to enter with his friend, Annette, even though he is reluctant because he knows Annette is in love with him and he doesn't feel the same way for her.<br/><br/>Then Tony meets Stephanie. <br/><br/>On the surface, Stephanie seems to have it all together with a good job in Manhattan and a nice apartment but Tony soon realises that not all is as it seems with her.<br/><br/>And unfortunately for Annette, Tony doesn't hesitate to trade Annette in for her as his dance partner, in the hopes of getting to know her better.<br/><br/>While Stephanie's aloof and haughty manner makes it hard for a true romance to blossom between them, there is a definite chemistry and connection between when they dance. The more they get to know one another they realise they have similar goals and aspirations to rise above their humble surroundings and move on to better things.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with a completely different set of eyes than the vast majority of IMDb it seems, as I don't see the relationships between the main characters the same way most view them at all. While most people seem to think that because Annette was objectively more attractive and adored Tony, that it was wrong of Tony to ditch her in favour of Stephanie, who acted like she was better than him, at least in the beginning. <br/><br/>It's fairly obvious to me why Tony doesn't like being around Annette; she represents everything he hates about his current life and Stephanie represents where he wants to go. <br/><br/>The relationship and friendship between Tony and Stephanie and especially the first scene of them dancing in the studio together, is one of the highlights of the movie for me. I think people take Stephanie's haughtiness too personally anyway."
"brownjay","Null","4","4","20 February 2003"," Tough, gritty and touching
","On a purely visceral level, SNF is a joy to watch, as Travolta, Gorney, Pescow and others all demonstrate that they can move to the sound of the beat, and the music etched by the Bee Gees and others (don't miss out on the Trammps ""Disco Infereno"") provide a riveting backdrop for the performers to strut. However, on a more human level, the movie expresses in simple and sometimes violent terms, the struggle that kids on the edge of being adults face everywhere in this country and others -where do I fit in, how do I make my way in life? For Tony, the dance floor provides an outlet that undergirds his self esteem and gives him plenty of opportunities to score with chicks (Pescow even prompts him for sex by bringing the rubbers), but it does nothing to address his desire to make his mark as an adult. Living at home, kicking in for food, working at a paint store and blowing $20 or $30 a night at the 2001 Odyssey leaves a void that only becomes apparent when he meets Stephanie (Gorney) and tries his best to score with her by asking her to be his partner in the upcoming dance contest. It is a boy meets girl, boy gets girl? story, laced with compelling dialogue and subplots. PARENTS BEWARE: this movie features an extreme amount of profanity, a rape sequence, depicts women in a largely unfavorable light and contains a tough death scene.<br/><br/>
In short, it is a movie that has stood the test of time since its release in 1977. It made Travolta a star (he was nominated for the Best Actor oscar as was Gorney for best supporting actress) and it deserves high marks on many levels. Please stay away from the sequel ""Staying Alive"". Stallone discards everything from the original but Travolta and the story is mundane and predictable.<br/><br/>Note:  Rent the 25th anniversay DVD as it contains 3 deleted scenes and commentary from director John Badham, which offers insight into Badham's thought process as he directed and edited the movie."

Quintessential film about the Seventies' disco craze that made Travolta an American icon (Best Actor nominee) and superstar as Brooklynite Tony Manero, a free-wheelin' Italian kid who loves to dance but doesn't know what he wants from life despite his talent and some eye-opening advice from dance partner Gorney. Directed on location with gritty realism by John Badham this blockbuster features songs by the ultimate trio The Bee Gees.(My favorite: ""How Deep Is Your Love?"").

People don't understand that to be known throughout the neighborhood was a prevailing desire for its' inhabitants.<br/><br/>As a resident of Brooklyn, the highest honor was and is, is to be known by people all around your neighborhood and beyond. I remember chatting with just such a person who kept insisting that if I asked anyone one all around the area, they would know who he is. This may seem foreign to most people but in the neighborhood in which Tony Monero grew up, this was paramount.<br/><br/>Of course, this way of living escaped those audiences that were critical of the film. In all, this was a brilliant expose on life as a Brooklyn youth in the '70's who radiated around their weekend temple of hedonism, the Disco.<br/><br/>SNF works on so many levels that Travolta should easily have won Best Actor for his contribution in his film. SNF was not only a great drama but also a brilliant semi-musical with songs that will last forever."
"bkoganbing","8","7","9","26 January 2009"," Staying Alive To Jive
","Saturday Night Fever holds a special place in the hearts of all the residents of Brooklyn. Besides being the visual symbol of the disco era, it is also the best filmed recollection of the post Dodgers era of Brooklyn which sad to say is still going on. <br/><br/>Brooklyn does not have the Dodgers any more and in fact the 2001 club is no longer there, but you can see a lot of the area that was photographed in Bay Ridge and Fort Hamilton. I could even show you the places on tour.<br/><br/>But it's the music and story of Saturday Night Fever that has made it an enduring classic. John Travolta left the sweathogs of Welcome Back Kotter and broke out as a major film star playing Tony Manero in this film. Travolta's a kid working at a paint store in a dead end job, hanging out with his dead end friends who has only one great talent going for him. On Saturday night when he goes to the 2001, he's king of the dance floor. <br/><br/>He can get just about any girl he wants and quite a few would like him, especially Donna Pescow, but Travolta's got his eye on Karen Lynn Gorney who is of Italian background like himself, but has real career aspirations as a dancer. Travolta and Gorney agree to dance together, but John just can't let it go at that.<br/><br/>The only Oscar that Saturday Night Fever was nominated for was John Travolta as Best Actor. He lost that year to Richard Dreyfuss in The Goodbye Girl. Travolta does a great job in playing Tony Manero, a kid who over the course of the film realizes there is a great big world out there beyond his neighborhood. A lot of things help convince him of that, his involvement with Gorney, his dancing, his dead ending friends one of whom meets with real tragedy.<br/><br/>Special mention should go to Barry Miller playing Bobby C, one of the Travolta friends. He's such a sad case trying so desperately to belong with the crowd. They tolerate him basically because he's got the car and he takes the gang where they want to go. <br/><br/>The Motion Picture Academy has committed some god awful blunders in its time. But one of the worst was its total non-recognition of the music of the Gibb Brothers and the other music from Saturday Night Fever. Saturday Night Fever was incredibly not even nominated for Best Musical Score. Not one of the songs from the BeeGees and others was nominated for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture. The winner that year was You Light Up My Life, a nice song, but has never had the enduring popularity of any number of the BeeGee tunes like How Deep Is Your Love, Staying Alive, You Should Be Dancing, or Night Fever.<br/><br/>The Brooklyn shown in Saturday Night Fever is a Brooklyn that most grew up with. Only old codgers like myself remember the Dodgers, but Saturday Night Fever is Brooklyn for the next couple of generations."

When you remember the film, its moments of humour are so clever, that they hide the dark undercurrents explored.<br/><br/>The same goes for ""Saturday Night Fever"" (SNF), a film that showcases disco in its most perfect form. And yet the true theme of the movie is about wanting more out of your life but just existing, until something affects you so much that you decide to start living.<br/><br/>John Travolta's character is so well played against his friends who are, quite simply, cruel no hopers who disrespect the opposite sex & treat them as fifth best against the car they all share to have 'mobile' sex in.<br/><br/>The female character that eventually shifts Travolta's character appears at a time when horrific events really force him to reassess where he is going  something that his friends will never be unable to ever do.<br/><br/>It is easy to label a movie a certain way.

"hayden-8","Null","5","6","28 April 2002"," Gritty urban tale
","1977 was the year in which iconoclastic punk and hedonistic disco dominated the music scene. How ironic then that the final number one single in the U.S. of that year was Debbie Boone's ""You light up my life"". While I think that the punk movement has never been well documented in film fiction, the more popular and mainstream disco culture had several major films dedicated to it. The best of these was Saturday Night Fever (SNF).<br/><br/>The snag is that SNF was NOT a disco movie. Yes, it had dazzling dance sequences, yes, it had a pulsating soundtrack, and, yes, many of the scenes were shot in a disocteque, but I have always felt that the disco theme was peripheral to the real story; the alienation of youth and the acceptance and sanctuary they find in each other and their chosen surroundings. In fact, Nik Cohn's article on which the film was based (and which he later admitted was faked), ""Tribal rites of the new Saturday night"" would have been a more apposite title. John Travolta perfectly captures this. As Tony Manero he almost ritually prepares himself for his night out, preening himself in front of the mirror, donning his warrior's uniform, and then escaping the drudgery of his existence to his battleground, the local disco where he is the tribal chief.<br/><br/>Gritty, foulmouthed and somewhat downbeat, SNF starkly presented the darker underbelly of the disco subculture."
"mecahill","10","5","6","20 September 2001"," John Travolta's Greatest Film!
","""Saturday Night Fever"" in my humble opinion has remained John Travolta's best film to date.  It was his debut lead film role and it has remained an all time favorite of mine.  Travolta plays a character named Tony Manero, who is a 19 year old paint store retailer in Brooklyn.  Tony yearns for a better life and trys to figure out a way to break free from his dead end friends and parents.  He knows he's capable of doing more with his life than he has.  Tony is a remarkable dancer and he shows everyone this at the 2001 Odyssey Disco, every Saturday night.  Then he meets Stephanie, a maturing young woman who is trying to improve her life with education and interest in her career. She also enjoys dancing, so Stephanie and Tony decide to become dance partners.  The story follows the two becoming friends, falling in love and Tony's maturation.  John Travolta couldn't be bettered in the role of Tony Manero.  His character is outwardly cool and tough, but inside there is a lot of tenderness and caring.  Travolta is an excellent dancer and he proves this as he glides onto the dance floor and gyrates to the Bee Gees pulsating soundtrack. The supporting cast is first rate too.  This is definitely a 1970's classic that shouldn't be missed by any connoisseur of film."
"ptb-8","9","11","17","8 September 2007"," The TAXI DRIVER of disco musicals
","I believe that Saturday NIGHT FEVER in its original 118 minute R+ version is genuinely one of the great dramas of the 70s, a film so severe, that I liken it to TAXI DRIVER in its relentless scathing depiction of NY life in the 70s. When first released in Australia in 1977 it was the full, full on, foul mouthed vicious version that I astonishingly saw in free to air TV in Sydney last night (on a 9.30pm slot). This R+ version had not been seen here for almost 30 years and only existed in its PG re release that played endlessly as a double feature with GREASE thru the 80s. Amusingly that is exactly how it played last night with GREASE prior at 7.30pm. All that aside, SNF with its scalding expose of the lives of these 20 somethings is a superb film, and for all those moaning about it not being fun because it is a musical... well it is not supposed to be fun... it is a damning comment on the uneducated and ignorance of the lives depicted. If you seek a fun musical then see STEP UP which is NY similar but nowhere as courageous and fully realised as this film. In 1978 with underage fans screaming to be let in, it was considered smart to cut 10 minutes out, dub over all the swearing (especially the two times Travolta says 'c*nt' in the same sentence, all the references and scenes to car sex...) and make it PG friendly... and it certainly was a success. But if you want a ""Scorsese version"" as originally released, and you can tell drama from drivel, then this full R+ version is for you. I have never seen a better damning of an uneducated bunch of cruel insensitive people in any film... and if there is a moral to this cinematic thrashing... it is that if you are not educated then you will end up like this lot. Brit director John Badham has drawn well from the equally vicious portrayals seen in the 'kitchen sink' dramas made in Britain in the early 60s like ""Saturday Night And Sunday Morning"" or THIS SPORTING LIFE where the working class who are bogged in their ignorance keep returning to an emotional bruising cycle of behaviour until one just plain stops and looks at himself. Like Tony does in this film. I also believe the scene with Karen Lyn Gorney and Travolta in the empty apartment they consider renting is one of the great moments in any American film (she is sitting on the window sill). This is a great film, uncompromising in its depiction of that 'lifestyle' cornered through ignorant mean-ness into delusion and nowhere. Perfectly realised. then cut to a PG. See the original."

Overall, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is more than simply a disco movie. It's a look at that era. Working-class teens saw no future, and so they saw fit only to get down every weekend in the discotheques. Some people say that disco is dead, but I beg to differ. I may have been born after the disco era, but that music will live on, whether in this movie or in people's souls. In other words, disco will stay alive forever, as will this movie.

Tony (Travolta) is your average Italian generation joe who has conflicts about whether he should be sticking around the usual gang of crude friends or try for better.  Along the way, many other topics are hit upon.  <br/><br/>Now let's face it...the dancing and the music are the highlights.  Even if you hate disco, you'll be amazed by Travolta's moves that made the Pulp Fiction moves look like granny steps.  And the songs are just classics.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this flick yet, definitely rent it.

"LuvSopr","9","5","7","17 July 2014"," Not what it's supposed to be - and that's a good thing
","There are many, many people who watch this movie for the first time expecting what pop culture remembers of it - disco, a white suit, a fun family dinner scene. <br/><br/>There are many, many people who watch this movie and come away horrified, because of the frank depictions of racism, sexism, and sexual assault (depictions that likely would not be in a major film today - and even at the time got the director fired from another project).<br/><br/>This frankness leads to some objections to the film that I wholeheartedly disagree with, such as it being ""sexist"" or that it ""slut shames"" Annette for being raped. The whole point of the that scene is that it's wrong that Annette to be raped. That even if she agreed (while under the influence) to ""run a train,"" it's still terrible and disgusting. Tony shaming her is also supposed to be terrible. We aren't supposed to watch this scene and think what happens to her is fine or that Tony's reaction is fine. <br/><br/>Tony and his friends live in a world where there is no such thing as racism or rape. It's all about them. It's all about getting what they can, and blaming others who in their minds take it from them. They have fun, they go out and dance, but they are dying inside.<br/><br/>Tony does not realize any of this about himself or his friends until he gets several system shocks (meeting Stephanie, his brother leaving the priesthood, beating a better couple in a dance contest solely because he's white, his friend's suicide). He slowly but surely sees that he is a racist, a misogynist, that he has an incredibly toxic relationship with his parents he has to escape from before he will never have an escape. <br/><br/>This aspect of the film is timeless - watching this in 2014 you will understand as much as you would have in 1977, if not more. <br/><br/>The performances are uniformly superb. Travolta gives a career best, and a great deal of the film's appeal is based not only on his charisma and acting, but on his refusal to allow Tony to be whitewashed as a character. Karen Lynn Gorney has the most difficult role in the film - a woman trapped between two worlds even as she takes Tony down the same path. She plays the soft moments but also plays the harsh, condescending moments too. The scene where we meet her ex-boyfriend and realize he was ""educating"" her just as she's trying to educate her is one of the most poignant in the film, because we see just how much of how she behaves with Tony is projection, is a shell. Joseph Cali is also superb, as he gives so many layers to a role that is ultimately only a symbol of Tony's breaking away, not a character. His work in small but ultimately pivotal moments like his attempt to counsel Bobby (initially treating him as something of a joke, then genuinely trying, yet still not getting it) is so surprisingly complex. And he and Travolta have wonderful chemistry together. Donna Pescow takes a character we could easily dismiss the way the men in the film do, and she breaks our hearts, especially those close-ups of her expressive eyes. Who else could make a scene with holding a bunch of condoms into such exquisite sorrow?<br/><br/>The worst mistake the film makes is not handling Tony's attempted rape of Stephanie with more care. Deleted scenes suggest that the last scene in the film (where he goes to her apartment to talk to her) was darker in tone, with Stephanie refusing to let him and his only getting into the building because someone opened the door to leave. The movie takes that out, and leaves a somewhat hesitant Stephanie pledging to help Tony ...as a friend. The problem with this is it undercuts the ugliness of what he did, especially as it had happened only a few hours before. It spoils what could have been a beautiful last scene and takes away from the other ambiguous moments in the film regarding sexism and rape that genuinely present this as bad and wrong.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie, but please warn people not to just expect polyester and hip thrusts."
"blanche-2","9","5","7","6 October 2012"," Resonates with a certain generation
","1977's ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a movie that strongly resonates with a particular generation - mine. Five minutes of the movie brings it all back -- the disco era, the incredible Bee Gees music, and the charm, charisma and dance moves that was young John Travolta. If you were around then, you'll remember the cultural explosion this film caused. It simply defined the era, the way ""Flashdance,"" an inferior film, did in a smaller way with the off one shoulder sweatshirt and music.<br/><br/>For me watching this movie has the added plus of being a film about Brooklyn made in Brooklyn and New York City, where I lived. In fact, a young woman in my dance class is kissed by Travolta as he walks into the club. I can still remember how excited she was talking about it in class.<br/><br/>It's the era of platform shoes, polyester shirts, and big blow-dried hair, and in the midst of it is a young Brooklyn man (Travolta) who has a gifted natural ability for dance is surrounded by friends heading nowhere and Italian-American parents who are afraid that he's just like his crowd. He finally realizes, thanks to his relationship with his pretty, uptown girl dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney), partly because of a tragedy, and partly because of his talent that he needs to stretch himself and move beyond his friends and neighborhood. As Stephanie says to him, ""You live with your parents, you hang with your buddies and on Saturday nights you burn it all off at 2001 Odyssey. You're a cliché. You're nowhere, going' no place."" As Tony Manero, John Travolta is a sexy number with his swiveling hips and white suit, and he has a neighborhood girl (Donna Pescow) in love with him, as well as one of his friends, Bobby (Barry Miller) who's gay and doesn't know it, but always shows off for Tony and cries when Tony doesn't call him.<br/><br/>I love what Roger Ebert says about the effect of this film, which was his review partner Gene Siskel's favorite: ""We all have a powerful memory of the person we were at that moment when we formed a vision for our lives. Tony Manero stands poised precisely at that moment. He makes mistakes, he fumbles, he says the wrong things, but when he does what he loves he feels a special grace."" Directed with both realism and romance by John Badham, ""Saturday Night Fever,"" especially for those of us who were young during the disco era, holds a very special place."

","The Beatles tried it and failed. They, especially Paul, saw movies as a sort of music, or at least a sibling of music. They saw how naturally and effectively they were able to change the world. So they tried movies, and it was a disaster. (""Hard Day's Night"" wasn't theirs. I'm talking ""Magical Mystery Tour"" here.)<br/><br/>But it got a lot of entertainment heavyweights thinking if something better could be done than those stupid Elvis movies. Robert Stigwood had built a record empire. (In those days it was black plastic.) And he thought he could make big hits by thinking about movies the way he thought about record albums.<br/><br/>So we have this and ""Grease"" as successes, and a few failures as well, including the BeeGees as Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Whew, that's a rough one.<br/><br/>But this one changed the world of movies. Music and movies always have had a dance of possibilities, mostly built around two models. Either the music was part of a realistic story, like when Micky and Judy ""put on a show"" so you have the show and some events surrounding (usually threatening) it. And you have a stagy otherworld -- a peoples opera -- where the world of the story and that of the music blend.<br/><br/>This is sort of in between, more like a show within, but there's a magic in the notion that the story more than wraps the show, it is a striving to actually pull the ordinary world into the world of music and dance. <br/><br/>Its what I call a clever fold. We the audience identify with Manero who strives to take his mundane life and make it a magical, transporting show. Just like (exactly like) we were yearning to turn our own lives into something like we associated with movieland.<br/><br/>So it works. And it was a first of this new model -- and also a new mode of promotion. It is a touchstone. But actually it isn't that good a movie. Some of the style has passed us by. We all used to know that Travolta character, and he's been replaced with a different, more dangerous and broken stereotype now.

To me, this movie never evoked any interest because I don't find anything interesting about disco dancing and I don't think John Travolta is the most fetching actor in the world. Clearly, he hasn't exactly had the most enviable career. But Saturday Night Fever is not about dancing, there is just so much more to it.<br/><br/>There can be no doubt about the irony of Travolta starring in a film in which he is the best dancer in town while he is at the height of his awkward youth, but like I said, the movie is not just about dancing. The dancing is a backdrop for a much deeper meaning. The movie has violence, blood, death, crime, sex, nudity, everything that you would almost automatically expect to be absent from a film like this. I thought it was going to be some goofy romance (made goofy by Travolta, of course. Can you even imagine him in a romantic comedy?), I mean, it has romance, but the movie is so much more.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is a very realist film about a young Italian kid who lives in a run-down neighborhood in Brooklyn and who is trying to find meaning in his life, which is virtually meaningless when he is off the dance floor. He has a crappy job, no education beyond high school, an unhappy life at home, and no prospects for the future. His concept of the future is what he's going to wear to the dance hall (charmingly named 2001 Odyssey) on Saturday night. Clearly, outside the dance hall, he is not the hero that he is on the dance floor. Early in the film, Tony (Travolta) is walking down the street and he runs back to talk to a girl that he walked past, and she blows him off, seeming to be annoyed by him (which is weird, because who could resist a disco stud carrying a paint can!). Yet when he is at the dance hall, the crowd parts for him, girls ask if they can wipe the sweat off his forehead, he is the king.<br/><br/>The costumes are excellent, from the first frames of the film that show Tony walking down the street in his hilariously disco outfit and all throughout the film. I remember one scene where one of Tony's geeky friends, Bobby, lets Tony borrow his car, and then as Bobby walks away, you can see that he has on what have to be the most ludicrous disco shoes ever created. Tony's meticulous care about his outfit is made clear when he wears a sheet wrapped around himself to the dinner table, and then gets upset not that his father hit him, but that he hit his HAIR. `I spend a lot of time on my hair, and you hit it.' However, no matter how hard he tries, he does NOT look like Al Pacino.<br/><br/>(spoilers) But on a deeper level, Saturday Night Fever has to do with everything from doing what you want to do with your own life to loyalty among friends to religious persecution and hypocrisy. There is also some substantial symbolism in that bridge that Tony knows so much about and which Bobby doesn't seem to have been mature enough to cross late in the film. `It's a dog eat dog world,' and Saturday Night Fever uses dancing as only one among many techniques to deliver that message. The film is dated in many ways, but it remains a landmark film, especially concerning the Italian experience in America in the 70s, and is definitely worth a look."
"wadechurton","2","20","41","19 February 2012"," Decaf Scorcese with unlikeable characters. Good dancing though.
","Okay, I was into punk not disco back in 1977, and held off seeing this movie on ideological grounds for many years. Perhaps if I'd seen it during its heyday it would have carried more weight, but when disengaged from the giddy heights of the disco era it does not travel well. This is basically 'Scorcese lite'; a sort of 'Mean Streets' done for teens, and missing out almost everything which made Scorcese's work so compelling. The viewer is faced with a parade of characters so stupid, self-centred and under-developed that it is virtually impossible to bond with any of them. Tony Manero is an idiot and his friends are even more moronic, whilst the girls are doormats (nice-but-dim Annette) or emotionally distant egotists (brash big-talking Stephanie). Add to this some downright unfathomable casting; Martin Shakar looks more like Tony's uncle than his brother (seriously, he looks a good ten years older) and whilst cast as Tony's crucial dance partner, Karen Lynn Gorney's ability is conspicuously 'school lunchtime disco'. Check the bit at the dance studio where she and Tony converse whilst she's practicing; it looks like she's been learning to dance for all of twenty minutes. Having said that, the dance scenes themselves are the high point of the movie, even if they are all Tony's show. In fact, there is an uncomfortable strand of narcissism and outright homo-eroticism to 'SNF' which is all in keeping with the essentially non-macho disco scene. With its falsetto vocals, elaborate studio-bound arrangements and invariably sex-obsessed lyrics, the music was made by producers, not neighbourhood bands, and the emphasis was on glitter and flash, not grit and trash. The dance scene's flamboyant, exhibitionist nature was far more in-tune with 'gay' sensibilities than the world of rock music, and so it was that disco suffered a boom-and-bust popularity over the late 1970s. 'Straight' society briefly sampled what the movement had to offer and then moved on to more gender-friendly cultural climes. By 1979 it was all over, and 'new wave' music was all the rage. Considerations of personal taste aside, 'SNF' is less than the sum of its parts, clumsily realised with characters who come far too close to being repellent without any redemptive qualities. It is all too apparently a vehicle for John Travolta, who served notice with his performance that his entire career would be based on slight variations on his 'Vinnie Barbarino' character from 'Welcome Back Kotter'. He struts solipsistically through 'SNF' wearing the exact same expression you see staring blankly back at you from a fish-shop window. Away from the dance floor, he could not carry the movie, which is a massive weak point since none of the other characters are as extensively written. By all means watch 'SNF' for nostalgia, for the dancing or the music or the actors, but not as a movie experience, because you will be disappointed."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","2","13 December 2015"," Much deeper and meaningful than you'd expect
","A film that played not an insignificant part in helping to launch the last big disco craze of the late 70s. Seen as something of a cultural icon for the music genre and regarded as a minor cult classic. Which is why I was surprised to find out that its outlook on disco was in fact rather jaded. It definitely showcases the style and the mood of the music genre beautifully, but it doesn't glorify the culture behind it. Quite the opposite in fact. It deals with subjects such as aimlessness of early adulthood, gang violence, lack of responsibility, the downsides of loose sexuality, the list goes on. It shows that the reason people become so obsessed with disco was because they had absolutely nothing else going for them, no other goal worth pursuing.<br/><br/>So what's the story? Tony Manero (John Travolta) is a young Italian American living in Brooklyn. He has a job in small hardware store, which is going nowhere, even though his boss seems to like him. His parents idolize his older brother, a priest by profession, not placing many expectations on him. In his downtime he hangs out with a couple of his friends, who have essentially formed a gang, and goes to a local disco club, where he is regarded as the king of dance. Then he meets a woman, another great dancer like him, who causes him to start questioning his life and his goals.<br/><br/>This is very much John Travolta's film. One of his earliest film roles and still one of his best. It's actually not that surprising that Sylvester Stallone liked this film a lot - enough to direct its sequel in fact - because you can definitely see a lot of similarities between it and his own Rocky. Both are brilliant examples of their respective main genres, dancing and boxing, respectively, but what makes both of them work beyond their genre limitations is the substance in them. They are good genre films, but they also provide you with great drama, social commentary and character development. Both feature uneducated, down on their luck blue collar protagonists, who nevertheless struggle to make something out of themselves and improve their lot in life.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is a great film. Not only because it's such an inviting, energetic and enjoyable film visually and auditorily, but because it's an excellent example on how to make a film be more than its bare bones. It is a film with both style and substance and is well worth a watch for all looking for a good story."

","I just watched this again on some channel. . Bravo, maybe.<br/><br/>When it first came out I was very young, and actually went under duress because all my other friends wanted to go.<br/><br/>Then I had to sit through it again on a flight to Europe. <br/><br/>I didn't get it then--I wasn't part of the whole disco culture--and now when I watch it I'm hypnotized, because it's so screamingly dated. The only way I can really view it is as a cultural artifact, which I guess, is exactly what it has become. <br/><br/>Since everyone knows the plot by this time, my only observation is that the only really sympathetic character in the story is Tony's brother, who quit the priesthood. Tony's friends are clods, except for the one who's the whiner, Tony's family is repellent, and the only woman in the story that *seems* to have anything resembling self-esteem is a delusional, stuck-up pain in the butt. As for Tony, yeh, he has his likable moments, but for the most part he treats women like crap. <br/><br/>One thing that always puzzled me was the casting of Karen Gorney as the girl Tony fixates on. Nothing against the actress, but she's utterly ordinary, and, as the character, totally obnoxious. Tony is a genuine hunk, all right, so why not cast someone as the unattainable girl who really can stop some traffic on the street? I mean, there WERE pretty women in Brooklyn in the 1970s.<br/><br/>I've noticed in some of the reviews that the lack of political correctness in the movie seems to be refreshing to a lot of people, so I'll say something that may be politically incorrect: As I watched the camera pan lovingly over the prone figure of John Travolta lying in bed on his stomach, wearing nothing but black briefs, I thought ""Wow, this is gay."" Not that there's anything wrong with that. <br/><br/>I understand why this flick appeals to guys on another level. Tony is the ultimate six foot strutting, prancing rooster, a man who knows that any girl he singles out will probably fall on her back and open her legs. And yet he has this streak of sensitivity. But not TOO much sensitivity.<br/><br/>As for the music, you either love the Bee Gees and disco or you hate 'em. But I will say I understand why the soundtrack became one of the biggest selling soundtracks of all time.<br/><br/>Anyhow, it's worth watching if only for the sheer culture shock."
"MartinHafer","6","8","14","3 July 2009"," A film about a dumb guy whose shallowness reaches amazing depths!
","I think that your opinion about Saturday NIGHT FEVER may have a lot to do with your age. People who were of age during the Disco Age probably will love it. Older or younger people may feel less impressed. As for me, I was rather young during this disco craze and thought that the gold chains and unbuttoned polyester shirts were all pretty tacky--so the film doesn't hold the same wonderful nostalgic memory it might for others--though I will admit that I liked the music (yes, folks, it's true--I am so uncool that I actually like disco).<br/><br/>As for the film, it is unusual in structure in that much of it is like a very prolonged music video. While this sort of film is more common today, in 1977 it must have been revolutionary to have such a meandering film that isn't always plot-driven. What was also unusual is that unlike most films, the main character is amazingly stupid and shallow--his friends are even worse. For Tony Manero (John Travolta), what matters most to him in life is his hair, his clothes and disco--and little else. As for his friends, their priorities would be drugs, sex, date rape, driving like idiots and disco. Not exactly a group of Einsteins, eh? This is a problem for folks like me, as I have a hard time really getting into a picture if I don't like anyone. My only emotional connection was feeling sad for the desperate women with low self-esteem that actually cared about this shallow guy or his obnoxious friends. Otherwise, I just didn't care about what happened to anyone--including his slap-happy family! <br/><br/>While it probably sounds like I hated the film, there were some things I did like or at least respect. As I mentioned above, the music was nice--with one of the best soundtracks in movie history. While no one today admits to liking disco (other than nuts like me), it did produce the biggest-selling soundtracks in history. Plus, while I didn't love all the dancing, I sure could respect all the work that went into choreographing it and making it look so effortless. What Travolta and the rest did to get ready for the film is incredible. I just wish, however, that the film was less like the prolonged music video and was more plot-driven at times or had greater importance than ""who will be Tony's new dance partner?""! Of course, this shallowness might actually be a great metaphor for the era--an era typified by loud clothes, drugs, sex without consequences and Studio 54.<br/><br/>Overall, an interesting time capsule hindered by characters that are mostly low-lifes and co-dependents.<br/><br/>At one point in the film, Tony muses ""there are ways of killing yourself without killing yourself"". Wow, such amazing depth to his utter shallowness!"
"roghache","5","7","12","14 March 2006"," Incredible disco music but plot neither gripping nor inspiring
","For me, this entire movie IS the music. I love the BeeGees songs, which of course became famously popular and almost defined the disco and bell bottomed era. Also, I think John Travolta gives a great performance, incredible dancing sequences, in the role of Tony Manero. When I picture Travolta, like most others I'll wager, the image that comes to mind is the white suited Tony strutting away on the disco floor to the BeeGees hits. His main purpose in the movie, apart from dancing, is of course to appear sexy.<br/><br/>The film is short on plot. I haven't seen the movie for a number of years, but all I can recall is that Tony is an uneducated Brooklyn teenager whose life revolves around his Saturday nights at the disco and his attempts to win a dance competition. Apparently (from others' comments), there are girls involved...one, Annette, that he rejects as being too plain so not good enough for him, and another, his pretty dance partner, Stephanie who, aspiring to better things herself, rejects HIM (good for her). Any details didn't make enough of an impression to remain with me for long. <br/><br/>The film does memorably capture, however, Tony's poor employment opportunities due to his lack of education and of course the fact that his entire self esteem unfortunately revolves around his coolness, particularly relative to his admittedly legendary disco dancing skills. Let it be a message for young viewers to stay in school.<br/><br/>How refreshing that another reviewer (you are not alone!) has denounced the poor sexual messages conveyed here. Other than dance, this movie is pretty much all about sex, isn't it? This other commentator noted that Tony's brother leaves the priesthood because he can't deal with the celibacy. Hardly surprising that this attitude is the one presented, is it? Also Tony's friend gets a girl pregnant but is unable to deal with the responsibility (hopefully a good warning to young male viewers). Yes, plenty of sex, though mainly talking about it.<br/><br/>Watch the movie for the great music...it'll ""make you feel like dancing"", but don't expect a gripping plot or encourage your kids to get their moral attitudes from it. Better still, just buy the BeeGees CD and don't bother with the movie at all. You won't miss much."

","Is the only reason this is not in the the top 250 films, snobbery?

Its easy to dismiss and yet with each repeated watch it gets better and better. What is so great about it then? For starters John Travolta delivers the most physically exciting male lead acting role ever on screen. The dialogue is unrelentingly rough and dumb, perfectly matching the group of deadbeats that Travolta hangs out with. The editing is relentless allowing the viewer to get to know a lot about Travolta's character and background in as short as time possible. And of course it has the most exciting, intimate dance routines on film ever. It should surely sit among the top 50 best films ever made."

","This movie came out when I was a child, and Vinnie Boberino (of Welcome back Kotter) was basically a household name. I was too young to see his movie debut, but the producers for some strange reason (curse them!) decided to release a kinder, gentler, super-edited version for under aged Welcome Back Kotter fans. <br/><br/>I was dragged to the movie to see this by a friend who bought into a lot of hype regarding how great the movie was supposed to be. Mind youI was like 9 or ten years old and would have rather seen Star Wars (for the fifth time), Superman, or anything by Disney. <br/><br/>What I expected to see was something humorous, with a lot of dancing and music What I actually did see was shocking, appalling, disturbing, and frightening despite the heavy editing that cut the film down to like one hour and fifteen minutes (or thereabouts). The scene where his buddy jumps off a bridge gave me nightmares for weeks, and despite the heavy editing the rape scene was stillwell, a rape scene. <br/><br/>A few years later, when I was in High School I finally saw the full-length unedited version of the crap-fest to see if my opinion would change if I a) realized there was more of a plot while viewing the full version or b) was a little older, and more mature. <br/><br/>Sure enough, it appeared to me as no less of a smutty crap-fest than it did the first time around. In fact, I grew to hate it more. Despite a film that glorifies being a low-life rapist who thinks he's Al Pacino, and hangs out at discos with drugged out racist scumbags It also features bad acting, really bad directing, poor dialog, underdeveloped characters, and so much unnecessary use of the F-Bomb that it makes Kevin Smith films look like Saturday morning cartoons. <br/><br/>The worse and most appalling part of this film catastrophe was: THE ENDING! Come on. Unrealistic and degrading to women. What was it about the disco era that made producers of film and television shows (like General Hospital) to glorify and glamorize the cruelty of rape, making it look like all the attacker had to do was apologize to his victim andnext thing you know they fall in love and live happily ever after?!?!?! What a crock<br/><br/>If this was as ""gritty"" and ""real"" as some of it's ""fans"" claim it to beStephanie would have called the cops on Tony, and he would have spent his entire meaningless life in jailRealizing he threw away what could have been a promising dance career when he acted out on his frustration and rage. Now THAT would have been realistic. <br/><br/>The only good thing about this film was the dancingeven though it was to really cheesy music."

","""An avowal of poverty is no disgrace to any man; to make no effort to escape it is indeed disgraceful."" – Thucydides <br/><br/>""The best way to escape from a problem is to solve it."" – Alan Saporta <br/><br/>John Badham directs ""Saturday Night Fever"". The plot? A group of frustrated 1970s working class youths escape the drudgery of life by disappearing into a world of sex, drugs and the pulsating lights of local disco clubs. One of these kids, a guy called Tony Manero (played by John Travolta), meets a girl called Stephanie, a cute dancer who aspires to greater things.<br/><br/>Being with Stephanie causes Tony to gradually become disillusioned with the life he is leading. Stuck in a dreary job and living with deadbeat parents, Tony finally decides to skip town, drop his loser friends and start afresh. Afterall, maybe he can be somebody. Maybe he can achieve something for himself.<br/><br/>The film ends with Tony and Stephanie living together, both determined to help one another climb the ladder to success. Like most films, ""Saturday Night Fever"" makes the mistake of suggesting that some external change in location will bring about some internal state of happiness, but perhaps its ending isn't meant to imply change. The film hints that this couple will forever be stuck in a rut.<br/><br/>Directed by John Badham (""War Games""), ""Saturday Night Fever"" is of course famous for its soundtrack and its groovy dance scenes. Yes, Travolta's portrayal of Manero comes across as being a bit camp nowadays, but this doesn't hamper the film. Virtually every shot, every cocky pose he strikes, is iconic.<br/><br/>Ironically, beneath the film's razzle-dazzle is one depressing movie, very much akin to the gritty ""kitchen sink"" and ""New Wave"" dramas churned out by British and French film makers in the late 50s and early 60s. This kind of murky social realism would prove influential on Hollywood directors, giving birth to a string of neo realist Hollywood films in the late 1960s and 70s - though most masked depoliticization behind faux grit - arguably the most interesting period of American cinema.<br/><br/>What's most interesting about ""Saturday Night Fever"", though, is this: most films within this genre align their song and dance numbers with their audience's own desires. IE - we celebrate those succeeding on screen because we secretly yearn for that special brand of Hollywood escapism. The audience's act of escaping drudgery via cinema then becomes, in theory, the on screen act of Travolta escaping his grimy life via dance. But ""Saturday Night Fever"" short circuits this fantasy at every turn, the film incrementally peeling back its disco lights to reveal a world of rape, drugs, suicide, class based frustrations and violent race wars. There is no escape, and the audience is always aware of what exactly its craving's are consoling.<br/><br/>In this way, the film highlights the urgency with which man clings to easy, manufactured escapes. More importantly, the film demonstrates how the frustrations of the working classes are built up and then channeled down the social hierarchy, animosity misdirected and aimed at equally or less unfortunate people. Travolta articulates this during his ""cycle of s**t"" speech toward the end of the film, in which he explains how his father's bitterness at having lost his job causes the old man to ""take a s**t"" on his son, who passes ""the s**t"" on to his Italian friends, who passes ""the s**t"" on to the Mexican gangs etc etc. The film's cure to this cycle of animosity is a kind of working class brotherhood. It suggests the forging of an empathic connection, born of collective suffering, between all men. Recognise the basic antagonistic struggle in which we are all caught, and join forces in a sort of mutual struggle.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – The 70s were odd. Even the silliest films had a kind of social urgency or attachment. Nowadays we have ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""High School Musical"", then we had ""Rocky"" and ""Saturday Night Fever"". Is it because films then seemed to be about real people, or because today's people aren't really real?"

The rest was an endless stream of profanity, sex, and stupidity. Travolta's character wasn't even likable. I mean, the main character of a movie can have flaws... but he/she has to at least be likable on some level. Travolta's character was shallow, a jerk, and didn't really ""grow"" that much through the movie. The fact that the gives the trophy to the couple who really deserved it, and wanted to try being friends with Stephanie, wasn't really that much of a ""redemption"" for me.

","Gene Siskel's favorite film. Although ""Saturday Night Fever'' appealed to him primarily on an emotional level, Siskel spoke about it in terms of its themes, and there are two central ones. First, the desire of all young people to escape from a life sentence of boring work and attain their version of the beckoning towers of Manhattan. Second, the difficulty that some men have in relating to women as comrades and friends and not simply sex facilitators.<br/><br/>There is a scene in the movie where the hero, Tony Manero, sits on a bench with Stephanie, the girl he loves, and tells her all about one of the bridges out of Brooklyn: Its height, length, how many cubic yards of concrete went into its making--and you can taste his desire to cross that bridge and leave Brooklyn behind. Earlier, Stephanie has described him in a few brutal words: ""You live with your parents, you hang with your buddies and on Saturday nights you burn it all off at 2001 Odyssey. You're a cliché. You're nowhere, going' no place.'' Tony senses that she is right.<br/><br/>No one wonder Saturday Night Fever is still Stayin' Alive!"

As a result, the movie avoids becoming a period piece which makes it as watchable today as when it was first released in 1977. <br/><br/>The term ""classic"" is a word that should be used sparingly, especially for Hollywood movies which for the most part are pot-boiler remakes of remakes of remakes, crass commercial products utterly devoid of any artistic originality. However, this movie is a classic. It has withstood the test of time and presents a complex story with themes that are as relevant today as they were when this movie was released thirty years ago. This surprisingly unique movie dramatizes a wide range of social issues that still plague society today. These issues include alienation, racial strife, family discord, class conflict and other symptoms of social pathology that if anything have intensified.

I see a lot of people that like the film hail Tony as a hero and a lot of people that hate it decry him as a shallow idiot. I view him more as a tragic character that sees the path he's going down isn't the right one, but doesn't quite know how to deal with it. He's not happy with the man he is, but doesn't quite know how to change into the man he wants to be. Movies that try to accomplish these things intentionally come off pretentious and ham fisted. This movie was just and honest slice of life story with a great lead performance and its realism lead to its depth.

You follow the life a young man named Tony (John Travolta) who is the King of the Dance Floor by night and Paint Shop Clark by day, but in amongst all this he doesn't get on with his family and doesn't know what he wants to do in life. For the soundtrack however, it is filled with Disco Fever classics like: Disco Inferno, Stayin Alive (of course) and More Than a Women.

","John Travolta is excellent in his first main role.  He stars as a shop assistant in a paint shop who dreams of dancing at the local disco and winning a dance contest.  The film is set to the famous soundtrack, which is mostly written by the Bee Gees and includes the songs ""More than a woman"", Stayin' alive"" and the excellent ballad ""How deep is your love"".  It is excellent in the cinema but great fun to see on video also."

","What makes Saturday Night Fever a great film? Before this can be answered, it must be acknowledged that this is far from perfect film making, and that there is more than one weak spot in the plot structure. On top of that, the performance quality is fairly uneven, in regards to the supporting cast.<br/><br/>
Again Â– What makes Saturday Night Fever a great film?  First and foremost, it is the stellar performance by John Travolta. Travolta's portrayal of Tony Manero is all at once, vulnerable, crass, intelligent (his portrayal, NOT Tony), and tragic.  Travolta's dancing some 25 years later is still of the more memorable in cinematic history.<br/><br/>As far as the soundtrack Â– forget everything OTHER than the Bee Gees. The music is not only still great, but is the only quality disco music period.<br/><br/>
Finally, the opening sequence in which Travolta steps off a Brooklyn subway car and begins a swagger back to the paint store in which he works is in my opinion, the most tantalizing scene of the film. This is I would argue, one of the most powerful and dazzling opening scenes in movie history, and Travolta plays it to perfection.<br/><br/>SureÂ…Saturday Night Fever is a dated film. The clothing is ridiculous by today's standards and there is more than one scene that would have the politically correct movement of today be up in arms.  Despite this, Travolta's best performance of his career (at 23, Travolta was nominated for Best Actor), along with the mostly-Bee Gees soundtrack, make Saturday Night Fever a great film today."

The protagonist of this movie is nothing less than abhorrent, his supposed redemption is a cheap, unearned, insulting sham.<br/><br/>Aside from the single good dance scene (which does NOT involve John Travolta) this film is an awkward mess of supposed class warfare, blue collar self aggrandizement, soft lighting (so romantic!), and explicit glorification of violence and rape.

",". . . the flick that made ""John Travolta,"" a household name. Looking at this late 70s film in 2002, it's easy to see why this happened.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Fever"" offers an extremely impressive ""guido"" type characterization by Travolta. He's not only got the handsome Italianesque features (complete with clef chin) great bod and sensual manner, but also displays brilliant disco dancing and strong acting skills. <br/><br/>
Travolta's solid work dominates a film which, unfortunately is a mixed bag. Great 70s music, pulsating disco scenes, and a potential paean to teen under-achievers, is mildly defeated by a director and editor with apparently limited abilities or vision.<br/><br/>Director John Badham allows the film to fall apart, as Editor David Rawlins sloppily cuts, splices and fades in odd manners.  True, the original version is much more coherent (and the ten minutes excised in an attempting a PG rating further undermines its continuity).<br/><br/>But Writers Nik Cohn and Norman Wexler also seem to run out of steam, not quite knowing just where they want their story to go, or exactly what kind of statement they want to make.  The result is more murky confusion than inventive surprise, and the viewer is left with decidedly mixed feelings.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that, to date, ""Saturday Night Fever"" represents Travolta's career peak.  Not that he hasn't tried in a long line of subsequent films, and one appreciates his hard-working efforts (with his total career being financially very successful).  Still, his work in this film has guaranteed that the name, ""Travolta,"" is forever enshrined in the annals of Hollywood history."

","Saturday Night Fever. Just the name evokes memories. It's hard not to feel nostalgic remembering this movie. Being someone who grew up knowing the magic of disco, I  definetly remember the glittziness and glitter of this early travolta movie. But I still wouldn't call it one of the best pics ever made as many reviewers before me had indicated.<br/><br/>I think this movie stands up as being a major influence on other movies as well as having some of the best music ever seen in a movie-and that's for sure-the music is addicting. And the dance numbers were pretty cool to.<br/><br/>But the story itself is just good for me-ok maybe VERY good-I'll admit I am a much bigger fan of ""Grease"" then Saturday Night Fever. I will say the movie nailed the atmosphere to a tee. Another reviewer recently posted on here talking about aspects of superficiality and I agree. In the disco era, as in many others, image is everything. That's the type of environment that can have more then a little negative impact after awhile if it gets into your skin.It's hard to see this now and not be taken back in time but even now, I like this less for the story then for the incredible sizzling music that very few movies before and after have ever been able to duplicate so effectively.<br/><br/>I give Saturday Night Fever a 12 out of 10 for the music but about an 8 for the movie as a whole. But hearing that great music never fails to make me wanna get up and dance!"
"dogge84","Null","2","4","16 March 2004"," A good history lesson, however.......
","Saturday Night Fever may indeed be the one movie from the seventies which had the greatest influence on people. This doesn't keep it from being a very bad movie.<br/><br/>It's not altogether bad though. The cinematography is great, especially the interior scenes from the nightclub where Travolta is dancing. And of course there isn't words enough to congratulate the choreography for the dancing scenes. The props, the haircuts and the clothing is so in keeping with the time, and at the same time it created the fashion for the time to come. The music is simply outstanding with the soundtrack being the best selling for many years. They even manage to fit the music in with the movie.<br/><br/>
These are the good things about this movie and neither of them are a good reason to watch it today. It's simply out of time and not just from a fashion point of view. The characters are bad developed and every one of them, except for Travolta occasionally and his brother, is either a lame unpleasant prick or just plain stupid. The language the characters use speaks for itself. <br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, Travolta is one of those ""pricks"" but he goes through some level of growth and you can actually manage to discern some sort of intelligence and humanity in him. This is, as I said before, more than you can say about the rest of the characters in this mess. If people in the seventies were like the gang which Travolta hangs out with, I'm glad that I was spared from that age (being born in 1979). <br/><br/>The story is about Tony (and NO, he does not look like Al Pacino!); a dreaming young man who lives in Brooklyn. Daytime he is working in a paint store and at night he is driving around with his ""cool"" gang, fighting with (and sometimes tries to kill!!) another gang and hanging out at a disco called ""2001"". Here Tony is the king of the dancefloor. Actually he is so good that the dancing crowd disperses and makes a space in the middle for him to ""shake his thing"" while they stand around and watch him. Then there is a dance contest and Tony teams up with a girl who he falls in love with and they start to practice together. This leads up to a number of circumstances and situations around which the movie circulates.<br/><br/>In spite of all the terrible things Tony do throughout the movie, you actually care for him in the end (and that's quite an achievement).<br/><br/>However, this movie is just sad. It's vulgar, sexistic and even boring at some parts. Don't watch it! Unless you are about my age and want to see what it looked like when your parents were young and went out dancing. Also, Travolta does a fine job and was indeed very well casted. So if you have a small budget and have to choose between the movie or the soundtrack......Well, you know what my choice would be.<br/><br/>

","An uneducated Brooklyn teen (John Travolta, in an Oscar-nominated role) lives in a dream world over the weekends as the king of a disco dance floor. Disillusioned, quietly upset with where his life is, Travolta finds solace by dancing in public to Bee Gee's music and finds love with his newest dance partner (Karen Lynn Gorney). The duo practice for an upcoming contest that could mean total success at last for Travolta and the opportunity to get discovered doing what he really loves. Travolta and his friends seem destined to go down a path of destruction though as a soap opera develops for all the key people found within. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a total over-achiever as it could have fallen to exploitation tactics of the 1970s, but becomes one of those iconic films that still stands the test of time.<br/><br/>The film is made in film vert: grounded, edgy, & realistic. Camera lenses are used that the film's urban ambience & attitude. The script has infinitely indefinable coarse & cuss verbosity. There are some realistic & graphic rape & fight scenes. But its all to not stop the film's panacea Brooklyn flair m& atmosphere.<br/><br/>While the movie is more apt to be recalled for its impact on American pop culture, few who watch the movie will ever see beyond the admittedly fantastic dance sequences. As a result, many people might never recognize Saturday Night Fever as perhaps one of the best movies ever made about class struggles among white ethnics.<br/><br/>While Tony's friends idolize him, the movie never really does, but it does allow empathy for his plight, because even Tony realizes that he is virtually trapped by the current conditions of his existence. While much might be made of the homophobia, racism, and misogyny of the protagonist and his friends, these things are never excused and the movie goes to some lengths to express Tony's own recognition that these are shortcomings in not only his character, but those borne of a provincial mentality which he desperately longs to escape.<br/><br/>We meet Tony's friends and the girls that hang around them, and we are reminded that feminism has not yet conquered Brooklyn. Some of the girls, especially a spunky little number named Annette (Donna Pescow), worship Tony. He dances with Annette because she's a good dancer, but he tries to keep her at arm's length otherwise. He's caught in a sexist vise: Because he likes her, he doesn't want to sleep with her, because then how could he respect her? The female world is divided, he explains, between nice girls and tramps. She accepts his reasoning and makes her choice.<br/><br/>The Brooklyn we see in ""Saturday Night Fever""reminds us a lot of New York's Little Italy as Martin Scorsese saw it in ""Who's That Knocking at My Door?"" and ""Mean Streets."" The characters are similar: They have few aims or ambitions and little hope of breaking out to the larger world of success -- a world symbolized for them by Manhattan, and the Brooklyn Bridge reaching out powerfully toward it.<br/><br/>But ""Saturday Night Fever"" isn't as serious as the Scorsese films. It does, after all, have almost wall-to-wall music in it (mostly by the Bee Gees, but including even ""Disco Duck""). And there are the funny scenes (like the one where Travolta shouts at his father: ""You hit my hair!"") to balance the tragic and sel<br/><br/>John Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character, fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too, it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the ""strut"" in their walk, representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being ""cool"". All the characters want to be something, while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their working-class backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American social-comments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.<br/><br/>The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love, drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect, it has intelligence as well as entertainment, which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets."

","Some films go beyond the limits of the big screen and become the mark of an era. ""Saturday Night Fever"" belongs to this select category, efficiently capturing the spirit of the ""Disco"" era in New York, in addition to presenting, through the character played by John Travolta, a remarkable teen drama. In addition, the exceptional soundtrack became iconic, as well as the dance scenes at the ""2001"" disco. For all these reasons, the feature film directed by John Badham went down in history as a symbol of the pop culture of the 70s. Employed in a small paint store in Brooklyn, Tony Manero (John Travolta) finds happiness only when he is on the dance floors in weekends. When his brother Frank (Martin Shakar) gives up being a priest and returns home, he finds a new dance partner named Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) and begins to rethink the way he looks at life and the lack of perspective on his future. To understand the cultural phenomenon ""Saturday Night Fever"", it is essential to contextualize its launch. After years of political scandals and participation in wars, pessimism began to make room for escapism among Americans, who sought to forget their problems and find pleasure on the dance floors. This movement also began to be reflected in cinema, which lived the last breaths of New Hollywood - a movement full of (excellent) equally pessimistic films - and started to produce more cheerful films, which functioned as a kind of escape from reality, culminating in the resounding success of the ""Star Wars"" saga. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is not necessarily a happy film, on the contrary, but it accurately portrays this movement that started in New York, in which young people went to nightclubs just after sex, drugs and fun, as a way to forget the hard times. reality of life and the lack of perspective for the future. Exposing sex and drug use naturally, the narrative embodies the youthful spirit and reflects the thinking of the time, also illustrating social problems in large cities, for example, through the fights between Tony's friends and the ""Latinos"".

","... this is a product of my generation. I was the age that Travolta's character Tony was in 1977, although in a completely different part of the US. Probably the disco era is the only one in the history of film in which people in street clothes look like they are going to a costume party. The pointy collars, the shoes, the hair so full of hairspray that it looks like it would shatter if it brushed up against something, and those jackets that are so full of holes - big ones - they look like they were attacked by moths and why are we calling them jackets anyways?<br/><br/>So Tony (Travolta) is a New York City born and bred Italian American with only a high school education, an employee at a dead end job - selling and mixing paint - in a store that is now extinct - the neighborhood hardware store that is about to get replaced by the big box hardware stores such as Harbor Freight. Dad is used to being the head of the family, but now he has been laid off in middle age. Suddenly Edith is talking back and disrespecting Archie and he doesn't like it one bit. And the only thing that makes Tony feel alive is Saturday nights on the dance floor of the local disco where he is the best.<br/><br/>And then he meets a girl - Stephanie. She is everything that I, a Texan, was told that New Yorkers are - loud mouthed, self important, snooty. And yet Tony follows her around like a puppy because he is in love. Annette (Donna Pescow) follows Tony around like a puppy because she is in love. It's funny how Tony doesn't like how Stephanie treats him, yet he turns around and treats Annette the same way. But Tony turns out to be much more self aware than you would think. And Stephanie - there is much more to her story than her being just another stuck up Manhattanite.<br/><br/>There is so much casual sex going on here that it answers the question ""Where did herpes come from?"". But it is so much more than glittering disco balls. it is a love story. A story of a guy learning about the friendship component of love. It is a tragedy. It is a story of young people at a crossroads. And last but not least, it has probably one of the great soundtracks in motion picture history and gave the Bee Gees a second act. I'd highly recommend it. Just try to ignore your probable first reaction ""Yikes those clothes!!!!""""."

","Timing as they say is everything. The confluence of rising director John Balham, new face John Travolta in the lead role and the insertion of a soundtrack powered by the newly discofied Bee Gees saw the high watermark of disco music as both movie and soundtrack broke box office and chart records at the time.<br/><br/>That said, I wonder what the teenage audience who flocked to the cinema made of what is actually at times a pretty gritty urban drama set in contemporary New York. It gets off to a great start with the now-iconic image of Travolta's Tony Manero cruising down the streets, hair perfectly coiffured, dressed to kill, checking his appearance in every mirror, his step in perfect syncopation with the anthemic ""Stayin' Alive"" booming out in the background. From there we're introduced to Tony's world, well-liked shop boy by day, troublesome young adult at home to his Italian parents, dad a feckless do-nothing and mum hung up on religion, lionising her other son who's already joined the priesthood to Tony's comparative detriment. However it's outside shop hours and home time that he really comes alive, running about with his similarly sharp-dressed teenage gang boys but in particular coming alive at the local disco where he takes as much care over his dance moves as he does his personal appearance.<br/><br/>Sub-plots involving other characters also happen by, like the rivalry with another gang in the neighbourhood, his regular girl dancing partner who wants more than that and the return of his brother who has summarily given up his religious calling much to the disappointment of both parents who seem to somehow blame Tony's influence for this family catastrophe. The main story is Tony's interest in the hot new girl who comes to the disco and catches his eye with her slick dance moves. Mix in a little Sharks and Jets turf war and a dash of the tragedy born of bravado from ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and you arrive at a fairly downbeat ending, with just the hope that Tony has now matured and is ready to grow up and face his adult responsibilities.<br/><br/>So, a coming-of-age contemporary musical drama with a new, young cast which might have disappeared without trace if it wasn't for those great Bee Gees songs and Travolta's star turn, particularly when he's dancing to their music. I personally could have done without the misogynistic treatment of women with some of the sexual encounters with females bordering on rape and the casual racism in some of the dialogue but director Badham certainly seems to capture the authenticity of late 70's street life in the poorer backstreets of NYC and like I said obviously recognised the benefits of centring the film round Travolta's electric performance and those hit songs of the Brothers Gibb."

","As infrequently as some oldies tunes happen to pop up on the radio, there was a time when that's all it was believe it or not. During the 1970s, the wave of disco joints multiplied by the day. Besides the 1960s and 1970s promoting peace and love, it also became a time where dancing was the ""in"" thing to do. Everybody was doing it. It was a craze that took a nation by storm where all people wanted to do was party and dance. For movies, the 1970s were also a time of many successes that have created quite an impact on today's culture and society. One of the most widely popular films to be remembered from that era was Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977). However for movies that capitalized on the dance wave at the time, the best known and respected film to represent such a time was this film. It does have some components that could've been left out or fixed but mostly it is an entertaining film of its time.<br/><br/>Written by Norman Wexler (Serpico (1973)) and directed by John Badham (in his first feature film), the story is about a late teen named Tony Manero (John Travolta) who lives in a world where the only thing that matters to him is the weekend. He's a nice kid at heart and works hard but just wants live his life in the present. During the day he works at a paint shop, later he hangs with his immature goof ball friends, gets badgered by an old flame named Annette (Donna Pescow) and then has the same dinner every night with his family of high expectations. What Manero looks forward to on the weekend are the disco dances. While attending a party one night he comes across a dancer who catches his eye named Stefanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). It's at that moment Manero wants her to be his dance partner for a competition. For all the prior subplots going on around Manero, they do serve the purpose of character development but they also fall to the wayside over time.<br/><br/>The reoccurring moral of the script is the power of choice. Everyone has a choice to be or do what he or she wants in life. Manero's family wants him to become a priest like his brother Frank (Martin Shakar). Annette gets told numerous times by Tony that she has to decide on whether she's going to act like a woman or a prostitute. Tony is also challenged on his beliefs by Stefanie and when his boss tells him to stop spending his money frivolously on the weekend. Stefanie even gets some of her own medicine thrown back at her. Tony friends are a gradual eye opener as well. Every single supporting/main character has a specific role to play when it comes to character development and it is handled properly. The problem is once the change in character occurs, the supporting threads and their respective characters disappear and aren't concluded in the most direct of ways. The only other component to the writing is some of the slang dialog used. Yes, the 1970s were a much different time. However, this still does not excuse the fact of using various racial slurs.<br/><br/>Other than this every other aspect to the film is enjoyable. The acting is competently performed. It is a bit jarring to see the difference in years when it comes to how much John Travolta changed. Also voice-actor Paul Pape has a role as one of Tony's goof ball friends. The acting and writing also effectively capture the mood and attitude of the era. As stated before, disco was a craze at the time and many people hopped on the bandwagon just because everybody was doing it. Plus with all the issues surrounding Tony, going to the disco was also a good representation of how disco was an escapist activity for a lot of people. For the people who took part, it was a moment in time where people would forget about their troubles and just enjoy the night. The cinematography shot by Ralf D. Bode fit well with the scenes too. Bode was able to acquire a number of odd angles and establishing shots that in some ways felt like the camera was prepping the audience just as much as the scene was.<br/><br/>The choreography handled by Lester Wilson was crafted nicely as well. A year before, Wilson worked on Sparkle (1976) which proved to be a success and it didn't change here. Wilson's ability to get the entire cast to work in synchronized motion is impressive. That and all the dance moves that Travolta and Gorney perform are well staged. It's unimaginable how much practice went into making sure those dance numbers were done the right way in one shot. That takes patience. The music for this film is practically scoreless with only a few tunes composed by David Shire. The rest was handled by English pop group The Bee Gees (Barry, Maurice & Robin Gibb). The movie itself would probably not be as memorable or popular if it weren't for the numerous songs heard throughout the background. Songs like ""Stayin' Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and ""More Than a Woman"" are just some of the songs that'll stick in the viewers mind. It's also interesting to watch the dancing with these songs because of the viewers' knowledge of music, how sensual the emotions are in the performances.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for its time it suffers from racial slurs that are still not excusable and its subplots are well written until they aren't needed anymore leading to indirect conclusions. These flaws are thankfully made up for with the abundance of character development, appropriate acting, memorable music tunes and well-staged dance choreography. It is a time capsule that defined the 1970s."

","Saturday Night Fever is one of the most ultimate disco movies, where John Travolta stars as Brooklyn teenager Tony Manero, who is known as the king of the disco floor at a local dance club. His weekend visits to the club help him overcome the bleakness in his life and he teams up with a girl from a dance class to enter a dance competition.<br/><br/>You get to see Travolta dance and boogie to a number of discos songs, from the Bee Gees' Staying Alive to KC & the Sunshine Band's Boogie Shoes, and you couldn't help but rock and sing-along with the groovy and toe-tapping music. The movie reserves a good amount of time for all the disco singing and dancing, which what I think represent one of the most iconic moments in the disco era and in pop culture as a whole.<br/><br/>The cinematography captures the somewhat lazy and dreary feel of Brooklyn, which I think symbolizes Tony's troubled life. The chemistry between him and his carefree friends serve up some good drama in the movie, and the conflict between him and his family was pretty suspenseful. But, I think there is little chemistry between him and dance partner Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) as I thought her character was unsympathetic and pretty wooden. The plot was well-paced for the most part, but thought it ***spoiler ahead** fell apart at the end especially toward the end during the fighting scene and the events after the dance competition as left pretty anti-climatic. ***spoiler ends*** <br/><br/>Overall, though, it's a pretty cool movie with great songs and an iconic performance from Travolta.<br/><br/>Grade B"

","It's enough for me when a film has spontaneity and spirit, what the Spanish call duende; it's okay to not be sophisticated, to not try to think up everything, there's no surer way after all of reaching your limits of observation (and all art is that) than an intellectual approach. <br/><br/>This observes in a simplistic way, a young dance hero at the local disco has to envision life ahead of just tonight. He works in a store by day, gets slapped upside the head by his Italian dad for being late for dinner and only minds that it messes up his hairdo, not the indignity.<br/><br/>By night though he commands the stage, life acquires shape, colorful order out of the swirl, and this is the beauty of dance and dance films in general; expression that ritually transforms scattered reality, and we see this wonderfully on the disco floor, room is cleared for him, he acts out with the whole body, and the moves are not stupendously choreographed such as you'd see in a Gene Kelly confection, they look goofy now, much parodized as silly.<br/><br/>I like this in much the same way I like Showgirls. Easy to be critical of both, to find the protagonists and overall worldview vacant and catty. Easy also to run into trouble in the effort to prop either as somehow profound satire that is above what it shows; it's not, even though the moral is creating a safe ordinary life outside the dance.<br/><br/>But it has a bit of the spirit that many films lack. This is all epitomized in Travolta; it's not necessarily in the moves, he could do it of course, but it's more than just suaveness that attracts, the dance scenes are few after all. It's in the eyes of innocent swagger, in not being afraid to stupidly dance at the edge of the Brooklyn bridge."
"bunciegardner3227","Null","0","0","31 July 2011"," Film Appreciation
","Saturday Night Fever is an original film that leads the way for other dance and music films in the 80's to present. John Travolta plays the lead role of Tony Manero who doesn't know much about his future but knows that he can dance. Tony Manero lives for Saturday nights at 2001 with music and his friends. There are many themes of this film social problems being one, struggling for human dignity, and youths coming of age. A major theme point of this movie was Tony realizing that he could not remain a young teen forever and would have to get serious about his future since there was not preventing it. Another great movie with some of the same themes is Fame. The editing is superb in this film. The viewer feels apart of every scene, it makes the viewer want to relive their youth or anticipate their youth. The soundtrack to this movie put the viewer right there in 1977, with the bell bottoms, and Farah Faucet hair. This movie is excellent for any youth coming of age or someone that wants to relive their youth and see how far they have come."

","Saturday Night Fever, one of the greatest disco dancing movies ever made. John Travolta played the character Tony Manero. Tony was a slick dresser with his bell bottom trousers get up and let us not forget about the slicked back hair. The theme revolves around a young man that wants to be accepted and want to fit in. Tony feels on top of the world when he is dancing. Without his dancing he feels hopeless and has really nothing else going for him. When Tony is in the club performing his dance moves he has so many people routing him and gets the attention he is seeking. At home he received nothing but negative attention and his family is not routing him on and thinks he has nothing going for him at all.<br/><br/>The lighting in the film made those white bell bottoms and moves come to life on the dance stage. I enjoyed the dancing and disco music during the show. The outfits with the help of the lighting seem to bedazzle me during the dancing scenes. Even though the move had a lot of dancing it revolved around a young man wanting to be accepted and gaining that acceptance through art. The lighting angles showcased his moves and allowed the glistening of the light to reflect just right and made Tony shine on the stage, man he is good.<br/><br/>Amazing to see a man getting ready for his night on the town, different perspective from other movies and these extreme outfits and slicked back hair provided him with the acceptance he desired. The movie also shreds light on unexpected pregnancy and men in general even in this day and time wanting to have sex with anything that walks in the back seat of car and even Tony basis his attraction on physical attributes. The film even though it took place in a different time era the message is still loud and clear even today. Looks seem to be the most important factor.<br/><br/>However like the song Neil McCoy sings that has a line that ""looks are not that important just icing on a cake. The world has came a long way with stereotyping and discrimination but there is still work left to do and Tony begins to understand by the end of the movie that there is more to live this looks. Lets not forget that we all get old and loose are hair or gain wait and we won't have our looks for very long."

And the music adds a LOT to the movie... the breathy introspection of ""How Deep Is Your Love"" makes the subway sequence heartbreaking as ""More Than A Woman"" represents Tony falling in love with his dancing partner and the life she represents... and let's not forget the grooving swagger of a little song called ""Stayin' Alive"" which opens the movie.<br/><br/>Some characters in the film haven't aged well, like the uber-skank Annette (vital organs eventually break) and Troubled Nutso Bobby C.

He is flocked by the women and nearly idolized by Annette. Then he meets Stephanie, who truly opens his eyes at life.

","1977 was the year in which iconoclastic punk and hedonistic disco dominated the music charts. How ironic then that Debbie Boone's ""You light up my life"" should end the year off at the top of the US single's charts. While I don't think the punk movement has ever been suitably documented in movie fiction, the more commercial and mainstream disco culture has had several major films dedicated to it. The best of these was undoubtedly Saturday Night Fever.<br/><br/>The snag is, SNF is NOT a disco movie. Yes, it has some dazzling dance sequences, yes, it has a pulsating soundtrack, and, yes, many of the scenes are shot in the local discoteque. But I have always felt that the disco setting is peripheral to the real story; the alienation of youth and the sanctuary and acceptance they find in each other and their chosen surroundings. In fact, even the film's title is somewhat misleading. Nik Cohn's magazine article on which the film is based (and which he later claimed was a fake), ""Tribal rites of the new Saturday Night"" would have been more apposite. As Tony Manero, John Travolta perfectly captures these rites, preening himself religiously in front of the mirror, donning his warrior's uniform, and escaping the drudgery of his job and homelife to the battleground, the dancefloor where he is the tribal chief.<br/><br/>Gritty, foulmouthed and downbeat, SNF starkly captures the darker underbelly of the disco subculture."

SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a meshing of religious overtones and secularism for a commentary on a generation and a clash between the religious world (briefly) and the secular world. The film tells the tale of lost souls at the disco as seen through the eyes of father frank and the higfh flying antics of a popular disco celebrity played by TRAVOLTA. The film is high art and pop culture rolled into one. The film captures the spirit of the disco era and set a new standard in soundtracks and soundtrack marketing. (along with STAR WARS and GREASE) The movie has a moral to it about life and the cruelty of it and trying to get by yet the clash between father frank and his walking away from the clergy was a great subplot I loved. That subplot gave the film believability and substance. The family setting for the character played by travolta was also believable. It was almost like a real family. The plus points:plot, music and acting. A film about nobodys who are trying to be somebody having been a nobody all my life I have nothing to hide. One of travoltas best movies.

","Saturday Night Fever is a terribly misunderstood film; I don't know anyone in my age group (growing up in the 70's but too young to have been part of the disco scene) that doesn't think that it's a silly film about disco dancing.  But it's not.<br/><br/>It's not the greatest film in the world, and certainly it's dated.  The dancing is important -- it's the backdrop, it's a catalyst for character development -- but it's not the focus of the film.  Saturday Night Fever tells the tale of an aimless Italian-American kid (Tony Manero, ably played by a very young and very thin John Travolta) whose only escape from his unhappy life is dancing at the club on the weekends with his friends; and it walks us very objectively through events that catapult Tony from a boy who can allow himself to escape to a man who realises he has to deal with his life.<br/><br/>There's a little bit of everything in the film (and a lot of profanity) It deals with personal and religious disillusionment; it deals with frightening problems like teen pregnancy and the choice of whether or not to get a post-secondary education in favour of working.

","'Saturday Night Fever' has acquired something of a reputation as a classic film.  The first time I saw it I thought it was incredibly boring, the second incredibly bad and the third time quite good.  Whilst undeniably a star vehicle for John Travolta, the film itself is an intelligent (at times) study of the emptiness of life.  Most of the characters are unpleasant though at the same time arouse our sympathy.  The ambigouity of the characters forces the audience to work to understand the characters rather than simply presenting them with one-dimensional characters.  The lead had to be played by a star with the charisma of someone like John Travolta as he is the most unpleasant character in the whole film.  This is perhaps the film's flaw, I really didn't care what happened to John Travolta, he could have plunged off Brooklyn Bridge for all I cared.  A major problem in evaluating the film nowadays is that it's difficult to know how much was supposed to be funny when the film was made and how much is funny now.  For instance, when John Travolta preens himself in front of the mirror would audiences in 1978 have laughed as they do nowadays ?  Ultimately 'Saturday Night Fever' is far from being a great film (although it is one of the highlights of Travolta's career) but it is interesting and will appeal to any John Travolta fan or anyone into cheesy '70s music."

","""Saturday Night Fever"" is a late 70's classic coming-of-age film. When I saw this movie, in a packed theater on Staten Island, New York in the winter of 1977 the people around me seemed to miss the point. When Karen Lynn Gorney's character Stephanie tells John Travolta's Tony he's going nowhere the audience booed her & clapped for his response, ""What the ""f"" you got? A stairway to the stars?"" After the film's release, some people were emulating Tony's friend's negative & sometimes stereotypical behavior. The movie's message was to better yourself, but some people just didn't get this simple premise. Karen Lynn Gorney was excellent as Stephanie Mangano, the business person/Manhattanite wannabe who mesmerized Tony Manero. Although she was about 32 at the time, she was playing a 20 year old (this was common casting practice in the 70's). My favorite scene is the touching moments when Tony tells Stephanie all he knows about the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The bridge symbolizes Tony's desire to get out of Brooklyn. If it had been The Brooklyn Bridge this scene would have made more sense, because the Verrazano Bridge connects Brooklyn to Staten Island, not Manhattan (a place we're their lives will supposedly get better). The language is authentic, the clothing, music & dancing are filled with 70's nostalgia. The film is NOT politically correct in any way. Therefore, it's very realistic, ""in-your-face"", & represents the time & place in which it was made. If you have an interest in late 70's pop culture this movie is a must see."

","I finally watched Saturday Night Fever last night. For all these years all I heard was hype and good reviews regarding the movie, but in my humble opinion, it was nothing more than a typical 1970s b-grade movie. I was very disappointed. The story is disjointed throughout, acting is very mediocre (except for John Travolta himself), the characters themselves aren't as strong as they seem intended to be, and the sound and video quality is also poor. There are several parts where the audio is almost definitely lip synchronised. (By the way, I watched the DVD version, so poor quality wasn't due to it being a worn VHS video copy). The music soundtrack is probably the only thing this movie really has going for it. I think this movie is a classic that we all have to watch at one time or another, but I don't think it's in the same category as Grease, which can be watched over and over without getting tiresome."

","John Badham (""Stakeout"", ""Bird on a Wire"", ""The Hard Way"", Short Circuit"", ""Blue Thunder"" and ""War Games""), yes John Badham, directed this semi-cult film about disco king Tony Manero (John Travolta), a hardware man by day, at night (especially Saturday night) a guru on the dance floor who can boogie down like no other.<br/><br/>Travolta sure can dance, and his smooth moves will either bring back fond memories, or leave you laughing in the aisles. So too the fashions, with the silky shirts, bell bottoms and platforms all looking hilariously ridiculous. There are, however, few other positives, except perhaps the Bee Gees' groovy soundtrack, with such hits as ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""More Than a Woman"".<br/><br/>Backdrop to this 70's hype is a drama involving Tony's gang, family traumas and his pursuit of a beautiful and sophisticated dancer named Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). All this remains in the background as John Badham does not allow Norman Wexler's script to develop in any way, and some very interesting characters, who appear to be real people, are not allowed to come to life. A real shame, as ""Saturday Night Fever"" could have been a strong melodrama, with some potentially solid performances just crying out to be given equal time.<br/><br/>Badham decided that disco fever would carry the movie alone, and at the time, it was a most shrewd decision. Sixteen years on, the same is not true, and most audiences will find ""Saturday Night Fever"" a bit silly, drab and even somewhat crass.<br/><br/>Saturday, September 17, 1994 - Valhalla Cinema"
"bob the moo","Null","2","6","19 April 2005"," Interesting character piece that could have been better but it is the dancing and soundtrack that make it memorable
","Tony Manero lives in Brooklyn with his parents, grandmother and younger sister. His brother is a priest and he feels like for every bit of pride that his parents have in Frank, it is equalled with the sense of disappointment that they have for Tony and his sister. Spending his days working in a hardware store, the one thing that Tony actually enjoys and feels he is good at is disco dancing, and he is a star in his local club. When he meets the annoyingly bitchy Stephanie he gains a dancing partner for an upcoming competition, although she is a difficult character and not the sort of female relationship that he is used to being with. With all this around him Tony tries to look forward to a direction in his life.<br/><br/>I noticed this film coming back onto television recently and I wasn't going to watch it because I had already seen it a few years ago. However, when I thought about it all I could actually remember was the famous dancing scenes - I then realised that I was actually remembering these from Airplane! Anyway, I decided to watch this again so that I could hold an opinion about it in regards more than just the dancing scenes. Watching it again I can understand why we all remember the soundtrack and dancing more than the plot, because they are the best aspects of the film. The plot is mostly a character piece with Tony at the heart of it and it is interesting enough to fill the running time as it gives us a good impression of the world he is in and his feelings. The problem comes with the fact that Tony (or anyone in the film in fact) is not that empathetic a character  he is rude, ignorant and pretty spiteful towards women. This is not to say that it damages the film but I did want the script to take me past his exterior to a greater extent than it actually did. In some ways it gets close (Tony's disbelief in his own ability works) and it is worth seeing but it needed to do more and be more consistent.<br/><br/>The plot around the dance contest isn't that interesting but it does produce some colourful and fun dance numbers that are all played out to a superb disco soundtrack that did have me rocking in my seat. Travolta copes well with the acting and the dancing, although I would have preferred a bit more humanity in him than he brought out but then again I suppose that was the whole point. Gorney is OK but is surprisingly bland past her very obvious character. Pescow is much better and produces a character that we actually cared about even if we never really get to know her. The support cast has too much in the way of cliché and stereotype to really be effective and they didn't make much of an impression with me.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film but not a totally successful one. The dancing and soundtrack are both great but what was really needed was better writing. The character study is interesting enough to carry the film and make it worth seeing but it is blunt, cruel towards women and lacking any sense of humanity and realism. Worth seeing but don't expect the fame of the dance scenes to mean it is a classic film for other reasons."

","The 1970's was the decade for John Travolta. He did ""Welcome Back, Kotter"", ""Carrie"", and now ""Saturday Night Fever"". I can understand Brooklyn, when you're a nobody in the neighborhood, you ought to get noticed. This movie to me is all about life, and the disco is the only place you can think of, right, WRONG! Anybody can strut his stuff of the disco floor, but wait, there's Stephanie. She's learning to live her life the way it is. She tries her best to help Tony(John Travolta) what it's like outside where he comes from. He hangs around his friends and his family who are bound by traditions. I think they are more misguiding than anyone I would know. And conscience played a factor for Tony when the disco dance contest was rigged and he thinks the Spanish couple deserved the 1st place prize. I agreed with him big time. At the end, Tony realized that Stephanie was the real deal and his family and friends were all a big joke to him. Starting over was the goal to Tony and Stephanie. The movie it had a lot of advantages, the music, the cast, and the scene. The cast had a big impact for the stars of today, like Fran Drescher, and Donna Pescow, two years later she did a sitcom called ""Angie"". This movie was a big phenomenon. And it should stay that way for a lifetime. I don't care it was 'R', 'X', or 'PG' rated. It's a hit ALWAYS! RATING 5 STARS!"

","There is magic of the disco in the 70s, as a transition kid ( too young for the disco ) who's too excited to see my elder siblings dress up and go to the disco in their teased hair and Vanderbilt jeans, this film is heaven-sent to kids like me who love to dance. It was rated R in those days so I relied on the retelling of my sister ( who edited the explicit part ) to me until I was old enough to see it for myself. By that time the hype is over but the memory of me cutting this out of the newspaper as a 'gotta watch movie 'I know I made the right choice. I can not imagine any actor doing the dancing as John Travolta did. He is the swag jumping out of the dictionary, strutting, enchanting the viewer. It also has a realistic depiction of how the poverty, religious beliefs and hardship of the working class family was in those days. Also the recklessness of youth, the lack of communication between friends, blind ambition are universal topics of then and now. It has a shoulder-shrug ending which up to now many people didn't get so my one point deduction is for that."

","Saturday Night Fever is a movie phenomenon not for its screenplay, cast or photography but the Bee Gees inspired disco soundtrack.<br/><br/>The shrieking notes of several Bee Gees songs are featured throughout as well as several other recognisable tracks that they wrote.<br/><br/>The disco 'phenomenon' was a blink and you'll miss it era during the late 1970s and this film epitomized that era. Starring John Travolta as Italian-American teenager Tony Manero.<br/><br/>Travolta's dance moves and disco wear have featured in several other films and have been the forefront of 'dad' dancing on dancefloors everywhere!<br/><br/>It was interesting to watch the film to see the costumes. Very memorable scenes. Travolta wouldn't be able to fit into them now. The first two thirds of the film are pretty moribund and I only found some resemblance of storyline in the final act of the film. A storyline focusing on Manero's troubled New York City family life, questionable love interests and friends. A good portrait of the era but a film I am unlikely to seek out again if I am honest."
"paul-allaer","9","1","2","16 July 2017"," Standing the test of time, 40 years later
","""Saturday Night Fever"" was released in 1977, meaning that this year marks the 40th anniversary. My local art-house theater here in Cincinnati had the good sense to hold a one-off special screening to commemorate the event (more in that later). I can't recall when was the last time I had seen the film, and in fact I wouldn't be surprised if this was the first time I saw it again in its entirety since I saw it during its original release (in Belgium, where I grew up, the movie was released in Spring of 1978, if memory serves me right).<br/><br/>Here some comments, in no particular order, having re-seen the film after all these years: 1. The music! Yes, the music! it remains the best feature of the film, and all of those Gibb Brothers-penned tunes are nothing short of a classic, every single one of them. 2. The dancing! John Travolta is as smooth as silk as he dances his way onto the dance floor and busts those disco moves. Love the scene when the entire floor dances along in unison to the Bee Gees' ""Night Fever"". And then there is Travolta's long solo during the Bee Gees' ""You Shouls Be Dancing"". Wow, just wow. 3. I had forgotten how many social commentaries and undercurrents there were in the film: tension within Tony's family, Tony's brother pulling a shocker, peer pressure among Tony's friends to 'fit in', even more pressure on the girls--if it all sounds contemporary, well, it is of course. They played out in society 40 years ago, and today--albeit not the exact same way of course. 4. The Travolta character gets a raise from his boss to $4/hr. Wonder how much that is in today's dollars? Almost $17! (Current federal minimum wage is $7.25.) 5. The age difference between Travolta and Gorney is much more noticeable to me now than it was for me as a kid (i was 17 watching it back then). 6. I was surprised at the number of F bombs throughout the movie (I don't know what version I saw in Belgium, the original R-rated version, or the subsequent revised PG version). 7. Seeing New York in 1977 like this, it feels like a bombed-out post-apocalyptic place, outright scary and depressing.<br/><br/>Bottom line: SNF stands the test of time, 40 years later, and then some. The Sunday matinée one-off screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, mostly people in my age group (I am 57). The event was co-sponsored by one of the city ""oldies"" radio station, and everyone had a great time, hooting and hollering in the beginning when Travolta was walking as the Bee Gees ""Stayin' Alive"" was blasting from the screen. If you have a chance to re-visit this classic on the big screen, don't miss it!"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","2","4 July 2017"," Proof that disco does not suck or is dead
","Will openly admit to having very fond memories of school discos, singing along (often forgetting words) and dancing (with some energy if not such a discernible beat) to music, a music college graduate has to start somewhere, that was great then and still is now.<br/><br/>'Saturday Night Fever' may not be a perfect film, or a masterpiece, but to me and many others it is high-energy and hugely enjoyable entertainment that took me back to nostalgic, and happier, times in my life. This was the late 90s-early 2000s, just to make things clear, memories of the 70s are none due to not having been born yet. 'Saturday Night Fever' is one of those films where it is easy to sit back and forget any problems and relax after a hard day (am hardly any stranger to those, so 'Saturday Night Fever' was a much needed distraction).<br/><br/>There are imperfections sure. Anybody looking for one of the all-time great scripts or a great story and iconic characters better look elsewhere. This said, the script is not all bad, but does have some cheesiness that will make one cringe, regardless of whether they are demanding much or not. The story and characterisation is somewhat more patchy though better than given credit for, the story does absorb but a couple of the subplots are silly and don't feel as resolved as they should, particularly that for the rival gang.<br/><br/>One of 'Saturday Night Fever's' biggest problems is how the character of Stephanie is written and how Karen Lynn Gorney plays her. The character is very underwritten and often very annoying, giving Gorney little to do and failing to inject much charm or likability, outside of some great dancing.<br/><br/>However, the production values are great with lots of glorious colour and style. John Bradham directs with a clear affectionate love for the period and subject, and the film does offer a more complex view of disco than one might think with some easy to relate to themes.<br/><br/>Best assets are the music, dancing and John Travolta. The soundtrack, with some of the most memorable contributions being from the Bee Gees, is one of the best, most unforgettable and iconic soundtracks of any film from the 70s, and great music in its own right. Music is a real passion and something that is always talked about in my prolific reviews here, and something that mostly garners a lot of praise but have also been known to be picky. The dancing is full of high-octane energy, snazz and pizazz, Travolta especially though the dancing is the best thing about Gorney's performance.<br/><br/>John Travolta is a revelation in the role that made him an overnight star and pop-culture icon. Danny from 'Grease' may be the slightly more famous role but to me Travolta is better here.<br/><br/>In conclusion, very enjoyable though not without its imperfections. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","This movie is not mainly about disco, it's just a setting for the characters.<br/><br/>Disco was fun, people were dancing and having fun, the 70's was probably more fun for most people because of it. You didn't have to like disco to go to a disco to be social and interact with people, but disco made that widely popular. Some of you reading this now probably owe your very existence to disco.<br/><br/>A lot of hate came from people who preferred rock, they were scared rock would vanish and be replaced by disco. But they didn't realize it would wear itself out on its own, just like rock has today. There are no real rock songs tearing up the charts now.<br/><br/>This movie was basically a classic from the moment it opened. The characters, the setting and the dialogue are up there with some of the best 70's movies. You can't fault a great movie for the era it takes place in. If you have never seen it because of some hang up like this, do yourselves a favor and see it. You may change your mind."

","This is a really unique film. Because it comes out of the disco era (which seems like a hundred years ago) some don't take it seriously. While I hated most of the music, I did like the Bee Gees and was intrigued by the knock down performance of John Trovolta. He is a man of arrogance and assuredness who dominates a subculture. A paint store worker by day, he lives for dancing, and he's darn good at it. He and his lackeys live a life of pain and violence. Women are at Tony's feet and he can do what he wants. What it is really about is a psyche that is so fragile. Those that admire Trovolta's character don't have the same ability to stand alone and some, one in particular, is on the brink. This is a slice of time that has past, but the quality of the film is excellent and will survive."
"Red-Barracuda","9","1","2","24 October 2016"," Excellent urban drama that is far more confrontational than many assume
","Saturday Night Fever is a film whose image and reputation suggests something very different to what it turns out to be. It often sort of gets associated with John Travolta's other music themed blockbuster from the time, namely 1978's mega-hit Grease. But the similarities between the two are frankly entirely superficial, as where Grease is a feel-good musical that looks back nostalgically on a bygone era, Saturday Night Fever is a gritty urban drama with a music back-drop that takes a decidedly unglamorous contemporary look at the lives of a group of young city youths. Part of the reason folks sometimes forget SNF's true form is that a heavily circulated PG version of the film was released in cinemas very soon after its extremely popular soundtrack started selling millions, the idea being that loads of youngsters would flock to see this Travolta disco movie that was being promoted via the music charts with a constant string of smash hits. And the studio was right of course, so much so that this censored version even played TV for a good number of years too. So much so, I have to admit to being a little surprised when I finally saw the original version which had drug taking, some extremely frank sexual scenes, bloody violence and dialogue with healthy amounts of racist terms and full-on swearing. Needless to say, this original raw version is much preferable and makes for a tough and interesting bit of unsentimental drama.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, this was definitely the film that firmly put John Travolta on the map. His performance as Tony Manero is one of the most iconic of the 70's. This was the Brooklyn kid who isn't too bright and has a dead end existence, whose life is one of humiliations and restrictions. But due to his skills on the dance-floor of his local discotheque he is treated like a god. It's in many ways a coming-of-age story about a young man imprisoned by his environment and friends. It paints a very gritty portrait of 70's NYC and the young Italian-Americans at the centre of the story. It doesn't even glorify the disco era or experience, suggesting in fact that there were a good many unsavoury elements to that also. All these reasons make for a fairly complex and unpredictable drama with all characters having many flaws and feeling all the more real because of them.<br/><br/>It was also, for better or for worse, the film that moved disco from the underground to the mainstream. The soundtrack album sold astronomical numbers of records. The Bee Gees contributed four classic tracks, ""Stayin' Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and ""More Than a Woman"", all of which are integrated into the film very well. Obviously, the songs work well alongside the celebrated dance routines but, more importantly, the music was mixed in very well generally into the flow of what is contrastingly an often quite grim and confrontational drama. All-in-all, this is a film which would probably appeal to a lot of people who would never expect to like it in the first place, on the other hand it will also be too much of a downer for quite a lot of folks who think it's going to be right up their alley. Saturday Night Fever is certainly a film that will continue to confound a lot of expectations and its all the better for that."

","If I was honest I should admit this is one of my all time favorite films. But understand I also realize this movie is hopelessly dated and some elements of the plot may not work as well in hind site. Having said that I still believe if you take into consideration the impact and influence this film had and still has, the fact that it is linked to an era in film that is largely considered fantastic, and lastly that it contains perhaps the most impressive acting debut for a lead in history and you have a stone cold classic.<br/><br/>The music is also very much of its time, and in its time it was hugely successful. If one wanted to be transported back to 1978 this is its soundtrack. But the way the film uses music is in my opinion unique in that its not a musical in the traditional sense- nobody breaks into song mid-scene. However the music is organic to the story of how this young man comes of age and begins to realize the imprisonment of his friends,of his family, and of his environment.<br/><br/>Another thing about this movie that I have long admired is how the story is told. This is one gritty urban tale and it captured NYC circa 1977 perfectly. Forget the disco, this is the era of Son of Sam and blackouts, and as a lover of NYC I gotta say I love seeing the trash and the graffiti everywhere. The script by Wexler is authentic and bites. But most of all the simple motif of escaping an environment is a passage that is incredibly profound and not explored often enough. Who cannot relate in some way to that.<br/><br/>Bottom line this is a classic very much rooted in its place in time. Saturday Night Fever deserves its place as one of the best films of the 1970s. And that was one hell of an era to be one of the best films in."

"asda-man","6","1","2","6 August 2012"," Surprisingly deep toe-tapping drama
","I thought that Saturday Night Fever was an OK film. It's not one of the best ever despite its iconic moments and having John Travolta perfect;y cast in the role as Tony Manero. I admired the films guts, that it didn't turn into some fluffy rom-com, like Flashdance and it could've quite easily followed that formulaic route. Instead we're given a protagonist who a lot of the time isn't at all likable with his womanising and compassionate-less state. The film gives an in-depth view into his dysfunctional family life. Tony Manero is a well thought out and realised character. Unfortunately little characterisation is given to his friends, although they mostly appear the same as him.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever really scores points in its atmosphere though. Once we enter the 2001 Odyssey the atmosphere is quite infectious with its vibrant flashing lights and sometimes hypnotic camera movements. I thought that the film would be too dance-heavy and whilst some of the dancing did go on for too long it was actually quite a joy to watch. It's easy to see why John Travalto's mesmerising dance solo has gone on to become iconic.<br/><br/>However, I did feel that the film took a disliking to women due to male dominance. Tony's love interest isn't explored in enough depth and the film has some serious pacing issues. Sometimes it loses its focus by getting too into a sub-plot that doesn't require that much attention. I think that the film should've primarily focused on winning the dance trophy, but once the final came I didn't feel excited like I did for the Nina's opening night in Black Swan, and I should've done! The final 15-20 minutes are quite gripping though and very upsetting. The film reaches even grittier territory that I found hard-hitting. I admire it for that. And although in the end it did reach some sort of cosy ending, I thought it was believable and quite touching. Saturday Night Fever features a fantastic soundtrack, brilliant directing and excellent characterisation on Tony Manero, but in the end it lacks focus and drags in places. I didn't enjoy it any where near as much as a Chilean film called ""Tony Manero"" which grippingly follows a Chilean man who has a disturbing obsession with Saturday Night Fever. I'd recommend seeing that under-rated gem instead."

","The rap on SNF today is that it is dated. The music, the dance moves, the clothes, and this supposedly detracts from the film. Personally I don't get this, every film that is about a specific place and time ends up 'dated'. Some even start out that way. If a movie was made today in 2012, about the disco scene from the mid 70's, wouldn't they use similar music, dance moves and fashions as SNF does? The 'dated' complaint is senseless, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever begins with a lot of visceral energy as we learn about Tony Manero and his obsession with disco dancing and hanging with his lower class Italian crew. There is a vibrancy to the film that jumps off the screen. As the thin plot unwinds, some of the energy unwinds with it. <br/><br/>There is a raw appeal to the street milieu that carries us through some of the more pedestrian scenes and conversations, but as expected, it is when the music is playing and the feet are moving that Saturday Night Fever comes alive."

This is hands down the iconic disco movie, and it will always have value as a time capsule both into disco culture itself and one of the biggest movies of that time period.<br/><br/>As a movie, though, it isn't quite a classic for anything but its iconic pop culture status. We meet Travolta's Tony Manero, a working-class Italian-American with a passion for dancing, who initially seems okay with his lifestyle working in a hardware store in the old neighborhood and being the king of his ethnic neighborhood's local disco, as well as ringleader of a group of friends who obviously idolize him.<br/><br/>Everything starts to unravel when he meets Stephanie, a dancing queen who is trying to make it out of the old neighborhood and succeed in Manhattan which, as the characters remark, seems like a different world even though it's just across the river. Stephanie turns Tony's world on its head by using him as a dancing partner only and refusing him romance, which was how Tony was used to treating women prior to meeting Stephanie. Smitten, Tony starts to have doubts about his lifestyle, and grows annoyed with his job, his family and his friends.<br/><br/>The movie has a few problems. It's almost a movie about someone becoming disillusioned with disco, which is a strange plot direction for a movie called ""Saturday Night Fever"". For a movie that's remembered as a high note of disco culture, it's actually pretty lukewarm on the whole thing and almost downplays any potential excitement the characters might be feeling, any ""fever"", rather than trying to highlight it.<br/><br/>Side-stories are awkwardly developed - Tony's brother quits the priesthood and expresses his crisis of faith, a clear prelude to Tony's own problems, but it just didn't seem to have been handled particularly well, Tony doesn't even seem to care particularly much when it happens. What's more, someone losing their faith in god is the opening act to someone losing their faith in disco? It's rather shallow when you deconstruct it. Aside from his brother, Tony's family and friends never even move past being one-dimensional, limiting any emotional impact the movie might have.<br/><br/>Although they deal with different time periods and cultures, I think an apt comparison here is ""American Graffiti"", which was made within a few years and dealt with the same general topic of post-high school teenagers trying to figure out their future amid a hang-out culture. ""American Graffiti"" offered much more depth and genuinely interesting characters and situations, highlighting the areas where ""Saturday Night Fever"" falls short.<br/><br/>This isn't to say ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a bad movie. Travolta's acting is iconic and memorable, the choreography is fun, the music, sets and costumes obviously have a lot of nostalgic appeal, and the story isn't bad or void of meaning, it just doesn't rise to the level of great storytelling. And, as opposed to many movies about a specific culture or lifestyle, everyone I've talked to who ""was there"" agrees that this movie is pretty accurate in its depiction of the northeast's disco culture in the late 1970s.<br/><br/>It's a good time capsule, but unfortunately falls short of being a great movie."

","Saturday Night Fever (1977)<br/><br/>Hey, there's John Travolta dancing and looking cute, and there's a simple look at urban Italian life without the mob in the 1970s, and there is some disco inferno. What more do you want?<br/><br/>Hopefully not much, because there is a thin plot, some truly forgettable acting (except for Travolta, who is spot on for this kind of flick), and even the functional details like camera-work and editing are dull as milk. The lights dazzle at times, but don't confuse that with good filming. And the soundtrack, of course--there is the core of the movie, the defining disco sound of mainstream America. <br/><br/>But hey, there's John Travolta, and dancing. Turn it up."

","This was John Travolta's first big step from being a ""sweathog"" on Welcome Back Kotter. It was promo-ed with a lot of studio hype with a disco beat in the middle of 1977 disco-mania across the country. The big part of the promotion was Travolta on the fancy dance floor with the strobe lights.<br/><br/>Unless you like disco, & that sequence. you will find the rest of the movie is forgettable. There is little to recommend it either though at least Vinnie Barbrino got to escape from Kotter's series. I don't know what it was but Marcia Strassman is still my vote for the worst looking sitcom wife. Even when she did Honey I Shrunk The Kids later, I never can picture her as an attractive woman.<br/><br/>As long as you like John & that dance sequence this movie is for you. If you don't like either thing, I'd not waste my time as the rest of the movie is nothing worth watching. I am not even sure if this mess has a plot."

","Rated R for strong language, sexuality/nudity, drug content and some violence.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever was John Travolta's breakthrough film.After this film and Grease, he would not be famous again until Pulp Fiction in 1994.There are two versions of Saturday Night Fever.The original R-rated version and an edited PG version which is hard to find on VHS(not released on DVD) but is the one which is used for the edited for TV version of Fever.It is cut by approx 6min.Anyway Travolta's acting is very good in this film and the storyline is pretty good as well.A bit boring at times but the soundtrack is excellent.I actually bought the soundtrack a couple of years ago.The film is about a young man living in Brooklyn.Everyday, him and his friends go to a disco to hang around and dance.Travolta is a very good disco dancer.One day him and this girl he likes try to win the dance competition which is being held there.Saturday NIght Fever is an interesting film which portrays disco in the 1970's.This is actually the film which helped popularize disco.Worth watching."
"ykornblum","10","1","2","16 December 2006"," One of the all time great movies
","Great story great music great and believable acting. All around great movie.<br/><br/>People in all over the world can understand such movie. It has a cross cultural flavor in the sense that the experiences and the types of characters that are depicted in the movie are found in all cultures. So it is easy for any viewer in any place to understand the message of the movie and related to their own experience in their own culture. The details of the experience may vary from culture to culture but in every culture the experience is the same and this universality is what this movie depicts so nicely. The naivety of the characters give the story and the acting a great measure of credibility and makes this move so believable.<br/><br/>The music and dancing are so great and so alive. You fill like dancing with music. The songs are great and most of them made the top charts and the Bee Gees in this movie are exceptionally great."
"Doylenf","6","1","2","9 October 2006"," Disco movie gave Travolta his shot at fame...
","For disco fans, ""Saturday Night Fever"" must be like going to heaven. It's only when JOHN TRAVOLTA, as Tony from Brooklyn, is doing his thing on the dance floor (energetic, dazzling twirls, leaps and steps lit by rosy glows of strobe lights) that it really comes alive. The story itself is rather mundane, about an arrogant boy's restless search for something to do on week-ends to get away from his everyday living in a Brooklyn tenement.<br/><br/>But when the Bee Gees music is in full blast and JOHN TRAVOLTA shows the Brooklyn gang what he can do on a dance floor (in that white suit), we can see the kind of immediate appeal this film had in the midst of the Disco Era. You might call it a microcosm of the '70s craze for this kind of dance music.<br/><br/>All of the scenes capture New York City nicely (especially those bridge scenes at night), but there's nothing deep here in exploring Tony and his restless energy while he seems to be a loser at love and finding himself. Nor are his friends anything more than cardboard cutouts of stereotypes we've all seen before, most of them with accents even stronger than Tony's and somewhat dumber, some of them yearning for jobs and a little respectability.<br/><br/>Summing up: Great for Travolta fans, all others beware, it may not be your kind of music--or film."
"paul2001sw-1","6","1","2","26 September 2006"," Saturday Night Sharking
","The career of John Travolta has had many ups and downs, but 'Saturday Night Fever'as where it really took off for the first time. The film is many things: a portrait of archetypal young people growing up under the influence of music (not unlike 'American Graffiti'); the story of a dance competition (like the later 'Simply Ballroom', although without that movie's wild comedy); and a portrait of New York's Italian community in the 1970s. One of the delights of this film is that Travolta's character is supposed to be cool, according to the standards of the time; but certain details now seem very dated, and one of the scenes set in a supposedly trendy club actually appears to demonstrate a form of line-dancing! There are subtleties here perhaps unexpected in a mainstream film, especially in the way the attitude of the male protagonists is at first apparently celebrated, but gradually revealed as atrociously misogynist; our attitude shifts with Travolta's, as his character grows up. As a pure dance movie, 'Simply Ballroom' is far more entertaining; but the edge of social, and human, realism raises this movie above the average modern Hollywood hit."
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","2","26 August 2006"," Dancing Revelation
","As the film opened with John Travolta coolly walking down the street in his posh gear with background music, 'Staying alive' playing I knew this was going to be a great period classic. We all have feelings about films and straight away from the chilled upbeat music I knew why older audiences talk highly over this period musical drama.<br/><br/>The unknown artist at the time, Travolta laid down his mark in film history by playing the part of the central protagonist Tony Manero, an upbeat but concerned character who has troubles with his family and friends but releases his stress on the dance floor.<br/><br/>The main reason why this film was captivating was the slickness of the character. His joyous upbeat character is convincing but viewers can associate with the stress he is going through to. Travolta's dancing is terrific. His movements on the dance floor are enjoyable and energetic. Seeing him in one of his best performances has inspired me to be more involved with the dancing industry.<br/><br/>Has Travolta ever topped this performance? Pulp Fiction and Grease people may argue but he is convincing as the slick styled emotionally paranoid character but this is certainly one of the best, if not the best.<br/><br/>Juxtaposing Travolta with Karen Lynn Gorney was a very effective method to bring a sociable element to the 1977 classic. His relationship on stage with Lynn Gorney is terrific as the pair performance brilliantly together, expressing their own opinions and dancing with their heart and souls on their sleeves.<br/><br/>The film really captures the essence of the late 70's where dancing was all a rage and meant something, unfortunately unlike today where dancing has become as influential as Travolta's recent performances e.g. 'Be Cool and 'The Punisher'.<br/><br/>The film is successful because of its phenomenal soundtrack. With such classics as 'Stayin Alive', 'Night Fever', 'Disco Inferno' and 'More than a woman' plus many others, it's a dancing revelation and is too likable to be hated.<br/><br/>The mode of address is well developed to captivate the late 70's. The classic suits, the discos, and the cars and buildings to conform to the rough surroundings and create a very effective mise en scene.<br/><br/>Its all about the beginning and getting 'Into the groove' and getting to know the different opinions from the parents and late teens about dancing and through this method of arguing and debates the film expresses emotional ideologies and viewers can associate their own views with the characters.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was fast flowing with different ideologies about dancing, families and work very convincing in short scenes. Though the whole film is like that I personally felt the latter stages of the film were over done with too much conversation at times but its minimal criticism for a film that is very emotional but truly conforming to different ideas and is therefore a much watch for anyone."
"Travis_Bickle01","6","1","2","22 September 2005"," It's time for some disco dancing
","""Saturday Night Fever"" is a movie about the glorious disco-years during the seventies. The movie is seen as a classic but I don't think it's worth it. The story is very average and it isn't very deep or original either. The male lead is for John Travolta who is the star of the local disco, named Tony Manero.<br/><br/>I love John Travolta. He was brilliant in ""Grease"" and many other movies, like ""Pulp Fiction"", but I don't understand why he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Tony Manero. His performance wasn't bad, but it wasn't an amazing performance either. Furthermore it wasn't a difficult part.<br/><br/>The dancing was good but not breathtaking. If you want to see a good dance-movie, I advice you to see ""Grease"" or ""Dirty Dancing"". These are two timeless classics, but unfortunately ""Saturday Night Fever"" isn't. Of course, the two other movies aren't disco-movies, so if you want a movie about disco-dancing, you should see ""Saturday Night Fever"". It's good and enjoyable but not great. Not an Oscar-worthy performance either. For me, it was somewhat disappointing and cheap. It had high expectations who weren't fulfilled at all.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"fatleprechan","10","1","2","3 July 2005"," Not just Real Disco, Saturday Night Fever' is a Real Good Story'
","From the classic opening scene when a young paint store worker struts down the Brooklyn street with a bucket of latex, to the stirring BeeGees rendition of 'Staying Alive, you know that director John Badham's Saturday Night Fever' has attitude. And attitude would seem to be just what you'd need to succeed in a place like New York. It's the story of Tony Manero. An Oscar nominated performance by then teen idol John Travolta. Who was the star of the popular TV sitcom 'Welcome Back Kotter' Manero, although languishing in a minimum wage job during the day, takes over the dance floor at the local disco by night. He is the king and an icon to his loudmouthed and juvenile friends. Who all seem to be on a road to nowhere. As pointed out to him by his new love interest Stephanie ( Portrayed by Karen Lynn Gorney ) The problem with this love interest is that she's not all that interested in him, Unlike his drooling groupies at the 2001 Disco. (Which was actually filmed inside the famous studio 54 ) And this causes Manero to stop and think that his life may be headed down a dead end street as well. This picture is not just you're mindless dance romp. Travolta creates a character who is totally believable. He makes you think that Manero is as crude as his idiotic friends. But it's the great way Travolta emotes and you can see on his face what's going on in his character's mind. It's still his best performance to this date. There are plenty of moral implications and concerns. Manero's brother is/was a priest, who returns home to their Italian parents to break the news to them that he's lost the faith. One of Tony's friends has gotten his girlfriend pregnant and is pressured to marry her by both sets of parents as well as his local priest. You can see just that little trace of the 1950's morality still remaining in the disco era society. Today, almost thirty years later. A single mother does not wear the same scarlet letter as she did even then. And recent revelations of child molestation in the Catholic church would probably make a family weary of being related to a priest rather than proud of the fact. But it's fun seeing the disco era as it really was instead of some cheesy imitation. If I had one problem with the film it would be with Gorney. Stephanie tells Tony and his friends that she's 'Only twenty' Yet at the time of the filming Gorney was thirty one. And she really does seem and look too old for the roll. As my father so crudely pointed out. 'You can't make a woman's ass that's thirty one look twenty.' But she can do the scenes. At one point after her and Tony meets her old boyfriend, she is reduced to tears by his jealous barbs. Gorney does fine work in this scene and you can feel the strain. Maybe that's what they were thinking when they cast her. That and the fact that she has a great Brooklyn accent. While the film has a great story with a little bit of everything. The music really is special. The soundtrack, which was dominated by the BeeGees, is the very cornerstone of the disco craze. When Tony and Stephanie ultimately dance to their 'More Than a Woman' a truly great song. To Badham's half fast half slow motion direction. The results are pure bliss. Actually the whole film is charming and fascinating, and I believe extremely underestimated. 'Saturday Night Fever' is about life. About difficult choices and conflicting voices. About growing up and having the courage to chase what you want. And it sounds and looks beautiful. Whether you like dancing or not, this movie's for everyone 10 out of a possible 10 T.H."
"grahamsj3","6","1","2","8 March 2005"," Big, but only so-so
","Anyone living in the 70's saw this film, either at the theater (as I did originally) or later, on video (as I have also done). This film gave the world a new type of music that was hugely popular - that being, of course, disco. The Bee Gees, a struggling trio, revived their careers with disco. Other musicians made it big in disco. The music was, I believe, this film's strength. The acting was decent, but not great. The story, with variations, has been done ad nauseum. I thought some of the dialog was poorly written, stereotypical and condescending. There is a sense of desperation to ""make their mark"" among the young people in the film that was pretty well portrayed. The dancing is pretty good, if you like that sort of thing (I don't, really). However, the rest of the film just doesn't have anything going for it. I think this is a decent flick but has a weak story with fair acting. Overall, not too bad, but hugely overrated, in my opinion."
"MovieLuvaMatt","9","1","2","10 May 2004"," Definitely lives up to the hype!
","This was my first time watching the movie, and I was more than impressed!  I was curious about checking it out, since I love the music that the movie is associated with and I like John Travolta.  But aside from the great music and Travolta's winning performance, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a realistic, well-written, character-driven film that is unlike no other.  Travolta's character isn't perfectly sympathetic, but there's nothing wrong with that. He still has a very human side to him that he's simply afraid to show since he grew up in a tough part of Brooklyn, surrounded by the unrelenting machismo (and misogynism) of his closest friends.  I kept getting frustrated whenever he wouldn't agree to go out with Donna Pescow's character, who is likable and pretty, but it made sense in terms of his character's motivations.  With many movies nowadays that involve a guy pursuing a girl who is out of his league while giving the cold shoulder to the girl who has wanted him along, the guy eventually falls in love with the latter girl.  It makes the audience happy, under most circumstances, but that's not how it always goes in real life.  This movie doesn't contain any sentimental contrivances, and ends on a tragic note.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this was a landmark film of the 70's, I don't feel it has shown its age.  I enjoyed the dance sequences, mostly featuring the great songs of The Bee Gees.  And though Travolta was a sex symbol during this decade, he showed that he was much more than a pretty face.<br/><br/>My score:  9 (out of 10)"
"rbverhoef","8","1","2","27 June 2003"," Could have been great
","My favorite dance sequence in the movies is Jack Rabbit Slim's Twist Contest from 'Pulp Fiction'. Probably the next ten favorites are from 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever'. They all have one thing in common: John Travolta. Where 'Pulp Fiction' was also great without that sequence, 'Grease' and 'Saturday Night Fever' are not. 'Grease' has so much singing and dancing that it is a lot of fun anyway and unfortunately 'Saturday Night Fever' has not. It is not that the rest of the movie is bad. It is all entertaining and pretty good, especially the ending is satisfying, but it could have been great instead of good. Cool guy John Travolta, the disco dancing and the great songs from the Bee Gees together are still a lot of fun."

","SNF really brings back memories. Recently, I got the DVD for Christmas (the only thing I wanted). I thought I would watch it with my kids, but quickly nixed that idea after the first round of graphic sexual scenes and pungent expletives. (I was 13 in 1977, when this definitive 70's movie came out, so I was a disco wannabe and only remember seeing it as a PG-13 movie. I honestly think it could do with a NC-17 rating in its rerelease instead of the fairly tame R-rating. )<br/><br/>After sending the kids out (they love the opening ""Stayin' Alive"" sequence), I fell in love again, with the music (okay, like the Bee Gees are my absolute favorite group of all time), with John Travolta (my husband has a cleft in his chin, too), and all the generation-defining disco dancing. The Bee Gees have always been my favorite group (because of their work on this film), and I have a 25-year-old original soundtrack LP to prove it, so even though I never set foot in a disco, I feel I was really part of the disco generation. And, now, disco music (and weird 70's clothes) is cool and hip again (although I promised my tweens I'd never say either ""cool"" or ""hip"" again - sorry).<br/><br/>For those of you who think disco sucks, too bad - you're simply out of fashion - disco is back, man. My kids love the soundtrack, too.<br/><br/>
And, in addition to all my posters of John Travolta, the Bee Gees, and Princess Diana (yes, loved her, too - great when they danced together at the White House), irony of ironies, I own the greatest, most obscure (and probably the most common) piece of movie trivia - a 2001 Odyssey (Honda).<br/><br/>I think all who love this movie should get together and watch it in unison every Saturday night a la ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" and all act out the parts.

I finally find some time and rent the movie! As I sat watching it for the first few minutes, as the movie opened with John Travolta doing his little funky walk thingy to the paint store with the Bee Gees music in the background, it seemed like it was going to be a good movie. But, and please don't sue me after I say this--the rest of the movie was just pretty downhill from there.<br/><br/>Yeah, sure, you could say ""What about all those great dance moves John Travolta did on the floor??"" or ""Don't forget that romantic scene with Toni and Stephanie dancing in the studio!"" or something like that. Well, I myself have never really been the romantic type, and some of the dance scenes were just....well...I just didn't like them. They either went on too long or were kina cheesy, ya know?? I have nothing against John Travolta--he's a very good actor and played his part well in this movie--but I wouldn't say that this was the best of his films. I mean, some parts were too confusing or too boring or too cheesy. I really don't get that part where Toni and his pals all go and get busted up at that Chinese restaurant, or whatever. Plus, what's this bridge deal got to do with anything? See how confused I already am?! :-)<br/><br/>Another thing is that some parts of ""Saturday Night Fever"" were just unenjoyable to watch. I wanted to watch the movie with a member of my family or someone, and, well, frankly, I'm *glad* I didn't. And does every other sentence really have to have the F word in it? It gets kind of old after a while, people.<br/><br/>Well, I just want to say that I really don't like this movie at all, and think it hasn't really lived up to what everybody says about it. Like I said, I have nothing against John Travolta or any of the actors/actresses in this movie. Writers, maybe, but actors, no. Maybe I'm just keeping my expectations too high. Maybe I just don't know a good movie when I see one. But I think that if it weren't for the great Bee Gees soundtrack, I would ditch this movie altogether."

The idiot who grows up (a little) storyline just doesn't hold much interest. Every aspect of this study of 70s meathead priorities is grotesque; unsubtle stereotypes, travolta in a speedo, hideous chicks, fried hair, terrible dancing, people who couldn't find a beat if you were pounding them with a hammer. <br/><br/>This is like junior Scorcese.

","Think about the mid to late 1970s and you'll think about this movie . It's a film that changed western culture and that is no exaggeration . The OST sold tens of millions of copies , turned the almost forgotten Bee Gees into superstars , inspired Jerry Brukheimer to make films where the soundtrack was the most important aspect and gave us the striking image of an Italian American in a white suit strutting his stuff across the dance floor . It's a movie I've seen parodied a million times in other films and TV shows but one I had never seen until tonight . Sorry to say this but apart from marrying cinema and popular music into one there's little artistic worth to it <br/><br/>It's a very flawed film because it's a very unfocused one . What is the main plot about ? Is it about Italian-American Values ? Is it about religious pressure versus indiviualism ? Is it about gang warfare ? Or is it simply about trying to get ahead in life ? All these issues are explored in a series of subplots but I'm vaguely at a loss trying to decide what the main story is about . It's by no means as confused and rambling as THE DEER HUNTER but like so many films from this period you are left with a feeling that there's a lack of concentration in the production . Say what you like about Jerry Bruckheimer ( And if you say he's out to make a fast buck I'll agree with you ) but his he knows what type of market he's going for whilst the original SNF was re-released a few months later in a PG version so that young teenagers could flock to the cinema to watch it .

","I had always seen the clips of this film, it is obviously best known for the soundtrack and the dance sequences, to be honest this is all I remembered from the two or three times I had watched it before, but there is more to it than that, directed by John Badham (Dracula, WarGames, Short Circuit). Basically, Anthony ""Tony"" Manero (Oscar nominated John Travolta) is a 19-year-old Italian American from the Bay Ridge neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York. He has a dead-end job working in a small hardware store and lives with his parents, Flo (Julie Bovasso) and Frank Sr. (Val Bisoglio), grandmother (Nina Hansen), and younger sister, Linda (Lisa Peluso). To escape his day-to-day life, Tony goes to 2001 Odyssey, a local disco club, where every Saturday he is king of the dance floor and receives the admiration and respect he longs for. Tony has four close friends: Joey (Joseph Cali), Double J (Paul Pape), Gus (Bruce Ornstein), and Bobby C (Barry Miller). Tony and his friends ritually stop on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to clown around. Tony agrees partner with neighbourhood girl Annette (Donna Pescow), who longs for a more sexual relationship with him, in an upcoming dance contest. But her happiness is short-lived when Tony is mesmerized by another woman at the club, Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney), whose dancing skills are most impressive. Although Stephanie rejects Tony's advances, she eventually agrees to be his partner in the dance competition, provided that their partnership remains professional. Tony's older brother, Frank Jr. (Martin Shakar), was the pride of the family since becoming a Roman Catholic priest. But he upsets his parents and grandmother when he tells them he has quit the priesthood. Tony supports his decision, after Frank Jr. tells him that he never wanted to be a priest and only did it to make their parents happy. Tony brings Frank Jr. with him to the club, and after witnessing his talent on the dancefloor, he suggests that he should do something with his dancing. While on his way home from the grocery store, Gus is attacked by a gang and hospitalised. Meanwhile, Bobby C has been trying to get out of his relationship with his devout Catholic girlfriend, Pauline, who is pregnant with his child. Bobby asks Frank Jr. if he should ty and get the girlfriend to get an abortion or if he should marry her. Frank is unsure how to answer, his faith is tested, and Bobby's feelings of desperation increase. Eventually, the group gets their revenge on the Barracudas, the gang that Gus said attacked him, crashing Bobby C's car into their hangout. Tony, Double J, and Joey get out of the car to fight, but Bobby C runs away. When the group visits Gus in the hospital, they are angry when he tells them that he may have identified the wrong gang. Later, Tony and Stephanie dance at the competition, with a slow love-themed disco dance, and end up winning first prize. However, Tony believes that a Puerto Rican couple, performing a more energetic routine, were better, and that the judges' decision was racially motivated. He gives the Puerto Rican couple his trophy and reward money and leaves with Stephanie. Once outside in a car, Tony tries to force himself on Stephanie, but she resists and runs from him. Tony's friends later arrive with an intoxicated Annette. Joey says she has agreed to have sex with everyone, Tony is not interested, but Double J and Joey date-rape her. Bobby C pulls the car over on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge for their usual cable-climbing antics. Bobby performs stunts more recklessly than the rest of the gang; Tony tries to get him to come down. Bobby's strong sense of despair has driven him to his drunken state, and he initially felt suicidal, he ends up slipping and falling to his death in the water below. Disgusted and disillusioned by his friends, his family, and his life, Tony spends the rest of the night riding the subway into Manhattan. When morning dawns, Tony arrives at Stephanie's apartment. He apologises for his bad behaviour, telling her that he plans to relocate from Brooklyn to Manhattan to try and start a new life. Tony and Stephanie salvage their relationship and agree to be friends.

Featuring the Bee Gees songs: ""Stayin' Alive"" (number 9 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), ""Night Fever"", ""You Should Be Dancing"", ""More Than a Woman"" (also featuring the Tavares version) and ""How Deep Is Your Love"" (nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song). Also featuring ""A Fifth of Beethoven"" by Walter Murphy, ""Disco Inferno"" by The Trammps and ""If I Can't Have You"" by Yvonne Elliman. Travolta (the year before he was cast in Grease) gives a terrific performance, and for a short time he was a superstar and pop icon. It is a very simple story, a young man escaping the harsh realities of his bleak life by strutting his stuff at weekends on the dancefloor, the gritty material away from the disco is mixed, with difficult subjects tackled. As mentioned before, the most memorable scenes are indeed the dance sequences, some party-poopers may find the 1970s time period naff and cringeworthy, but you cannot argue that the choreography, costumes and use of colour for the disco sequences are splendid, all in all a most interesting dance musical drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for the Bee Gees and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy and Best Original Score for the Bee Gees. The Original Movie Soundtrack album was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Albums, John Travolta was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 38 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was also number 46 on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, it was number 68 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 83 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!"

","Cutting right to the chase. The movie is alright if a tad boring in sections due to overly long dance scenes. Great atmosphere- I especially loved the scenes with Tony at home struggling to communicate with his family as tensions arise.
I would be willing to give this movie a light 7- were it not for the infamous ending.
Perhaps audiences in 1977 were more okay with seeing rape on the cinema screen- but it does not sit well in 2020.
Spoilers ahead:
Literally twenty minutes from the end, Tony attempts to rape Stephanie in the back of a car. Not two minutes later his friends bring a drugged girl named Annette to the backseat and rape her one at a time.
Both scenes are incredibly hard to watch- I found myself having to cover my ears so as not to hear the screams and cries of the women.
The scenes add absolutely nothing to the story, by the way.<br/><br/>The worst part?
Tony meets with Stephanie the very next day and apologizes. For attempted rape.
And she accepts his apology.<br/><br/>Watch the PG version, the movie's surely better without it."

","What a miserable film! I was in the ""Disco Sucks"" crowd in highschool and never did get around to watching this iconic film. Funny thing, though I am still not a fan of disco, the club scenes were the about the only watchable part of this dark, weak plotted flick. Only the soundtrack and the funky dance scenes made it
bearable. Good enough opening scene then the film takes a nosedive. After we were a third of the way through, the discussion was should we bother to finish this miserable flick or not. Every other word was the F-er and the fast forward came in handy all too often for the adult film , foulness, misogyny, violence and sleaze. I felt like I needed to take a shower after all the raunch. Every character creeped me out; not one to root for. They all could have jumped off the bridge at the end, I wouldn't of cared. Cool dance moves in a otherwise boring, pointless and nauseating film."

","This movie is part of pop culture, and I had always heard about it, being hailed as a classic and a great showcase of the disco era. Though I was born after the disco era ended, I was always curious about it. With that in mind, I thought as a film fan I should check it out.<br/><br/>At first I was grooving to the music and was enjoying seeing all those classic and sometimes a bit chuckle inducing disco moves. It was interesting seeing the lifestyle of Tony and his friends, and him being an ""outsider"" trying to appeal to the more ""classy"" girl and make something of himself outside of his dead end job.<br/><br/>While watching, I saw so much that were remnants of a bygone era and would not fly today. From homophobia, to sexism and racism, and even rape that gets blamed on the girl and almost shrugged off. Now I'm not the SJW type, but these were definitely surprising to see in a movie that is so revered.<br/><br/>That's not my biggest complaint though. That would be the downer ending that leaves so much unresolved. In the end, this movie was a bit of fun, but it peaks around half way or so and goes progressively downhill as it goes on.<br/><br/>I'm glad I watched it because I no longer have to wonder any more, but it's not something I'd want to watch again.<br/><br/>The movie is a 6/10, but I gave it a 7 because of Travolta's dancing and acting, which elevated the movie."

","This cult disco movie, which made Travolta a star, talks about growing up in the working class and attempts to escape from mediocrity and pointlessness of everyday life, even if only on a Saturday night. The main character finds sanctuary in a discotheque, where he's undisputed king of the dance floor. Through film permeate many of the problems typical of the lower middle class, as well as disturbed relations between the sexes that are particularly noticeable in this environment. Although music and dance occupy a large part of the film, the ""Saturday Night Fever"" exudes the atmosphere of hopelessness.

However, I did find some of the commentary slightly offensive. Specifically comments made about African Americans and gay people. There is also a rape scene towards the end.

"Desertman84","7","1","3","1 October 2012"," A Dated Disco Movie
","Saturday Night Fever is a dance film directed by John Badham.It features John Travolta as Tony Manero, an immature young man whose weekends are spent visiting a local Brooklyn discothèque; Karen Lynn Gorney as his dance partner and eventual friend; and Donna Pescow as Tony's former dance partner and would-be girlfriend. Barry Miller,Paul Pape,Bruce Ornstein,Martin Shakar,Julie Bovasso and Fran Drescher play supporting roles.<br/><br/>The story is conventional.Tony Manero is a Brooklyn paint-store clerk who'd give anything to break out of his dead-end existence. In life, Tony is a peasant; on the disco dance floor, he's a king. As the soundtrack plays one Bee Gees hit after another, we watch white-suited Tony strut his stuff amidst flashing lights and sweaty, undulating bodies. Tony's class aspirations are mirrored in his relationship with his dance partner, Stephanie, a secretary eager to move into the glamorous world of Manhattan. <br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever's huge success grew meteorically thanks to the towering popularity of its soundtrack; during the first half of 1978, when the movie's disco songs saturated the singles charts up to four at a time, it was no longer clear whether the hit movie was feeding the hit songs or the hit songs were feeding the hit movie. This crossover between music and movies set the pace for many movies to come, as it also marked the rise and fall of 1970's disco culture.There's a lot in the movie that's sad and painful, but after a few years what you remember is John Travolta on the dance floor in that classic white disco suit, and the Bee Gees on the soundtrack.Obviously,one cannot dismiss its cultural significance, which today may be part of its campy appeal.Obviously,this is dated disco movie by today's standards."
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","3","6 July 2011"," The 70's youth needed a hero ... his name was Tony Manero ...
","Whenever you mention ""Saturday Night Fever"", the image that immediately pops in your mind is John Travolta's sensual hips moving on the disco floor, a black and white suit, a gold chain with a cross in a hairy chest while his index points to the top, like a religious prayer to be the one and only, the Holy Spirit that inhabits the dance floor.<br/><br/>Indeed, there is something divine whenever John Travolta moves. But it's like the film's iconic status distracted the viewers from Tony's complexities, as the movie was more an invitation to admire than to understand him, a shameful reality because he's probably one of the most fascinating and generation-defining characters of the 70's.<br/><br/>And the most defining scene is, in my opinion, the first one that sets the mood of the film, with Tony swaggering down the street, with the unique sound of the Bee Gees' ""Stayin' Alive"". His cocky demeanor says it all, you really can tell by the way he uses his walk, he's a woman's man. And his smile, the way he shows off is so communicative that you don't even pay attention to the paint bucket in his hand, and feel there is something behind that charisma. A young man like Tony can't exude such virile magnetism if he wasn't inhabited by a 'strange power'. But the movie is a character study, it takes its time, it builds up the personality of Tony Manero by showing his job, his family, his friends, with a realistic touch that would have made proud Martin Scorsese. The macho culture prevails during the Italian dinner, where Tony seems to be the lowest element in the family ladder, crystallizing the anger of his unemployed father and her mother, whose love is almost exclusively dedicated to her older son, Franck, the priest of the Family, and the only good model.<br/><br/>The irony in Tony is that he looks for models too, he idolizes charismatic figures like Bruce Lee, Al Pacino, or Rocky Balboa but outside the family, he's the idol, girls want to be with him and guys want to be him. And as the movie progresses, his interactions with all the supporting characters reveal a more complex side of his personality, he's more than a good dancer, a stud or a charming young man. Take the heart-breaking case of Annette for instance, she's so obsessed with Tony that she'd ultimately trade her self-esteem to go out, dance, have sex with him or his friends, to hurt him. The downfall of her pride is one of the sad back stories that enrich the film. But this is nothing compared to Joey who's cruelly portrayed as the anti-Tony Manero. He's shy, insecure, and his behavior and physical appearance diminish him even more. He's got a good-heart but cant find anyone to listen to him, to advise him, as the eternal good guy whose constant display of kindness earn him mockeries and pitiful indulgence. His tragic accidental death underlines the perverse side of the Brooklyn youth's life, leading to nowhere but frustration, and despair. When you know about Tony's environment, you definitely understand the deliverance incarnated by the dance floor.<br/><br/>Tony literally resurrects in his territory and no one can challenge him, except maybe Pauline, a remarkable dancer on whom he flashes during the first Saturday night, she'd be the perfect partner for the dance contest, but Tony is visibly looking for something more personal. Pauline is a public relations employee and reveals herself to be the sort of pain-in-the-ass know-it-all girl, that whenever she has the opportunity, starts bragging about which celebrity she met or which compliment she received, provoking a defensive reaction from Tony who can't stand this snobbish attitude. Pauline basically wants to show, Tony wants to prove something to himself, this is the torment he endures. It's not about pleasing an audience, your parents, your friends, it's about self-esteem, which he curiously lacks.<br/><br/>This irony is highlighted during the climactic sequence where, after a beautiful and romantic dance number, he and Pauline win, but despite the thunder of applauds, Tony hardly hides his disappointment as he knew the Puerto Ricans who danced after him did a better job. For Pauline, it doesn't matter; it's all about winning, showing. For Tony, winning must go along with deserving. This false victory is the proof of the hypocrisy that governs the rules, Tony won because he's the most charismatic, but he can't build anything on charisma, because it has nothing to do with his own merits. There's something profoundly romantic in Tony Manero, as the misunderstood guy who feels his popularity as painful weight on his shoulders that prevent him from improving himself. No one understood him, maybe not even some viewers who couldn't get why this guy isn't prouder of himself. I guess, because the character gains more maturity and realizes that it's easy to comfort yourself in a safe haven of popularity and get all the chicks, but nothing worth living for can be conquered easily.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Fever"" is a deep introspective film that conveys the existential state of the 70's youth through a fascinating character, who'll get you a better appreciation of John Travolta's acting talents in this deservedly Oscar nominated role. In the same time, the movie is so driven by the disco music that it aged a little, it has some flaws too, but the same kind that you'd find in Marty's ""Mean Streets"". Overall, ""Saturday night Fever"" deserves to be regarded as one of the greatest films of the 70's, and a classic among the classics.<br/><br/>And an iconic status that would inspire a parody only three years later in the hilarious ""Airplane!"", like so many great classics, ""Saturday Night Fever"" features images forever engraved in our memories, with, like Simon and Garfunkel for ""The Graduate"" 10 years before, a music that fits the spirit of the 70's like the white suit in Tony's gracious body."

"slokes","8","1","3","10 September 2005"," The Gospel According To Barry, Robin, Maurice & John
","""I got the wings of heaven on my shoes/I'm a dancin' man, and I just can't lose..."" More people know ""Saturday Night Fever"" for its soundtrack than the movie. Having been one of them, I can speak to how that can skew things negatively seeing the film for the first time. The music of ""Saturday Night Fever"" is shimmering, accessible disco music of high sophistication, an aural cocoon of positive vibes. The movie, by contrast, is harsh, nasty, vulgar, and dark.<br/><br/>Tony Manero, a kid of good instincts but mediocre intelligence, lives a life of quiet desperation, hanging around his low-life buddies and trolling after sex and various illicit thrills. He blows his small weekly wages for a brief spark of the divine, music that makes him a god, or at least an idol, to the others who come to his temple. ""Can I wipe your forehead?"" a woman asks, and as she does so it reminds one a little of Mary Magdalene washing Christ's feet.<br/><br/>Calling ""Saturday Night Fever"" a religious film feels like a stretch. If anything, the attitude of the film is fairly atheistic, especially in the way it mocks the piety of Tony's mother and showcases the fall of his brother the priest. Yet ""Saturday Night Fever"" is completely concerned with the question of transcendence, man's desire to achieve it and his inability to do so, using the grimy streets of Brooklyn as the reality and the music of the Bee Gees and other artists as the fantasy. The result is a cultural touchstone.<br/><br/>The music may be the best part of the film, but it works in unison with the narrative, right from the opening when a God's-eye view of Brooklyn descending from the clouds to the train tracks suddenly picks up ""Staying Alive"" in midbeat. When we first see Tony, in a brilliant sequence that merely involves him toting a paint can, the song's lyrics are already telling us his sad story, that this tough, chiseled character is struggling to stay alive, ""going nowhere"" in a big city with no one to help him. Bee Gees Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb almost merit co-screen writing credit, as they set a mood director John Badham and writer Norman Wexler weave throughout the film.<br/><br/>People who complain SNF is foul have a point; in isolation the soundtrack does nothing to prepare you for the language, casual sex, and racism presented matter-of-factly on screen. To me, it points again to the question of religion, and what people have if they don't have God. The answer, it seems, is music, and nothing else. It's either one of the most nihilistic or pro-religious messages ever put on screen. The fact I have no idea which it is makes it more interesting to me.<br/><br/>Another reason the film is so very good is John Travolta's breakout performance in the lead role. People talk about his dancing, and he's amazing especially when the floor opens up and lets him do a solo turn to ""You Should Be Dancing."" But his best dancing comes when he's acting. One moment his character is nobly refusing a prize he knows he didn't deserve. The next, he's assaulting a woman because he knows she doesn't want to have sex with him. The dark undercurrents with which Travolta imbues his character make such transitions not only believable but essential to the story.<br/><br/>I'm not completely sold on ""Saturday Night Fever."" The family scenes are annoyingly one-dimensional, for example. Like another bleak, pathbreaking film featuring a gang of toughs, ""The Wild Bunch,"" it's a film I respect more than enjoy.<br/><br/>But there's a lot of color and depth here. Those who say otherwise aren't watching it with both eyes open. I also love the performance of Karen Lynn Gorney, who provides pathos and humor as Travolta's dance partner Stephanie whose aspirations of glory exceed even his, even if she can't pronounce words like ""interesting."" The scene of the two of them in the coffee shop is hilarious.<br/><br/>A lot of the film isn't, though. It's quite bleak. But that's the strange source of its power, that and the music. Like its protagonist, ""Saturday Night Fever"" is a film that doesn't stand still."
"AdamKey","8","1","3","17 May 2005"," Youthful Desperation & Frustration
","""Saturday Night Fever"" is an example of a youthful but very real desperation and frustration, ones that permeate all of existence. It is also in many respects a wonderful ""time capsule"" of the 1970s, and about an often-stereotyped and ignored group in the USA; inner-city, blue-collar white ""ethnics"" and their manifold and often difficult cultural and socio-economic plights that have not had an adequate and respected public voice, except for being selfishly warped and exploited by the likes of Richard Nixon and George Wallace. Unlike his cluelessly provincial friends and family, daytime Brooklyn paint store worker and nighttime local disco king Tony Manero (John Travolta) is much smarter and far more aware than he initially appears, deeply yearning to escape his limited and gloomy environment, fearing that, like his parents, he will soon be inescapably swallowed up by it.<br/><br/>The character of the seriously unhappy and increasingly desperate on-the-cusp-of-full-adulthood Manero is not a stereotype, as many mistakenly believe, but more accurately, a Weberian ""archetype"" of sorts (one that in Manero's case might have been created by Albert Camus himself) accurately embodying a general personality in a specific cultural milieu. He is also what anthropologists would term a ""marginal"" man, unpleasantly caught between his strong Brooklyn Italian-American ethnic identity (one with which he is not entirely comfortable because of what he believes are some of its undesirable attitudes and actions, unlike his friends and family) and the wish to ""make it"" over the bridge into the wider world of Manhattan (as represented by his honest and kind but rather transparently pretentious friend Stephanie) although unsure of how to proceed. Disco dancer Manero's character is the flip side of that of Soviet spy Christopher Boyce in the 1985 film ""The Falcon and the Snowman;"" both characters suffer from a profound existential and cynical despair about themselves and their respective and equally shallow (but radically different) personal worlds; worlds deeply infected by the general cultural malaise, lethargy and escapism that dominated the USA in the 1970s, infections which they are trying to personally remedy in some manner, albeit in significantly different (but not in necessarily wise, healthful or rational) ways.<br/><br/>A most important scene in the film was when Tony's favored older brother Frank suddenly decides to quit the Catholic priesthood (a landmark event echoing in the later ""Falcon"" when Boyce quits the Catholic seminary in disgust) a decision which sends shock waves through the family. It's a poignant scene of shattering disillusionment and utter disappointment; their parents' thin, dreamlike hold on vicarious middle-class respectability is suddenly swept aside, and in the wake of this trauma, the younger and less-favored Tony, to them, becomes just an even more pathetic example of someone going nowhere fast (the lyrics of the BeeGees' gritty song ""Stayin' Alive"" completely and concisely encapsulate the entire theme of this film.) However, amid the bitter wreckage of these various seemingly solid but in truth quite fragile and dangerous illusions (one among them being Tony's approaching loss of unchallenged dominance on the local disco dance floor) Tony fitfully realizes that he is finally ""free"" in a truly existential sense, and only then can he leave behind his bleak, dead-end world while still unattached and quite young enough to do so.<br/><br/>""SNF,"" despite its flaws, is a fine example of gritty, unvarnished, unapologetic, relentlessly politically-incorrect yet thoughtful, open and fascinating film-making of the 1970s--real stories about real people in real situations in real time--a decade which had probably been the finest era in American film."

Thank god the Bee Gee's wrote the music in glorious isolation to the crass, dark and ugly images.<br/><br/>Here we have death, gang rape, homophobia (thrown in twice in case you went to the bathroom the first time around), racism, violence and family conflict.

However, these scenes are nicely contrasted with the not-so-hip everyday life of Tony. <br/><br/>
Travolta does a very believable portrait of a teenager torn between a rather bleak day life and a hot night life.  He feels he could be something, but he has no idea how.  He dreams of owning expensive cars, but earns barely enough to support his once-a-week clubbing.  He is annoyed by girls that want to have sex with him, due to something that is not entirely clear.  But he is really really believable. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story does not hang together very well.

"exterminator_99","8","1","3","10 April 2002"," A tale of hope and ambition
","Too many people have complained that ""Saturday Night Fever"" isn't a disco movie first and urban drama second. Released at the height of disco, the film has too easily become associated with the Bee Gees soundtrack and John Travolta's white suit. These are side issues for the film, just window dressing. Sure, the soundtrack certainly evokes memories of the 1970s effectively. But the retro revival of the late 20th century ensured we became very familiar with the 1970s, so in that sense the music, the discos and the costumes can be put in the background and the audience can concentrate on the story. ""Saturday Night Fever"" is an effective drama about ambition, dreams and the harsh realities of life.<br/><br/>The funniest thing about ""Saturday Night Fever"" is that it is essentially a film stuck in the 1970s. There is no way that Tony Manero (John Travolta) could possibly act the way he did then in today's society. Tony is essentially a bum, a dropout deadbeat in a low-paid job with no future ahead of him. The only thing Tony excels at is dancing, not professionally, but at his local disco, the amusingly titled Odyssey 2001. He and his friends live like Neanderthals, existing in a life of drugs, boredom and aggression.<br/><br/>They are the epitome of misogyny - it's almost disturbing how lowly they regard women. <br/><br/>Tony's life begins to change due to two factors. Firstly his brother Frank (Martin Shakar), a priest, returns home with some unexpected news. Held up as an angel by his parents, Frank's sombre return to the Manero house ignites a spark in Tony – if Frank can change, why can't he? Tony's family is generally loveless. His father (Val Bisoglio) is bitter for not having the life he always wanted, and perhaps more so because he never gave Tony the support he needed as a child. As a result Tony has grown up to be the image of his father: uneducated and going nowhere. All Tony's mother (Julie Bovasso) sees is the realisation that Frank is everything the family wanted (a Priest for a son!), while Tony is nothing but a deadbeat. <br/><br/>The second factor that changes Tony's life is his discovery of Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney). He first encounters Stephanie at the Odyssey 2001. Different to all the other girls Tony has been with, Stephanie, at least to Tony, represents a higher class of girl. He wants her, and combined with this desire is a need for change and progression. For what could be the first time in his life, Tony has ambition.<br/><br/>As an audience we feel for Tony and share his sense of ambition to cross the bridge from Brooklyn to Manhattan. In Stephanie he sees himself – a person from his own background that has made something of herself. Of course we learn that Stephanie, for all her celebrity namedropping and airs and graces, is essentially the same as Tony, possibly even more of a dreamer. While we may not connect to Tony and Stephanie – their lack of intelligence is a little overpowering at times – we want them to succeed. The scene where Tony tells Stephanie a story about the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge is truly touching. They both realise that they can succeed, but also, that the world is a lot more dangerous and difficult than they can ever imagine.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the film is slightly weak and predictable, but it is generally satisfying. It is unfortunate that it takes a tragedy for Tony to finally shape up, but perhaps that was what was needed for him to turn his life around. As the credits roll we are hopeful that Tony and Stephanie will succeed but not entirely confident in their abilities. <br/><br/>John Travolta reprised his role as Tony in the sequel ""Stayin' Alive"", directed by Sylvester Stallone. It contained some outstanding dance scenes, but lacked the grubby optimism of the original. While the dancing in ""Saturday Night Fever"" is truly brilliant, the story is an underrated and effective drama that carries the audience along a journey of hope and discovery in an unforgiving world."

","Anyone who read Nik Cohn's original New York Magazine piece (""Tribal Rights Of The New Saturday Night"") would know that the article, and the subsequent film, are meant to CRITICIZE urban tribalism (""neighborhoodism""), machismo, racism, sexism, etc.....not glorify these ideas! Although the real-life Tony Manero (a fellow named Eugene Robinson) and his friends were a multi-ethnic group, other aspects of their behavior were dissected in the piece. The film chose to change their ethnic background to Italian, and take potshots at urban Italian culture circa 1977. The disco/dancing leitmotif was meant to be exactly that, a leitmotif. I never realized how many people missed the entire point of the film until I went to see the God-awful play here in NY....these people were APPLAUDING the stereotypes portrayed! The Faces are supposed to be ignorant, sexist, violent near-thugs, not role-models.....that is why Manero leaves them at the end of the film. It amazes me when people emulate and glorify negative stereotypes (like the Italian-Americans who emulate ""The Sopranos""!) Part of the problem is that many people see the censored versions of the film, where the negative behavior is censored. The R-rated film is the only legitimate version. The PG/PG13 versions are inane (hey, guys, let's put out a PG, dumbed-down version of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.....so the kids can hear all the GREAT MUSIC!).SNF wasn't the only film at the time to attack ethnic tribalism, NUNZIO and BLOOBROTHERS are other films that examine similar themes."
"The_Movie_Cat","7","1","3","10 September 2000"," ""The man who gave you coolness and hotness and everything you want""
","Saturday Night Fever is a hopelessly naive film that appears to have no discernible sense of irony. Such a self-aware approach could have fully vindicated this dated story of Travolta's Tony Manero  who now looks an idiot throughout with colossal collars  getting his highs through disco dancing. Filled with contemporary film and juvenile sex references, this is the sort of film a sixth former would write, falsely believing it to be ""relevant"" and ""meaningful"".<br/><br/>The film also has a bitter edge, centred on the obnoxious Tony and bad language. ""What are you anyway, a nice girl or a c***?"" is a typical chat-up line. The most harrowing scene comes when the rejected Annette (Donna Pescow) initiates a gang-bang with Manero's friends in order to make him jealous. Despite her changing her mind halfway through and crying for them to stop, the act continues in a quite repellent example of cinema. This snapshot of racist, homophobic, foul-mouthed Italian-Americans is more Scorcese-DeNiro territory than the cosy retro of Grease, and can be quite shocking for those that think of this as a film solely about disco-dancing.<br/><br/>An odd scene is Travolta and Karen Lynn Gorney sitting on a bench in front of Brooklyn Bridge, shot from the same angle as Woody Allen and Diane Keaton would be two years later in ""Manhattan"". The difference being Allen wouldn't have called her a c***. Well, at least not until Deconstructing Harry. On the unintentional laughter scale, look out for a gang brawl that involves much harsh editing, balsa wood chairs and overdubbed ""punch"" sound effects.<br/><br/>John Badham's direction is very good, combined with Bronx slum surroundings that give it the aspect of an art-house movie. Ultimately, though, this is a film famed more for cultural iconography than actual content. Aside from Travolta in a white suit dancing, I bet that very few people could tell you what the film is actually about. Just short of two hours long, the repetitive tale  it alternates constantly between disco and mundane everyday life  is surprisingly never dull. Like Travolta, it is personable and imminently watchable, if never actually any good. Abortions, crisis of faith, gang war, attempted rape and Travolta seeking redemption by leaving the slum - this is more than a film about dancing. And, no matter what anyone else says, the best song on the soundtrack is obviously Rick Dees and his ""Disco Duck"". 7/10"

","This is a coming of age film with a 23 year old actor playing a 19 year old in the lead role of tony, a 19 year paint store clerk who is obsessed with spending his Saturday nights on the dance floor of a Brooklyn discotheque. He can shake up a can of paint and he can shake it up on the dance floor but has little else going on. He does have a 19 year old girl, Annette, played by a 23 year old actress over at the disco who is obsessed with him but he is attracted to a 20 year old woman, Stephanie, played by a 32 year old actress who he wants as his dance partner in a competition. The actors who play Tony's presumably same-age buddies from the Italian neighborhood are 25 and 27 years old and the third one is actually 19 years old. The story is based on a story by Nik Cohn that appeared in the June 7, 1976 New York Magazine that was passed off as a true story called Tribal Rites of the New Saturday Night. Cohn had gone to the 2001 Odyssey disco in Brooklyn to look for material for a story on the disco scene. He saw an impeccably dressed and coiffed dancer who stood out among the crowd and came back the next week to look for him but he wan't there and he couldn't learn anything about him. He knew nothing about the disco scene so he ditched his plan and decided to make up a story using the guy he had seen as the model for his character he called Vincent. Producer Robert Stigwood read this story and figured it would be a good movie and he could score the music to it from The Bee Gees who were under his contract. Norman Wexler who had written the screenplays for Serpico and Joe adapted the short story into a screenplay. Rocky director John G. Avildsen was hired to direct but his differences in how the Tony character should be written with Stigwood's vision got him fired and replaced by John Badham who had recent success with The Bingo Long Travelling All-Stars & Motor Kings. John Travolta who was well known from the Welcome Back Kotter TV comedy was just starting out in films. He had done two TV movies and had a starring role in one of them and had been in two theatrical release feature films including the popular Carrie. Most of the other actors in this film were unknowns recently starting out in films or making their screen debut. Dance instructor Deney Terrio worked with Travolta and actresses Karen Lynn Gorney and Donna Pescow on the latest disco dance moves and additional training for the cast was from former Broadway actor and choreographer JoJo Smith who had been in the '64 revival of West Side Story and was running JoJo's Dance Factory in New York. Lester Wilson choreographed all the dance sequences. He had choreographed such films as Funny Lady and Sparkle and would go on to do the films Scrooged, Sister Act and the Motown 25 TV special. All their work hardly pays off as this film shows no real love for dancing. The characters are all going through the moves and it's energetic but their is no fun displayed in what they're doing for us to understand why they do it. Cinematographer Ralph D. Bode films the dance sequences in a point and shoot manner with poor lighting and little imagination. The Bee Gees of course provide a bulk of the soundtrack which went on to be the biggest selling movie soundtrack of all time. Lot's of songs by other artists too. Stayin' Alive, Night Fever, More Than A Woman, Disco Inferno, If I Can't Have you, You Should Be Dancing, How Deep is Your love and many more familiar tunes throughout this film. It's amazing that no songs from this film were nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Song which was won that year by the diametrically opposed You Light Up My Life by Debbie Boone. Travolta did get an Oscar nomination but throughout the film I keep imagining him in this role as Vinnie Barbarino doing the Jerry Lewis character Buddy Love from The Nutty Professor. This film hit the disco era in full stride and it was perfect timing. Oddly there had been no disco flavored music films but a flood would follow like Fame, Village People Can't Stop the Music, Roller Boogie, Soup for One, The Apple, The Wiz and Xanadu that all hit as disco was fading. I saw this film during it's initial theatrical release and it is a good snapshot of the 70's disco era but as a story and as a film it falls short. I would give this a 6.5 out of 10."

","Saturday Night Fever is a movie from the disco era. At the same time it tells about disco culture and life of 70's young adults. The movie plays many classics of disco music and presents dance movements of its time. John Travolta makes the final breakthrough in Hollywood with the main role. Travolta plays American-Italian Tony who lives in New York with his family in modest conditions. His family is catholic and conservative and his parents don't like Tony's dancing in discos on Fridays. He has some close friends with him at the disco every time. I think the movie is underrated but not perfect. The movie contain some unbelievable scenes like the final scene but I still like this movie a lot. It is very entertaining and characters are interesting. On the other hand Saturday Night Fever is a time window to the disco era.

","I won't go into a long explanation, so here is the short end of the why this short story was made into a film.<br/><br/>The story illustrates all the people who this twenty year old knows and meets in this short time period in New York. All of them in Tony's eyes are the same, except for one. One casts a shadow upon the missing piece the character of Tony is looking for in regards to how he sees his future.<br/><br/>The amazing thing about this story is Tony doesn't do some dance finale because dance is not what the story is about. It helps carry the substance of Tony's journey, but its not the story.<br/><br/>Tony's at end tolerance and eventual epiphany when he refers to everyone as ""idiots"". Why is this so important? Because we grow up and learn to believe in respect for others, but by the time we go to school and realize everyone has lied to us in our youth, you simply want someone who is honest. He saw how dysfunctional and disingenuous everyone was and wanted out, but he didn't want to go it alone, after all this is a love story of self discovery and innocence.<br/><br/>This is basically a man's version of a Victorian age snoozefest story line where the women wants to abandon social conventions. But the essence is the discovery that the world does consist of many idiots and all Tony wanted was one person who wasn't a fool.<br/><br/>That's what the film is about. Watch it again."

","Where to begin??<br/><br/>Is it the polyester suits? Is it the disco mirror balls? Is it the Bee Gees? Is it the charisma of John Travolta?<br/><br/>Well, the answer to all four of these questions is YES.<br/><br/>More than four decades since it was unleashed onto a not-entirely-unsuspecting world at the end of 1977, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER remains one of the cultural touchstone movies of the late 1970s, admittedly dated in some places (sometimes a bit too painfully obvious), but timeless in far more ways than one. Its story of Travolta's working-class New York City tough Tony Manero getting onto the dance floor at the 2001 Odyssey club and showing his stuff to escape his oppressive family life, but seemingly unable to commit to either one of the two women (Donna Pescow; Karen Lynn Gorney) that he finds there, is a true microcosm, not only of the era in general but also of the much-reviled Disco craze in particular. Nik Cohn's story ""Tribal Rites Of The New Saturday Night"" provided a whole lot for screenwriter Norman Wexler to conjure up, and he had a lot of help from Travolta, who had first become a star on TV via the 1976 TV film THE BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE and the hit TV sitcom ""Welcome Back Kotter"", then on the big screen as Nancy Allen's toady boyfriend in Brian DePalma's 1976 horror classic CARRIE. He is also helped by the sure-footed (to use a well-turned phrase) direction of John Badham, who had had many credits for television but, prior to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, only one big screen credit (1976's THE BINGO LONG TRAVELLING ALL-STARS & MOTOR KINGS). Besides all the great dance sequences, there is also the famous scene of Travolta and his friends playing a dangerous game of chicken on the Verrazano Narrows Bridge while a horrified Pescow looks on, set to ""Night On Disco Mountain"", a discofied adaptation, by David Shire, of Modest Mussorgsky's terrifying 1867 symphonic tone poem ""A Night On Bald Mountain"".<br/><br/>Made for what nowadays seems like a ridiculously low budget of only $3 million, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was not only a huge box office hit, grossing something like close to a quarter of a billion dollars, but also unleashed a 2-LP soundtrack album that went on to spend twenty-six straight weeks atop Billboard's album chart and sell close to 40 million copies, making it one of the most successful album releases ever. That the film should have been as successful as it was is kind of amazing even now, considering how rough the street language in it was, making it unsuitable for unaccompanied minors and thus warranting the 'R' rating that it got. Even so, it's hard to forget the impact it had on popular culture, with a wall-to-wall soundtrack that included not only the Bee Gees, but Yvonne Elliman, MFSB, Ralph MacDonald, Tavares, KC and the Sunshine Band, and many more-a soundtrack that still keeps selling like crazy even to this day.<br/><br/>It is instructive to look back at this film, and realize that the craze it depicted was the subject of a lot of invective from the so-called ""Disco Sucks!!"" crowd, a bunch of disaffected rock and roll fans of the time who railed against Disco as a ""threat"" to their music, which, being a classic rock fan myself, I always found overblown. Rock music wasn't consumed by either the Disco craze or by this film and its soundtrack, far from it. Given that, and everything contained in it, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER remains a truly classic film, worthy of many viewings."

","Believe it or not, STAYING ALIVE, the sequel to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, is not a John Travolta film (and take it from someone who was there: people laughed really loud after the trailer would play in theaters)...<br/><br/>For better and mostly good-bad worse, it belongs entirely to writer/director Sylvester Stallone, rehashing the ROCKY storyline of a diamond in the rough fighting to survive and given a miraculous chance at quick fame (much like Stallone himself): Only here he's a dancer, not a boxer... and unlike the Oscar winning southpaw tale, it's a pretty bad movie/guilty pleasure, but fun as hell! Travolta struggles to make it from the streets to lead dancer in the cheesiest Broadway musical ever created, SATAN'S ALLEY (a title derived from Stallone's own PARADISE ALLEY), a cross between CATS and a surreal flu dream...<br/><br/>Playing the character he made famous in FEVER, Travolta's former Disco King Tony Manero charms his way into the bed of gorgeous Broadway star Finola Hughes, who turns the tables and uses him. And much like the SNF dance contest, the big budget musical is what everything leads to... resulting in the same kind of whiny idealism for the main character, taking his dancing much too seriously... But now we're skipping ahead...<br/><br/>There's a contrived overabundance of Tony getting his just-deserts i.e. the player getting played by this sly vixen, and his complaining gets tiresome. All the while he uses his loyal girlfriend played by Cynthia Rhodes, a cross between the classy Karen Lynn Gorney and a vulnerable Donna Pescow...<br/><br/>Rhode's Jackie just can't help but to love the handsome devil. And, like Rocky Balboa, our dancing hero, sculpted with mapped-out body muscles yet looking strangely gaunt, facially, strives for heights never thought possible: Tony, having ""grown up,"" is now going for gold.<br/><br/>The Bee Gee's Soundtrack, unlike the catchy romps from the original, is full of breezy and forgettable pop tunes. Frank Stallone's muscular fanfare, Far From Over, captures the ""drive"" a whole lot better, serving as a victorious anthem much like Bill Conti's GONNA FLY NOW in ROCKY...<br/><br/>So if you like corny movies, STAYING ALIVE takes the cheesecake... And in many ways is even more entertaining than the original since it centers completely on Tony sans intrusion from an ex-priest brother, bickering parents (although mom provides a mellow cameo), or pointlessly plotted cronies: Like it or not, Travolta's the sole man of the hour... And the side-characters, including Steve Inwood as a temperamental Broadway director, are working hard to keep him ready and steady for opening night.<br/><br/>And now we'll end with some trivia... Yours truly was in the theater when this movie's trailer played... The audience roared with laughter when dated title showed up on the screen... So let's give Stallone a hand for such a risky venture...<br/><br/>Look out for the director's cameo, pictured below, while Tony walks down the streets of Manhattan... In one scene Sly's brother Frank, playing a guitarist for Jackie's band, is described by Tony as looking like a ""demented paratrooper,"" which is writer Sly's own words describing his bro....<br/><br/>And last but not least but definitely the most obscure Easter Egg herein (decades before we used stupid catchphrases like Easter Eggs... or Cinefile): listen closely towards the end of the movie during the halfway point of the musical where, backstage, someone says: ""Yo, Adrian... Showtime!"""

","John Travolta busts out when he busts a move, and I finally watched this for the first time on Netflix. I'm pretty shocked that it's not really about dancing, and seems to be more about growing up with a little bit of rape and racism.<br/><br/>Summary: I didn't take notes or anything when I watched it, so I have to give a very brief synopsis. Tony (Travolta) is a dancing God in his neighborhood, and he can slay whatever woman he wants. He has loyal fellow Italian-American friends in his group, and they all have a little taste for a little bit of drugs, a little bit of racism, and a whole lot of disco, even if there isn't as much dancing as you would expect in the movie. When Tony decides to enter a contest as if dancing ""is the ticket out of here,"" like most ""teenager has to get away from home"" movies have. He falls for his dance partner, but she won't have him. Somewhere along the way, racial turmoil between his Italian friends and a rival Hispanic group of friends escalates, and one of his friends- who is a devout Catholic- knocks up some girl, which of course is terrifying. In the final minutes of the movie, the younger friend commits suicide right after the other two friends take turns with the obsessed girl in the backseat of the car, raping her in a short scene where she cries and wishes Tony would stop it. After a fight with the wrong people, the rape, the suicide, and even trying to rape his own love interest, Tony finally realizes maybe it's not jive to act like he has been.<br/><br/>Review: I'm not 70's era guy, so I don't know how well the movie captures the essence of disco for sure, but I think the movie does a pretty good job. And it has the feel that all critically acclaimed movies from a couple of generations ago have- that feel of just telling a story, and just letting it unfold. The story itself lends to the overarching themes, rather than over emphasis on a scene or a line or a particular frame. And though there are some times where the scenes are sort of saturated to show how Tony gets a high from dancing, the story is a rather poignant representation of what I suspect life was like in the 70's. Races were still widely divided. Women were second to men. Youths made rash decisions, and rarely considered the consequences. Well, I suppose that's not so secluded to the 70's after all, some may say, which is why Saturday Night Fever can certainly be found to still be relevant.<br/><br/>Regardless of the ""era,"" it is in those moments that choices are made that lives truly unfold. And life is rarely much different: from the 70's to the 90's to the now, being good at one thing (dancing) doesn't mean a damn thing when you're not being good for something."

His carefree youth and weekend dancing help him to forget the reality of his bleak life.<br/><br/>In 1977, disco was alive and well. Today (2015) most would say that disco is dead. But watching this film proves them wrong. The story is as good now as it ever was, and the songs (many supplied by the BeeGees) are quite timeless -- almost every single song on this soundtrack is today considered a classic. Few films can claim such a lineup.<br/><br/>From a historical point of view, the movie launched John Travolta, which is interesting... he is one of the more fascinating people in Hollywood over the last forty years. And perhaps it also helped launch Fran Drescher in some way (though she seems to have really not taken off until ""The Nanny"")."

","There is surprisingly more to ""Saturday Night Fever"" than just John Travolta in the white suit rocking out to the Bee Gees (you see some iconic images over time, they sort of symbolize the movie, what can I say?). We can all identify with these youthful fears of a dead-end job, a go-nowhere life, and that came through extremely well. And I love his meathead line delivery. But the scenes with Travolta and his friends, their woman hating (it's ugly), that all lost me. And it makes up a substantial part of the running time.<br/><br/>So, ""Saturday Night Fever"" . . . well, it kinda is all about the dancing. That's what it does best. The energetic dancefloor scenes, awesome soundtrack - it's flashy, calculated fun.<br/><br/>A star-making movie if ever there was one. And talk about that opening credits strut; he owned those streets. <br/><br/>7/10"

","Before I ever saw this movie I had happen to see Grease, which I did not like. I never got this 50s nostalgia, and the story was corny. Now, Saturday Night Fever, which isn't related to Saturday Night Live in any way, has as an engaging story enhanced by great disco music without being a musical. It's actually rather similar to Fame, the movie, having a similar message: the entertainment business as a vehicle out of the ghetto. Perhaps not very ingenious or innovative. The picture deals with other themes too, such as racial issues, religion and sex, but only subordinately. Over-all good acting and dancing.<br/><br/>Interesting this 70s disco music phenomenon: it developed out of soul/funk, and Barry White was crucial to its genesis as his Love's Theme was the first hit to be referred to as 'disco'. The new genre was endorsed by artists that were not predominantly Afro-American, adding an international flavour and popularity. 'Disco' was not prone to develop much further than White's sound of 1973, though, and in 1979 there was even an anti-disco movement called 'Disco Sucks!' that culminated in mass burning of disco records at a stadium in Chicago.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever did capture the essence of the era with regard to the clubbing side of it. One thing that does surprise me is that the fashion they wore didn't match the class and ever-greenness of the music: polyester..."

","Saturday Night Fever is the 1977 instant classic that initiated a new kind of music that came to be known as disco, produced the number one movie soundtrack of all time, and made an official movie star out of John Travolta.<br/><br/>Travolta plays Tony Manero, a 19 year old who has a go-nowhere job in a Brooklyn paint store and still lives with his parents. Manero's somewhat aimless life only seems to come alive when he puts on his silk shirt, his tight pants, and hits the local disco dance floor where he is king. Tony finds himself cut down to size by a snooty secretary (Karen Lynn Gorney), who he asks to be his partner in an upcoming dance contest.<br/><br/>Director John Badham put together a story that the cherished 18-34 demographic ate up. His music video approach to the direction, some really electrifying dance sequences (with Tony's first solo to the Bee Gees' ""You Should be Dancing"" a standout), and his complete confidence in his leading man combined to make this box office smash one of the most talked-about films of the year.<br/><br/>There's a silly subplot regarding a rival gang that is hassling Tony and his crew and Karen Lynn Gorney's performance is beyond annoying, but these are minor distractions in what is a pretty solid drama with music. I would love to give credit to whoever choreographed Travolta's dance sequences, but so many people have claimed to have done it over the years, I'm really not sure who choreographed this film.<br/><br/>Travolta was nominated for an Outstanding Lead Actor Oscar for his performance and there are a couple of strong supporting performances from Barry Miller as an insecure member of Tony's crew who idolizes him and Donna Pescow as Annette, a somewhat trampy and desperate regular at the disco who is madly in love with Tony but can't get him to give her a second glance.<br/><br/>The Bee Gees provided a soundtrack that became a classic in itself and produced the number one movie soundtrack of all time.

"jcbutthead86","10","0","1","18 March 2015"," An Excellent And Unforgettable Classic With A Brilliant Performance by John Travolta.
","Saturday Night Fever is an excellent and unforgettable classic that combines wonderful direction,an amazing star-making performance by John Travolta and a great cast,a classic soundtrack and a memorable score. All of those elements make Saturday Night Fever a classic and one of the best films of the 1970s.<br/><br/>Set in Brooklyn,New York,Saturday Night Fever tells the story of Tony Manero(John Travolta),a young teenager who goes to the local Disco club every Saturday night with his friends to dance where Tony is king of the dance floor but outside of the dance club his life is miserable. When Tony meets and befriends fellow dancer Stephanie(Karen Lynn Gorney),Tony starts to re-examine his life and decides to grow up.<br/><br/>Released in 1977,Saturday Night Fever is a brilliant,unforgettable and iconic film that was not only a critical and Box Office success but also made John Travolta a movie star,helped launch the Disco craze in the late 1970s and gave viewers one of the best and biggest soundtracks of all-time. It's a movie that has become so famous and apart of Pop Culture you know the film by the title name,the white suit that Travolta wears in the movie or by it's many songs on the soundtrack that are played throughout the film and are still played on the radio. Right from the now iconic opening scene,Saturday Night Fever is an instant classic from the very moment you watch an amazing film that is just an experience that glues viewers to the screen with music,intense drama and electricity that just never stops. When you watch Saturday Night Fever it's truly like watching a time capsule that takes viewers back to the 70s and 1977 in New York showing the night and day-to-day life in New York during that decade. While Saturday Night Fever isn't a musical where characters are singing and dancing,the music and dancing play a big part in the film with the music making certain scenes come alive while the dance scenes are amazing,memorable and are done in a visual stunning style that is dream like and beautiful with tons of energy that makes the film. What I also love about SNF is that despite the music and dancing the movie at it's heart is a timeless Coming Of Age story and is one of the best in the genre showing viewers the Coming Of Age of Tony Manero. The character Tony Manero is a classic character of 1970s cinema and the Coming Of Age genre because while he isn't the most likable person and can be a jerk at times we see Tony deal with the hardships of growing up. When Tony is dancing at the night club he is the king on the dance floor but outside of the night club Tony's life is a wreck and is pretty sad,he works a dead end job at the hardware store and his parents think less of him and see Tony going nowhere in life. Despite Tony's miserable life he's very ambitious and wants to succeed in life beyond his neighborhood which makes the character Tony truly complex. What also makes Tony grow is when he meets Stephanie who Tony sees as a prime example making it and being successful which gives Tony more hope for his future. When Tony and Stephanie begin to dance together and start to know one another they both need each other and start to relate to one another more and try to help each other out. Tony Manero is a memorable and interesting character you will never forget and is one of the reasons the movie is a classic. There are also parts in SNF that make the movie dark,bleak and gritty because like Tony the other characters have sad and miserable lives and the movie has a tragic overtone that sticks with you. The movie also deals with themes such as sex and aimless youth who are lost in the haze of trying not to think about about real life. SNF is a much deeper movie than one might think and isn't just a movie about Disco and dancing and that's one of the reasons it's a great film. The ending of Saturday Night Fever is amazing and powerful and truly brings the character Tony full circle and we as the audience feel that there is hope for this character. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The cast is great. John Travolta is excellent and iconic as Tony Manero,with Travolta bringing charisma and depth to the role. Karen Lynn Gorney is wonderful as Stephanie Tony's love interest and dance partner. Barry Miller(Bobby C.),Joseph Cali(Joey),Paul Pape(Double J.)and Bruce Ornstein(Gus)do fantastic jobs as Tony's friends. Donna Pescow is great as Annette,a neighborhood girl who's in love with Tony. Martin Shakar is sensational as Father Frank Manero Jr.,Tony's older brother who's a priest. Val Bisoglio(Frank Sr.),Julie Bovasso(Flo Manero),Sam J. Coppola(Fusco)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by Fran Drescher in the role as Connie.<br/><br/>The direction by John Badham is terrific and stylish,with Badham always moving the camera and bringing a beautiful and visually stunning look to the film with fine camera angles and use of color and lighting. Great direction,Badham.<br/><br/>The score by David Shire is fantastic,memorable and matches the tone of the film. Wonderful score,Shire. The soundtrack from The Bee Gees one of the best and most iconic soundtracks of all-time with songs by The Bee Gees(Staying Alive,More Than A Woman,How Deep Is Your Love,Night Fever,You Should Be Dancing),Yvonne Elliman(If I Can't Have You),K.C & The Sunshine Band(Boogie Shoes),The Trammps(Disco Inferno),Walter Murphy(A Fifth Of Beethoven). A classic soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love 1970s films,cinema in general,John Travolta and Music,I Highly Suggest you see Saturday Night Fever,an excellent and unforgettable classic that you will never forget and watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","When we're first introduced to Travolta's character, Tony Manero, we learn what kind of character he is through his actions alone whilst the song ""Staying Alive"" plays in the background. The way he walks indicates that dancing is his passion, and the way he tries to harass a random pretty woman on the street indicates that he's a bit of a chauvinistic asshole. When he finally does start talking with people, we build on that chauvinistic asshole personality in order to discover that he's like every other teenager: someone who always lives in the present with no thought for the future. Aside from being played by John Travolta, he's not much different from any of the protagonists in a Seo Kouji manga.<br/><br/>Indeed, Tony is a guy who only has one real passion: dancing. He doesn't want to face reality because, well, it's a shithole. His family is emotionally abusive/disturbed, his friends are assholes, and his brother is doing far better than him as a priest. So when we get to those scenes, there's a bit of a gloomy atmosphere and there's bound to be at least one moment where Tony lashes out at something. When we get to the dance club?<br/><br/>Tony's escape from reality also functions as the audience's escape, as well as the moment where Tony really defines himself. Because let's face it, do we really want to follow some random asshole and his shitty life for the entire movie length? There's plenty of people suffering from Tony's problems in reality. Something I think most hack coming-of-age writers don't realize that characters need to be fun and that relatability doesn't necessarily translate to that. They need to have their own life. Their own wants and needs. Their own unique way of providing excitement, even during the darkest times. And when Tony is dancing to ""You Should Be Dancing"" or whatever else the Bee Gees made, he's not only giving us something cool to see, he's characterized in a way that makes him even more interesting to the viewer.<br/><br/>Once Tony is properly characterized, the next question that forms is ""where are we supposed to take him?"". As with most male stories of this type, Tony's self-reflective journey is jump-started by a free- spirited female who represents what Tony wants. And not just any female. An older woman named Stephanie who can really bring it on the dance floor, which is pretty much what attracts Tony to her. After the two agree to be dance partners, that's when the subplots start to come in. One of Tony's friends got his (unseen) girlfriend pregnant and he wants to get out of marrying her. Tony's brother leaves the priesthood and instantly becomes the black sheep of the family. Annette, a girl who has a crush on Tony, gets treated like dirt by him and retaliates in a way that costs her dearly. It's like the main story is your Steam profile and these other problems are the crappy games you buy off of it.<br/><br/>What I like about these subplots is that whilst Tony is never directly involved with any of these characters' problems and we never really see them resolved in a satisfactory way, that doesn't matter because at the end of the day, they're just flavoring used to highlight two things: Tony's shitty lifestyle and the late 70s disco era. This movie doesn't have answers to these issues because it's not supposed to (they're called 'sub'plots for a reason). It doesn't overreach at the expense of its true accomplishments like a shitty VN adaptation, and even when the characters aren't dancing, the disco stuff is always there the same way the action continues to exist in Die Hard even when Bruce Willis is just spouting one-liners whilst stuck in a ventilation shaft.<br/><br/>Moreover, they're integrated into the main plot perfectly, containing all the actual substance that truly makes Saturday Night Fever special whilst the story of Tony winning a dance competition with his new friend remains the skeleton that must always exist strongly throughout, yet can't really provide meat on its own. The finale IMO is where this shines the most. Without giving too much away, the compounding problems regarding his friends and family cause Tony to commit terrible actions that worsen his lifestyle even more than it already was, destroying the goals he tried to set out for himself, and ensuring that there was no turning back. It's up there with Kaoru's breakdown in Kids on the Slope as one of my favorite dramatic moments in fiction because it's self-destruction where even though outside circumstances are to blame, the protagonist is the one who pulled the trigger at the end of the day and all he can do is face the consequences of his actions. See that Seo Kouji? That's how you create relatable drama out of asshole characters.<br/><br/>But there is hope. You can't get back what you lost. But you can rebuild something new in its place and compromise whilst doing so. And that's why the final scene when Tony rides the subway for the entire night before meeting Stephanie works so well. It doesn't matter that the movie ends at the plans for the future and not at the results. It doesn't matter if at the end of the day, Tony is ""just friends"" with a girl rather than having an actual girlfriend. If anything, that's what makes the finale so much better. And let's be honest, Tony is lucky to even have that."
"natashabowiepinky","7","0","1","21 August 2014"," We know how to show it...
","I must confess: I'm not a big Bee Gees fan... (and my favourite song of there's isn't even in the film) so you might think the fact that you hear one of their little ditties every five minutes in this production could represent a problem. Not so... the tracks fit each scene like a glove, and it's impossible to imagine them missing. With all the other disco themed tunes too, you could argue that more people have heard the soundtrack than watched the movie. I'd certainly place a small bet on it.<br/><br/>Rather than being a celebration of all things hedonistic about this era, the script provides a rather more level-headed approach. It doesn't deny the exuberance that one can derive from casual sex and shaking' your thang every weekend, but it also highlights the dangers of such an irresponsible approach... namely, teen pregnancy, barfights, sexual assault and even young death. It's all fine and dandy when you're that age and you feel you have years to burn... but unless you make long term plans for the future outside of the (metaphorical) dance floor, your folly will soon catch up with you, and you could end up with nothing but broken dreams. Take it from someone who knows... *Looks down sadly, but then perks right up again*<br/><br/>Travolta, as you could guess, is quite the mover, and the parts where he gets his groove on in a variety of funkadelic outfits provide some of the more stimulating moments. There's also that brilliant introduction where we a close-up of his feet as he paces the streets of New York... just by his stride alone, you can tell we're in the hands of a very cool cat indeed. His friends are all jerks, his parents sole focus is on his priest brother, and he works at a dead-end job at a paint store. Saturday night is about the only time he can cut loose, so who can blame him for wanting to make such a big show out of it? This was his star-making role, and it's not hard to see why. He simply exudes sex appeal... and when all the girls throw themselves at him as he cuts a rug, the surprise factor is 0%.<br/><br/>So you have brilliant dance sequences, good performances from all and sundry, a dark undertone to all the frivolity and some bangin' tunes to immerse yourself in. A 70's classic that has truly stood the test of time. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a white suit I need pressing... 7/10"

","Saturday Night Fever is more than just a group of people dancing at the local disco-tech! The movie really focuses on Tony Manero's life - who he is and what he wants. Tony wants more out of life than a typical 9 to 5 dead-end job. He's growing more and more tired of the same hum-drum mundane lifestyle that he lives day-in and day-out. He's even growing out of his friends who seem to want things to remain the way they are. Tony's focus: His Dancing. Could he ever make it as a professional dancer? <br/><br/>I will not give away all the juicy details of the film - I recommend watching it for yourself if you have not already seen it. I will highly recommend this movie and the second film ""Staying Alive"" for viewing if you have any interest at all in professional dancing - particularly if your have your eyes towards Broadway.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Saturday Night Fever is a good movie with a well written storyline although there really isn't very much conflict throughout the movie,and an average cast.The plot is certainly nothing too exciting but it is certainly the dance scenes that make this movie enjoyable,I'm usually not a fan of watching people dance,but John Travolta is certainly an exception and this movie is the best example of what are professional dance he really is,and his dance scenes are without a doubt unforgettable scenes and the movies highlight.As for the casts performances,I honestly think its the weakest part of the movie,I was that bothered about the plot,but I don't think anyone really delivered a top notch performance,not even Travolta,his performance is certainly the best in this movie,but he was still very new to acting at this time and he was nowhere near professional yet.The worst performance was certainly Karen Lynn Gorney,who played Stephanie,I didn't believe her for a second,she started off seeming like a upper class girl,but as soon as she started talking she was not one bit believable,and especially when she was upset,she could not do a fake cry.All in all,Saturday Night Fever is an enjoyable movie,it's filled with flaws but the dance scenes are the main thing in this movie,and they are the best parts.<br/><br/>Tony Manero (John Travolta),a young man living in Brooklyn,is trying to find himself as he is growing up,he gets a low payed job,but keeps a positive attitude while seeing his friends every night and going to his favourite dance club."
"Leofwine_draca","7","0","1","14 March 2014"," The Rocky of dance movies
","Saturday Night Fever, the huge musical hit and film that launched John Travolta into A-list stardom, is kind of like the ROCKY of dance movies. Made at around the same time as the Stallone flick, its emphasis is on capturing a street vibe and depicting the grittiness of life for young people living in late '70s New York. Like ROCKY, it features a central character attempting to better himself in order to lift himself out of his humdrum surroundings.<br/><br/>The movie belongs to Travolta and Travolta alone, because he electrifies the screen like no other. In many ways he plays a variant on his 'jerk' character in CARRIE, except that this guy just so happens to be a brilliant disco dancer. Wait until you see some of those dance sequences - they're amazing to behold, and it helps that the Bee Gees soundtrack is excellent into the bargain.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, the story isn't afraid to shy away from downbeat realism, but at the same time it's oddly uplifting. John Badham's assured and confident direction helps to bring both story and era to life, making this a time capsule of its age."
"antagonist117","6","0","1","30 December 2013"," A decent, if overly-serious, character study, burdened by side stories that lead nowhere
","This is a self-serious movie about the foibles of pathetic little people engaged in a pastime that is objectively trivial but which to them is a matter of life and death. Namely, disco dancing—disco dancing in the seediest, most peripheral of clubs on the wrong side of the Brooklyn Bridge, no less. For a while the lack of any whiff of sarcasm or judgment on the part of the filmmakers, of the sort you might see in a Coen brothers movie about the dregs of society and their quixotic refusal to acknowledge the futility of their existence, raises questions with direct ramifications for the movie's quality: Does the film not understand how sad and silly its characters are? Are we really supposed to think that disco dancers were the new rebels without causes, or that Travolta's strutting and preening made him the next great underdog like Rocky or the next tragic antihero like one of Al Pacino's roles? And then a conversation happens between John Travolta's character and his dancing partner (Karen Gorney) after which there is no doubt that the seriousness of the film stems from its real understanding and concern for these pitiable, fragile individuals. Here they lay their cards on the table for the first time, and suddenly their personalities are present and clear. The introspective Travolta is indeed smart in his way and is beginning to realize how limited his options in life are, and the guarded Gorney wisely can't bring herself to trust anyone in her sphere of society, and therefore acts as if she doesn't really belong to it. For the first time it is possible to feel sympathy for them both, and that remains the case even as they continue down a destructive path amid the rotting infrastructure of late-70s greater New York. There are some side characters, potentially just as interesting but who don't ever come into focus quite as neatly, on whom the movie's seriousness and good intentions are misspent: Travolta's priest brother, who is a loose end, a woman who seeks Travolta's affections but who is used by the movie in increasingly unsatisfactory and unjustified ways, and a group of Travolta's lowlife buddies whose predictable B-plots involving racial violence and teen pregnancy come to nothing. It is therefore understandable, if slightly unfair, that ""Saturday Night Fever"" seems to be remembered primarily for its soundtrack."

"rbrooksie12","10","0","1","2 November 2013"," Brooks--Saturday Night Fever Review
","Saturday Night Fever is no doubt a film that paints a portrait of what the urban setting in the 1970's was like. Issues of the 1970's, such as homophobia, rape, and suicide are present in this film. However, this makes the film better because it paints a portrait of the 1970's. As soon as the film opens and you see John Travolta strutting down the street, you know that this picture has something. Travolta portrays Tony Manero, a nineteen year old boy who works a dead end job at a paint store. He goes home and continues his dead end life because he fights with his family, especially his father, who is unemployed. When Tony is not fighting with his parents or working at the paint store, on Saturday Nights, he forgets his weekday boredom and is the hotshot dancer at the 2001 Odyssey Discotheque. While he is there, Tony sees a girl who lights up the dance floor just as he does. Tony eventually meets this girl, Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Tony finds out that Stephanie is a person totally the opposite of him. Stephanie is smart, mature, and hard-working. While Stephanie eventually accepts Tony's friendship, and tells Tony that she will be his partner in the dance contest at the 2001 Odyssey, she stresses that they will not be more than friends.<br/><br/>A critical character in this film is Annette, who is played by Donna Pescow. Annette is a girl who will do anything to be liked by Tony and the guys in his group. Tony's friends (Joseph Cali, Paul Pape, Bruce Ornstein, and Barry Miller) are like Tony. They are immature and crude.<br/><br/>I will not reveal the end to the film because it is a must-watch to anybody of any age who has not seen it. Travolta displays his best acting performance of his career in his first major film of his career. Even though there is a lot of crude content in this film, what you will remember is John Travolta lighting up the dance floor in his legendary white polyester suit. This film deserves a rating of 10/10 and is a must watch for anybody who has never seen the film!"

","So most of us know Saturday Night fever that are between 30 and almost dead. It has some iconic and often spoofed dance scenes. I wonder if the youngin's of the world today have heard of this movie or for that matter seen it. So is it a classic, well that depends on how you look at it. If you are shallow and have an insipid mind it is. If you are someone who likes to make fun of Disco and cheesy movies it is as well. I think, though I could be wrong, that I fall into the latter category. I enjoyed watching this movie not because it was good, but because it was just humorous to watch Vinny Barbarino in action, and I admit he is a good dancer. I found myself making fun of this movie while I watched it, but it is not terrible or undeserving like say the Blind Side (which I just reviewed), of being in this blog but just dated and just o.k. But there is that music by the Bee Gees that I am almost ashamed to admit I like, and the disco which along with the 80's are among America's cheesiest decades. So I recommend watching it to feel nostalgic, to see what the disco era was like if you are young, or just to laugh at a la mystery science theater 3000. Oh and look for a ridiculously hot very young Fran Drescher in the movie, marone that chick can get sausage stiff if yo know what I sayin' yo know what I am say sayin, ohhhh... marone, I think I just felt the thunder bolt (my attempt at being a stereotyped Italian from Brooklyn or I guess New Jersey as well)."

","When this movie came out, I was a teen and still in school. It seemed like just a simple movie about a simple guy. But it ended up inspiring me and probably millions of people to embrace the nightclub scene. Unfortunately the end result is'nt that positive, most of my friends who are serious club kids did'nt necessarily turn out all that successful.<br/><br/>Ironically the friends of mine that have stayed out of this lifestyle are doing much better than the ones who got seriously enmeshed in it. <br/><br/>But the question you have to ask is who is having a more exciting and fun life? If you can survive the life without turning into a raging alcoholic or drug addled dancing fool, or survive getting into the fights that sometimes erupts, or the potential for car wrecks after you leave the scene, the club scene is a very exciting and fun time. <br/><br/>This movie still inspires and excites many people, but beware!

","Saturday Night Fever is one of those films that exists in the very top bracket of film making yet has many flaws that are overcome by the sheer raw power of the message in the film and the development of the characters. <br/><br/>John Travolta will never be better as Tony Manero. We first meet Tony strutting down the street holding a can of paint, checking out all the ladies to the sound of Stayin Alive by The Bee Gees. (iconic shot - simple and has been imitated many times) and from that moment you are hooked into his world, his friends and are charmed into his lifestyle of sex, booze and great dancing. At first like Tony you are enjoying yourself and think he has it made. <br/><br/>This is what makes this movie great. As Tony discovers the little world that he is king of is nothing but a shallow empty shell of existence, you do too. You discover this with him. His friends are all idiots, the girls flinging themselves at him every Saturdays are whores and he can be so much more than this. <br/><br/>Another theme of the movie is the way people treat each other. Even Tony is not a hero in any sense of the word. He is not a good friend himself, he treats girls like dirt and is very selfish. A few examples include his treatment of Donna Pescow's character who seems lovely if a little dumb. He also permanently ignores a friends call for help until the guy goes berserk and falls off a bridge high on drugs - even then all Tony can think about is himself. <br/><br/>However you still like him. This is down to John Travolta and his career defining performance as he is a real person. People are selfish, people rarely listen and Saturday Night Fever captures this in gritty real detail. <br/><br/>Another great aspect of this film is the 'love interest' Stephanie. Now Stephanie is not a six foot amazonian blonde with great big artificial hooters teenage boys can lust after. She is a normal looking woman who has her own flaws. She is also quite selfish, snobby if you like trying to rise above her roots and upbringing to a better life. Tony is attracted to her as she does not react to his advances and often lets him down as he does other women. Stephanie as a character I understand is not well liked amongst a section of the SNF fans but she is very necessary to the plot and is played in a comical manner by Karen Lynn Gorney as we discover she is really no cleverer or sophisticated than Tony.<br/><br/>A special mention also needs to go to Donna Pescow who is cute as a button and the arc her character takes makes your heart break. She didn't deserve that! I thought she was the stand out hottie of the film hands down - that rack! Anyway I was supposed to be giving a serious insight into the movie...where was I....ah yes<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever also contains some of the most iconic moments in seventies cinema - I am not fan of disco or dancing at all but even I think these scenes are brilliant. <br/><br/>Overall it is a film that you have to re visit every now and then, perhaps now over looked by a modern generation that file it alongside Grease as cheesy dance film. A shame really as it is also a powerful character study and a great ride if you decide to take it."

","John Badham's 'Saturday Night Fever' is a groovy, spicy and lastly energetic movie. John Travolta puts on the coat with grace, goes on the dance floor and provides some clap-slap dance moves. <br/><br/>'Saturday Night Fever' is about a young immature fella, who finds himself stuck between family issues and disco-dancing. His journey is thrilling and very musical. John Badham's direction captures Travolta's sissy movements with a jig on the crust. Travolta rules the show with a super performance. His dancing, though very 'Girly' makes you move nonetheless. But what truly moves you is, as mentioned, his performance. He gives his character importance and he keeps the atmosphere alive. Travolta now ranks as a legend, for being a full-round performer and rightly so. <br/><br/>At the end of the review, I suggest you check out this musical-classic for it's sheer energy and Travolta's honesty. Two Thumbs Dancing Up!"

","Italian roughnecks in Brooklyn live for their Saturday night disco dancing, and one of them (John Travolta) falls in love with a girl (Karen Lynn Gorney) who makes him realize there are better things in life.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is a foul-mouthed, fast-paced slice of life which made a film star of Travolta, a terrific dancer. It capitalised on, and indeed reinforced the disco boom. It was a phenomenal box-office success that despite some of its flaws - its minor characters are not well sketched, and Tony Manero isn't exactly multi-dimensional - seemed entirely predictable.

"eabakkum","9","0","1","7 August 2010"," A working class tale
","I must definitely write a review about Saturday Night Fever. This film was the talk of the town in my teen years. Right after the release I saw the film once, together with a school mate, in the neighboring city. There was no cinema in our village, and our film journeys invariably transformed into a pleasant evening out. The usually preferred menu were James Bond films, but that time SNF was a must. We enjoyed ourselves. It has everything you could wish for. Music of a proved band. A new style of dancing that we could imitate (how little were our talents in this regard). Even sex. Enough chances for identification and enough stupidity to maintain a feeling of superiority. The guy who made a girl pregnant, but took aversion to marrying her and fell into a state of contempt of death. There are real character moments when Tony lacks power: Tony begging his boss to get advanced money. Or Tony, although among equals of a cool attitude, getting slapped by his parents and whining. About 25 years later I recorded the film on video, and watched him some seven times, at short time intervals. At first it was just nostalgia, a reminiscence of the good old times that are lost forever. Then it was the film itself: lots of movement and fun and actions. My involvement with SNF finished with an analysis of the intriguing relation between Tony and his new dance partner, and a dissemination of the dialogs (what do they say and why?). The characters are certainly credible and well-played. It seems to me that the film comes close to a working class tale and a criticism of American society: the apathy, lack of education, the brutal surroundings, the struggle for mental survival, and of course the desire to get out. It is essentially a good-natured film, which still portrayed some hope in the aftermath of flower power. The right film at the right time."
"amwcsu","8","0","2","17 March 2010"," A near-musical that has realism, grit and charisma.
","Not many musicals or movie where the musical stylings are a part of the film as the cast. Saturday Night Fever works because it shows the world of late 1970's New York City. One of the reasons why: It was done at the right time, not 10 years after, not 2 years before. 1977 was the heyday of the Disco movement...and you cannot get any better than the heart of Disco which is in New York. When someone hears the word ""Disco"" they often visualize happy, clean-cut people straight out of a Eight Is Enougb episode having a good time or a rabble of openly gay sex addicts. This movie shows neither.<br/><br/>SNF has no stereotypes to flaunt and exploit. The Moreno family is a struggling middle-class Italian family with their tensions. In fact, the main character, Tony is a womanizing, sexist, racist, profane bastard. Most mainstream movies then and now frown on this kind of character. He even rapes his rather attractive dancing partner, Stephanie! How's that for a hero?! Despite the recklessness, domestic abuse at the dinner table, and shameless use or racist slurs, there are bright point in the movie. Tony is devoted to his dancing no matter and he sees it as an art-form. By the middle of the film you want this boorish man to excel to a higher station. SNF is incomplete without the disco known as 2001 and Tony's remarkably impressive dance moves!<br/><br/>If only High School Musical were this impressive, serious, and intelligent, not-to-mention daring. Alas, the 2000's have no defining musical style like the 1970's did. In the end, you felt some sympathy for Tony Monero and all his faults. Saturday Night Fever is a classic that can never be duplicated no matter how hard one tries."

","This is an extraordinary movie. I found myself watching it on TV without knowing what it was... if someone had told me what I would be watching, I wouldn't have given it a chance. Why? Because of its being so often paired with grease. But it is everything grease isn't. Saturday night fever is gritty, pretty hopeless futures await the protagonists, the sheer jungle of youth and young mens culture is highlighted marvelously. The weak don't survive, the weak are shown no pity... there is no saccharine here. The dilemma facing Travolta's brother is an all too familiar one in Catholic countries. Travolta himself emerges a likable decent lad, which in itself is no small feat."
"JLRMovieReviews","8","0","2","15 June 2009"," Travolta's Finest Hour
","This ode to the 70s, dancing, and Saturday night went down in movie history with a Oscar-nominated performance by John Travolta and one of the best movie soundtracks ever, courtesy of the Bee Gees. It also gave Donna Pescow's career a boost as a girl who throws herself at Tony, and look closely for ""The Nanny"" Fran Drescher and Lisa Peluso of ""Loving"" fame. <br/><br/>But those who rent this and see this for the first time and are expecting a high time may be disappointed or may be pleasantly surprised, depending on your point of view. The writer of this must have been inspired (at least I think so) by ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" with Albert Finney. This time around it's New York in the 70s and Tony lives to dance on Saturday night. Tony's plight is really no different than anybody else's. <br/><br/>Because his day-to-day life is mundane, he tries to forget his troubles and breakout and break dance on Saturday night. Travolta's performance as a dreamer is buoyed by his conversations with his girl, how he talks of the bridge, and his sad, baby blue eyes which express a deeper yearning for something he can't quite put into words. By the end, he learns the harsh reality of responsibility and how our actions (or lack thereof) has consequences. He learns that living on a Saturday night is not rewarding in the long run. <br/><br/>""Saturday Night Fever"" is compelling in showing life in 70s New York, but it tends to sag in the middle and while its inevitable ending is needed for a sobering wakeup call to reality and may be uplifting to a degree, it goes out with a whimper instead of bang. But, then again, that may be the movie's intention - not to leave with a disco move on the dance floor, but with Tony moving towards manhood."

","""Saturday night fever"" is not just a movie about dance or the usual Teenage lust for sex and drugs, in fact it is a well crafted biopic of an ordinary teenager raised in a dysfunctional family and who is struggling to find his true purpose. John Travolta stars as Tony Manero; a 19 year old kid who works at a paint shop in the daytime earning his petty cash to spend it during weekends to go to a disco club with his mates. At the club, Tony is treated as a king, the alpha male (a status he earned through his smooth dancing skills). Everyone notice him and greet him. Women are charmed by his moves and ask him to dance with them. Club goers compliment him by saying ""You know something, Tony? You always seem to be in control"". This attention and freedom that he receives at the club is far more pleasurable than what he experience at his house; his family life. There is no respect for each other in the family; they fight over the silliest matter when having dinner. His parents are overly proud of their eldest son who is a priest and this make Tony somewhat inferior, and he faces constant pressure over the decisions he has made in his life. It is not surprising that such a youth would hunt for some form of release to breakthrough from this misery. For some, it usually involves drugs and other abusive substances, but for Tony it is Dance, and Dance is what he could always think about. <br/><br/>It is at this dance club where he stumbles upon Stephanie; another good dancer who is more mature in age, beliefs and attitudes than Tony. Even though they possess these contrasting traits, the way that life has dealt with both of them has never been more similar. They both depend on one another to make themselves feel better. This movie explores deeper themes than it appears on the surface. Matters we sometimes resist to tap into, and director John Badham has achieved these immediate goals. The pure film-making used to shoot the dance scenes encompassing funky tunes are another aspect to pay close attention to. One of the best films of the 80's."

","John Travolta and The Bee Gees team up, and the result is the biggest selling soundtrack in history. Travolta's feverish dancing put a face on the Gibb Brothers' disco beat. We still imitate him in his white suit, our fingers pointing to the sky. For awhile, I thought The Bee Gees were singing ""Bald Headed Woman."" I was informed that it was ""More Than A Woman."" It is unlikely that the movie would have gone far without The Bee Gees music. Songs like Stayin' Alive and Night Fever echo today. I particularly like Yvonne Elliman's rendition of If I Can't Have You. It was painful to watch The Bee Gees renounce the disco era a few years later. The characters and storyline of SNF are downers. A sequel called Staying Alive was released in 1983. It was so bad that it killed Travolta's career for a decade."

It's got groovy music, coiffed hair and 1970s disco atmosphere dripping from every frame, but it's primarily an excuse for a bunch of flashy dance numbers without the burden of stringing them together with anything resembling a real plot.

I cant' believe the energy of the actors, they danced and sung live, unlike most Pop Stars.

It gives the viewer the perspective of the era through Tony Manero, and his moments with friends, encounters with women, and confusion and acceptance of his older brother (Frank) decision.

","John Travolta's high-octane performance took his stardom (earned on Welcome Back, Kotter) to otherworldly levels.

He's 19, has a job that he enjoys (selling paint at a hardware store), and at night he's the king of the dance floor at the height of the disco age.<br/><br/>The movie is very dated - as most movies that rely on topical music score and fashion must be - but the theme runs true. Tony dances to build his own self-esteem, since he gets little in the way of positive enforcement from a family that dotes upon his older brother, a priest. He hangs with his arrested-development pals, drinking and dancing and carousing and fighting.<br/><br/>Travolta is fantastic as Tony; he's not as loud and arrogant as his friends, but he's clearly their leader. He's not terribly bright, but he's smart enough to know his limitations. He's a little thoughtful, but not too reflective, choosing to live in the present. Until, that is, he meets the slightly older Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney).<br/><br/>It's easy to see why audiences flocked to this one, with its strong soundtrack (all Bee Gees, all the time) and electric atmosphere.

The production is a flashy musical-hybrid at it's' roots but it has a surprising dramatic sophistication when you see Manero working his way through the mess of his life.

","So, john travolta plays the incredibly sexy dancer that glides across club floors performing dance moves. the dance moves are all disco, so if you cant handle the disco era, then this movie is not for you.  But i never really heard that much until after it ended. so the disco music was ok for me. i wouldnt like it, except (**SPOILER**) when the beginning happens and he walks down the street and the bee gees are playing staying alive.  Oh MY god, that is magic.  The girl that he tries to dance with really was extremely annoying, since she had huge dreams and couldnt really accomplish them.  she uses her dreams to rub in what she supposedly has done, and that makes john think about what should and still could be.  after all, he works at the hardware store and blows all his check on the one weekend of dancing disco. he is well known in the club, and is admired by both males and females in the movie.  i thought that could have a significant meaning, showing that you can have popularity and a special talent, but you are all alone when you dont have someone special to share with.  john really starts to show that he needs someone, and clings to the dancer because she shares the dancing gene, and as well as her being attractive to him.  this movie is really, really great, and it really shows that all people have their downfalls and yet still manage to hang on to the disco era.

","I don't know what people are expecting from this movie but it is what it is. It is not the fluffy disco movie that people think it is.<br/><br/>This movie leaves many issues unresolved and is actually the snapshot of a period of time in the lives of the characters. They are dysfunctional - they have loads of problems. That's what makes it real.<br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is a great movie from a great period of time. The music serves as a backdrop to a time in the lives of the people in the movie.<br/><br/>If you've never watched the movie and you get the DVD, watch the VH1 ""Behind The Hits"" presentation on the DVD before watching the movie to make it even more real."

","Except for the music, this movie was completely detestable.  Stephanie Mangano was an arrogant, pretentious, snobbish fake; Tony Manero was a preening, cocky, prejudiced jerk.  Tony revealed a single redeeming quality in the last part of the film when he protested the unfair outcome of the 2001 Odyssey dance sweepstakes, but it didn't outweigh his behavior up to then.  I doubt that either of these two believed that the sun rose until they got up in the morning.  What on earth did they see in each other?<br/><br/>An attempted rape, a backseat gang bang, a gay-baiting incident, a caricatured ""Whatsamatta you!"" Italian family that slaps first and asks questions later:  something to offend everyone will be found here.  Loaded to the brim with racism, homophobia, and superficial priorities, this movie might well be considered a chronicle of the worst seventies excesses: drugs, disco, and doin' it.  Not sure of the order.  But if you're looking for a movie that will be an uplifting experience ... of the toilet lid, for you to blow chunks ... here it is, folks."

","I believe that this was the first movie that I saw in the theatre when I four-years-old. (My second movie was Star Wars-also in 1978-then the Muppet Movie, and then I am sure the next was Popeye).  The baby sitter took me to Saturday Night Fever, and I remember my legs fell asleep sitting in the seat for so long.  I viewed the movie again tonight, and this time nothing fell asleep.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the lead actress was completely the wrong chick for this film, and although the movies ending was sort of lackadaisical; nevertheless, the acting was all pretty honest, nothing was forced, and the film flowed very, very well.  Coupled with the fact that the soundtrack is superb & the dancing was top-notch it tells us a lot about how we took a relatively cool style of music and mistreated it with coked-up lifestyles and loud polyester.  Sure, it might look cool en-retro; however, asked someone who lived the discotheque life and they will grin and bow their heads in shame.<br/><br/>This is really a fun movie that actually contains substance.<br/><br/>I think Saturday Night Fever deserves a lot better rating than most IMDB users give it.

"phillafella","8","0","1","17 May 2003"," Travolta Lights Up the Screen.
","The intelligence of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is probably due to John Travolta's hunk appeal and wild strut.  It's amazing that Travolta can go from the rowdy but clean-cut Vinnie Barbarino to the foul-mouthed disco king Tony Manero and still be successful.  The music really defines the era of disco and makes the film a big hit that is still popular even if disco is dead and gone.  The street language is acceptable, but it also prevents the movie from being perfect.  Altogether, SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER is a very watchable movie highlighted by Travolta's dance solo.  Very impressive.<br/><br/>4 out of 5"
"captain_obda","10","0","1","27 March 2003"," A classic
","Travolta gives an astonishing performance in a movie that for me is the epitome of a movie meditation on the themes of youth culture, society and human interaction. Saturday Night Fever is intelligent, realistic, multi layered and the subtleties of the various facets of the narrative are perfectly blended by an all perfect combination of performance, screenplay, direction and soundtrack. This movie speaks for a generation - not just for its style - but it explores universal and timeless themes in a powerful way through understatement, and questions this society through the dramatic device of characterization and relationships. The result is ultimately convincing and has genuine emotional impact. I've never seen any other film which seems as fresh and challenging after the tenth viewing as it did after the first.<br/><br/>It saddens me that so many of the wholly excellent cast members were unable to launch a consistent, internationally successful acting career following their triumph here in SNF. However, their outstanding legacy from this movie will live on for many generations to come. Thank you to everyone involved in Saturday Night Fever - every member of the cast, screen writer Norman Wexler, director John Badham, for the faith of Robert Stigwood in this project, the monumental soundtrack and finally to every single member of the crew for their contribution to making a powerful statement not only about a time and a place, but about the human condition itself."
"StarWarsDisco","10","0","1","21 March 2003"," A masterpiece from the greatest era of American cinema.
","There are people who have seen this movie that have not been stoked by it (see some user comments). Personally I can't understand this. I know that there are people who have different tastes, and maybe some younger viewers will not be able to relate to it, or appreciate it. However, at the risk of sounding like a dick, I can confidently say that those are people I would not want to know anyways. This is a film that does what great films are supposed to do; that is to transcend our daily lives and bring us joy. There are a few films that can be called masterpieces because all the different film elements that are brought together have a unique quality and vision and the final result is something more special than the sum of the elements themselves. In a nutshell, this is a simple story about a young Italian Brooklyn man, Tony Manero, from humble roots with a gift for dancing who dreams of something better against all odds. He escapes from it all out on the dance floor, basking in the glow of the disco ball, and the frivolous, moving dance music. He meets another young woman at the danceclub, Stephanie Modano, played by an underrated Karen Lynn-Gorney, who is equal to him in dance ability, and, more importantly, in desiring a better life. The two struggle together, and against each other, in their pursuit of winning a dance contest that may spur on their dreams.<br/><br/>A simple story yes. One you've seen before yes. But after that, there is no other film that can touch it. John Travolta, as Tony, was in his prime, giving a performance that is so likeable because he is so normal. Who can't relate to a character who is so honest, so cool, so goofy, so conflicted; who has talent but doesn't get recognized by the people who should recognize him, like his family, only by his friends whom he knows deep down are all creeps? This is all of. us!<br/><br/>The soundtrack features some of the best disco music ever made, in terms of making you feel joyous, and impervious to the world's problems. Mostly contributed by The Bee Gees, as well as others, it is the essential element that makes the whole thing work.<br/><br/>John Badham's direction is even; giving the audience plenty of music and show stopping musical bits, yet unafraid to lure you back to the grim reality of what our hero is always up against. But it's never heavy handed. The story is equal parts dramatic, comedic, exhilirating, and pensive, and moves along just as rhythmically as the music.<br/><br/>In the end, literally as well as figuratively, Tony is more alone and unsure than ever in his ever changing world. And so it makes sense that he reaches out to Stephanie for love and support; someone that has at least a little understanding of who he really is, even if they can't be lovers. Simple, realistic, beautiful. The 70's was the true golden age of American cinema. It was the era of the auteur. Great minds like Scorsese, Coppola, Lucas, Spielberg, Badham, and so forth had for a decade or so, the ability to make truly visionary films; in the sense that they had a lot of creative power to express themselves devoid of studio pressure, political correctness, marketing tie-ins, and big budget, sensory offending, special effects. They laid it on the line. And we get to enjoy it for eternity.<br/><br/>Attention younger viewers, don't let the distorted lingering stereotype fool you. This isn't a ""cheesy film"" with John Travolta dancing like a clown to music that ""sucks"". It is as good a film as you'll see, if you can allow yourself to appreciate it as a real film. Disco music was once cutting edge before it ""sucked"". John Travolta was actually a good dancer and actor, and the story really does have depth."
"Board","5","0","1","7 March 2003"," The movie itself is pretty empty, but worth owning for Travolta's moves alone!
","I think my headline sums it up pretty good (spoilers ahead): The story line is simply and we have seen it a million times before; Travolta is a guy who works in a store and all he basically lives for is going to the disco every Saturday night. Then they get drunk and one of his friends falls of a bridge. He then realizes he better start taking his life seriously. The end. Bu-hu-hu! The story is sappy and gross and if it hadn't been for Travolta's dance moves at the disco I would have sold my copy of the film as soon as possible. When it comes to the two minuttes in the middle of the film where Travolta is alone on the dancefloor, I can only praise this movie for some of the most evil dancing I've seen!!!"

","I first saw this movie at the drive-in as a kid. I remember being fairly amused seeing Vinnie Barbarino on the big screen for the first time. For what it's worth, this is the quintessential disco movie. The characters are believable, if not appealing. If you're a fan of the era, you'll love this film. If not, you can't help but be amused. Personally I fall somewhere closer to the latter. This isn't just a dance movie though, it deals with the characters and the other aspects of their life...questioning religious faith, unwanted pregnancy, relationships, friends, and family. For me, it's a quality period piece from the much maligned late 70s, set in Brooklyn. I have to admit I'm somewhat thankful that I was a little too young to really be involved in the disco era.<br/><br/>*** (Out of 4)"
"joshstep41","Null","0","3","24 August 2002"," surprisingly offense
","I love dancing, so I rented SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER and was caught completely by surprise.  The film is not about the joys of dancing at all.  Instead you are bombarded with profanity, misogyny, drug use, promiscuity, racism, homophobia, suicide, and even rape.  I cannot understand how this movie is so big and popular.  All my life I've heard about this film and have encountered numerous satires.  Since when is mainstream America so accepting of such material and content?  This movie is extremely offensive and definitely adult-orientated.  I assume that all of this is just the film's reflection of the disco generation because I am already aware of their ignorance.  The disco scene was largely a ""white"" mainstream rip-off of two subcultures: the African-American and gay club scenes.  So, in that regard SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER was a good portrayal of that time.  I was just amazed that such a mainstream and well-known film had so much bigotry.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong.  This movie did have some credible moments (the opening sequence was fabulous!), but I was really caught off guard.  I am a fan of fun and dancing and that is why I like disco music, but I certainly did not find any in this movie.<br/><br/>So kids, if you want to watch a movie with good old-fashion dance fun.  This movie IS NOT for you.  You'd be better off watching Baz Luhrmann's STRICTLY BALLROOM (1992)."
"Daniel-Couri","10","0","1","16 March 1999"," To the night fever
","One of the catalyzers of the disco fever, this film is much more than a flick, as some critics insist. It definitely has become a classic, the best view of the Seventies and one of my all time favorite movies. (I've seen it a thousand times!) Tony Manero, a young Brooklyn guy (played extraordinarily by John Travolta) struggles to be the disco king at a local disco where he's already recognized as a dance master. He also meets Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) there, a beautiful and snob woman who despises him until she realizes how pretentious she was being. Even though, she's not in love with Manero but became his friend. Parallel plots develop around Manero's family and friends during the film. Director John Badham adds an erotic touch to all dance sequences while Travolta (wearing his classic black and white sport suit) reigns as the greatest find of the film. The great soundtrack by the Bee Gees (which was a smash hit worldwide) remains one of the most popular movie albums of all time.<br/><br/>Taking a nostalgic look at the film's costumes is a funny (!) experience too. Wanna know where to go when the record is over? Go get this video to watch the film!"
"Peach-2","8","0","1","14 March 1999"," Dated, but well worth a watch.
","Some people will avoid Saturday Night Fever because it's a ""disco"" movie. It couldn't be further from the truth though because this film is about kids and the trouble they sometimes have finding themselves. This film has a great opening shot, showing us where John Travolta's character has his priorities. The friends he hangs with don't really know what they wanna do either and there is a lot of time spent actually avoiding real talk. Sooner or later Travolta's character decides he wants to move on, he meets a girl in the club he hangs out in and Travolta is interested in her because she has left the neighborhood, or is trying, and he is tying to find his escape. Saturday Night Fever gets pretty serious for just a ""disco"" movie and there are some good questions made by the screenplay. John Badham does a very good job with the material and this film made John Travolta a star. Some will avoid it.....no one should."

"teejayniles2345","9","0","1","1 August 2001"," A music video that has a ""Siamese Twin"" of a ""B"" movie
","Do watch the full-length version of this 1977 dance classic; it's a strangely muted John Travolta ""vehicle"" of a bunch of 70's cliches.  It precedes the 1981 MTV phenomenon but showcases some excellent tracks of the Bee Gees' music and lyrics (including some great covers).  The movie presents a strangely uninhabited urban landscape where whites rule the ""roost.""  The plot and odd storyline are quite ""B"" in their haphazard domestic/gang fighting and abuse.  The pathetic female co-star who is the object of sexual abuse is more or less a caricature and I am not quite sure who the leading lady is asserting her right to be -- partner or ""trophy"" ?? My evaluation is of course quite revisionist in nature but the great musical that has been ""Siamese Twinned"" with the Italian working family saga (complete with a ""doubting Thomas"" elder brother) needed some revision-ing of its own.  Maybe Tim Burton's next project will be a Ricky Martin version of this classic 70's piece where he succeeds on a wave of New York Puerto Rican Latin musical frenzy.  Or is that already so ""last year"" ?!?"

","After reading several other comments on the film, I have to concur; the only reason to watch this film is for the dancing. The one-note, whiny plot about how hard it is to be a teenager in New York had me screaming at the screen, ""GET A LIFE, PEOPLE!"" I didn't see the film until a few years ago (I was 6 when it hit the theatres, and was dying to see Travolta dance; my parents went to see it, and walked out halfway through, thoroughly disgusted),and my wife refused to sit through it after hearing how repugnant the language was. I can't honestly say that I blame her now. Like Midnight Cowboy, this film left me with a nasty taste in my mouth.   This presents a golden opportunity for Paramount when they get around to releasing this one on DVD.How about releasing a disc that (through the wonders of seamless branching) has both the PG and R rated versions on it? Not only would this appease those of us who were repulsed by the R rated version, but it would be a piece of history, a piece of nostalgia. Just a thought....."

","To watch this movie today, it almost plays like a parody of itself. The clothes, the language, the music, the Farrah Fawcett posters on the wall ... but what a great trip.<br/><br/>This movie is about many things. Dance is a central part of this film but it is not what it is about. It is more about what dance does for Tony, how the Disco is the one place where his life is in order - where he rules.<br/><br/>Whether you loved or hated Disco in its peak, I believe that every guy secretly wanted to be Tony Manero. Handsome, confident swagger, well dressed (for the time), great dancer and a lady killer. Who wouldn't want that on their CV. But this movie shows us the dysfunctional homelife and everything else that Tony yearns for and doesn't get.<br/><br/>Twenty Five years later, we can now also have a full view of the cultural impact of this film. It is a 70's reference point for everything - fashion, music, dance, culture, language - and it is the launch of one of the most colourful careers in Hollywood. The music, though, has the longest lasting impact. The songs from this film are still routinely played in clubs and weddings, on the radio, covered by bands, sampled into hip hop music, and have become the backbone of the disco era. <br/><br/>Saturday Night Fever is an important and wonderful film not to be missed. I hated it in the 70's - I love it now. If you didn't like it then, give it a chance. Look for the R-Rated version and have fun!<br/><br/>***1/2 out of 4."
"Katmiss","10","0","1","11 July 2001"," ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE 1970s
","""Saturday Night Fever"" is about much more than dancing. It contains a sturdy character study, which is what makes this film so great. That and the music.<br/><br/>John Travolta stars as Tony Manero, a Brooklynite whose life consists of dancing at the local disco and hanging out with his friends after working at the local hardware store all week. This is one of Travolta's best performances. After seeing him as Barbarino week after week in ""Welcome Back Kotter"", it was probably a great shock to his many fans that he would do a serious drama. But he pulls off this difficult role so well that it establishes him as a serious and great actor.<br/><br/>Some of the best scenes in the movie involve Tony and his family. Tony is seen as something of a disappointment, especially compared to his brother who is a priest. The conflicts with Tony and his father are among the truest and most human I've seen in some time. It's a shame that they are not very well remembered among audiences today.<br/><br/>The most well remembered and talked about sequences are the scenes inside the discotheque. John Badham, the director, makes good use of the camera and captures the energy and color of a local disco of the 70s. At the very least, it blows away ""Can't Stop the Music"" and ""Thank God It's Friday"", probably among the worst films of this era. Travolta himself is impressive in the dancing sequences. It is good to see an actor actually do the dancing himself rather than a double.<br/><br/>The music is great, too. Most of the music is from The Bee Gees, the standout group of this era and this is some of their best work. Songs like ""Stayin Alive"", ""Night Fever"", ""More Than A Woman"", ""You Should Be Dancin"" and ""How Deep Is Your Love"" not only represent the disco era, but they also enhance the film itself and not many soundtracks can do that.<br/><br/>""Saturday Night Fever"" is a wonderful movie, an insightful look at a time that has faded away from memory. So many people want to forget the disco era so badly that they tend to take potshots at the music and fashions. They forget that they lived that time and it should not be forgotten.<br/><br/>
***WARNING: ""Saturday Night Fever"" exists in two versions. My review applies to the original ""R"" version which has a lot of offensive language and material.
