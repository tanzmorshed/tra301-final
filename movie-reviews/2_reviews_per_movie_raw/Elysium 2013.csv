","After director Neill Blomkamp's fantastic debut film District 9 I was understandably eager to see his new sci-fi film Elysium. Unfortunately his second feature doesn't quite match up with the greatness that was District 9.<br/><br/>Visually the film is quite stunning and it has some great cinematography when it comes to the larger shots. The CGI effects are excellent and blend in well with the environment. The Earth of the film looks very gritty, believable and lived-in and the space station Elysium has this very sterile and futuristic look to it. You could really buy it that Earth could look like this with many decades of neglect and poverty. Everything's in disrepair and in decline. The rich on the other hand have every resource available to them in their own little paradise in space. The set and production designers truly did a great job with the locations. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is decent as the film's protagonist Max who is an ex-con now working on assembling the droids which keep order on the now overpopulated Earth. His role and the writing of his character isn't anything too special or memorable but he does what he can with it. He's just a no nonsense guy who is thrown into a difficult situation. He was also quite sarcastic and funny when he was dealing with the droids in the earlier part of the film but we didn't see this side of him at all after that. Alice Braga plays Max's childhood friend Frey with whom Max meets up again when he's an adult. I didn't feel much of an emotional connection or chemistry between them though and that hampered the film a bit. Their back story is told almost completely in sentimental flashback sequences which I didn't care for. The antagonists in this film were very one-dimensional and over the top. Jodie Foster plays Elysium's defense minister Delacourt and Sharlto Copley (who was also in District 9) plays an undercover agent named Kruger who is positioned on Earth. They're both very cliché and uninteresting. The writing of all the characters wasn't very good at all in this film and I didn't get emotionally invested in any of them. <br/><br/>The story isn't that great either and this then also takes away from the film's many action sequences because we don't have that big a stake in them. The film starts quite strongly as it juxtaposes the situation on Earth and on Elysium to highlight the problems of social and economic inequality. Then suddenly when the action starts, these issues fade far in to the background in favor of more and more action. From the trailers and the hype I really got this impression that the film would deal with these issues in a thoughtful manner. Regrettably this is not the case with this film. A big problem with the film is also that none of the characters seems to learn anything new or change their beliefs or anything like that. A huge part of the success of District 9 was in seeing how the main character evolved after spending some time with the aliens. In Elysium the good guys are the good guys and bad guys are the bad guys. There's no complexity, nuance or subtlety in any of them. We also don't get to meet any other citizens of Elysium beside the higher up leaders like defense minister Delacourt and president Patel. It would've been interesting to see the common people of Elysium and how they react to the situation, what their beliefs are and what drives them. The writing is also a little too pointed out and heavy-handed. Some of it just made me think ""Wow, really?"". For example, at one point the CEO of the droid production company literally tells some mid-level manager not to breathe at his direction. Things also seem to happen way too conveniently to push the plot along. Then again you could say this about many films but you really start to pay attention to these things when you're not completely engrossed in the film. This film surely would've benefited from a more subtle approach. The ending was also way too simplistic for my taste.<br/><br/>The action in this film is quite intense and it looks very impressive at times. The exoskeletons were fun and looked convincing. Then comes the shaky cam. Oh boy. It's really quite annoying and very often it's hard to see what's going on. They should've really taken a page from the Bourne movies on how to shoot action scenes. Luckily the shaky cam isn't there all the time but the action could've definitely been improved with a clearer shooting style.<br/><br/>All in all, the film has decent action with absolutely gorgeous visuals and it moves along at a good pace. Sadly the writing, the plot and the characters aren't that interesting and it's hard to get emotionally invested in this film. It's watchable and probably quite entertaining if you're in the proper mood for it. For me, the film ultimately left me a bit cold and disappointed."
"mmccord9126","5","530","764","10 August 2013"," Liked the CGI and sets, but didn't like the story
","What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again, in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created (visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.<br/><br/>I just wish that, when someone comes up with future plans for making a legitimate SF film (sans comic book scenarios), they contract a real science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of SF writers out there that can, I believe, turn out much better scripts than currently making their way to the big screen.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when Bladerunner was produced. As an avid, and long time fan of true science fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the story, it could have been a lot, lot better."
"TimMeade","4","431","689","16 August 2013"," Lacking in Motivation
","Elysium is the follow up, much anticipated by many, to the critically acclaimed District 9 from South African-Canadian director and writer Neill Blomkamp.<br/><br/>In the middle of the 21st Century, with the world now grossly over-populated and law and order seemingly at breaking point, the super wealthy have decamped to a satellite space station highly visible from earth, a utopian society free of poverty, illness and other such mundane woes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the vast majority of earth's population lives in squalid, cramped slums seemingly based on the Favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Needless to say, the rich are all too keen to protect their enclave and any unauthorised vessels arriving from earth are duly dispatched by being blasted away.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster stars as Elysium's ambitious and sociopathic Defence Secretary, as ruthless at advancing her own interests as she is at ensuring the purity of the over-sized Ferris wheel whose security is in her charge; Matt Damon is the working class drone desperately trying to access the other world for the treatment to cure his radiation sickness from which he will die in 5 days.<br/><br/>There was clearly an interesting concept waiting to burst out here, an opportunity to explore themes of wealth, inequality, social status, health care and immigration, but sadly it failed on almost every level to build interest or have anything relevant to say.<br/><br/>First, we saw so little of the societal structure or way of life on Elysium itself. Apart from Jodie Foster and a few other high ranking officials, the film showed us nothing of how this satellite was run. It looked as if everyone lived in a McMansion style-home – the type you find next to golf courses in Florida or on the Sunshine Coast. It all looked terribly sterile, reminiscent of the contrived town Jim Carrey inhabited in The Truman Show. We were not privy as to who cut the lawns, did the plumbing or washed the dishes. Superficially, the lives of these pampered people seemed hollow and totally unfulfilled – where were the galleries, the museums, the theatres or even a casino for those that might like that sort of thing? Frankly, the impoverished life on earth which was shown with enforced work in a fascistic environment seemed far more fulfilling.<br/><br/>Further, Matt Damon's motives for getting on Elysium were totally selfish. All he wanted was to save his own skin. Granted, there was then concocted an unconvincing love interest and a wish to save his childhood sweetheart's little girl but this too was just parochial. Where was the burning anger borne from social injustice, the wish to better the lot of all humankind, the working class warrior on a mission? And when the film's final denouement came it was head in a sick-bag time.<br/><br/>The script and dialogue were banal, as was Jodie Foster's delivery. Matt Damon worked harder to bring some interest to his character but he was up against it – but at least he tried.<br/><br/>The CGI was good – but that's pretty much a given in any well-funded Hollywood film these days. Close up camera work was appalling, non-stop wobble vision which made action sequences confusing. This camera style is so unnecessary and it really is beyond comprehension as to why film-makers persist in its use; in small doses it can be effective but when near constant it produces a feeling of nausea.<br/><br/>It is so disappointing to be relentlessly negative about a film but when they are as lacking as this one, the positives can be hard to find."
"lbuttny","1","453","726","13 August 2013"," Elysium gets worse and worse the more I reflect on it...
","This movie was such a colossal failure on so many levels. I don't usually write reviews for movies, but this monstrosity was so atrocious that I felt compelled to warn unsuspecting potential viewers of the steaming pile of sewage that is referred to as ""Elysium"".<br/><br/>Where to start<br/><br/>First off, the plot was a laughingstock. Even if you can ignore the choppy camera-work that looks like the doings of a toddler with a buffed up camera, there's no ignoring the plot. Some examples of the numerous holes in the plot 1) Apparently, if a grenade gets blown up inches from your head, your brain is still intact and it can be repaired at Elysium. 2) If Carlyle could make the code to make Jodie Foster president, then why didn't he just make himself president or give himself all the power, by implementing the code himself or subtly adding a nuance in there? Not the sharpest tool in the shed. 3) Where are all the satellites to help track down Matt Damon while he is fleeing the villains? It seems some of the technology 100+ years in the future has actually regressed. 4) If the medical terminals can literally give a person a new head, through repairing a ""brain"", why can't they disable the sociopathic tendencies of characters like Jodie Foster on Elysium? Once again, only certain technology has evolved for the director's benefit. 5) In order to let one spaceship enter Elysium, you must allow all spaceships to enter too by taking down the no-fly zone. That makes total sense. 6) Last but certainly not least: the ending. Apparently everyone is going to live happily ever after on Elysium now? Every rich person on Elysium just wanted all those poor people on earth to suffer! But now the world is sugar plums and everyone lives happily! Yay!<br/><br/>Secondly, there was never any point in the film in which I felt connected to the characters in any matter. Why was this? Well, none of them had any depth. The dialogue was one cliché after another. The primary villain in the story appears to have some sort of speech impediment, because for most of the movie he is inaudible. A well-told story will also have a villain that has deeper complexities as to his/her background and motives. This character was just a bumbling moron. Matt Damon and Jodie Foster did the best that they could, but their scripts were so poor that it would have been more interesting had they been reading off the menu at a local Olive Garden. The exchange regarding the hippo between Damon and the little girl that is dying of seizures had me cringing in my seat at the awkwardness of the whole matter. I should have walked out then and there.<br/><br/>Also, why was the best look we ever got of Elysium one where we saw a few trees and a woman swimming in a pool? Would looking at the inner workings of the politics and lifestyle on Elysium simply have exposed this film for the fraud that it is? I'm not going to go too deeply into the themes of the movie, as everyone has their own opinions, but it doesn't take much to realize the hidden (and rather misguided, imo) opinion of the director in this one. The message was about as subtle as receiving a ton of bricks to the head. View at your own risk for your blood pressure will likely rise after watching this one, as it objectively is a pathetic disgrace of a film."
"guitarron01","7","373","605","7 August 2013"," It is flawed and by no means anywhere near on the same level as D9 but its solid entertainment and a smarter than average sci/fi film.
","Matt Damon stars in the Sci-fi/political thriller Elysium, Neill Blomkamp's follow up to District 9, along with Jodie Foster as Elysium's Secretary Delacourt and Sharlto Copley as the main villain Kruger. Is Elysium on par with Oscar nominated District 9? Absolutely NOT! Not even close but it is still a solid sci/fi entertainment. It is a more conventional film than its predecessor, which I was not expecting from Blomkamp.<br/><br/>The film starts of very cliché and gave me some eye roll moments but it quickly picks itself up from reaching into mediocrity. They way it does this is by evoking political messages through out the film in relevance with today's society. Questioning our handling with immigration, military power, our health care. Which I found to be important in this film. Obviously me and Blomkamp share each others political stance. For anyone else it might seem like its trying to oversell its message.<br/><br/>I felt most of the cast were very under used. Jodie Foster's character really didn't have much to work with. She was just there to move the plot forward. Matt Damon served his purpose as the lead but by no means of the imagination is this one of his best performances. They were all over shadowed by Sharlto Copley. My God, is he great as Kruger! Right away we are introduced into this provocative-sociopath with no regard for human life. The story really needed this kind of menacing character. He is by far the film's best positive. Another negative aspect of this film would be its pacing. When we are given emotional scenes they don't stay long enough to settle and doesn't give that emotional impact you were hoping for.<br/><br/>Like District 9 it delivers on the the beautiful imagery. Using the very best Weta Workshop has to offer. From its big guns to the human-like robots, to the space station of Elysium. The action set pieces were just as exciting as its predecessor. The film really manages to capture all its budget on screen. My biggest issue comes from the excessive use of shaky cam. It was used when the characters were simply walking to the action sequences. I felt ninety percent of this film was shaky cam. Which got me a little dizzy since I ,unfortunately, got to sit in the very front of the theater. That might have something to do with it as well.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp has established once again that he can compete with the best Directors of the genre films. Elysium shows more flaws than his first film but they are overwhelmed by its positive aspects, to me at least. It was not a disappointment and it was a solid popcorn entertainment and a smarter than average sci/fi film."
"plpregent","7","70","106","10 September 2013"," Competent film with unexploited potential, but satisfying nonetheless
","I tend to be curious every time a talented filmmaker gets to direct a film set in a pessimistic future/post-apocalyptic era : visually, it's the perfect setting for desolated landscapes and amazing images of urban chaos ; story-wise, it's the perfect occasion to insert social commentary and establish more or less subtle metaphors about our current way of life, our current values, and extend in a fictitious way many assumptions that we have regarding the fate of mankind and our very own planet. <br/><br/>In my opinion, it has to be one of science-fiction's most important sub-genres, since it leaves so much room to contemporary concerns (the environment, pollution, wars, immigration, etc.). Films like ""Children of Men"", ""Looper"", and ""The Road"" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : ""Children of Men"" was an ode to life, ""Looper"" felt a lot like a modern-day western, ""The Road"" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, ""Elysium"", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with ""District 9"", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>The first third of ""Elysium"" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in ""District 9"". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in ""District 9"", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in ""Elysium"". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.<br/><br/>Then the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while ""Elysium"" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of ""Elysium"", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package."
"cousbrojs","8","332","573","14 August 2013"," Wow
","Before watching Elysium, I read every review about it. And it seems to me that there are a lot of people that hated it. Most have said that the message in the film is what kept it 'likable'. Well, after I watched it, I thought to myself, ""Why?"". Trust me, don't believe any negative reviews about this film. Yes, it's flawed, but the film itself is really good.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was great in this film and he was a very likable hero. But Sharlto Copley, oh boy, he was one heck of a villain. He was so good, every scene he was in was disturbing, in a very, very creepy way. He owned almost every scene he was in and was the stronghold of this film. Jodie Foster as the other antagonist, err, she did her part I guess. Every one did a good job and they really enabled the film to lighten up in most areas.<br/><br/>So, this film was really good, and I was extremely pleased by it. The film did a nice job for making the audience feel attached to the characters, and I applaud to that. The action sequences were nice, and it didn't over power the film, something Elysium got right and what others sort of didn't. (Man Of Steel's epic final battle, was just TOO LONG!) Also on the scenes where it tones down and becomes emotional, was very well done, and it gives this movie heart. It's fast, epic, emotional and incredible.<br/><br/>Now, although the film is great, I only have one small gripe about Elysium. Now, the film is around about 109 minutes. I know, that when a film feels really good and it begins to near it's end, you don't want it to do that just yet. That's how I felt when I saw District 9, and I felt the same with Elysium. The film didn't feel rushed which was nice, but an extra half an hour would've been great.<br/><br/>Is it a Sci-Fi movie? Yes! Is it an action movie? It gets to it. Is it an epic Sci-Fi action movie? Yes. It is epic! It's definitely a must watch this year. I'm being generous to this film, because of the film's message consisting of poverty, wealth and equality. Watch this film with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>8/10"
"aracataca16","4","220","374","8 August 2013"," This story was terrible, but the effects were a little cool.
","So bad. They don't make you care about ANY of the characters and the storytelling is awful. You barely get to see Elysium, it's just like 3 guys in sweaters in a country club drinking champagne for like 5 seconds, and there's a little bit of grass and a few trees. Like really? That didn't even look that cool. **Spoiler I guess** Matt Damon is dying the whole movie from some exposure to radiation, and that is the only reason he is trying to go to Elysium. They should have at least made that little girl his secret daughter or something, so that you could actually care about him saving her. Her mongoose and hippo story was painful to watch, even thought it was the only time Matt Damon and the little girl actually interacted. Kruger (the main villain) was okay I guess. He had a cool accent and beard, but he wasn't that tough or threatening though.<br/><br/>It was just some Mexican people on post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, with no health care and dirty clothes, and Matt Damon dying for a few days. Then he gets some tech-suit that makes him a tiny bit stronger and he punches like one guy and then nothing happens. They should show people on Elysium freaking out and worrying about people from Earth coming. The people on Elysium did nothing except swim in a pool and sit on a chair.<br/><br/>The only cool thing on Elysium was that bed that healed people. I mean couldn't they have a little more cool futuristic stuff? Touchscreens? Cool shirts or sunglasses? More sci-fi stuff. I mean it is the year 2154, I would think technology would be a lot more advanced. Jodie Foster's control room had like CRT monitors it was so bad. The robot animations and models were well done though.<br/><br/>The story and characters weren't developed at all, and there was barely any action. I haven't seen District 9, but there's no way it can be as bad as this. I really wanted to like it, because the trailer and concept looked awesome. I usually like Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Diego Luna and their acting was fine, but this movie could have been so much better if they fixed the story. I felt like Matt Damon didn't really give a crap about helping all the people on Earth, and he never even made out with the hot chick...<br/><br/>I love the concept surrounding the themes about health care, wealth inequality, social status and immigration, but nothing really tied it all together or developed these themes and this is what was missing. That's what this movie should be about, not some guy who is dying and doesn't want to die. It should have been about resistance, and inspire you to want to make a difference in the way we currently live."

","WOW! This movie is just awful. They call it Science Fiction but there is no science in it...only really bad fiction.<br/><br/>Have you ever noticed in these kind of futuristic society stories they never really explain how society got to the current state it is in at the start of the movie? There is a reason why. There is no possible way that such a stupid societal construct could ever come to be! So ...like a Paul Krugman economic theory...the answer is that the construct exists because the premise starts out saying ""Let's assume that all logic and common sense goes out the door.""(!)<br/><br/>Evidently in the future only future Los Angeles and Elysium exist. Supposedly the world is ravaged by population and disease but there are no Asians or EEU or South American or African members...or even Washington, DC, involved with Elysium! EVERY POLITICALLY SYSTEM GLOBALL JUST SOMEHOW UP AND VANISHED! DOH! So...Elysium is built and lived on evidently by only Hollywood types who rule the planet! The internet as we know it has also completely vanished. So has e-mail and cell phone technology...but you can still get a good deal on GMC vehicles that look like leftover Road Warrior vehicles! <br/><br/>Matt Damon (say it Team America-like) works in a factory where he...I guess...builds robots (?). That's a little unclear. But...he is stupidly badgered into some sort of elevator style ""heat-treatment"" booth by his superior. Since their is no OSHA anymore his character gets trapped in the room where they...get this!...dose the robots WITH HUMAN KILLING RADIATION! Now...there's like no big signs up anywhere in this factory that say WARNING: RADIATION AT WORK! It is never explained why robots need radiation treatment but that is what they do. AND...get this!...when the treatment is done the radiation ""magically"" disappears! People just walk in and out of the room! Like...WTF!??!!!??? How does radiation magically dissipate or get moved out of a room? IT DOESN'T! Unless all science goes out the window! <br/><br/>Poor Matt. Now he has 4 days to live because of Radiation poisoning and he is very ill and can barely walk or stay awake or keep from puking...for about 5 minutes! The rest of the movie he is hooked up to a biometric-ally controlled exoskeleton and Matt never shows any effects of radiation poisoning and he fights his way all over LA and Elysium! So...in a complete Johnny Mnemonic rip off (they should sue)...Matt Damon has the magic data in his skull and people want his head. How this all comes about is so incredibly ridiculously stupid and unbelievable I wanted to throw things at the screen.<br/><br/>Matt then shows up with a grenade with the pin pulled out and his hand holding the grenade from exploding and he demands a ride to Elysium or he will blow his head off. So...not strapped in...and with no refueling of any sort at all...the ship just flies off on a 12 minute flight to Elysium! So...they are breaking through Earth's atmosphere with the super rocket powered ship...he is not strapped in and is holding a grenade...AND THERE IS NO BLEEPING G FORCE CAUSING ANY ISSUES! <br/><br/>The final ""evil guy\good guy"" fight is just awful. The ""evil guy"" basically runs around saying ""I could kill you but I will continue to spout stupid statements to drag this out until you...and this will be SUCH A SURPRISE...manage to overcome and defeat me because I kept just spouting off at the mouth rather than just killing you!"" <br/><br/>This is after Matt goes to the armory and rescues the girly and Leukemia ridden daughter(tug my bleeding heartstrings). Now...dig this...3 bad guys are taking over Elysium...there is a big armory with plenty of weapons...AND NO ONE IS COMING TO GRAB THE WEAPONS AND TO STOP THE 3 MAN COUP OF ELYSIUM! DOH!!<br/><br/>To call this a craptacular is an insult to crap. This is just big money lazy story writing pushing a phony agenda. And it is just awful"
"ben-mulligan","2","116","205","12 August 2013"," No heart in this film
","I thoroughly enjoyed Neill Blomkamp's previous film, ""District Nine"". That film succeeded because of its well-written, interesting characters, uniquely lived-in futuristic setting, and, most importantly, its emotional core. Unfortunately, Blomkamp's newest project has fallen far short of my expectations. ""Elysium"" is utterly dull. In spite of an aesthetic that almost exactly mirrors that of ""District Nine"", ""Elysium"" lacks the characters or attention to plot details that would have made the movie work. Instead, it falls flat in almost every way. <br/><br/>Most notable in failure is Jody Foster, whose character is insufficiently developed to explain away her perpetual foul mood and all-encompassing anger - this is as two-dimensional a character as any I've seen. However, almost no facet of the movie IS well-developed: there are several 'emotional' moments in the movie that lack impact simply because the audience is given no time to get to know the characters involved before these important events occur. There's simply no reason for an audience member to care about a character who's only had ten or fifteen lines of generic dialogue in well less than five minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>I was irritated that Blomkamp was unable to recapture the emotional connection that made ""District Nine"" special to me. While there was clearly a moral message to this movie, it was ham-fisted in execution and ultimately meaningless. A montage at the very end of the movie's lengthy action finale emphasizes the weight of the choice that our hero made, but what's the point of making that choice if the audience must be inundated with recycled footage and clichés to make the connections that are vital to making the moment emotionally meaningful? Blomkamp doesn't seem to have trusted his audience to make these connections, and that's the final insult. ""Elysium"" is not a smart movie, and it doesn't expect its audience to be any smarter. As I walked out of the theater, I could remember only one or two names from the whole feature - that alone speaks volumes for how forgettable a film this really is. ""Elysium"" tries to hide its lack of heart by battering the audience into thinking it should care... But, as in all of the other important areas, it falls far short of its goal."
"pascaloetterli","7","90","157","19 August 2013"," Entertaining Science-Fiction with some flaws
","Elysium<br/><br/>Elysium is at one point disappointing and at the other it is fine. It's a Dystopia which does not look like it could be too far away from the present. The longer you think about it, Elyisum already happens everywhere, and Neill Blomkamp is a South African native, so it becomes clear, that the message is about poverty and money in the future. The difficulty making such a future logic and scientifically well, is obvious, and it is not completely convincing. There lies the main problem of a sci-fi movie. You make either a starwarsy fairy tale or you have to make it very, very believable like the director's much acclaimed ""District 9"". <br/><br/>Plotwise it reminded me of ""Wall-E"" (which was better), ""Oblivion"", ""Escape from NY"" and some anime type plots . The story was very predictable from the beginning and for my taste, it could have been made completely PG 18 in terms of violence, to make it darker and more grim. Now, it looks a bit indecisive. The actors were fine, especially the less known, like Copley, Luna and Moura. Jodie Foster is great here, reminded me a bit of Tilda Swintons performance in ""Michael Clayton"". Matt Damon is a good actor, but he's a bit overused lately. In comparison to ""Pacific Rim"" it's clear, why the audience is more happy with Del Toros skyscraper-style movie: it's pure entertainment, reality is far away and the violence is very mild - you hate it or you love it.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I was well entertained by this. I liked the strong hints of real present problems. I disliked the predictable way the story unfolds, the overall mixture of action and violence and some illogic details.

","Just what exactly do you expect when you go to see a good Sci-fi movie? Great visuals? Computer effects? Sure, they add a lot to a movie, but they are not part of its' ""soul"". However, all that big studios do these days is target the 90% of the population and sell crappy plot wrapped in special effects and good reliable clichés (like the ""hero fighting the main villain at the end of the movie"" scene). But hey, why not? That's what makes money. Because 90% of the population - those people who actually think this was a good movie, those who are responsible for the tabloid press being the most popular media - those will LOVE this movie. It's about them. About poor uneducated people who overpopulated the Earth and practically destroyed it. They are willing to overlook the laughable plot holes like the one where Foster talks to the Carlyle character. She asks him if he can reboot the system of Elysium and make her a president. And the answer? Of course I can! - Really? Really?! Just like that? Well why didn't you do it earlier than and make yourself a president instead of begging her for new contracts? I agree with other reviews that talk about the weak plot, shallow characters and poor acting. However, there is one more thing to point out: What is the message of this movie? That we are all equal? Cuz the way I see it, our hero makes everyone on the Earth a legal citizen of Elysium, so that everyone can be cured and they can all thrive under the sun, without any diseases and health problems, and continue to overpopulate the Earth as before, making it even more miserable a place to live. Lets make more cute children and don't think about the consequences. Natural selection people!!!"
"top_quark","5","55","94","14 August 2013"," Disappointing on so many levels
","As an avid Sci-Fi fan, I was eager to see the last big SF movie of the summer. The trailer seemed exciting and both director/screenwriter Neill Blomkamp and the main star Mat Damon are big names, so I had some expectations (not very high, mind you). Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disappointment. So, let start with the post mortem.<br/><br/>The good. This will be a short section. Good special effects, both the CGI and the stunts were spectacular. Elysium was great. The cinematography was fine. There were some cool ideas like the exoskeleton (not that original but it was well done nonetheless).<br/><br/>The bad. Everything else. The plot was a mess, the characters were unlikable and/or underdeveloped, the character motivation was absolutely ridiculous and the character development (when there was any) was rushed and artificial.<br/><br/>The main character Max is not a likable person. All the sympathy I had towards him quickly vanished when he tried to be a smart ass around the robot cops in the beginning of the movie. How stupid you have to be do such a thing when you have a long rap sheet and are still on parole? We are supposed to believe that there was a big love story between Max and his childhood sweetheart and yet they haven't seen each other for decades. He didn't even know she had a kid. The extensive flashbacks to the 10-year old Max were nothing more than a diversion from the extremely underdeveloped characters.<br/><br/>The boss of the smugglers to Elysium is only interested in money, which is fine and realistic but at the middle of the movie he has a sudden and inexplicable change of hart and everything he wants is to help his fellow citizens. Never mind that he practically killed a lot of them, taking all of their money for 1% chance to be healed and 99% chance to be killed.<br/><br/>All villains are cardboard cutouts without any soul. Maybe this is a consequence of the heavy-handed political propaganda but nonetheless you will rarely find more ridiculous and unbelievable villains. Kruger had hilarious accent and the Jodi Foster was very weak as the ""tough"" but extremely transparent and stupid anti-immigration official of Elysium.<br/><br/>Now the smaller but still annoying things: 1. You have 3 ships that are just few hundred kilometers from Elysium but to take them down, you have to call a man on Earth, who launches 4 Stinger rockets in space and they fly with something like a 1000 miles per second to strike the ships about 10 to 15 seconds later. Absolutely deranged. Why not launch missiles from the space station itself? Wait, I know why! To introduce us to Kruger. Weak, weak writing, Mr. Blomkamp.<br/><br/>2. The atmosphere of Elysium just stands there even though there is nothing above to hold it in place. Well, the Moon and Mars are not big enough to hold significant atmosphere with their gravitational field, but a space station less than 500 kilometers across is? Would it kill them to have a force field or something to keep the air in place? Again extremely stupid.<br/><br/>3. You can be revived 15 minutes after you face is blown by a grenade because ""your brain is still intact"". Still, when you are shot in the heart or bleed to dead with severed artery, you are beyond saving. Wait, what? 4. A man with crappy exoskeleton is tougher than a military robot.<br/><br/>5. There are robots everywhere and they seem really capable but the corporations still need low-skilled workers to work on assembly lines doing mundane, simple task that even now are done by robots.<br/><br/>I can continue but it's really painful. I hope that most of these shortcomings are caused by the need to shove down our throats the simplistic political views of the director because the alternative is to think that District 9 was just plain luck.<br/><br/>Compare this BS with the Slumdog millionaire and you will see a movie that effectively carries a social commentary with much better plot, characters and message.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 stars and I'm extremely generous."

Everything including all the fight scenes were executed flawlessly. Coming out of this movie I had close to no complaints. The writing was a bit dodgy in some areas, but the great acting and effects quickly draw you back into the story. Neil Blomkamp, who dazzled audiences with district nine 4 years prior, does a fantastic job once again with this flick. His vision made the story very real to movie goers everywhere.

"S_Craig_Zahler","3","106","192","12 August 2013"," looks like science fiction, but isn't: simple-minded, heavy handed and dramatically silly
","Like the extremely overrated District 9, Elysium's lone strength is its convincing special effects and its weaknesses are in every other area. Although there is nothing as terribly stupid as the District 9 ""alien blood that can bond with human DNA ... and also power spaceships,"" Elysium is heavy handed allegory, amped up drama and dramatically ridiculous.<br/><br/>Some of the ships and robots are great to look at---seeing Syd Mead's name in the credits was not a big surprise.<br/><br/>Since the days of Hitchcock people seemed to have forgotten that the first and most important job of a director is not to come up with 'cool visuals,' but direct actors. Ergo, the title, 'director.' <br/><br/>So congrats to Blomkamp for showing me the first truly terrible Jodie Foster performance. It's like he showed her a 1960s spider-man cartoon and said, 'like this but bigger.' And a lot of her work was dubbed for some reason, likely accent inconsistency (even though it's still inconsistent in the end product). And i am a HUGE William Fichtner fan, but this movie also showcases his career nadir. Sometimes he seems to be imitating Data from Star Trek, other times, sort of German. And Copley as the villain...well if there is a less menacing accent than this, i haven't heard it. And he is of course, way, way over the top as he was in District 9 (though he was decent in Europa Report). Damon is the only performer whose work is credible, probably because he's a big enough star to just say no if Blomkamp wants to turn him into a screaming cartoon.<br/><br/>In terms of story, don't expect any science or anything other than good versus evil. Sadly, with rare exception, Hollywood science fiction movies are really just noisy action movies these days, and as a huge science fiction fan I know i'll rarely see any interesting scientific elements in these (though the movies of Duncan Jones and Kosinski do have some smart ideas and are the exceptions). So no, Elysium isn't sci-fi, but just heavy handed action movie allegory, more or less the same class warfare of District 9, so he's already retreading this theme. Then there is the would-be action centerpiece exo-skeletal suit, an idea that doesn't work at all, and isn't well sold visually. Really, as designed, this thing wouldn't work without tearing off fingers and smashing the limbs of its user, which is why most exo-skeletal designs are also armor that could shield a water-based lifeform. In any case, the actions scenes are so shaky and over cut, it's hard to see what's happening regardless. But I never had even a moment of thinking the thing actually functioned or would function.<br/><br/>Blomkamp clearly has a political viewpoint---one that I have no issue with at all, except that it makes his writing too pedantic and monochromatic. A strong viewpoint does not make one a good writer. Writing rich people are bad and poor people are good is not dramatically compelling to watch, even if you actually believe things are that simple. Look at the success George RR Martin is having with complex characters...Blomkamp's writing seems like that of a child by comparison. That Elysium is self-important and humorless, doesn't help.<br/><br/>And if Blomkamp (who clearly should not write his own movies) really understood science fiction the way actual science fiction writers do---guys like Greg Egan, JMS, Ted Chiang, Arthur C. Clarke, Greg Bear, M. John Harrison, Stephen Baxter, Larry Niven, etc.--- he would not have a future world technology where humans can be rebuilt at an atomic level in the same world as one in which robots fire guns and miss their targets. (!!!) Robots hitting their targets when they fire is near future and to some extent, current; rebuilding bodies at an atomic level (in less than a minute) is very, very, very far future, if ever. <br/><br/>But like most Hollywood junk---and the similarly stupid, crazily overrated breakthrough success District 9--- Blomkamp is doing something that looks like science fiction, but isn't."
"ZeusBurgess","1","63","110","16 August 2013"," Not as good as these reviews indicate...
","Warning, SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!! SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>One illogically plotted moment after another, dumb dialog, single dimension characters and needlessly pornographic violence don't usually make for a good movie and, folks, Elysium is no exception. Like many always willing American male age-group-focused audience members with fifteen bucks to burn for a good Hollywood spectacle, I can usually deal with the latter three faults in my summer blockbusters, but perhaps unlike those imaginary people, when a screenwriter doesn't bother to craft a coherent plot, I tend to check out early and start analyzing what's wrong with the script. (Maybe I wasn't focus-grouped enough.)<br/><br/>And so I'm here on IMDb to share my thoughts.<br/><br/>Aren't you lucky?<br/><br/>Shall we?<br/><br/>Elysium, like many bad films, does not come up with compelling reasons to care about its characters. <br/><br/>What do I mean? Flash forward to the finale. This is the critical denouement between the protagonist, an ex-con played by Matt Damon and his love-interest, actress Alice Walker, a nurse who also seems to be Matt's ex-childhood friend. Matt has battled his way to the heart of Elysium, a giant Earth-orbiting space habitat whose residents enjoy near-magical healing technology. This, in order to save himself from cancer. Alice's daughter happens to also have cancer in need of Elysium's magic healing. Alice and her daughter are there too. Deep Breath: In this scene Matt has to zap his brain to transfer a special computer code to reset Elysium, so he, the daughter and all other non- residents who don't have a special members-only laser-tag branded on their forearms can have life-saving medical intervention via the futuristic healing machines only located on Elysium (yes, it's that convoluted...). Matt can't save himself, though: he will die as a result of the transfer having some kind of weird built-in brain booby-trap. Silliness of this plot aside, in a well-crafted story, we might buy in, and find satisfaction in Matt's sacrifice for the daughter. But in Elysium, this moment falls flat. It feels like an afterthought because there was not a relationship established earlier.<br/><br/>Flash back to first and second acts. To establish the bond between these characters we have a brief, somewhat romantic scene with kid Matt saying he'll take kid Alice to Elysian ""some day"". (This scene is rehashed sporadically throughout the film.) We have a shot of one of Matt's tattoos which recalls a moment from that one romantic scene. And we have Matt meeting Alice again as an adult and discovering that she's finally realized her long held dream of becoming a nurse. Here he mentions, meekly, that it might be great for the two to get back together again. In one other romance set-up scene, Matt is briefly surprised when he meets Alice's daughter while seeking shelter with Alice when he's on the run from evil Elysium agents. And that's it for relationship building.<br/><br/>What else happened with these two? What about the relationship after they were kids? What separated them? How about now? They don't kiss. They don't get back together. They don't seem to even like each other. Matt is focused solely on saving himself. What about the daughter? doesn't she have cancer, too? It's telling that Blomkamp can't physically connect Matt, Alice and the daughter in the final scene when we're asked to care about their relationship and experience Matt's sacrifice for them. Not much really connects them in the film, either. They say their goodbyes via walkie-talkie.<br/><br/>Rather than focus on a strong central plot (like, Matt must rescue his love interest's daughter from cancer) along with two, at most three, logically supporting subplots (like, Matt must destroy Elysium, restore love of the ex-girlfriend, save humanity...) the film sets up all its problems as equal: Matt Damon has cancer, he needs to go to Elysium; his ex-sweetheart's daughter has cancer, she needs to go to Elysium; all the people of Earth are sick, they need to go to Elysium. All the baddies must go down. Each conflict competes to be the central theme of the movie, and none win. <br/><br/>In a better film, Alice and Matt's relationship might be fully explored in the first act. Instead, every moment in Elysium we have seems like one of my nine year old son's ""and then Dad, and then Dad, and then Dad"" stories. The only thing missing are the Minecraft references.<br/><br/>To be sure, the central message of the movie is a good one: that we are all equally human and so deserve the same opportunity to have a good life, and good heath, wherever we may happen to live. It's particularly well-suited to our contemporary social landscape. But before I can care about this message, I need characters I can care about and a story that makes sense too.<br/><br/>To like this movie, you must believe that on Elysium there's technology that can cure any disease instantly, but that for some reason it can't be duplicated on Earth, not even partially, where fantastic technology also exists, just not quite that fantastic.<br/><br/>Blomkamp is an amazingly talented, visual virtuoso but, unfortunately, a garage band screenwriter. Please, Hollywood, hire this genius a good screenwriter."

","This movie is a serious competitor with After Earth for worst sci-fi movie of 2013. While After Earth was the result of wealthy Will Smith's nepotism, the question of why Elysium ever came to be is more of a mystery. The longer you watch this movie, the more you forget about the ridiculous fantastical story, and will just see wealthy actors boring you. The contrasting uber-polarization between rich and poor was made to be so obvious, particularly with the rich having a machine that instantly fixes any health issue - and somehow the poor run a space program - that it is simply childish and unbelievable. The director obviously had dough for proved talent Matt Damon and plenty of special effects, but it just doesn't add up to anything. The villain is an absolute annoying joke - and I guess villains are to be hated - but maybe not for the reasons I did, which was: ""Why can't I take this guy seriously?"" and ""I hate the sound of this guy's voice"". And unfortunately the villain isn't the only annoying thing about this movie: the entire thing is torture comparable to a steaming pile of poo held under your nose for over an hour.

","They did a fantastic job on effects, particularly the rebuilding of a face, and bodies breaking apart. The characters and storyline were collateral damage. OK, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster cannot be brought back to life?? The villain was brought back to life after being dead two hours and half his head cut off! Stupid. I wanted to see more of Elysium. Isn't that why you go to the movies? To escape and be wowed and be privy to a fantasy world?? There was NONE of that. You literally see as much of Elysium as is shown in the trailer. About three quick scenes. No characters are developed on Elysium. There could have been so much fun to show life and technology and decadence, but the characters don't even do their fight scenes in the fancy houses, they fight in a factory setting! Guess it saved a lot of money on sets! The jittery hand-held camera work was bad. No need to edit the scenes since they are blurry and choppy and you can't see what is going on anyway. Matt Damon, a kick ass actor who was given nothing. I could care less if he ends up with his leading woman. No real moments, just clichés and they had absolutely NO chemistry. She lives in a dump with her daughter and no husband, and when hunky Matt Damon asks her out she says NO?? WTF? It sucked and then she tells him her daughter is dying and he walks out the door. (Except for a cheesy scene which was like a Hallmark moment.) BTW all the cute little girls on Earth were dying of a disease that could only be cured on Elysium. The kids were too cutesy and did not have real personalities. Another complaint is that I truly did NOT want the people of earth to get to Elysium. They were unlikeable. Why is it that they were portrayed as filthy and greasy?? I know plenty of people without money who are nice and clean and neat as a pin. They were criminals and just plain gross. They cannot brush their hair? Matt Damon is the only one who works in his neighborhood? It was like the filmmakers were bigots toward impoverished people to portray them that way. Oh yeah, and Matt is exposed to a full dose of radiation at the start of the film, and THEN he saves the world? I'm sorry, make him have liver failure or cancer or an infection. DO NOT give him acute radiation poisoning and expect us to believe he can carry on, have major surgery, recover and save the world. Duh. And BTW, why would all these criminals let him even come near them when he is contaminated? I also think they should have made the earthlings surgery much cleaner. It was stupid to believe Matt could recover from surgery in that filthy chop shop. His apparatus bolted into his body was ridiculous. It was like two tire pumps screwed into him. The chop shop was another reason to dislike the earthlings. Organization does not cost anything. They could be organized and have lights in their surgery. They have a huge war room with technology so why no lights? They had water, and I'm sorry, if you are sitting around all day with no day job, you can learn how to make your own soap! Jodie Foster did what she could. I wanted to see more of her party, her house, her life. Would have been so cool to have Matt Damon sneak up there and have an affair with her or something. Now that would have been a good story. Jodie looks absolutely beautiful. Villain was super annoying. He was like spitting out one-liners constantly and I hated him because he was annoying, not scary. Another thing they did was make all the houses the criminals (earthlings) broke into empty. No one was ever in the Elysium houses. Why? Because you did not want to write dialog? Maybe there would be a nice family who would help. It would have been so much more satisfying. It was just so lacking in any personality, I feel bad because I think they must have had a limited budget or something, so no time spent on the story or scenes of Elysium. It could have been great, so it was a lost opportunity."
"januaryman-1","5","20","32","19 August 2013"," Not Sci-Fi; Political Caricature
","I read reviews that claimed Elysium was thought provoking. It did generate a lot of questions, one of which was what the Afrikaaners with their grossly thick accents were saying. Yes, Afrikaaners. I haven't seen this many villainous Apartheid goons since Lethal Weapon 2. The villains aren't explicitly identified as being from any country because countries have been replaced by classes, but the accents of Delacort and the band of murderous mercenaries sound Afrikanner to me. Elysium is presided over by an Indian, inhabited by Caucasions, protected by white supremacists who seem to be Africa's sole representation. That leave Hispanics back on Earth. The Earth-side scenes are set in a futuristic Los Angeles that looks a lot like a Mexico City slum. The only Anglos in sight are the evil industrialist and his taskmasters...and Matt Damon. With characters painted with such a broad brush, why wasn't the protagonist' part filled by a Latino? The re-emergence of Afrikaaners as villains puzzled me until I realized that the director/writer is South African. I guess everyone has his favorite group of villains. Blomkamp's villains also include the wealthy. His heavy-handed portrayals of rich Caucasions turns everyone in this film into a caricature. I'm reminded of Rand's We the Living where rich capitalists not only oppress the people, they run over someone's puppy too. The heavy-handed absence of subtlety is typical of philosophical works. I guess that makes Elysium more of a philosophical statement than science fiction. This is a criticism of Rand's seminal work Atlas Shrugged, and it holds true for more leftward leaning dogma too. Everything is good or bad. People are evil rich or sanctified poor. The rich seem to have the resources to cast crumbs to the poor, but they won't because don't want to. The film makers turned Elysium is liberal tripe, even throwing in a quick anti-gun remark just before using those guns to fight back against their tyrannical yoke.<br/><br/>The special effects are okay. Elysium is probably the least impressive of images. The mercs airship is probably the most impressive effect but even it is nothing special.<br/><br/>It's hard to judge the actors' performances because of their comic strip dialog, but Sharlto Copley makes a damned good villain. His only fault really was his heavy accent made it difficult to understand him at times. His character even had a bit of depth in contrast to the one-dimensional nature of the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Elysium makes a so-so way to spend an afternoon...if you don't mind being slapped around for having money enough to buy a ticket, popcorn, and soda."
"mjnomaps","5","23","38","11 January 2014"," How did they get Matt Damon and Jodie Foster to do this film?
","I think the director, Neill Blomkamp, must have blackmailed them into it. Or maybe he held their dogs hostage? Because, if they read the script, they had to have known that all the special-effects in the world wouldn't save it.<br/><br/>I LOVE sci-fi. But I hated this film. In fact, I'm angry that this film was released. Just as we've finally started getting some good sci-fi movies produced, this thing comes along. And presto, sci-fi gets a bad reputation, once again.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble deciding which was worse; the plot or the camera work. <br/><br/>Just kidding. It's the plot! The plot is one dimensional characters we don't care about, fighting a war we don't care about. In fact, more than once during the movie, I was hoping the bad guys would just kill Damon's character. That would put us BOTH out of our misery.<br/><br/>The camera work and editing isn't much better, and hits a low in the fight scenes. Watching the fight scenes is like trying to watch vegetables being chopped in a food processor. Jump cut, jump cut, jump cut. Who's winning? Damon? No, the zucchini.<br/><br/>I won't even try to cover all the failings of the ""science"" part of this sci-fi. There's no way to chronicle the errors and inconsistencies, and stay within the 1,000 word limit. <br/><br/>But here's a tip for future sci-fi directors: If you use a 1950's style circular space station, please SPIN it! At least a little bit. Because that's why space stations are circular, so they can spin to generate artificial gravity."

","Can't tell you how great it is to see someone capable of filling Ridley Scott's and James Cameron's shoes! Blomkamp has made the best movie yet this year. I was intrigued by District 9. It made me think, but this self-assured and skillfully crafted effort is taking his game to a much higher level.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I was in awe of both the script and the direction. To see they both came from one guy, Neill Blomkamp, is wonderful if a little unnerving. Do we really have to rely on foreigners for biting social commentary?<br/><br/>This film is much more clever than most reviewers are letting on. One reviewer said it's a bit melodramatic, but, frankly, I don't see a subtle treatment getting to first base with most Americans. This puts a lot of troubling issues in sharp relief in an artful, very watchable format whereas most of the arguments about immigration, healthcare and the rich versus the poor are in dense, boring prose.<br/><br/>I was warned that Jodie Foster's performance was marred by odd accents, but I barely noticed. I thought she depicted a kind of sharp edged conservative that should be readily recognizable. Sharlto Copley is great as a vicious soldier and Matt Damon is the likable center of the film, as called for. The supporting actors including Braga, Luna and Fichtner, to name a few, all add much to the whole enterprise.<br/><br/>This is definitely a go see and I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, including pre-teens and up."

","Having read mostly great reviews, professional & amateur, as well as having watched the trailer, I was very very enthusiastic about this movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a great cast, stunning computer graphics, and even an IMAX screen could not rescue this poor and patch worked story-line.<br/><br/>If you had never seen any major SCIFI or action adventure movie before seeing Elyseum, you might just be able to let your imagination get carried along in this movie.

"rgblakey","7","17","27","8 August 2013"," Matt Damon will do whatever it takes to get to Elysium
","Of all the genre's out there, science fiction seems to be the one rarely getting it right these days. When Neill Blomkamp burst onto the screen with his gritty racial commentary film District 9 it changed the genre for the better. Now he is back with his latest look at the future with Elysium and is bringing Matt Damon along for the ride. The trailers looked to deliver a similar vision of his previous film, but does it pack the same punch both in the story as well as visually?<br/><br/>Elysium follows a man desperate to get to Elysium, a space station where the very wealthy live in a pristine world, while the rest of the human race remain on an overpopulated ruined Earth. With nothing left to lose, he takes on a mission against Elysium's secretary Delacourt and the entire system to save himself as well as the millions of others on Earth. Once again Blomkamp has created a film that not only entertains but has numerous levels of social commentary without ever getting overly preachy. This time out there seems to be the health care system, over population, and pollution that all make up this world these characters inhabit. Matt Damon continues to deliver with him really stepping it up even more than usual here. What is great about his character is that he feels more like a normal guy with flaws and a reluctant hero forced into this situation as opposed to wanting to be there. You feel his desperation and in turn can imagine the rest of the planet and what they are going through. District 9 star Sharlto Copley plays a completely different type of character and is a complete badass. He steals every scene he is in and is near unrecognizable in this role. Every time he steps on screen you know something great is going to happen. The always great William Fichtner has a brief but not surprisingly good presence here. Jodi Foster is the only that just doesn't seem to work all that well. Her performance felt forced at times and she seemed to float in and out of the strange accent she is trying to use. The visuals are gritty, dirty, and beautiful all at once and are the main catalyst to make this film come to life. There is plenty of action here and at first seems to be playing it a bit safe, but quickly proves otherwise as the film moves forward.<br/><br/>This is one of the best science fiction films to come along in some time and has everything you could possibly want. Most will just watch this movie and see the action spectacle and cool visuals, but this film is so much more. Pay attention to the story and what it is trying to tell you and this film will have a greater effect on you. Some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, but overall still gets the message across all while delivering a bad ass action science fiction film that should not be missed."

And what about the plainness and shallowness of the story? One could guess every step of this mess until it was at last finished.<br/><br/>But if there was something that really did bother me was the arrogance and hypocrisy of the film makers to present this piece of trash as a social allegory, a moral message, something very wise and profound that could help us all became better human beings and turn this horrid world into a better place. Let us open the frontiers, let us all share our wealth and smile kindly at our brothers they say.

It's one thing when you can see the ending of a movie from the first second, it's an other thing when there are absolutely no surprising twists and turns during the film. The whole thing seemed like something pushed out by a random scifi script generator. Add a few movie stars, and you have a summer block(BUST)er. For me a good scifi starts with a good story, so after the epic fail in that area, I wouldn't even want to comment on anything else (like acting, special effects, directing, etc).

","In 2154, the population is divided in two social classes: the wealthy people live in Elysium, a space station with all the resources; the poor people lives in the exhausted Earth. <br/><br/>In Los Angeles, the former car thief Max da Costa (Matt Damon) is on parole and works on an unhealthy factory Armadyne managed by the CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner). He dreams on saving money to travel to Elysium. Meanwhile the Secretary of Defense of Elysium, Delacourt (Jodie Foster), plots a coup-of-stat against President Patel (Faran Tahir), with the support of Carlyle. He programs a software that can override Elysium's data system and make any change, including the president's name to Delacourt. Carlyle uploads the software to his brain to increase its protection. <br/><br/>Max is exposed to a lethal amount of radiation in Armadyne and has only five more days of life. He seeks out the criminal Spider (Wagner Moura) expecting to travel to Elysium, where he can use a medical chamber called Med-bay that is capable to heal any disease and save his life. Spider tells that if Max steals profitable information, such as bank accounts, from the brain of Carlyle that is on Earth, he would get his ticket to Elysium. Max accepts the proposal without knowing the powerful knowledge in Carlyle's brain. When Delacourt learns that the information she needs to become president was stolen from Carlyle brain, she sends the notorious agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to hunt down Max and recover the software at any cost. <br/><br/>""Elysium"" is another great sci-fi by Neill Blomkamp, the director and writer of ""District 9"", with a different fight of classes. The poor people live in Los Angeles, now a big slum, and the rich people lives in Elysium, the Elysian Fields from the Greek Mythology and meaning a place or condition of ideal happiness. Matt Damon is excellent as usual, and Jodie Foster is a perfect villain with a different look, blonde with short hair. The Brazilian Alice Braga is very well-known and this is the international debut of the also Brazilian Wagner Moura.<br/><br/>There are many plot holes, like for example why not shutdown the airspace from Earth permanently unless when Elysium needs to send a shuttle to Earth of vice-versa? Earth is limited to Los Angeles? Why does Elysium need a man to launch missiles to knock-down the spacecrafts with illegal immigrants? Why not keep Med-Bays in the hospitals on Earth is they are so simple and cheap? But the movie entertains and does not give time to think in these holes. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Elysium"""
"fenoixrising","1","16","26","31 December 2013"," An Absolutely Non-Sensical Waste of Time!
","I read several reviews of this movie before I actually saw it and every review was BAD. But, I believe in giving movies a chance because many times I like poorly rated movies but not this time. <br/><br/>The general gist of the film centers around the orbital colony known as Elysium. Elysium is the home of the wealthy and well to do. They live in a paradise free from hunger or disease due to the ""healing beds."" The people on earth live in total poverty as they slave away in the factories owned by the people of Elysium. In short, it is a take on the old argument of rich vs, poor. And in trying to get that message across, the movie falls flat.<br/><br/>In the opening scenes, we hear the characters speaking Spanish. Later, they are speaking English. No explanation was given as to why this happened. We see robot cops and robot parole officers. Again, the reason for this is never given. Now, lets get to important stuff; we see that Los Angeles of 2154 is nothing but one huge slum. Shanties and run down buildings everywhere. We see Max, Matt Damon's character, going to work and we see manufacturing sites everywhere but no stores, no shops so where do they spend their money? We see people like Spider having access to DNA marking equipment and access to several exo-atmospheric shuttles used to fly people up to Elysium. Now, if the people on earth can just jump onto a shuttle and leave the atmosphere, why can't they produce healing beds and such themselves. A lot of it stems from the fact that the earth people have no respect for anything. <br/><br/>Now, lets look at the acting. There are some very talented people in this film. Matt Damon's portrayal of Max was just BAD! He has already proved that he can play an odd man out type hero with his role of Jason Bourne. The character of Max reminded someone of a blundering idiot that went from screw up to the next. Another disappoint was the character of John Carlyle. He was played by one of the most underrated character actors in the business today and that is William Fichtner. Fichtner has had supporting roles in many blockbuster films, such as Col. Willie Sharp in Armageddon; SFC Jeff Sanderson in Black Hawk Down and others. Fichtner almost appeared to be reading que cards. Now we come to the character of Defense Secretary Jessica Delacourt. Jodie Foster appeared to be attempting to act like a combination of Hannibal Lector, Darth Vader and a damsel in distress. She sucked just like the movie."
"aj-avatarskye","8","46","87","13 August 2013"," If you didn't like this movie, you're watching it wrong.
","Most people who are reviewing here are looking through a District 9 lens and bringing their bias into the reviews instead of just judging Elysium as a stand alone movie. This movie was never going to be District 9: Part 2. If you are expecting that then you will likely be disappointed, and rightly so. Instead go into Neill Blomkamp's Elysium expecting gritty realism, a very feasible universe which could potentially be our reality in the not too distant future (and is actually an exaggeration of our current reality), engaging acting, and gory action galore.<br/><br/>As someone who hasn't seen District 9 (yet), and was drawn to the movie by other means (Matt Damon), I can confidently say that this is a solid, enjoyable and a uniquely unoriginal movie. Well, that is, while the premise is nothing new, the execution and actual progression of the story is good enough to capture your interest and imagination. For instance, one enjoyable part of the story is the lack of a clear 'right' side. Max, the main character of the story is a jaded, antagonistic prisoner on parole, desperate to get to Elysium for his own selfish reasons. He is willing to do whatever it takes to get there, work with criminals, steal, connive--not out of some altruistic duty, but to save himself. Meanwhile, Elysium is clearly an unjust society run by semi-corrupted leaders who gladly hoard all the commodities for the rich. Neither side is a picture of justice, but both sides are on a collision course which promises to be entertaining and exceptionally violent. <br/><br/>Warnings: Profanity everywhere, Blood and gore, Death. Perhaps reconsider if you are squeamish at the sight of the red stuff. Not family friendly, don't bring the kiddos. There is a predictable childhood romance but it is tolerable in the grand scheme of things, and really doesn't harm the story. Dare I say it evens adds to it. Unexpected plot twists may cause heart rate elevation. MATT DAMON AWESOME. <br/><br/>For those commenting on how the people on Earth speak Spanish and the people on Elysium speak French (all 5 of them), it is important to note that a) it is far more likely that all manners of languages exist on Elysium because the only criteria for access to Elysium is you must be rich, not you must speak X language b) the part of the movie that takes place on Earth is in Los Angeles so Spanish makes sense and c) both are European languages anyway."

"dee.reid","8","13","21","30 December 2013"," A bit heavy-handed at times, but ""Elysium"" is one futuristic allegory that delivers...
","South African filmmaker Neill Blomkamp directed one of my all-time favorite science fiction films four years ago, ""District 9"" (2009) (my second favorite picture that year, behind James Cameron's ""Avatar""). He follows it up with his second major feature, 2013's ""Elysium,"" a nightmarish futuristic science fiction action-thriller set in the next century on an over-populated, pollution-ravaged planet Earth.<br/><br/>In this future - year 2154 - there exists only two classes of people: the very rich, who live on an orbiting space station-habitat called Elysium, and everyone else, who live on an Earth that has been devastated by pollution and over-population. Enter into this picture, the wild card Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), an ex-convict factory line-worker living in Los Angeles who takes on a special mission that will take him from Earth to Elysium, and hopefully bring equality between the two disparate masses of people by opening up the ultimate gated community for Everyone Else. Even more so, Max's mission is not to save mankind, but ultimately to save himself.<br/><br/>Matt Damon himself is a wild card in this picture. Known for his boyish good looks, Blomkamp has Damon do everything in his power to make him the most buff-looking, grungiest, most visually un-appealing science fiction anti-hero the genre has seen in the longest time. With a completely shaved head, prison-issued tattoos and a low-jack ankle monitoring device to complete the look, Blomkamp brings us a 2154 where Damon's ultra-rugged, reformed thug Max Da Costa fits right in.<br/><br/>It is also without any real surprise that Max's tough-guy exterior begins to crack when by chance he one day reunites with his childhood sweetheart Frey (Alice Braga), who also comes with her own personal complications to overcome. And he also undergoes a gruesome back-alley procedure at a human chop-shop that has him retro-fitted with a state-of-the-art exo-suit (which recalls a more compact version of the alien weapon system at the climax of ""District 9"") that will surely help him in his many battles against the corporate-run police state and the metallic armored robot-thugs that routinely oppresses him. In order to accomplish anything, he must first dethrone Elysium's well-dressed, ice-cold chief of security, Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster), and her chief minion, an Earth-bound mercenary monster named Agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley, Blomkamp's sole hold-over from ""District 9""), who grows progressively unhinged as the battle for Elysium wages on.<br/><br/>In dealing with such timely issues such as class-ism, elitism, corporatism, environmental degradation, health care, immigration and worker exploitation, ""Elysium"" successfully transposes these key themes into a realistic, futuristic scenario that is all too possible (and we do, in fact, seem to be well on our way to such a scenario), even if it is all a little heavy-handed at times. But Blomkamp delights in creating a rough & tumble wish-fulfillment science fiction fantasy that sees the poor, over-worked, down-trodden masses fighting for their rightful slice of the pie that's been horded by the uber-wealthy, elite 1%.<br/><br/>Also like in ""District 9,"" Blomkamp spares no cost in staging ultra-bloody action sequences where human bodies are suddenly transformed into Heinz ketchup. Matt Damon handles himself extremely well, bringing tough-guy gravitas - and his Everyman vulnerability - to a part that could have just been another typical sci-fi action hero. While he retains his Everyman sensibilities, he is otherwise virtually unrecognizable from his usual self; like I said earlier, he fits right in with his grungy, futuristic surroundings.<br/><br/>Neil Blomkamp is quickly becoming one of my favorite new sci-fi filmmakers of late. With both ""District 9"" and ""Elysium,"" he has succeeded in bringing back intelligence, social commentary, and even principles to a genre that has lacked all three for several years. I still believe ""Children of Men"" (2006) is the best new science fiction film the 21st century has seen yet. But if Blomkamp continues on this current streak of his, he may very well be in a new class of science fiction filmmakers, up there with other greats such as James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, and Ridley Scott.<br/><br/>8/10"
"LloydBayer","7","13","21","14 November 2013"," In the shadow of Blomkamp's District 9
","ELYSIUM is a bitter-sweet social commentary that uses brutal allegories to reiterate the alarming rate at which socio-economic and geo-political ties are disintegrating all over the planet. As a follow up to the thought provoking and thoroughly entertaining DISTRICT 9 (2009), South African writer-director Neill Blomkamp's latest offering is yet another visionary parable to mull over. And while the first half is a frightening impression of the future of humanity, the second half feels rushed and diluted. Even so, the film has a lot to offer in terms of visual effects and explosive action.<br/><br/>Although Blomkamp's narrative begins in a dystopian future set in 2154, the story has a modern day setting that uses current events in cleverly hidden metaphors. Consider the following facts: The French Revolution that led to the execution of the monarchy; Derogatory sentiments deriding Android phones as ""ghetto"" products; Fatalities of illegal immigrants on route to greener pastures; The prospect of space tourism that only the super-rich can afford. Now imagine in the not too distant future, the extremely wealthy live on a pristine space station where state-of-the-art health care prevents people from premature death. The remaining ninety-nine percent of the population are left to suffer on the diseased, polluted and over populated planet we call Earth. Thus begins Blomkamp's setup where the premise is a thematic and often desperate struggle for equality. Amongst Earth's 'ghetto' population, blue-collar worker Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) has always dreamt of shortening the ever widening gap between the haves and the have-nots. Now diseased and dying, the only means of rejuvenating his health lies aboard the titular space station. But preventing Max from leaving Earth is Elysium's iron-fisted Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her rogue agent - the terrifying and almost psychotic Kruger (Sharlto Copley). <br/><br/>Where Blomkamp excels is in presenting a bleak scenario that is not only plausible but also discomforting. Considering the real world disparity between man-made utopias and an unfed infant in so called 'third world countries', it becomes all the more unsettling that this story is not entirely make believe. This is precisely what gives ELYSIUM a powerful yet thought provoking backdrop. All else, from gritty action sequences to the CGI built paradise in space benefits from the current going rate in Hollywood. On the other hand, character development leaves much to be desired. Two-time Academy Award winning Foster is either miscast or given very little to work with, but definitely my biggest disappointment in this film. There is simply no punch in what appears to be her first antagonistic role. Foster shares this downside with William Fichtner, another underrated actor whose talents are wasted in what should have been a key role. Thankfully, Damon and Copley make up for any noticeable lapse in the acting department. Together, their characters portray the fickle polarity of the human nature while also providing the film's testosterone fuelled action, including scenes of intense shootouts and sudden blood splatter. <br/><br/>In a year that coughed up quite a few sci-fi films, with some even treading into apocalyptic territory, ELYSIUM stands on firm ground as a film that tackles social issues head-on. And while this film is far from perfect, there are ample reasons why this film is still worth a trip to the cinema."
"ddude1116","6","50","100","8 August 2013"," Solid entertainment, but amateur storytelling
","Elysium has such an intriguing concept, I went into the film very eager and excited for Blomkamp's follow-up to District 9, thinking he'd overcome his flaws. But after viewing Elysium, I've come to the conclusion he needs a writing partner.<br/><br/>This film takes place in 2154 after a prologue establishing the wealthy have fled the now overpopulated and polluted Earth in favor of a space-retreat called Elysium. Earth citizens try their best to ensure passage to Elysium on the black market, but they never succeed thanks to Jodie Foster's Secretary of Defense, Delacourt. These people, it establishes quickly, want access to the medical technology held on Elysium (early in the film a mother cures her daughter of her severe fractures in one of these pods). Think now on how neat a concept it is: the Earth has become a slum and their put all of their effort to MAYBE be healed on Elysium. Getting up and being in perfect health for the few minutes is enough for them. All political implications aside, Blomkamp has thought up a hell of a dystopia. Earth is no less interesting, however he never follows up on either of these.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed about District 9 was how immersed we became with the prawn slum, and how unconventionally we became so. Elysium lacks this. It's very much a straight shot, cause-and- effect plot. It's very much amateur writing. Elysium lacks any trace of dramatic irony, though I noticed multiple instances where it would be necessary, and also any sort of character development (jodie Foster seemed to exist only as a catalyst for the plot).<br/><br/>The story follows Max (Matt Damon, who does a very good job adding certain depth to an otherwise listless character), as he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. This starts the ball rolling on him getting to Elysium to be healed. He agrees to pull off a dangerous mission in order to secure unauthorized space passage, but he finds himself in more of a jam when he becomes the only cerebral carrier of a program to overthrow Elysium's government. SOmewhere along the way he meets childhood friend, Frey, but she doesn't add much. She just confuses the plot, since their history is never told, nor is she at all developed.<br/><br/>Where the film shines is in its visual direction, both cinematography and action. Elysium had a much better reason for its action occurring than District 9, but it also planned out its action better. Since Max was suffering from severe radiation poisoning, he was given an exoskeleton to keep him fit as a fiddle (you'll need to suspend your disbelief for much of this) and he ended up taking on the wonderful villain, Kruger. This leads to many fight scenes. However, Blomkamp would splice random shots of slow-motion to add structure to the action so you never really feel lost, though you may still get sort of dizzy. He also had some neat camera tricks where he would twist the angle mid-scene so the action did not get as boring. I also enjoyed how Max and Kruger's fights were more battle-of-wits than just duking it out. Max learned from his prior mistakes in fighting against Kruger.<br/><br/>This is, above all else, a very entertaining film. Blomkamp (from whom I expect much more in the future) kept the plot concise and the cinematography and special effects are absolutely beautiful. It's easy to follow and its political implications are smart and relevant. Don't expect any surprises, but it does pretty well at making what you expect fun to watch. It's just a good summer flick."

Illness and disease is around us now and it is difficult to cure and treat everyone but this film shows what the future may hold to health care but also to what could happen to man kind, this film help me understand that I should not take anything for granted and that we as people should respect each other and not be such snobs towards social class, a brilliant film with fantastic actors, a huge well done to everyone that helped create such a wonderful film"

","This movie is lacking an explanation as to why the privileged want to live full time in a space station considering the enormous risks of living in outer space like radiation exposure, loss of eyesight, loss of muscle mass, and space motion sickness.<br/><br/>The sheer cost of maintaining a space habitat with artificial gravity, a breathable atmosphere, radiation protection, etc would be immense. Earth has all these nice things built in to it and it is also much larger then a space station.<br/><br/>As such, in order for it to be reasonable to maintain a habitat in outer space rather then one on Earth it must be the case that the Earth is really messed up such as with the sky scorched like in the Matrix or something equally terrible.<br/><br/>In this movie people are going about their daily lives on Earth and they have food, water, sunlight, air and all the other necessities provided for. Therefore, the premise of this movie that the privileged would live on a space habitat makes no sense. This movie is lacking an explanation in why things are this way so nothing really makes sense.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental points in this movie is that in the space station they have futuristic medical technology that can cure any sickness essentially instantly. This movie is also lacking any explanation as to how the people on the space station can maintain a monopoly on such advanced technology or why they would even want to so that whole element of the plot doesn't make much sense either.<br/><br/>Besides these major elements that this story is lacking I feel this story is also lacking some explanation as to what happened to Max between when he was a child and when he was an adult. They just show Max as a child and then they switch to him as a tattooed adult with only brief mentions of his past later on. Well this movie wasn't all bad I feel it may have been more interesting to see the elements of Max's past this film was lacking like his car thefts rather then bothering with the plot about a space station which lacks a decent explanation as to its existence."

I'm still wondering what people disliked so much about the movie because I really liked it and wasn't disappointed at all - my expectations were fulfilled and I enjoyed every moment of Elysium. <br/><br/>The movie kept me on edge of my seat since its beginning to the end, it made me hold my breath few times while watching it and I can't remember a moment when I was bored - the story was fluent and kept me interested in it for the whole screening. It was shorter than most movies today, 109 minutes may seem to be not enough for a huge movie like this but I'm glad it's not longer - as I said before, the story evolved and had no 'lazy' and uninteresting moments, it didn't concentrate on unimportant details and told only things that were needed. <br/><br/>There was so much to look at, so much to experience - visual effects and the environment/surroundings were amazing, camera work very good, soundtrack stunning (I can't stop listening to it since seeing the movie), and actors did a great work too. It's one of the best sci-fi movies I've recently seen and I can recommend to everyone to go and see it.<br/><br/>I liked that the main characters weren't perfect examples of bravery or leadership or whatever comes to your mind when you say a 'perfect human being', they were quite natural and believable. Matt Damon's Max was selfish and maybe a bit coward too at the beginning of the movie. Jodie Foster's Delacourt maybe seemed to care only about good and peaceful life on Elysium, but she also thought about her own career and own interests. Max wasn't only a hero and Delacourt wasn't only a villain, they were humans with both good and bad in them. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the whole crew made an excellent movie that is definitely worth watching. One point down from total 10 for few cliché moments that seem to sneak into every (even the best) movie nowadays - those clichés for me include this story of little kid Max who promised to take everyone to Elysium or the farewell scene with sad music on the background and typical 'I'm-sorry-goodbye-speech'. <br/><br/>To sum up, the movie left me astonished when it ended up and yes, I consider it to be a very good movie ;)"
"chuckonfire","4","51","105","7 August 2013"," So many plot holes
","Just saw this in an advance screening, and wasted two hours. The biggest issue I had with the movie was that the characters were not sympathetic at all on any level. I could care less if the characters arrived on Elysium and in fact was hoping they wouldn't. There were so many glaring plot holes or things that were left unexplained. Like why did there seem to be zero vegetation on earth for the overpopulated earth citizens. Also the Kruger character was an absolute joke. He was a cross between Freddy Krueger and Brad Pitt in Snatch. He made nonstop commentary that you could only understand half the time. This movie tried to go action over plot and character, which could have been fine if not for the close up shaky cam. During most of the fight scenes you couldn't tell who was winning losing or being thrown against a wall. The movie was not worth the time, and I am glad that the pass was free. Do not bother with it."
"alexander-ivanchev","4","39","78","11 August 2013"," Disappointing
","Damon's, Foster's and Copley's acting is on the level, but this movie is so weak in terms of concept and plot that I seriously regretted spending money seeing it. Dystopias work well when they work, but one has to spend at least 10 minutes of thinking and at least try aiming for justification and creating something the viewer can easily immerse in. The movie does very poorly in this regard and though Elysium is probably the best Mass Effect Citadel station rip off I have seen in cinema you cannot build belief on the basis of 10 mins of sloppy presentation and CGI alone.<br/><br/>Copley's character is quite, quite fresh and as I said Damon and Foster do well, but that's it. I honestly didn't believe I'd say a weaker sci-fi movie since I saw Total Recall (redux), but there we go...<br/><br/>Would recommend seeing on blu-ray at $5 on a rainy night but don't keep your expectations high."
"dwankan","1","16","28","28 January 2014"," Old Story, New Plot Holes
","The only creative aspect of this film is its plot holes. I can ignore some implausibility with science fiction, but this one went too far. It didn't help that I've seen far too many futuristic elitist dystopias in the past several years and that even the best actors in this film seemed to be struggling through to their paychecks. Like Hunger Games and Upside Down, it featured a future society in which the poor are sacrificed or exploited to benefit a small group of elites, but the satellite where all the privileged live, on not too close inspection, doesn't seem even large enough to contain much more than the control centers and political offices that show in the film. It also features a scrappy hero who's been in trouble but now just wants to get by, but it's hard to sympathize with his purely self-centered reasons for fighting the system; he only wants to cure himself of radiation poisoning. He does sacrifice himself at the end, so there is a type of redemption, but it really doesn't make sense that the solution to looming oppression is to program the computers to stop being bigots, at which point, the elite all have to be nice because they only do what the computers tell them to do. I guess the writer(s) didn't study what happened to African Americans in the US after the emancipation proclamation: it was not all peaches and cream just because the white establishment called them citizens. Some of the film looked great, but I was too busy, rolling my eyes at every single movement of the plot, to notice it. District 9 was an interesting and innovative film. Elysium is, in every way that matters, exactly the opposite."
"jfinch3751","1","34","67","10 August 2013"," Pathetic SciFi
","As Sci Fi fans we looked forward to the premiere of Elysium. It was awful. it was a pathetic and expensive attempt by Blomkamp to stuff his values and political agenda down our throat. Elysium succeeded in eclipsing the performance of Matt Damon and Jodi Foster with loud noises, expensive special effects and bad science. ( Our I-Max theater was extremely loud, we spoke to management about it, ""Sorry it is an I-Max film, we can't change the volume setting') A human punching a well armored Robot ? (Come on!) hand grenade goes off in the passenger compartment of a space ship and only one person is hurt, crash landing a space ship onto the Elysium space station and people survive a crash that tears up 200 yards of space station (give me a break); space craft go to full forward thrust to land?? A lot of bad science. and poorly executed Special effects. Wait for the video."
"GregAmos45","8","23","43","5 December 2013"," Elysium, The Perfect World ... For Some
","Why are writers and other creative types fond of portraying dystopic societies? (Bladerunner; I Robot; The Hunger Games; The Lord of the Rings trilogy; the Terminator series; the Matrix trilogy; The Omega Man and its remake, I am Legend; even the star Wars franchise; Elysium; the list goes on.) Maybe because we live in one.<br/><br/>The dystopia in this movie is Los Angeles. The utopia is the eponymous satellite city. Elysium orbits in plain sight but remains out of reach. Citizens of hell on earth long for and die trying to reach heaven above, a 19-minute spaceship ride away.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp, the director, is quoted as saying the movie isn't science fiction, it's today. I agree. The only difference between Elysium the movie set in 2154 and real life in 2013 (besides the cool exoskeletons) is that Elysium – utopia – isn't up in the sky.<br/><br/>Elysiums exist all over the country. We've seen them. Some of us have even been inside them. They're cleverly disguised with normal names like Beverly Hills, The Hamptons, The White House, Trump Tower, Park Avenue. You just need a special key to get inside; it's called seven-figures.<br/><br/>The movie ends with rogue citizens of hell making everybody – not just the privileged – citizens of utopia. Once everybody is a citizen, they are entitled to benefits. They can't be arrested. Medical aid is dispatched to care for everybody in Los Angeles! It's just that simple. The resources existed. Nothing had to be appropriated. No one had to give an order. No one received less because thousands or millions were given some. A few new lines of computer code did the trick.<br/><br/>Again, this isn't science fiction. This is real. This is now. This is today.<br/><br/>We put a man on the moon – a bunch of times. We landed an SUV on mars and the lack of gas stations doesn't appear to be a concern.<br/><br/>We can care and feed for all our populace. We just don't want to. Or rather, the few that hold the keys don't want to.<br/><br/>Sooner or later those few will be forced to turn over the keys to the city. Just like in the movie, the political and social will to do the right thing will be forced upon them. It won't come from the inside, from the body politic, or the establishment. The will, the impetus to provide functional, universal care for everybody will come from below, from hell, from the dystopias that exist next to the Elysiums, from the masses, from those who need it and die from its lack. Sooner or later these raged masses will become fed up and demand what already exists, what they see others enjoying everyday, what the elite take for granted. Warning: the later the demand comes, the uglier, bloodier, deadlier it will be. I think another word for that is revolution."

","Elysium is your standard tale of the struggle between the upper class and the poor...with robots and space ships in the year 2154. (The fact there's even THAT MUCH of Los Angeles left in 2154 is amazing on its own.) The rich have moved from a dying earth to the massive space station Elysium, and everyone not rich is forbidden to go. Also, Elysium has video-game-like healing stations that cure everything. EVERYTHING. And since you can barely get an Advil back on earth, the people stuck there are not too happy about it. Matt Damon plays your standard guy- raised-in-an-orphanage-wishing-he-wasn't-so-poor, while Jodie Foster plays the I-don't-give-a-flying-f*ck, shoot-first-ask-later head of security for Elysium.<br/><br/>Pros: - The first thing that will grab you is the scenery. Earth looks beaten down, but it looks fantastic in its devastation. Elysium looks like a dream world. The inner-core of Elysium looks like something straight out of Aperture Laboratories. (Portal, anyone?) - Jodie Foster plays a MEAN villain. And that's good. - Sharlto Copley, the star of District 9, has got some serious acting flexibility. He plays a grizzled mercenary that is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of his D9 character, but you'd never recognize him until the end credits. - The SHOOTING action scenes are very cool. <br/><br/>Cons: - I specified earlier that the shooting action scenes are good, because the FIGHTING action scenes are terrible. When anyone goes hand-to-hand, the camera shakes WAY TOO MUCH. I know that this is becoming a style for many movies, but...I hate it. You literally cannot make out what is happening. All I can think about is that there's a camera guy running behind the scene, who can't hold the camera properly. It's enough to give you a headache. STOP DOING THIS, MOVIES. - Matt Damon is...eh...dry. He just doesn't do much for the character. Seems like he phoned it in. - I hate to say it about a Neill Blomkamp-written movie, but the script just isn't that strong. I would have wanted more time for Jodie Foster to flex some acting muscle, and less time for Matt Damon to fumble through awkward confrontations. I never really got attached to any of the characters.<br/><br/>Be warned - there is some graphic violence. <br/><br/>Elysium is not a bad sci-fi action flick, but it could have been much better. It's going to fall well short of some of the other sci-fi flicks we've seen this summer. (Star Trek, Pacific Rim) Elysium scores a 3 out of 5 on the BDBOS.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review...well then, you have good taste. And you're probably very good looking.

"nrk39","6","24","46","9 August 2013"," Interesting and entertaining, but the story falls apart
","I am a Bourne trilogy fan, and enjoy watching Matt Damon, but this movie had stale conversations didn't really bring the act to this. The action was decent though, the stand offs were very entertaining and overall it was a good movie. Except for one major part, the story comes out as him trying to save himself, then turns to saving the entire planet, and then him saving his girlfriends daughter. Even there is the problem the characters were not developed, the viewer seems random flashbacks of his life one I think was around 3 times. Never though do they explain the story of him and his girlfriend and where does she get the baby from. <br/><br/>Away from children, and back to reality another drawback of the movie is it's politics system. Seems as though Mexico took over USA in 130 years because everyone speaks Spanish, and all the French people took all the rich people and flew out in space. <br/><br/>Lastly, are the effects, some were cheap (first crash landing) and some were awesome (elysium itself and the gruesome splatter effects). There were neat ideas put into the movie of how it is going to be in 130 years. The scene with the parole officer was amusing. Also, I gotta admit the shield that the bad guy was using was wicked, and the whole reconstruction/healing was neat or at least as long as your brain works (go see the movie you know what I am talking about)<br/><br/>This is my first review, thought I will try to write and maybe was a bit harsh with my rating, but I think the idea has potential, but should have been worked on a little more. Oh, my girlfriend thought that the awfully accented bad guy was Chuck Norris."
"tigerfish50","1","28","55","19 September 2013"," Dick Cheney's Ringworld
","Writer/director Blomkamp's breakthrough work was 'District 9' - a simple plot driven by fairly original concepts and techniques - and it was a big success. Predictably the new 'wunderkind' was given a bloated budget for his follow-up project - and it's resulted in a major letdown with a trite story undermined by implausible ideas. The film is set about 150 years in the future, with mankind living on a polluted, over-populated earth, and being exploited by a fascist elite who control the masses by means of a robot police force. The privileged minority reside on Elysium, a vast orbiting space station which resembles a luxurious Beverly Hills gated community. One of the earthbound serfs is the standard action-movie hero: a tough-but-sensitive ex-con called Max. After being exposed to a fatal dose of radiation at his robot-factory workplace, he needs to access the forbidden medical facilities on Elysium - and during his struggles to save himself, Max becomes entangled in a 'coup d'etat' planned by the station's megalomaniac female head of security.<br/><br/>Although the film looks good, Blomkamp provides little reason to care about anybody, since the participants act like manic puppets with incomprehensible motivations. He attempts to conceal the yawning gaps in his story by getting the characters to shout at one another, and engage in endless shoot-outs with CGI robots - all of which produces little more than brain-addling tedium."
"mesesanmihai","4","31","62","17 August 2013"," Promising at first, disappointing in the end.
","After watching this movie, I was left with a very bitter taste and felt a bit ""conned"". Nobody forced me to view it, to be honest, so I shouldn't have reasons to complain. I went in with low expectations after seeing the trailer, and wasn't expecting something different than a popcorn flick. <br/><br/>The first part of the film, though, was a decent enough construction of a story, which kept me involved and interested. Nothing really original, but enjoyable nevertheless. Some shaky footage here and there, where it didn't seem to be required, but kept at the minimum for a while; some beautiful action shots, and a good pace. This part of the movie I rate at around 7 out of 10. <br/><br/>After about the half way mark, something changes dramatically regarding the style and everything turns ugly: poorly written scenes, characters' actions become totally irrational, and the whole construction crumbles like a deck of cards. In my opinion, a single character's existence and ridiculous behavior manages to completely destroy a perfectly functioning movie. You'll recognize it when you'll see it. The camera starts to lose control in the action shots, and in conjunction with the roaring sounds, causes dizziness - I really had to close my eyes for a few moments at one point. So the second half I see as a 2 out of 10.<br/><br/>The overall performances are good, with one notable exception. Averaging the two grades, the overall feeling is a 4 out of 10. ""Oblivion"" was a better movie, by today's pretty low standards regarding sci-fi movies, and compared to ""After Earth"", the first part of ""Elysium"" was better, but the second was worse."
"castlemgmt","1","37","76","9 August 2013"," The worst movie I've ever seen
","This movie could not have contained more clichés. There were science fiction clichés, adventure movie clichés and mechanized battle clichés. This was a long string of scenes from other movies and TV shows strung together but without any real purpose.<br/><br/>The script and directing lacked any semblance of quality. There was no meaningful plot or dialog. To compensate for this, loud and pounding music was used to try to convey to the audience when they were seeing suspenseful or dangerous scenes.<br/><br/>If the script and directing we're awful the performances of Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were worse. They were both wooden. Matt Damon at times showed a tendency to reprise his Bourne performances and at other times was just pitiful. Jody Foster was totally uninspired and without life. They both seemed to be bored with the movie and I certainly was. <br/><br/>Don't waist you time. This movie isn't worth it. Go see something else."

","One of the more unique films I have seen in quite awhile. Max, (Damon) is a man who wants to live a normal life on earth. Although his parole officer seems bent out of shape because of his untimely police accident going to work. <br/><br/>But that's how it is with all of those who wish to live a free life. Except for those still on earth, they have to live in hell. Elysium is a station built for only the elite, or for those who acquire a ticket to fly to the station and get healed using miraculous devices on the station. <br/><br/>However, a price must be paid in order for the station to run its perfect harmony. And that is to sacrifice all those back on earth to live in squalor, poverty, and destitute. For max, getting healed is a matter of life or death since he had an accident in his work place, by absorbing a full dose of radiation.<br/><br/>Now tasked with trying to get to Elysium, he uses a known smuggler/weapons dealer to get his ticket early. In the meantime, a daunting and brutal mercenary comes into the scene with his brand of justice - The Psycho way.<br/><br/>All in all, a great film to add to the list of Damon fans all over the world. He is still a fantastic actor, the cast was great, including Jodie Foster who plays a mean sadistic broad who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. Including the presidency of Elysium. <br/><br/>The music was top notch, and the special effects were just right. Nothing went overboard, no continuous effects to dismiss the story.

"jesse-hitzroth","6","43","90","8 August 2013"," Elysium a trip you might want to re-think
","Elysium was easily my most hyped up movie for the summer. Neil Blomkamp came into the scene a few years ago with the amazing film district 9, so Elysium has been long anticipated. So the question is does it live up to all the hype and can it reach the level that district 9 did? Unfortunately the answer is no. Unlike District 9 the story here is a very simple one, with no real sense of political/controversial undertones, and that is a shame because Elysium's plot is perfect for this. Instead we get a very generic story with no real surprises and unfortunately Blomkamp decided to play it safe here. Now Elysium is not an awful movie by any means, in fact it's good but it the problem here is that it's weighted down by it's simplicity. The camera-work and soundtrack also hurt Elysium in a sense that the sound and music are almost non existent, and the camera work looks like it was filmed to be in 3d but then they opted out making it seem almost like a video game. Matt Damon brings in a decent performance but it is Sharlto Copley here who steals the show with his role as the villain. It's going to be a big year for sci-fi films but i would highly recommend watching the unrated sci-fi film oblivion over this. Elysium ends up playing it safe and becoming generic with no real surprises. There is a grand setting here but they never take advantage of that fact. Hopefully Blomkamp can get back on track with his next film, but i do expect great things to come from him in the near future. While not awful, Elysium proves to be somewhat of a disappointment.

"ced60","10","16","29","18 August 2013"," Excellent movie - excellent statement
","I feel compelled to counterbalance some of the poorer reviews: concerning bad storytelling, not much to connect to, no chemistry between the main characters, not enough development of social criticism, no one changing to the better ... The movie provides a plain and clear statement. It doesn't want to be a simple hero-gets-heroine, down-in-our-hearts-we-actually-are-all-good-people-flick. One of the first thoughts that struck me was: this is exactly how we 1st-world-people treat refugees, foreigners, 3rd- world-countries... It is not a movie about chemistry between certain people, it is about chemistry between systems. Using the tool of a brilliant, entertaining, well-done action thriller with outstanding actors, Blomkamp draws a picture highlighting some of the grievances of our present world. Connecting to the movie's message is synonymous to connecting to these problems, to what we can see in our own neighborhood, country, political system right here and now. Do we ourselves change our attitude to the better? Or are we just, turning off the TV with a little shiver, glad to be on the better side, forgetting within a minute all about the poverty and sadness we have just watched? The movie doesn't need more chemistry, development or social criticism - it needs people to open their eyes, minds and hearts to see the plain facts. The only mistake Blomkamp maybe made was underestimating our ability to follow what is so clearly seen by him: he himself having lived in a 3rd-world and later in a 1st-world country, knows the difference from his own experience, the cause and effect of problems are obvious to him. We, who are lacking this first hand experience, must make an effort to see. Maybe it is easier for myself because my husband is South African and helped to open my eyes to the gap between rich and poor as well as our ignorance beforehand."
"Al_The_Strange","10","28","56","10 August 2013"," Elysium review
","This film represents a natural evolution of the rough, intense, deeply sociopolitical textures that Neill Bloomkamp previously worked with in District 9. Many comparisons can be made between D9 and Elysium; they're both particularly ugly films that face certain ugly truths through the thin veil of sci-fi, and they're both set in some of the trashiest slums ever filmed. At the same time, Elysium borrows a lot from the anime Battle Angel; both are stories in which the rich and poor are separated between the Earth and some high-flying city, and the characters fight their way to the top with some help from cybernetics. There are also individual scenes that reminded me of other things: one scene reminded me of Total Recall, the main henchman was like an evil version of Metal Gear's Solid Snake, I couldn't help but to think of the Ghost in the Shell saga and the works of William Gibson with all the high-tech surveillance ops and brain-hacking.<br/><br/>Despite being somewhat unoriginal, Elysium is every bit as awesome and awe-inspiring as I expected. The action hits hard and rough, with frequent fights and shoot-outs, all made even more explosive and incredible with a plethora of futuristic gear. The film can get pretty gruesome, for there are a few exploding bodies and painful-looking injuries, but it's still nowhere near as gnarly as District 9. Some incredible slow-motion shots and gorgeous special effects make the excitement stand out even more. In between the action scenes, the film maintains even pacing with strong conflicts and quality visuals.<br/><br/>As noted above, the story covers pretty standard sci-fi ground. It does employ some interesting concepts though: the actual Elysium space station is a magnificent utopic space habitat (a Stanford Torus design), the likes of which is often envisioned by futurists and sci-fi authors, but has never actually been produced on the big screen for some odd reason. The world of Elysium is visually fantastic and really cool.<br/><br/>The actual plot is solidly-built, with its foundations firmly set in conflict and action. It takes some really interesting twists and turns; the climax is a little predictable, but everything leading up to it is a real roller-coaster ride. Characters aren't particularly deep; the villains are especially one-dimensional. However, the film does its best to humanize the heroes and the poor people they fight for, to best emphasize its key themes. The themes are not all that subtle, and the political stance is not something I personally agree with, but I appreciate the effort and nobility of the film, as it underscores such hot topics as immigration, healthcare, and class warfare.<br/><br/>This film uses pretty rough and gritty photography and editing. The camera does shake around a bit during some scenes, but it didn't agitate me nearly as much as I thought it would: I could see the action perfectly well, and I thought a lot of the camera angles and compositions were cool. Acting is alright: Matt Damon is a pretty generic action hero here, Sharlto Copley (hey, the dude from District 9) is flipping crazy, and Alice Braga offers the most touching performance of the lot. Surprisingly, Jodie Foster is the weakest link, thanks to her butchery of the French accent. Writing is not bad. This picture has really cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is pretty good too.<br/><br/>I felt this was a perfectly satisfying and awesome sci-fi adventure, despite a few quibbles. District 9 remains a fresher, more original, and more deeper experience; I think it's because it offered something nobody had really seen before. Elysium, on the other hand, offers something we've all seen before, so it hasn't struck as hard with audiences. Personally, I think I prefer Elysium over D9, for having a more complex plot, more incredible action, and more far-out ideas. Both would make a great double-feature, and I do hope director Neill Bloomkamp continues to pump out similarly raw and uncompromising pictures. If you're a big sci-fi fan like me, Elysium is definitely worth seeing; I'd recommend it as a rental to casual viewers.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"

Very disappointing.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good and could/should have made for a very good sci-fi/action flick. <br/><br/>The biggest drawback by far is the frenetic, confusing, shaky shooting and editing. This is something we've been seeing more of in the last several years for reasons unknown. The closest thing I've ever heard to a compliment on this style has been - ""It doesn't really bother me."" What I do hear often and personally agree with is ""It sucks. I can't tell what the hell's going on!"", with a close second being ""It's making me feel sick to my stomach."" No one has ever watched a ""traditionally"" filmed scene and said ""Wow, that was terrible, I could actually see everything that was happening and know exactly what was going on."" This new trend is just lazy and sloppy. <br/><br/>The other notable distraction was Jodie Foster who is normally very solid and put in what I think is the worst performance of her career. It's not that the dialogue was bad, but her presentation was hideous. Trying to put on an air of aristocracy, her pronunciation was painful to watch and completely unbelievable."

","This is a strange movie. The story isn't well written and the characters aren't interesting or involving.<br/><br/>The premise is that Earth is an overpopulated disease ridden poluted disaster zone for common people and the elite live on a space station called Elysium. They didn't show enough of the latter for contrast - too much was on Earth.<br/><br/>The immigration message is confused and didn't get what it wanted to across. I don't understand why future LA (filmed in a slum in Mexico) is portrayed as a mainly Hispanic slum. Why didn't they have a multiracial future city? Instead of showing that immigration boundaries should be relaxed and highlighting bad treatment of illegal immigrants it looks more like a warning against letting more people across the border. I think the message backfired - unless that was the real intention.<br/><br/>I didn't like the character Matt Damon was playing - very me me me. His selfishiness in seeking a cure for himself got his friend killed and his lady friend and daughter in trouble. She was rather annoying too with my daughter this and that. There was no chemistry between the couple. The hit-man villain's accent was hard to listen to and out of place (was it South African?). The brutal fighting didn't really advance the plot and was tiresome. Just as annoying was ""Secretary"" Jodie Foster's strange clipped accent. She lacked dignity for the role and looked too high strung and mentally unhinged. Another evil guy is the CEO - how clichéd.<br/><br/>I don't think the writer director thought out this story very well and it shouldn't have been made into a movie. Not worth a watch."

Anyone who has seen ""District 9″ knows how politically charged it is, with sweeping themes of class-ism and racism. As heavy-handed as it is, I would have been inclined to dismiss it out of hand. However, Neill Blomkamp is a native of South Africa. He's lived through tumultuous times (albeit as a youngster) in that very part of the world; I thought it lent credence to his sermon of a film.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but keep those facts in mind the first time I read the plot summary for ""Elysium"". The title even gave me a hint of what was to come; 'elysium' was a term in ancient times given to a place, like Heaven, that was ""reserved by gods for the favored heroes"", or a ""place or state of perfect happiness"". I sensed (correctly) that Blomkamp would bring audiences another morality play masquerading as a science fiction film. Generally, that's what makes the best science fiction; 'Star Trek' is famous in part for mirroring our current society's issues through the interactions with other intergalactic beings. We have other literary examples of this through Richard Matheson, Isaac Asimov, and Philip Dick, to name a few.<br/><br/>I believe Blomkamp and company were on the right track, just like the aforementioned authors, but there's one thing that separates this story and its' notorious villains from better science fiction: ambiguity. There is none. Jodie Foster's character, a ruthless defense secretary, shows only one motivation- keeping illegals out of Elysium. Sharlto Copley's psychotic agent/bounty hunter and his pals simply live for the thrill of the hunt. William Fichtner's devious character doesn't think twice about his company's liability after a serious workplace incident. These are all characters without remorse, conscience, and seemingly without reason. It leads me to wonder how they got that way, and why society has made the choice to separate their physical and moral selves from planet Earth and the rest of humanity. To be honest, that's far more interesting movie to me than the black and white way this film presents the division of power.<br/><br/>We clearly understand the motivations of every earthbound citizen in this film. Earth sucks, robot police and parole officers can't sense sarcasm, no one can get decent health-care, and to boot, everyone on the orbiting space station Elysium lives disease-free thanks to special medical pods. They have it all 'up there', we don't 'down here', and that's life. So, everyone on Earth spends their time risking their lives trying to somehow sneak onto the Wheel In The Sky. (I hoped, at some point, there would be a random reference to the Journey song, but alas, no)<br/><br/>That being the case, ""Elysium"" is just not the satisfying film it should be. Blomkamp showed an economy to his story in ""District 9″, an intelligence that's lacking this time around, especially in the last third of the film. In him, I had sensed a rebellious director, eager to merge the intelligence of classic sci-fi principles with the broad capabilities of today's movie technology. With ""Elysium"", I sensed a director who got the big budget and wasn't forced to economize his thoughts. His talent is undeniable, and I have a sneaking suspicion that his next film will be more focused and rich, hopefully while being less frenetic and explosion-happy. Instead of the engrossing and smart journey to Elysium that we should have, befitting the effort it took to get there, we're treated simply to a shoot 'em up where the gore and violence wins. It just doesn't seem right; it's a purpose film, perhaps alluding to the disparity between medical technology and affordability in our world, but sorely lacking in purpose. If you want a 'splosion film that's smarter than ""Transformers"", ""Elysium"" might be great for you; however, as a parable for today's society, it's not nearly as enriching and satisfying as it should be."

"marklookerofficial","7","8","13","25 August 2013"," Blomkamp, we have a problem
","The dictionary definition of Elysium is 'a state of perfect happiness', something that this film ultimately falls short of delivering. This is particularly disappointing for fans of its writer/director Neill Blomkamp, responsible for the refreshingly original District 9, a film that perfectly spliced the hard-hitting issues of the apartheid into a believable sci-fi world.<br/><br/>It's clear that he has tried to repeat his last success here as we follow underdog Max (Mat Damon) as he tries to reach the space station Elysium, an exclusive paradise in the sky with Prometheus-style healing machines causally fitted in every home. A utility that Max soon needs after receiving a fatal dose of radiation at his work, causing him to agree to a plan of breaking into the place with help from his childhood sweetheart Faye (Alice Braga). However, things don't go as smoothly as planned, as ruthless rouge agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) hunts them down, following kill orders from Delacourt the space stations treasonous Secretary of Defence (Jodie Foster).<br/><br/>Although the story does entertain, it does nothing new or surprising, and after BlomKamp's previous work it's impossible not to expect something more groundbreaking, or just different. Especially considering that this film follows District 9 beat-for-beat, heavy- handedly changing the metaphor from the apartheid to immigration, and altering the alien transformation to a mech-suit attachment. It all just feels predictable, with plot points being signposted far too prematurely, especially with the oversimplified sentimental ending that seems to break the film's own logic. This makes it feel like a result of reshuffled ideas rather than a combination of new ones.<br/><br/>It's fortunate then that the acting and casting is so perfect, grounding the film and breathing new life into its old plot. The standout performance is from Copley, who steals the film with his unhinged terminator portrayal of agent Kruger, just outshining Damon who manages to inject a likable personality into the otherwise underdeveloped character of Max.<br/><br/>However, what really defines the film is its visuals, with the quality of CGI soaring above that of District 9 and other current releases. If nothing else it's a testament to Blomkamp and his ability to create such distinct worlds that feels so real and detailed, this time around turning California into a sprawling slum of overpopulation and grime, that demonstrates a disturbingly realistic vision of a possible future. Even the interstellar scenes with Elysium look understatedly beautiful and genuine, adding a level of immersion that was so noticeably lacking from 'Into Darkness'.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Elysium doesn't quite take off into the heights of perfection that District 9 so effortlessly hovered in, but the meticulously designed future world and the characters that inhabit it save it from its underwhelming recycled story. For Blomkamp fans it shows again how well he moulds social themes into science fiction, even if it is in a way that's becoming over familiar. Regardless of this, it manages to be an entertaining and engaging film that has other entries in the genre playing catch up."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Social commentary does not automatically make a movie ""smart"". In fact, commentary done poorly could be labeled the exact opposite. Writer/Director Neil Blomkamp's critically acclaimed sci-fi feature District 9 was creative in its approach to social issues. Unfortunately, his follow-up is a sloppy, big budget mess with too many writing shortcuts and what may be the worst performances of Jodie Foster's career.<br/><br/>Earth in the year 2154 is an over-populated, polluted disaster that looks like what we saw in Wall-E, only with people. Earth is so bad, it has been evacuated by the ultra-rich ... an obvious statement on the ""one percenters"". The poor and downtrodden earthlings spend their lives dreaming of getting to Elysium, the space station paradise that houses the elite and is only a 19 minute shuttle ride away. On Elysium, the houses are stunning and the lawns perfectly manicured. Oh, and technology has re-imagined tanning booths into a medical marvel that can cure anything from zits to cancer. This advancement is the main reason earthlings risk everything to reach Elysium. See those poor folks have only shoddy hospitals ... an obvious statement on universal healthcare.<br/><br/>After an industrial accident, Max (Matt Damon)is desperate to reach Elysium so he can save his own life. As expected, his selfishness evolves into focused heroism after he runs into his childhood crush Frey (Alice Braga) and her leukemia-stricken daughter. Getting yourself to Elysium is not so easy thanks to the protective nature of Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster). She is working with greedy businessman William Fichtner and earth-based mercenary Sharlto Copley to plot her political coup on Elysium ... just in case you forgot that the rich are really bad people.<br/><br/>There is a data theft plot that, if re-directed, could open up the Elysium advantages to the entire population ... an obvious statement on open immigration. In between all of the political statements Blomkamp does throw in plenty of explosions, gun fights, aggressive robots and enough CGI effects to keep any sci-fi fan entertained. There is even a battle of exoskeleton suits between Copley and Damon. Where Arnold once said ""Get your a** to Mars"", I can't in good faith say the same thing about Elysium."
"Indrigis-XIII","4","20","40","11 August 2013"," Elysium is a distilled version of D9. That is - even worse.
","While in District 9 Neill Blomkamp did a fine effort of trying to show the results of racial segregation from the point of view of an oppressor becoming an oppressed one (ultimately failing to make it even a bit believable, though) in Elysium he has hit the nail precisely on the head, forgetting to put it against a wall first.<br/><br/>The premise is pretty worn - two communities, one a small, rich and prosperous, the other large but poor and suffering. And, obviously, a tale of one man's rise to citizenship of the rich one. What Elysium completely fails to create is a reason to feel for any of the characters. The bad guys are bad because Neill said so, the good guys are good by virtue of being poor and oppressed (we all know that every miserable sod has a heart of gold but is unwilling to sell it). So the good guys fight the bad guys. sacrifice themselves left and right and, obviously, win.<br/><br/>Also the movie contains so many absolutely stupid details that it becomes a pain to watch without facepalming. Every stupid action/sci-fi cliché you can think of is probably there.<br/><br/>Oh, and as for the message. Earth = Cuba/Mexico. Elysium = USA. Brave immigrants fight through border patrol and decimate U.S. citizens to achieve their small American dream. Kindly empathize with them."
"sahamh","9","25","52","9 August 2013"," The Best Sci-Fi of 2013
","Directed and written by Neil Blomkamp, the guy who is behind one of the greatest sci-fi and alien film of the past decade, District 9 (D9). This was my most anticipated movie of the summer, and surely I'm not disappointed by it.<br/><br/>The core of the story is health care and how awful the situation is in 2154. I love the fact Blomkamp puts a message in his films while he entertains you, he doesn't try to create a change or make a direction for a change, but he brings awareness to these social issues and problems and shows how unpleasant and horrifying it can get. This helps to realism of the film's tone, which brings me to the next point I love about his films, the sci-fi aspects; it looks and feels real and believable, he doesn't make cartoonish environment, the science and technology are not too far from the realistic world. It also comes from using less green screens and performing actual stunts, but another plus in his films are the visual effects, it is astonishing, especially in some of the fight scenes, it looks so sharp and awesome. So besides the solid story, the pacing is well done, it doesn't slow down at all, the movie just keeps moving and building up without wasting a second – I totally didn't realize how fast the 100 minutes went by. The soundtrack is also perfect for this film, either if it's an emotional moment or a fight sequence, the score is there to support and add an extra element to it; Blomkamp definitely knows whom to hire to score his films, well done sir. Regarding the performances, Matt Damon surprisingly is his first sci-fi action, he brings a solid performance (I guess Dogma can be counted as sci-fi, but it wasn't as big as this, and he's done a great job here); Jodie Foster, first I need to mention that she has a really sexy, dynamic ass that I had never realized (maybe because of the Imax screens, but she surely looks sexy here), and she does a fine job here, however some might find her accent and dialogue strange and not like it, same with William Fichtner (one of the most underrated actors of the present time), but keep in mind this strange futuristic dialogue is there to show the difference between the poor class and the rich class; the best performance definitely goes to Sharlto Copley, he owns every scenes he appears on the screen, to me he's even better in here than in D9 – I found it very interesting that a lot of people didn't know he's in the movie until yesterday since he was on Reddit or just someone told them after the movie. Although with all these positive sides, I have a few problems with the film, first one is the cam shakes in some of the fight scenes, to me they're very unnecessary, especially the fact movie is R rated for the violence and the language of Copley's character - maybe at some points they considered having it in PG 13, which I'm glad they didn't because it would ruin Copley's character, and then it would destroy the whole film. The other problem is Jodi Foster's character, she's supposed to be a family oriented person, but the audience won't find that in her character at all, I guess showing more of her character would slow down the movie a little bit, and they just avoided that. Also one thing you really need to consider, this is NOT an action packed movie, there are fight and action sequences, but the film is not filled with all of it, so do NOT expect and raise your expectations based on that. I also think there are two signatures to other classic sci-fi's; a bonsai tree next to Jodi Foster, Bladerunner, and the year 2154, Avatar's year.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is the best sci-fi of the year, indeed, it's better than Man of Steel, Pacific Rim, Ironman 3, and even Star Trek Into Darkness, and yet it's not better than D9, but it' still enjoyable and very entertaining, definitely check it out in real IMAX if you can, I give it 8.8/10."

","It's more than obvious that when people go to their local movie house on rent/buy a DVD, they don't want to think about anything, aside from having a good time. Fair enough, but being voluntarily stupid doesn't exactly contribute to society. Message films today are kind of looked upon as ""pro-Commie, bleeding heart propaganda"" (thanks, Fox News), but they still have a place in the world. One of them is ""Elysium"", Neill Blomkamp's slam-bam yet thoughtful follow-up to his Oscar-nominated ""District 9"".<br/><br/>Like the song by the funk band, War, the world has become a ghetto by the year 2154, due to disease, pollution and overpopulation, and anyone big-pocketed has high-tailed it to a halo-shaped space station, its' name shared with the film's title, decked with Beverly Hills-like mansions, servant and security droids and rejuvenation chambers. Any ""undesirables"" are quickly shot down, under the command of Delacourt (Jodie Foster, ""Taxi Driver"", ""Flightplan"") the station's secretary of defense.<br/><br/>The fly is in the ointment happens to Max Dacosta (Matt Damon, the ""Jason Bourne"" saga, ""Dogma""), an ex-thief turn robot factory worker, who's dying of radiation poisoning after a work-related accident. Refitted with an exo-suit by ""smugglers"", he's sent to capture and download financial intel from the brain of his apathetic ex-boss (William Fichtner, ""Prison Break"", ""Drive Angry"") as payment for his journey to the space station, but the intel's actually a reset program for said station as the ingredient for a coup, making Max a target for DelaCourt and her field soldier, the sociopathic Kruger (Sharlto Copley, ""District 9"", ""The A-Team Movie"").<br/><br/>Like ""District 9"", which allegorized apartheid in South Africa, ""Elysium"" brilliantly allegorizes illegal immigration, social division and healthcare. Did it have to take a South African-born filmsmith to make a sci-fi satire about the aforementioned topics? Guess so, else the film's wouldn't had a sharp edge, the space station being a pristine heaven while Earth's a garbage-encrusted, decaying hell. Production designer Phillip Ivey captures that division, especially in the look of the technology. No one here's in exactly good or bad, just opportunistic, noting how society can fall so low. Damon fits in a role Bruce Willis could have played to a T; Foster echoes Sigourney Weaver with pure coldness and Copley, the 21st Century's Bruce Campbell, is both bottle-cap sardonic and sinister. They're helped by Alice Braga (""Repo Men"") as an old childhood love of Max; Diego Luna (""Rudo Y Cursi"") as Max's old heist pal and Wagner Moura as an ""tech coyote"".<br/><br/>""Elysium"" is one of those films that deserves to watch more than once because, like Blomkamp's first film, it tells the truth about the human condition in a sci-fi canvas."

Here are the rich versus the poor, a bit of programming that could change history, and yes, poor people speak Spanish and rich people converse in French. On top of that the main thug speaks in an intelligible accent, and Elysium resembles a hybrid of Beverly Hills and Southern Florida.

An old girlfriend shows up with a sick child, and the rebels in the late 21st century look even worse than the citizens of ""Waterworld"". While we follow the thinnest of stories whose end we can see from the beginning credits, we are also treated to some of the most jarring and jumpy camera-work ever seen in a big Hollywood production.

Then there is the look of the technology of the period. Everybody's spacecraft looks like something out of a cereal box, the robots are cheap copies of something we have seen before, and we really shouldn't care for this.

","I love a good sci-fi movie. Even in ones with preposterous scenarios, if the film-makers can find ways to make it credible or can display some cleverness in the presentation, I'll buy in. It's called suspension of disbelief. I had some hope for ""Elysium"", because the idea of a giant, floating space wheel where .01 per cent of the ""other half"" lives really stirred my imagination. Mind you, I had some questions about its atmosphere and the sun's lethal radiation in space, but these vital scientific issues were never touched upon. Other reviewers on this site have effectively lambasted the film for its suspect science, so I'll merely recap by saying: The film-makers seem to think that if they just show it the audience will believe it.<br/><br/>I'd like to zero in on those cure-all medical pods in the movie. The door opens, you place the sick person inside, the door closes, the machine diagnoses the problem and - presto! - the person is cured. It works for leukemia, severed limbs and faces that have been torn off (and I swear that the face in question grew back without acne scars or grey hairs in the beard - yes, a finely trimmed beard grew back, too!). This isn't science, or science-fiction. It's magic. It occurred to me that with such magical medical machines all over the place this could have been a movie about immortality. Because you could certainly cure death.<br/><br/>I expect more from a big-budget movie in an age bristling with scientific knowledge. Fifty years ago this type of cheese would have seemed pretty nifty, but not under present-day circumstances. It's not even a well-made movie, with its choppy pacing and inability to allow the audience to inhabit any of the physical spaces it shows on screen. Poor Matt barely gets a chance to breathe let alone develop a character; and then there's Jodie Foster, who practically bellows her lines and wears a facial expression that suggests rectal discomfort. Maybe she should try one of those magic pods."

As I said, almost everything that people like cyberpunk genre for and what they wait from it.<br/><br/>Now, the main problem with it stems from the fact that it was advertised as a sci-fi action movie from creators of District 9. So people waited some sort of a braniac movie with really heavy social commentary and great action. Now, when action is there, it's really cool, imo, nothing epic, just sort of grounded and realistic, but nice. Cyberpunk is a fantasy genre, there's no sci-fi in it, it was mostly just projecting the current tech into the future with some funny ideas attached. The main plot is pretty straightforward, simple and naive, very typical of cyberpunk.<br/><br/>Actors did a really good job representing their character archetypes.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie was missing is a gloomy neon aesthetic that is associated with the genre. This way it would be probably classified more properly. Other than that it's a perfect representation of cyberpunk in movie form."
"bruno-costa","10","2","2","29 July 2018"," This is already happening
","Excellent visual and good acting. Yes, this movie should've had a better pace, but nothing that could've damaged its real value. The simple truth is that Blomkamp has something important to say and he knows what he is talking about and how to film it.
I read people here saying the story is just too extreme, unreal...
Please...
Overpopulation is real as the hypocrisy about birth control. Poverty and inequality are rampant. Fascism is spreading fast... Waves of miserable people are dying trying to enter not only Europe and North America, but even Brazil!!! Brazil, that has more homicides than half of the world together...
Truth is that countries like Brazil, Mexico and South Africa are already organized in the ""condo"" logic that Elysium denounced. The fact that some people denied this reality is the reason why this movie is so relevant. People should read Locke again and try hard to understand that unjustified extreme inequality breaks the system. That should be no mystery, since French and Russian revolutions were just about that... But if this mystery still remains, Blomkamp is fully justified and needed.
Of course the movie isn't just the message. There are excellent filming and good acting. Luna, Braga, Moura and Copley know exactly what they are doing. Those characters, that violence and despair, it is all real and they saw that on their homelands...
That's why Damon is so good, because he really jump on and find the main line: despair. The same despair of the people that dye trying to reach a country where they maybe will have access to primary goods."

Don't go into this expecting something new.<br/><br/>Enjoy the visual feat that this movie presents to you in the wide screen cinema near you.<br/><br/>Try not to argue too heavily on the free health care issue and call it impossible because here in Australia we have free health care and it's not destroying our society.<br/><br/>A+"
"Danusha_Goska","4","22","46","11 August 2013"," A Dull Sermon about Obamacare and Open Borders in the Guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic
","""Elysium"" is a dull sermon about Obamacare and open borders in the guise of a so-so Sci-fi flic. The didactic aspect of the film is so heavy- handed it takes you right out of the movie, out of the willing suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help that ""Elysium"" lacks the arresting characters, clever plotting, or wowee special effects that break science fiction films out beyond the genre's die-hard fans. <br/><br/>It's 2154 in a dystopic Los Angeles. LA is ugly and garbage-strewn, in a futuristic way. Almost everyone in LA is Hispanic or at least speaks Spanish. Max (Matt Damon), a bald and tattooed ex-con trying to go straight, is forced into taking on a high-risk crime for Spider (Wagner Moura), a crime lord. Max has to travel to Elysium, a space station where rich white Americans live in beauty and luxury, unlike the cursed denizens of earth, who are mostly Hispanic and live in garbage strewn slums and can't get adequate medical care. Elysium has med-beds. If you lie down on a med-bed, no matter what your ailment is, the med-bed will cure you.<br/><br/>Spider is plotting to breach Elysium's security and take it over, thus making med-beds and Elysium's breathtaking beauty available to all. He faces formidable foes. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster is the white, blonde Elysium antagonist. She is trying to protect Elysium from the Hispanic immigrants and sick people in search of health care who are attempting to enter. Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, a South African actor, is her evil tool. There is no attempt to explain why someone with such a pronounced South African accent lives in LA. In any case, Copley's performance of an enthusiastic sadist is the best thing about the film. <br/><br/>There is a lot of chasing. Men put on metallic costumes that give them special powers. There are your usual hyped up guns and there are also some knives and swords. A lot of this feels like expedient cheating, as it always does in fantasy movies. There are special devices that detect runaways. Max is able to elude these super smart devices by hiding under pigs. The movie never explains, as these movies never explain, the rules of such gadgetry. If a character needs to get away to advance the plot, some trick will help him to get away. <br/><br/>I live in a non-futuristic, garbage-strewn slum. We have had liberal, Democratic government for generations. See Detroit. We've been hearing the same message for generations, the same message ""Elysium"" sends: ""It's us versus them. We are human; they are cold and cruel. They live lives of perfect bliss. Their health problems are all taken care of. They only way for us to achieve anything is to take what they have."" <br/><br/>This message, even in a grade C sci-fi flick, is toxic. Liberals do not help us, the poor, by telling us that we have nothing of value in ourselves, that it is only through taking what the rich have that we can have lives of value. Poor people do not benefit by discounting what they have and living lives of passive, deluded envy, focusing on what the rich have rather than focusing on their own skills and blessings, and cultivating their own opportunities. <br/><br/>If the Earthlings of ""Elysium"" succeeded in their goal, it wouldn't end there. It would end as the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Iranian Revolution and others ended: with terror, torture, rape, chaos, and ""meet the new boss; same as the old boss."" The real revolution starts when we look within and outside ourselves with love."

","I'm a fan of Jodie Foster and even a fan of few of Matt Damon's movies, so making the choice to watch this movie was no-brainer. Unfortunately everything starts bad, continues to grow into worse and it ends up disastrous.<br/><br/>My biggest problem here was the screenplay, it's like the author has never read a book in his/her life and was in a hurry to write the script. In the year of 2013 with such premium actors you would expect better lines than ""I will find you, I will hunt you down"" from the cacky British negative hero. <br/><br/>Shallow lines, not following on the actors pre-story. Mat Damon is supposed to be some car-thief legend, yet he speaks like a coward most of the time, lives like a rat and uses ""man"" too much, his bold head is repulsive and along with the tattoos he looks like Neo Nazi more than ex keep-it-cool car thief, but trust me the real disappointment here are the lines he had to act on in the movie... <br/><br/>He was a legend thief - 3 seconds later - now he works in a dumpster-like factory.<br/><br/>He has a childhood girlfriend - 5 seconds later she has kid, he doesn't keep in touch anymore. 5 seconds later the kid is sick and dying. 5 seconds later after 20 years he is in her house, 5 seconds later he leaves, refuses to help kid. <br/><br/>They overthrow the richest community in the world with 2 guys, who are no ""expendables"" heroes they are just ghetto thugs. It's like the rich people would not pay to be protected by at least 100 soldiers... On the whole Elysium there were like 2 droids... <br/><br/>The president William Fichtner looks more like a wedding planner than a creator of Elysium, his death was meaningless and the bad kind of Unexpected. The death of Jodie Foster was even worse, the whole idea of Elysium was that you don't get sick and you live well, yet she refuses without following her negative character to be helped...<br/><br/>If you ever watched Bornes Ultimacy, silence of the lambs and similar movies where Jodie and Matt are big deal, don't get fooled, this movie will only ruin your image of them and you will surely watch more than a trailer before you jump into the next movie with them."

","Well I've just watched this and at first I thought it was going to be a bit boring and not my sort of thing but wow my opinion sure did change. We start of by knowing that there are two worlds which are Earth and Elysium. Everybody wants to get to Elysium because the air's better and life in whole is much better than being on earth. There is this one bad guy who lives on Earth and blows up people who try and get to Elysium illegally.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is the lead guy and yeah he looks great. His acting is okay I wouldn't say that he was great though. Jodie Foster was rubbish absolutely rubbish and she was such a bitch in this film. I really didn't like her in this film even though she is only in it for about 10 minutes. The rest of the actors and actresses were great. I loved Matt Damon's friend but unfortunately he died which was quite sad. I liked Matt's friendship with the woman whose daughter is dying.<br/><br/>The story line itself was brilliant. I really loved the idea of being in the future; the world really made you think maybe one day this could all come true. You always hear about living in space and I think now it might be cool. So basically the story was Matt Damon gets sick and wants to get to Elysium so he can be cured; he fights with lots of people and eventually saves the world. But it comes at a cost.<br/><br/>Oh the ending. Damn you whoever made this film. Why did you have to do that at the end. I seriously think I might cry. No I'm joking but seriously was there any need? No.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film it was good although some parts were a bit predictable. I think that the ratings on this film are perfect. I would rate it 9 out of 10 because for me I saw it coming apart from the ending."
"btnthx","Null","9","16","13 August 2013"," Not District 9, but still not bad
","Most of the great works of science fiction take place on a spaceship, another planet, or in the case of the new Neil Blomkamp film, a dystopian future where instead of a wall separating two countries, it's the space between a diseased-ridden Earth and the distant but visible Mercedes-Benz logo looking space station, ""Elysium"".<br/><br/>On Elysium the haves, have it all, beautiful houses, beautiful children, and even little MRI machines that cure whatever ails you, be it broken arm or life-threatening disease. The have-nots back on Earth live a hard life not to dissimilar from the one that Blomkamp portrayed in his previous film, the fantastic ""District 9"". Instead of the oppressed aliens in Johannesburg, this time it's a whole planet. On this Earth, in the ruins of L.A. in the year 2154 lives Max (Matt Damon) an ex-con with the heart of gold, which we're told in way too many flashbacks that he is special. On Elysium Jodie Foster runs the show as a government official who keeps the floating paradise safe by killing all who try to enter.<br/><br/>When all too convenient circumstances bring Damon and Foster in opposition the movie really picks up, with a few stops to introduce Alice Braga's character and fits her and her story like a familiar puzzle piece into the narrative. That is the major drawback on the film aside from the constant reminders of rich is bad and poor is good, is that everything feels all too convenient. Characters who all know each other or who only have one degree of separation between the main cast. Plus if you know sci-fi, or even movie logic, you will see everywhere the movie takes you well before you get there.<br/><br/>The performances keep you engaged enough, mostly though through the slightly 'off' character Kruger played fittingly by Sharlto Copley. What really stood out to me was the world building and the incredible, I mean really incredible visuals. From the robot police to the simple 30- plus year effect of a ship flying in space, the visual effects artists really made a beautiful looking film. Writer/Director Blomkamp still needs some work on his storytelling and his fight scenes. Or maybe he shouldn't have got the steady-cam crew from Damon's ""Bourne"" movies to shoot a lot of his action.<br/><br/>The classics of sci-fi almost always have some sort of social commentary as told through a fictional prism. Who we are, what we are capable of, what we can do to ourselves as well as one another in a society with rules that are followed blindly. Unfortunately ""Elysium"" is not one of those destined to be a classic, but it reminds you of the potential these types of films still have and gives me hope that Blomkamp can give us another one with his next film.<br/><br/>--Robert L. Castillo <br/><br/>http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"
"A_Different_Drummer","9","9","16","12 August 2013"," Great .. could have been superb
","Neill Blomkamp (District 9) is a good writer director with a near-mastery of set design and CGI. If he could learn to take his lead-foot off the ""social allegory"" pedal he could be superb. But that is not likely to happen anytime soon, because Bloomkamp is clearly attracted to the Moral Pulpit like a moth to the flame. Not that this is a bad thing. At a time when Hollywood does not know whether it is coming or going (literally -- if you haven't been paying attention, Tinseltown product is now being released in Russia before it ever gets to Cleveland) it is refreshing indeed to encounter a film as finely crafted as Elysium. So well crafted indeed that Bloomkamp has unintentionally made it remarkably easy for his audience to ignore most (if not all) of the preaching and simply enjoy one of the most fluid sci-fi actioners since Alien. That's how good this guy is. As much as he would love to get each viewer alone for 6 hours and explain precisely what is wrong with our world - DUH -- he simply cannot resist the temptation to be an entertainer first, and a cleric second. Highly recommended. And for those with lingering doubts, a newly ""buffed"" Matt Damon has become the new Kurt Russell and a genuine Action Figure. IRONY ALERT: Damon could not be cajoled into doing the last Bourne but his role here is little more than Bourne Redux. Ditto for Jodie Foster, who turned up her nose at the last Hannibal, but here gives a performance that is little more than a placeholder for action to come."
"LadyJessicaDarke","5","17","35","10 August 2013"," Elysium - A Story We've Seen Before
","I apologize for the delay on this, I watched this film Thursday night and it took me this long to settle on what I needed to say about it. If you are worried about the girl who won't shut up about movies having to figure out what to say about this one; you should be. <br/><br/>This is Writer and Director Neil Blomkamps sophomore effort in the US. Most people remember the Peter Jackson produced (that means he was the money) District 9. A not so subtle story about the effects of racism in his native country of South Africa using aliens and humans as the opposing races. While many Americans that I know of derided the movie for it's obvious themes and what appeared to be a ""why now?"" mindset. What those individuals forget is that while the laws against segregation were enacted within the US in 1964 it wasn't for another 30 years until they were put into place in his country until 1994. Thats right, everyone reading this review was alive then. It was only 19 years ago (15 when District 9 came out); so it was fresh in his memory and his countries memory not something told in history books and hundreds of movies since.<br/><br/>This may seem like a long diatribe on history and this director without point, but I swear I have one. It's that he has gone back to what the best of Science Fiction used to do; which is focus on social or current issues framing it in an alternate world that provokes thought and with a bit of luck awareness. So while films like District 9 and comics like X- men (originally) focused on racism, Elysium and other films in the sci fi and horror genre are beginning to focus on a new *ism*, class-ism. <br/><br/>But do they do it well?<br/><br/>That's the question that kept me silent and wondering on this one. The answer I am afraid is *No*. While Elysium sets up a dystopian future with clear lines between the haves and the have nots, it doesn't really do anything with it in a meaningful way. No one learns anything, no one evolves. While the plot lines introduced in the movie are resolved in a nice tidy bow, the only lessons the film teaches us:<br/><br/>If you are amoral - you will die If you are a have not - you will suffer first, then die. The only way the Have Nots can achieve what the Haves have (sounds weird), is through violence, treachery and few Haves wanting more and making a well timed mistake.<br/><br/>From a storytelling perspective, the movie does nothing new. If you saw the recent Total Recall remake (it is not as bad as people say), you have watched Elysium. DOn't believe me? While I normally remain spoiler free I feel that I must provide some synopsis that may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Try this: A blue collar man who works on the robotic line that makes the robot police that keep him and the rest of the low class oppressed rises up and through violence and criminal amoral acts with the inspirational help a woman who loves him and reaches the other side of the world, while being hunted by a terminator esque force, where the Rich live and brings down the threat of oppression allowing his people, the poor working class to be free and live happily.<br/><br/>Another one? JOhnny Mnemonic. Don't boo, it has nostalgia value and is highly entertaining in the cyberpunk genre. <br/><br/>A man with a dubious and somewhat criminal history has data that can save the world implanted in his head. Rather than wanting to save the world, he wants nothing but to save himself. The people who like the world just the way it is dispatch a terminator esque creature to stop him from reaching a resistance that he is being guided to by a woman who cares for him. In the end to save his own life and those of the people around him he goes for broke and manages to use whats in his head to save the underclass citizens of the world.<br/><br/>Both of these synopsis just describe Elysium. WHile there are different effects, different characters, filming styles, etc Elysium adds nothing truly new other than a medical McGuffin that everyone wants. The acting is fine, the actors themselves are fine even if they are playing two dimensional stereotypes we have seen before.<br/><br/>STOP. WITH. THE. SHAKY. CAM.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch the fights and I couldn't because the camera man was clearly involved in a 7.0 earthquake at the time of filming. I want to hunt the inventor of shaky cam to the ends of the earth for it.<br/><br/>TL;DR<br/><br/>WHile Elysium isn't bad, I wasn't really entertained except for a few moments of the film. Matt Damon and Sharlto COpley are all that save this from being a bad movie.<br/><br/>MatinÃ©e it if you must, skip it entirely if you musn't.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have a chance of overriding the system."

","I'll start with the good points as they are very few to start with. The CGI and Matt Damon's performance were okay. Other than that, the movie just made me laugh, not in a good way. The dialogues were so terrible that I knew where the movie was heading in the first five minutes itself. Every dialogue was made up to explain the plot which was already obvious from the visuals. What's up with Jodie Foster? I never knew that she was such a terrible actress. Many of the characters looked so fake and unrealistic. I didn't find a single character that a normal person can relate to. The Direction and writing were unbearably terrible. The writer somehow assumed that all the viewers are dumb. In the scenes where there was a melodrama, it looked so unrealistic that the viewers were feeling almost nothing. The whole time I spent in the cinema, i was so conscious that I was watching a terrible film. I promised myself not to go to this writer's films again. All my friends had the same view about this film. Oh by the way, there are some major continuity issues as well."

","I do not believe the Randian principles that this movie was based on- I do not believe that if you remove the very rich that the society that remains would be one of crime and poverty. I believe, if the rich somehow figured out a way to overcome all scientific barriers to building/living on a space station (which I assume would include messaging technology that looks better than Sprint text messages circa 2002), a new caste system would emerge (probably with those lauding authoritarianism on top) and political dissidents looking to dismantle the system (not car thieves) would be par for course within that new society (assuming that the rich are on a space station not the gated community across the train tracks). This would have been a more interesting movie.<br/><br/>I did not expect anything from this movie- it usually keeps me from being disappointed. I was not disappointed-- I was induced to anger by shallow characters whose motivation consists of only ""My sick daughter!"" or ""I want power"" or ""I'm envious of that perfect life in the sky- and now my sick butt has motivated me to get there."" If I don't care about the characters at all- how am I supposed to care what happens in the *very long fight scenes*? These shallow characters were highlighted by the atrocious dialogue. Characters shift within their actions for no understandable reason.<br/><br/>I'm a liberal and this movie felt like propaganda to ME. It was ham handed about health care, wealth inequality, racial inequality- all legitimate concerns but so poorly illustrated that it became a mockery of itself and those concerns. If they were trying to make something for low information voters- they might have started with characters that evoked any emotion (at all) from the audience."

In a ""fascist"" universe people come and go as they please. There's a whole underground society with the highest technology available. One wonders why they don't use it to cure these poor children. The ships going from Earth to Elysium get shot down or get in, whatever the story needs. A highly trained, clever technician gets hurt in a way a 10 years old child wouldn't. And then we have these heartrending memories of childhood in slo-mo, loads of them, with music, of course. BTW : the score is laughable. And I have never seen Jodie Foster that bad.

Actors like Matt Damon, Judie Foster or William Fichtner are always high-level (Damon has become a really versatile actor, his role in Behind the Candelabra is totally different). However, the movie has no even good-bad contradiction, as Sharito Copley is not equal in value with Damon.

"The-Sarkologist","10","9","17","16 August 2013"," Arguably the best film of 2013
","This is one of those films that I probably don't need to actually introduce anybody to what it is about because the adds have been filling the cinemas, buses, and bus shelters for the last two months. I also do not need to mention that it is a really good movie because I can see that opinion is actually quite divided, both with regards to the script, the plot, and the ideas behind it. In fact I have noticed that the idea behind the movie has actually raised some hackles, at least on the IMDb boards where people are somewhat offended at the liberal nature of this movie.<br/><br/>Now, there is a suggestion that Blomkamp is giving us an idea of the differences between the United States and the rest of the world, however I do not think that this is the case. In relation to the question of countries I believe that Australia is more like Elysium than the United States, not just because we are a wealthy nation, and not just because we are surrounded by a moat that is incredibly difficult to cross, but also because we have a universal health care system than is the envy of much of the world (though there are countries with much better health care than ours). However, I suspect that the divide between the over crowded Earth and the paradisaical Elysium is much more metaphorical in that it clearly contrasts the differences between the rich and the poor.<br/><br/>The whole point of the movie seems to deal with access to medical care. It is not so much that the wealthy live in Elysium and that the poor live in hell, but rather the question of basic rights, such a medical care, that is denied to people who don't have movie and is a given to those who do. While in Australia, medical care is guaranteed for life threatening conditions, there is still the question of money when it comes to non-urgent matters. For instance, people which require elective surgery (such as knee surgery) can be waiting for years, in pain, before they are able to get access to the care that they need, while those with Health Insurance (available, though still somewhat pricey, I pay around $1200 a year before government rebates) get bumped to the top of the list. It is not so much a question of whether the surgery required is life or death, but rather whether somebody is living in pain while waiting for surgery.<br/><br/>It is interesting though how Blomkamp portrays this society because, at the beginning of the movie, we have three ships making a run for Elysium and the director of security orders a sleeper agent to shoot them down. The ruling council rebukes her for the use of such tactics due to questions relating to human rights, however we see that as soon as they arrive they are arrested and shipped back to Earth (and the only reason one is making the run for Elysium is to get access to medical treatment). In a way it is similar here in Australia because the only reason our navy is not blasting refugee ships out of the water as they make the run for Australia is because we will be condemned for such barbaric behaviour. However, while we may not be systematically killing them, we are still locking them up in detention facilities in inhumane conditions with no hope of release.<br/><br/>There are other factors (not political) that I should mention as well. Okay, Kruger is just one of the nastiest bad guys I have ever seen, but it seems like many have commented on that as well. What impresses me about Blomkamp's two films is the way he creates science-fiction weapons. In District 9 I simply loved the suit which uses a magnetic field to collect a bunch of bullets, as well as the way Blomkamp makes his bodies explode. Expect the same in this film. Kruger has this simply awesome shield that he uses to protect himself, while Max has this gun with an awesome bullet that simply blows away one of the robot police officers. As a final word though, personally, I think Copley simply stole the show, relegating Damon (who is a pretty good actor anyway) to that of a supporting role."

","Elysium has to be one of the most populist oriented science fiction films I've ever seen. Doesn't mean it isn't good, in fact has a message of equality that should resonate for today's audience.<br/><br/>Elysium is a giant wheel in space with artificial atmosphere where folks live on the inner ring in really luxurious style. They've even got all the latest advances in modern science with a machine that can cure just about anything. For that if nothing else the people living there want to keep it to themselves.<br/><br/>Meanwhile back on Earth the planet has just become one big polluted mass where everyone just scratches out a living the best they can. It's patrolled by robot police who keep the great mass in line. Everyone yearns to go to Elysium and live the good life. But there are no Horatio Alger stories any more. The haves, the 2% that live on Elysium want to keep it for themselves and are ruthless in keeping the other 98% in line.<br/><br/>What's brought things to the sorry state they're in is unbridled capitalism. That's the message of Elysium.<br/><br/>The one man who's going to change it is Matt Damon who gets an accidental overdose of radiation poisoning on his industrial job. Now he wants to get to Elysium and steal some of that rationed healthcare. In the end though he serves far more than himself.<br/><br/>That part of the film reminded me so much of the famous noir film DOA where Edmond O'Brien is given a slow acting poison. As for the ending that's from another classic science fiction film The Omega Man with Charlton Heston. See if you don't recognize the plot elements.<br/><br/>One of the causes near and dear to Matt Damon's heart is our environment. Both in this film and in his most recent previous film Promised Land, Damon used the power of his celebrity to voice these concerns without sacrificing an iota of entertainment.<br/><br/>His adversary for most of the film is Jodie Foster who plays the head of Homeland Security on Elysium. She's got an agenda of her own as she protects the Homeland Security for the haves on Elysium.<br/><br/>Elysium also makes some strong political statements about the USA as a kind of earthly Elysium which at one time was built on the strength of immigrants which now some want to keep out at any price.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this film very much, it's one of the best so far I've seen this year."

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","18 August 2013"," Welcome to the world of Elysium: Heaven, if you're rich, and hell on earth if you're poor. Elysium is a great thinking man Sci-fiction movie.
","From the director of 2009's Distant 9 Neil Blomkamp, comes another controversial sci-fi movie about the different between the have and have not, racism, and overpopulation. The movie is so like Distant 9, it's like watching the future Earth after the aliens left it. It's pretty shocking to see Neil Blomkamp try to strike lightning again with similar plots and themes. It's rare to see a hard Rated R blockbuster nowadays. I give props to them about that. The movie is a thinking man movie because it explores the political and sociological themes such as immigration, health care and class issues. Great world building indeed, as the film takes place in 2154, on both a luxurious space station known as Elysium where the rich people have orbit and ravaged, disease, wasteland Earth with the overpopulation poor. Elysium's Earth, so remind me of Distant 9 with its vast emptiness. Elysium's space station reminds me of an old 1970's NASA Ames drawings of a ring-shaped Torus space station. Those paintings were in a lot of Sci-Fi books and comics at the time and the 1980's. The space station also look like something that came from 1968's Kubrick, 'A Space Odyssey' or Larry Niven's Ringworld novel. The visual effects are amazing. Great use of CGI. The world on display here is imaginative yet utterly convincing. Max DeCosta (Matt Damon), an ex-con lives in this world, manufacturing the means of his own oppression, making security bots. It's weird that he is one of the few white people on Earth. Only when he got into deadly radiation poisoning, he joins the cause of getting people to Elysium so that they can have a chance to survive. I would kinda like to see that he was loyal to that cause beforehand. He is not alone, as he is join by his childhood best friend, Fey (Alice Braga) who daughter has leukemia. Don't get me wrong, free health care to sick dying children is fine, but with a world that is that overpopulation; the hard truth is that depopulation is needed to solve that problem. Overpopulation can destroy a habitat and nature eco-cycle if not watch. In truth, while Max DeCosta and his crew are portray as free-fighters, they are also terrorists to those people who control Elysium, mostly John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster). While, William Fichtner is clearly acting as William Fichtner; Jodie Foster's acting was pretty bad. She had this weird accent that supposed to be South African as if she was playing Lillian Crane. I don't understand why everybody in Elysium was portray as evil business-men. While, I'm more liberal, I would think at less, the movie would have shown that some people at Elysium would be more against the anti-immigration. Why couldn't Elysium build another space station or terra- form another planet or even get this, rebuild Earth? Clearly, they had the technology for it. I forgot, because the plot says so. At less, they could have done is add a few medical pods on Earth for young dying children so they would be so many civil unrest. So Max makes a deal with a local crime lord: He will kidnap John Carlyle in order to download information held in his brain, and in return he'll get a ticket on the next illicit flight to Elysium. To help with the gig, Max even has a powerful exo-skeleton grafted painfully onto his body. This makes the movie, seem more like a video game like Bio Shock Infinite. The movie is full of annoying action scenes with slow bullet time moments and shaking cam. It was a headache to watch. The action fight scenes were so fast, it was blurry. At less, Mad Max had himself, a pretty intense psycho villain mercenary named Kruger. (Sharlto Copley). Wow, this actor is amazing, too bad, he isn't in many films. It's polar opposite of the character, he played in Distant 9. The movie's plot can be a big predictable. The Jesus symbolism was tired when other movies did it, and manages to feel even more derivative in this film's overt delivery. An handful of right-wing news outlets attacked the film for being sci-fi socialism, but in my opinion, there is nothing wrong with open discussion to these issues. I agree the film should be designed to make us think, rather than stuff a predigested agenda down our throats, but sometimes that push is needed for this society. Much of what Republican analysts mistakenly see as Occupy Wall Street support is merely a form of ""mass-ploitation"" — Hollywood seizing on angles that appeal to the widest possible audience. There been films like this since the dawn of cinema. Remember, films like 1927's Metropolis. I think, most people would agree with that people should have access to first-rate healthcare and a better standard of living. They just disagree on the means of providing that. The themes of the movie are brilliant, even the title 'Elysium' was a term in ancient times given to a place, like Heaven that was reserved by gods for the favored heroes. We have other literary examples of this through Richard Matheson, Isaac Asimov, and Philip Dick, to name a few. The movie also have this 1979's Mad Max feel to it. The soundtrack was a bit too loud. It remind me of a copycat of 2010's Inception sound, rather than the moving music instrument that should follow a film like this. That being the case, Elysium is just not the satisfying film it should be to some people, but to me: it work. It was fun to watch. Elysium works in a way, how Elysium in the film works. It's just there to remind people to seek a better life. I could find escape from the harshest of my reality in the film 'Elysium'."

","Man., talk about immigration restrictions! In this film the wealthy society have left earth and moved into outer space to a spiraling community called Elysium. Healthcare back on earth is virtually non-existent, while on Elysium (as shown in the trailer) there is a magic healing machine that can fix any kind of ailment that you can think of. I thought during the film that if such a machine did exist, earth would explode with population growth. Maybe that will be the sequel (smile). I was also happy to see that they re-used earthly communities from District 9 (or something very similar). Why not save a buck when you can. Max (Matt Damon) finds himself in a very volatile situation and desperately needs to get to Elysium to rectify the situation. In order to get this done he has to make a ""last ditch"" deal with Spider (Wagner Moura) who is the local deviant. Max also bumps into his childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga) who somehow manages to get herself entangled in this whole mess. There is also an undercover hit man running around earth named Kruger (Sharlto Copley – reappearing from District 9) who works for the corrupt Delacourt (Jodie Foster). I have to pause here and just say that I couldn't understand one thing that Kruger was saying. Anyway, Delacourt is constantly breaking the rules and is tired of taking orders from the space court. She wants to do things her way. That being said, in comes John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who is a greedy business man looking to get as many government contracts as he can. The robot army in the film kind of reminded me of I, Robot (especially at the end of the film). I think that director Neill Blomkamp is definitely comfortable in this genre and I think he should continue to make Sci-fi films, however I think that this film lacked an emotional connection for me. I really never got vested in the main character although Frey's daughter did tug at the heart strings just a bit. On a positive note, I think that parts of the film were visually stunning. It never ceases to amaze me with what they can do with CGI. I found the film to be very predictable, but I am glad that it was not butt-blister long. There are a lot of films opening this weekend and I am not sure that I would put this one at the top of the list. I give this film an amber light."
"supatube","8","4","6","26 February 2014"," It's a great film, hands down.
","The film is well worth a watch. <br/><br/>""Elysium"" was viewed at home on an iTunes recommendation. I did not look into it at all. So even before we got to the 'Afrikaner' accent from the bad guys I felt the story was a rehash of ""District 9"". Especially because it looked the same. Yes, Shalto Copley seeled it, it was a Neill Blomkamp film, but before him all i could see were the similarities in the character ""Max"" from ""Elysium"" and ""Wikus"" from ""District 9"". The story of the unassuming hero who needs to emotionally understand his part in joining the revolution/resistance... <br/><br/>So was the story lacking depth? Were the characters heartless? Was it sloppy character development and rudimentary story telling? I personally saw the connection between the two films and was captivated nonetheless. ""Elysium"" seemed to focus on creating the world the story would play out in, as it formed a large crux of what the story would be about, so the difference in setting was more crucial than the unassuming hero. Maybe if the hero had been a woman it may have added a dimension that was less familiar, bringing us to the point. It was not a poor story but a familiar one which left the story revelers to think of something else while soaking up the visual feast. Captivation was not as demanding simply based on a familiar feeling. And it took a second viewing to really grasp the story because I just wasn't listening the first time - I heard the sounds but not the words.<br/><br/>So why deem it such a great film if in fact very little attention was paid? Once that familiar story was acknowledged the focus was not on ""Max"" but the connection that Elysium has to Earth, the unflinching grasp one group has to have over another in order to exist. <br/><br/>Admittedly great movies have to have pivotal main characters, so how can one just dismiss the main character and still rave about its importance? That's because it's a Sci-Fi. Take a great Sci- Fi story like ""The Man From Earth"". Impeccable in the way it massages the brain but that very massaging could be experienced if I listened to it over the radio. It was not fantastical in its delivery. ""After Earth"" had characters that should have pulled out something amazing in an incredibly lush environment but it couldn't even hold its head above water. <br/><br/>Sci-Fi can be the trickiest one to get near perfect, and with time ""Elysium"" might prove to be one that stands a little longer than expected. The heart is there, the message is there, the layers and depth is there but may very well be over shadowed by our societal fad of ""been there done that"".<br/><br/>And the true test of greatness when it comes to film is its longevity - that being said, if Neill Blomkamp can maybe throw some ideas around about different characters, build on other unassuming type figures, with a bit more of a grotty past, then we might very well have a Hero in the Sci-Fi department of Movies."

","I could poke holes in the story all day long, as many other reviews have already done. I mean, why would Matt Damon walk into a deadly radiation chamber just to unjam the door? Surely they would have a master Off switch for safety. Or they could send in a robot to unjam the door. That scene alone was too phony. And how is Jodie Foster is able to shout extreme insults at her boss, the President? Wouldn't she be instantly fired? It's also unbelievable that everyone on Earth got to become Elysium citizens through a mere computer hack. You'd think the Elysians could simply undo that. And why would copying data from Matt's brain kill Matt? But the guy who got his head blown off with a grenade was able to grow a new head. <br/><br/>Some sci-fi stories are either too fake or too stupid to be made into movies. How did they ever get an $80M budget to make this film? Surely there are more worthy scripts than this floating around Hollywood. So let's see, the plot and the screenplay both sucked. On the acting side, Matt Damon tried hard but was not good enough to make up for the lame plot, so it was probably his worst performance ever. Jodie Foster was terrible. I'm surprised those two accepted the roles at all after reading the script."

This ""split"" reminded me of ""Metropolis"" in a way. Jodie Foster (in a heavy role for a change) plays the main baddie who wants to keep Elysium free of unwanted people at any cost (including hiring psycho cyborgs and ordering spacecraft blown away). Matt Damon is also surprisingly interesting as ""Max"" a man who has spent his entire awful life on Earth yearning to go to Elysium. Lots of awesome special effects and action sequences as well.

Seem most movies follow the same genre of guns and chases etc. that are really old and lame. Hollywood is politically against guns but they love them in their movies. What Hippocrits. Damon is insipid in his role. So predictable. Then, insight came into my head, the movie is really about Hollywood's pie in the sky attitude toward life. The refugees wanting to escape earth are clearly representing Mexicans and the space station current day U.S.A. Only the rich get the best medical treatment and the immigrants get nothing. Sound Familiar? Wake up Hollywood, event the die hard liberals are sick of the same old same old."
"Crankgorilla","7","4","6","9 December 2013"," Plenty of Bang for your Buck
","Probably a better movie than the recent Oblivion and aspects of design I like better than the recent Star Trek. I really like Blomkamp's style in his movies, and you'll notice it here if you've seen his previous District 9. There's great contrast in the space station and the citizens on Earth. The station citizens are painted as such pompous ignorant sorts, you get the feeling it would be great if we launched them all into space really, but the dominance and exploitation over the run down earth population is what drives the story. Why they don't whack a few of the med treatment units down on Earth is a bit of a wonder... But I suppose current health care is experiencing the teething signs of this horrible future. The woman/child aspect is a transparent plot driver which is kind of annoying and only the daft will be surprised by the ending, but it is a good ride overall with awesome visuals and some thrilling tech. Very industrial with some great design aspects. Everyone acts the parts well with standout Sharlto Carpley as the main villain who is just awesome to watch and so good with the dialog. They should get the nutter from the Guy Pierce ""Lockout"" movie and Carpley together as a villain duo - I'd watch something with that. Anyways, if you like sci-fi, you'll like what has been done here most likely. A good use of the screen time and plenty of bang for your buck, even if one is left wanting for a few more surprises and a deeper plot."
"JPfanatic93","8","4","6","23 September 2013"," The return of good old-fashioned intelligent science fiction
","A fabulously dystopian science fiction flick in every sense of the term, courtesy of the still fairly inexperienced South-African director Neill Blomkamp, who continues treading the path he started with the smash hit District 9 (2009). No extra-terrestrials this time, as Elysium focuses on our own local troubles on Earth. Overpopulation and pollution have taken their toll on our world by the time the year 2154 arrives, but for those stemming from rich and powerful families, life is a never ending vacation on the space station Elysium, where the wealthy look down on their fellow man below in excessive luxury. Alarmingly protective to make sure the huge masses won't infect the beauty of their private Heaven, the common man is not allowed to visit the station, and most travel between locations is done exclusively by robots. There's no sickness on these Elysian fields made reality, as each residence has its private medical pod which immediately cures all ailments. The ex-con Max (Matt Damon) is not so lucky, as he gets exposed to a lethal dose of radiation at the shuttle factory – you'd think such dangerous but important work was delegated to droids too, but humans are no doubt cheaper and more expendable in this sorry state of affairs – after which he is informed he's only got five days left to live. In an effort to save his sad existence, but soon that of the daughter of the love of his life (Alice Braga) too, he gets involved with a shady criminal organization that seeks to infiltrate Elysium to hack its systems and make illegal human trafficking easier. All Max needs to do is kidnap a visiting station dignitary – the terrific and terrifyingly rude and unsympathetic William Fichtner, who considers his Earthly brethren little more than unhygienic cheap labour – and break into his head via a comlink wedged in his brain to steal the necessary data. Unfortunately, things go wrong and the target dies during the heist. What's worse, he happened to be involved in a covert operation orchestrated by Elysium's Minister of Defense (Jodie Foster with a funny accent) – who has no moral qualms in shooting down refugee ships from earth to make sure no poor people invade her homeland – to seize government control. Soon Max must run for his life, both to reach Elysium before the countdown ends, and to evade a particularly nasty and amoral band of ruthless mercenaries led by the unstable, maniacal Kruger (Sharlto Copley, who starred in District 9).<br/><br/>Blomkamp develops this disturbingly inhumane world with its outrageous divide between the haves and the have-nots – a not all too inconceivable and unbelievable scenario considering our present day social situation – to a frightfully effective extent, hearkening back to similar dystopian genre classics of the the notoriously gloomy Seventies the likes of Soylent Green and Rollerball, illustrating a future society where all our present day problems continue to exist, except they've grown to seemingly unsolvable proportions. The potential consequences of our everyday indifference and our political inabilities to end such increasing social inequality are amply showcased in Elysium, but not in such a heavy-hearted manner they alienate the audience. Similarly, Blomkamp has put his design team to incredibly good use, creating a visually lavish world which does not seem so far-fetched in terms of technological capabilities and is clearly an extension of today's tech, which makes for many a memorable, visually pleasing shot and dynamic action scene. It looks and sounds amazing, yet always serves both the story and this world's credibility.<br/><br/>Still, despite its superior look, solid action and fascinating plot, Elysium as a film is not as perfect and beautiful as the space station that shares its name. The climax is rather a forced one, much more cheerful than expected and warranted, wherein common criminals inexplicably prove to be revolutionaries. Foster's conspiracy plot line ends up underexposed and essentially unused in the last act, while her character remains underdeveloped to be adequately menacing and understandable. Both Foster and Copley are guilty of overacting, the latter going a little bit off the deep end in his portrayal of a bad guy that apparently does not have a shred of recognizable humanity or redeeming qualities at all (though he does know his South-African lullabies). Similarly, Damon proves a flawed casting choice: true, Damon can act, but he's much too big a movie star to convincingly play an everyday down-on-his-luck factory labourer with a checkered past. A less known actor would have been preferable, since all we can see now is Matt Damon looking goofy with a heavy assortment of tattoos and all kinds of mechanical gizmos strapped to his body. Despite these few shortcomings, Elysium is science fiction filmmaking according to the finest traditions of the genre: socially engaged, thematically rooted in the actuality of the day, intricate and intriguing but grounded where reality is concerned in terms of its futurist design, and simply never dull. Delivering a worthy successor to District 9, Blomkamp is sure to become one of the greats in contemporary science fiction cinema, deservedly so."

","This film was terrible. There were a million things wrong with it. Aside from the immense logical flaws that it had there also wasn't any sympathy created for any of the characters. A few people I know who watched it confirmed it, we didn't care who lived or died or what happened to them. The film had much potential but unfortunately it was butchered by the bad writing of Blomkamp and furthered grinded by the direction of also Blomkamp. I mean, what was up with those accents? I was attentive the whole way through and only understood like 40% of some people's dialogue. It's a shame, the film had great potential but it did not meet my expectations. I highly recommend people spend their money and time elsewhere."
"Jordan-Bank","5","10","20","14 August 2013"," Enjoyable plot, transparent characters
","Going into this movie I thought it would be an interesting tale, and it was. I enjoyed the plot and Neill Blomkamp's vision of the 22nd century was an interesting, appropriately pessimistic take on what consequences our actions will have on future generations. Sharlto Copley is fantastic as the ambitious and insane Agent Kruger. However, where this movie lacks is where Blomkamp's District 9 excelled: Character development of the protagonist. While the development of Wikus van de Merwe of District 9 is a riveting adventure, Max Da Costa's development, or lack thereof, is rather dull. At the start of the movie, Max is primarily concerned with himself and his safety, and it is later established after his industrial accident that he suffers from a severe fear of death. Max's sole mission is getting to Elysium; despite his friend Frey's daughter also needing to get to Elysium, Max only cares about himself. Later, he helps them escape Kruger's men after the airship crashes on Elysium, and suddenly it felt like he was about to develop more into a hero. At the conclusion of the movie where the computer program used to reboot Elysium is extracted from Max's head and he dies, he does not accept his fate but goes through with it anyway. Frey and Matilda are not on his mine; The fact that he will die is all he is thinking about during the entire process. While that is believable, it is not interesting as Max has basically remained the same person throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>While the plot is interesting, the characters, particularly Max are unoriginal and hollow.<br/><br/>The other thing I must cover is the narrow vision of Earth during the movie. The entirety of Earth is depicted as essentially Los Angeles, which just does not seem like it would ever happen.<br/><br/>Overall, the most fun I had in this movie was watching Copley as Kruger. Kruger was far more interesting than Secretary Delacourt, who was played up to be the main antagonist in much of the promotional material. But, a movie should be more than a ruthless villain; The hero needs to be interested too. While District 9 had Wikus van de Merwe, also played by Copley, Elysium has Max Da Costa. Wikus clearly wins the battle here."

","This is so far the culmination of a disappointing movie summer. The plot is so simple, it could fit into a three-panel comic. Fair deal for an action movie, but since the director stated in interviews he wanted to draw some attention to social and ecological problems this has to be said. It's simplicity maybe even leads to wrong and maybe dangerous deductions for the real world - as I realized when talking to friends after the movies. Apart from that the characters are incredibly flat. The inhabitants of Elysium differ by.. speaking french instead of Spanish as a second tongue besides English? Come on. OK, I forgot they're more healthy. As for the action movie, it pretends to be full of action by overly excessive (yes, that's a tautology) use of shaky cam - and granted, action is plenty, but unfortunately I can't see it because of the shaky cam blurring everything. Last but not least it lacks even in pseudo-realism.<br/><br/>That being said - the acting is not that bad. And it's probably better than a Halo movie."

"Amthermandes","9","22","53","9 August 2013"," What every Sci-Fi Action flick needs to be like!
","Elysium is an energetic science fiction action thriller featuring Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley. Neil Blomkamp certainly aims to please, especially fans of District 9, as both the movies share many similar elements. <br/><br/>A crock-pot full action and violence, and spiced with a few humorous moments, we follow our hero as he struggles to live within the future L.A. slums that are packed to the brim with the poor and unfortunate. You can almost hear the monotone chant; ""bring out your dead"" over and over again. Meanwhile, up in the confines of space, the rich and fortunate live in utter bliss on the rotating space station, Elysium, free from the disarray of Earth life. The story rages on, heavy with themes of justice and equality for all, as our hero stumbles upon something that could change the course of history, and bring the two worlds back together again, and save those who really need it. <br/><br/>Matt Damon's character is believable enough, with Jodie Foster coming in as a ruthless commander and politician of Elysium. Both do a good job, but the real winner here is Sharlto Copley, who emerges as a completely new type of character than that in District 9, one who is eccentric, dangerous, and malicious. Along with a fun array of new weapons, robots, and fun ways to be blown up, Sharlto Copley adds that special touch of uniqueness that elevates the level of fun. <br/><br/>It would be unfair to also give praise to the special effects of the film, which looks marvelous on a big screen. The cinematography is well done, adding a few new filming methods, and improving on old techniques to help elevate the feel of the movie. <br/><br/>One could question the racial undertones that define the living standards of each way of life, and one could also nit-pick the realism of this future world, and Wolverine-ish superpowers of Matt Damon. However, the movie does share a moral of what a beautiful planet Earth truly is, and gives us a good lesson in gratitude. While it panders to the action and sci-fi junkie, it also allows room for just about anybody to envelope its positive themes and appreciate the courage and strength of the characters. However, it's main purpose, is to entertain, and blow you away. And this movie does just that."
"crusca2382","3","11","23","24 August 2013"," Somebody please rescue Hollywood sci-fi
","OK, first there are all the clichés. The frenetic last-second run for salvation (to keep viewers busy). The little girl who also is terminally ill (inspires compassion). French-speaking Cruella who would do anything to protect her freedom (she is clearly the daughter of Christine Lagarde). The inconclusive president who only minds popularity (fill in the name here ). The hero who conveniently dies at last (so they do not say Hollywood ends everything in joy). And the poor Latina who evolves from dust to surgical room (Evo Morales rejoices). <br/><br/>Then there is some moderate quality, like Sharlto Copley playing the psycho villain and, of course, the visual stuff, which is fantastic, awesome, etc. <br/><br/>After that, comes the rubbish. Robots who can do everything and even detect sarcasm, but still need to be produced by humans in pre- industrial revolution plants. Outlaw chief who understands in about fifteen seconds the entire protocol to run Elysium, can change it in less time (while under fire), and save billions of lives. Faces that fly off the skull, but leave brains perfectly working. And, finally, the salvation of the overpopulated and polluted world via medical shuttles. One wonders, if deliverance was so easy, couldn't Elysium mollified president send all of his super ambulances before, and fetch even more popularity on the earth?<br/><br/>Well, this movie is the demonstration that Hollywood budget plus the talent of the director who made District 9 can end up in the production of a story that could at best fit the needs of a TV episode of Star Trek. With Prometheus and Oblivion it makes the perfect case for a rescue mission of the UN in Los Angeles."
"TheAlexMay","10","11","23","11 August 2013"," Elysium - Great Movie! Watch movies for the story, not the message!
","Everyone is up in arms about the supposed message behind Elysium, when let's face it, were the circumstances in our real world the same as in Elysium, that is EXACTLY how it would be.<br/><br/>For those who have not seen it, the basic premise is that the rich and privileged live on Elysium (a space station with an artificial environment) while the poor are left on an overpopulated Earth that is ruined and decrepit. On Elysium they have medical technology that is not located on Earth and inaccessible to the citizens of Earth. Max (Matt Damon) gets radiation poisoning and the only way for him to not die is to get help on Elysium. So, he does everything humanly (and sometimes not humanly) possible to get there and get fixed. **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT: If you don't want the ending to be spoiled, skip to the next paragraph.** Through a hijack, he ends up with a file in his head that will reset Elysium and allow anyone to change what they want. Jodie Foster's character needs the file to make herself President, but removing the file would kill Max. In the end, Max sacrifices himself and initiates the reboot so that his associate Spider can make everyone on Earth a citizen.<br/><br/>What has everyone outraged and hate-filled in regards to this movie, in my opinion, that it's calling attention to everything they close their eyes to and pretend does not exist. Earth IS becoming overpopulated. The rich DO have access to medical technology that the poor do not, simply because they can afford it. Were Earth to become the wasteland that it is in Elysium, the rich would undoubtedly evacuate.<br/><br/>I, myself, am a conservative. I avoid all news stations because each has it's own slant whether is one way or the other, none are fair and balanced, but in most of my views, I lean to the right. Despite that, I LOVED this movie. Why? Because I watched it for the story. So what if it has a message that you don't agree with? (I don't necessarily agree with the message, but I see the points of it) It is still a good movie, with a good story and good acting. Not to mention: superb directing on Neill Blomkamp's behalf.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing, my new favorite, and I highly recommend that you go see it without a mind tainted by misguided preconceived notions obtained from Fox News, MSNBC, or any other news syndicate.<br/><br/>10/10"
"andrew-h-shafer","2","14","31","12 August 2013"," Another Big-Budget Faliure
","One of the most hyped movies of the summer, I personally was looking forward to this movie being a big fan of District 9, however we see first hand in Elysium how big studios can ruin great ideas.<br/><br/>First of all, the world that they try to introduce to you is sloppy and full of plot holes, that I guess they just assume the viewers will ignore. This, combined with cliché after cliché just gets old really fast. ""The orphan who was meant for something more"", ""The man with only 5 days to live"" , ""The mother just trying to help her sick daughter"", for being an original story, very little was original at all.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's performance was OK at best. The movie felt like it was trying to EPIC at every turn. Damon really wasn't given too many lines to add much depth to his character --- Think: classic hero.<br/><br/>Foster's performance was by far the worst of the movie though. She plays a power hungry defense secretary. We get no back story with her, and her whole plot line seems rushed.<br/><br/>As far as positive's go, the cinematography was decent (although not as good as District 9). They did push the boundaries with some interesting camera movements during fight scenes, even that felt like an afterthought though, instead of being a living part of the movie. The robots were again smartly portrayed.<br/><br/>All in All I would put this up there with the John Carter's, and Lone Ranger's of the world. Still baffled how studios let this kind of stuff hit the market. Everyone is too concerned with nailing target audiences instead of making truly great cinema."
"WheelzFourReelz","9","7","13","2 March 2014"," This is one of the smartest sci-fi movies I've seen in a while,
","This is my first review on an R rated movie so far. Yeah! This is on Elysium. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was really cool looking. It showed an interesting premise and some shots of sweet action. I saw the movie a few days ago, hoping that it would be good. Was I right? Read the review. I ain't telling. If you don't know the premise of Elysium, it's about Earth far into the future. It's polluted, it's dirty, it's disease ridden, and all the poor people live there (It might sound mean, but it's true). All of the rich people live in Elysium, a floating fortress in the sky, which is a lot like the halo from Halo or the Citadel from Mass Effect (call it what you will). Up there, there's no disease, there's no death, there's just life and happiness. One of the reasons this is is because of these medbeds. If you lay on it, it will cure any disease or injury you've gotten. That's cool. That's pretty much what the entire plot is, it's cool. And it's really, really good. I like it because not only does it have cool sci-fi plot elements, but it has a message. It basically tells you ""stop doing crappy things because in the future, life will be crappy"". It's good. The acting is top notch. Matt Damon does a great job in his role, you can really see him just invested in his character. I like actors like that. Jodie Foster plays the leader of Elysium and she's really good, but she isn't the main villain, like the trailers make it out to be. The main villain is a guy named Krueger played by Sharlto Copley, who for me stole the show. He was so good! You know when they do a good job when you hate the villain not from being annoying, but from being evil. Good job Sharlto. The action is so cool! It's very intense and very cool to watch. It's a movie where you feel every blow emotionally. That is a definite plus. The gore may be a little over the top, but it's still cool. The scene I'll remember the most was one of the characters getting his face blown off by a grenade. Not like the skin or anything, no. A chunk of face flew out of the front of his skull. And it was awesome. The cinematography is the best I've seen since Moonrise Kingdom, but it's very different. It definitely feels post-apocalyptic in the filming. It's shaky and movey (is that even a word?), but it doesn't distract you or get you nauseous. Overall, this movie is great. It's got an awesome plot, superb acting, sweet action, and stellar cinematography. My only gripe is that it's about twenty to thirty minutes too long, but that isn't a lot. Don't go into this movie thinking it's going to be fun, because it's not. It's well made and very interesting."
"docryanov","8","7","13","24 August 2013"," The Sci-Fi gamer's guide to Elysium
","First and foremost, lets point out the obvious things. As others have said, yes, this movie is a tad predictable and the plot is a rather simple premise. However, I assert that these two attributes work in favor of this film.<br/><br/>As sci-fi gamers, we're all well familiar with simple predictable plots, but who is to say that these plots diminish the quality of the title? We all cried in uproar for a simpler more predictable conclusion to the end of Mass Effect 3, but instead Bioware left us with some weird trying to be poetic style bulldick.<br/><br/>In Elysium, this is not the case. You will dig this movie for the following reasons as a sci-fi nerd: 1) It has rich white people dying: Come on. This is a no brainer if you've seen the trailers. We all know rich white people who pay no nevermind to those less fortunate souls of Earth will get dead. Oh and do they die horribly wonderful deaths. It's so great, because we all know people like this actually exist and its always entertaining watching them get what they deserve. Too bad it doesn't happen in real life enough.<br/><br/>2) It has futuristic weaponry: For some reason, Blomkamp seems to have an obsession with bad ass personal firearms that just utterly destroy stuff. I may add that these weapons are present in abundance in Elysium.<br/><br/>3) Gibs, gibs, glorious gibs everywhere: We all love that moment when you first explode a Vorcha in the Omega underground of Mass Effect 2 or step on the head of a necromorph in Dead Space. Trust me, if District 9 was any indication, Elysium is the perfection of the glorious body parts flying everywhere phenomena.<br/><br/>4) The portrayal of the future is not far-fetched: All of us sci-fi nerds love to be able to immerse ourselves in a science fiction world, but when it can relate to the very fabric of our existence, this makes it even better. Elysium does this really well. The fact that such a setting is even conceivable and a definite possibility in the future for our civilization is something that is generally well known in the modern times, but this is the first time we've seen it like this on the silver screen.<br/><br/>5) There's bad ass tech that make you wonder about the possibilities: All of the technologies in the film are at least theoretically plausible. This goes hand in hand with #4, but it's nevertheless true. The only really far fetched device is *spoiler* a machine that heals all ailments, but it is at the center of the film. Even then, it's not incredibly far fetched that in over 100 years we will have technology that can do such things at quantum level as it is portrayed to do in the film (it even says ""re-atomizing"", a nice touch I think).<br/><br/>6) The rich assholes get dead: I know mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. This is the best part and most simple part of the movie. It is what makes it awesome, and let me tell you, they die and no fvcks are given.<br/><br/>In fact, it's not at all surprising that most of the people complaining about this film say that the settings/themes are tiresome and liberal in nature. It's then also unsurprising that most of the complaints come from conservatives sitting on a seatless bicycle stand. People need to have deep complexity and themes in their movies these days, but when a movie about rattling the cages of the established high class society comes out, you best watch your back, because they'll come out swinging. They come out swinging with things like ""It's for college kids who think they're smart"", ""it's for people who just want government handouts!"", ""It's so simple and predictable, the bad guys lose and the commies win!"".<br/><br/>Yup. It's simple. The bad guys lose. The rich people lose. You also don't hate them because they're simply rich, it's what they're doing with their power and their money that makes you resent them, and allows you to enjoy watching them die horrible sci-fi deaths.<br/><br/>If you can deal with that, and appreciate these things, go see the film. You will not be disappointed."

","Neill Blomkamp made a massive impression with his $30 Million debut District 9, a smartly written sci-fi film with great special effects that supplied both blockbuster thrills and social commentary. His follow-up film was also going to be a highly anticipated film, but also runs the risk of suffering second album syndrome.<br/><br/>By the end of the 21st Century Earth is overpopulated and polluted. The rich and the elite leave Earth to live on Elysium, a huge space station that could be seen from Earth. By 2154 Earth is a poverty stricken, diseased world that has suffers from crime and health problems and an oppressive robotic police force whilst Elysium is a calm paradise where they have healing pods that can cure anything from broken bones to cancer. Many people on Earth try to break into Elysium despite it being pretty much a suicide mission.<br/><br/>On Earth is Max De Costa (Matt Damon), a convicted criminal who tries to live a clean life and works as a factory worker, despite being targeted by the police. But after a work accident he gets a lethal dose of radiation and only has five days to live. Max's only hope is going to Elysium, but to do that he needs to steal the thoughts of a billionaire (William Fincher). What Max ends up with something that could change the world and makes him a target for Elysium's Defence Secretary, Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her personal covert agent, Kruger (Sharlto Copley).<br/><br/>Some of the critical and audience reaction to Elysium has been mixed and lukewarm with people disappointed with Blomkamp's work. But Elysium is still an entertaining sci-fi film with substance. Blomkamp uses some simple story ideas, such as Max only having a few days to live, so has to go on one last mission and Max having a McGuffin that everyone wants. Blomkamp does this so he can fresh out his world and themes. Earth does look like a hole of despair of urban decay and crime and the planet does seem to not have advance very much.<br/><br/>Elysium is very clear and open about its themes and ideas; this is a film that very critical of access to healthcare in America, particularly how the poor had inadequate healthcare compared to the rich and elite who can have anything they want. There are rampant poverty which the elite ignores, looks at gated communities, immigration, particularly of Latin Americans going to the United States and xenophobia of the elite and classism. Elysium's wears its leftist politics on the sleeve as we see the world split into the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as companies aim to maximum their profits regardless of the workers. There are also smaller themes but no less important like the how workers, particularly immigrant workers are expendable. The film is at its most subtle when robots are in bureaucratic positions like Max's speaking to his parole officer, complimented with Damon's sarcastic interaction. Elysium is very much a film about the lower classes taking back what is theirs which should appeal to revolutionary Marxists.<br/><br/>Blomkamp is known for coming from a special effects background and like District 9 the CGI and models were excellent. Blomkamp is able to supply action and spectacle with his world building. Blomkamp does go for a little too much shaky-cam at times, yet the hand-held camera work did give Elysium a pseudo-documentary feel and adds a scene of authenticity to the film, making it look more real and add to Blomkamp's photo- realistic style.<br/><br/>Like District 9 the action is strong and very well directed. Whilst shaky-cam is used Blomkamp also uses a lot of slow-mo to great effect. We get gun battles, fist and knife fights with men in exo-skeletons and District 9 style weapons leading to exploding bodies. Elysium is how I like my R-rated sci-fi action, very bloody and violence: we even get a man getting a grenade to the face.<br/><br/>Some of the art direction was very similar to Looper, with old cars and guns being modified and people on Earth having to do in a rag tag world. There are also some elements of Total Recall, In Time and Escape from New York.<br/><br/>Copley was fantastic as Kruger, a raging psychopath with menace and dark humour to his role. It was a shame that he wasn't the main villain as he injected energy into his role. He should be considered to play the next Bond villain. It is a shame that Foster as the main villain was lacklustre, being a politician with xenophobic views who had a cold persona and a strange accent. She should have been written out and Kruger been made as the main villain.<br/><br/>Elysium does use a similar storyline and plot points to District 9, both the main characters end up being inflected with something that will kill or change them and both character end up having something that an organisation really want. As mention is very heavy handed with its political commentary and one be that was so transparent was Fincher's character, a billionaire tycoon who puts his workers to the limited and does not care what happens to them. It could have been handled better such as the billionaire trying to squeeze out very bit of profit they can and do things like ignoring safety regulations or concerns.<br/><br/>On a final note composer Ryan Amon was clearly influenced by Hans Zimmer as his used a lot of horns, strings and choir music used during the film.<br/><br/>Elysium is not as strong as District 9 but it is still a very worthy film that is entertaining and thematic. Even if you do not agree with the politics of Elysium it holds up as an R-rated sci-fi and more should be made."

","This movie completely caught me by surprise! I watched it cause I got free tickets and I'm so happy I did. I was expecting some Transformers sort of robot action movie with little to almost any kind of story line. The plot was very impressive and the action was great. It was very adult-like and had a lot of scenes that I'm glad they didn't sensor. It made the movie seem very realistic even if it's completely fictional and really made me cheer for the characters, both the good guy and the bad guy. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good action movie and a good story and doesn't really mind blood. Blew me away completely!"
"EllaMentree","4","12","26","8 August 2013"," Below average on all accounts
","Elysium is such a massively underwhelming movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes are just way below the bar that's already been set by action movies of 2013 and 2012. What action there is is ruined by a shaky camera and blatantly poor choreographing. It tries to make up for this by being a ""LOOK AT ALL THIS COOL FUTURE STUFF"" movie with robots, magic healing stations, ""futuristic"" weaponry, and the tired dystopian theme.<br/><br/>As a science fiction movie it's just awful. There's a plot hole every 15 minutes, issues that are never addressed, and terrible writing altogether. The science part is never in any way explained — this would be better billed as a science fantasy film. It makes absolutely no effort to be anything other than another cheesy ""sci-fi"" film to throw in the bin along with After Earth It takes after District 9 in that it's trying to be a social commentary but falls flat on its face so hard it's almost amusing.<br/><br/>The ""message"" of the film is like any other film being released lately: being socially privileged is wrong. It's yet another film that sets out to make you feel shameful for living in a first world country for no other reason than the fact that it seems to sell really well lately.<br/><br/>Honestly, I give it a 4/10 meaning it wasn't quite painful to watch, but it was pretty difficult to enjoy. The humor (at least I HOPE it was intended as humor) kept me from outright leaving the theatre and that's really all it has going for it in my opinion.<br/><br/>That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad movie. It just means it's way below average. If you haven't seen much sci-fi and you don't want to think too hard (and in fact staunchly refuse to pick it apart) then it's a fantastic movie for you otherwise, don't bother."

Some technological inventions are ingenious like the chips that are attached to a human brain where the data could be up/downloaded via a USB cable :D It has some great action elements, which are sometimes easily predictable.

There are many who say this is a propaganda film and it sure is for the dumbest in our society who are already democrat voters anyway so this film makes very little difference to the overall political climate. What is very sad is that the people who paid for this garbage to be made are sadly now having to face the fact that they were totally duped by the production people. This film should never have passed the first draft. To associate yourself with this tripe is shameful and it really finally seems like Matt Damon is a total egg head brainless fool. He may be making the bucks but his socialist and liberal utterances whilst sending his kids to private schools etc is just a typical example of Hollywood liberal hypocrisy. I know that there will be many who think this is a great flick but that is normal for a society whose general level of education is below many third world nations.

Only difference this time is he's playing himself as if he's not feeling well.<br/><br/>2. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the first 45 minutes.<br/><br/>3.

The cast probably knew this as well, considering how most of them simply went through the motions. I would totally avoid this, unless you're a sci-fi geek in which case wait for it on DVD. Its been a long time since we can find a good sci-fi movie worth watching, and unfortunately the wait will go on.

"wtfboomheadshot1337","5","7","14","13 August 2013"," Even Avatar had a better point and i thought that was pointless
","Really there is so very much wrong with this film i'm not sure where to begin. First off it rips off Halo's theme obviously with its ring like space station. Many will say the main controversy of the film was its ideas about immigration and health care reform. I personally do not believe that the immigration was one of its main point at all, but i know many will disagree with that. The story is ass not up to District 9 standards. The actors are mainly annoying and unlikable. The action scenes are brief and overly effect ridden. <br/><br/>So whats wrong with the movie? <br/><br/>The unoriginal Haloish settings make me wonder if it was co-produced with Microsoft(if not i hope they sue).<br/><br/>I agree that there is big political aspect's of this film mostly and mainly the healthcare ideas, but there is several logical reasons why the Immigration is not(or at least should not be). At the end of the film they make everyone on earth a citizen of elysium and immediately several EMS ships take off to assist the injured and dying people on Earth. No transport ships were sent just the EMS ships so i doubt everyone is about to pile in and get a ride to it from them but that is debatable. Lets consider what Elysium is or was. A place free from pollution, crime(except the Military leaders agenda), poverty, overcrowding and sickness. What will become of it not that there is no restrictions? Its a small space station.. could it hold all of earths inhabitants? No. Does it have enough resources to support everyone? No and i bet the anti-cancer beds will run out of juice soon enough. My point is not everyone should go there because these obvious limitations and to say its just because of immigration is just an illogical reason.<br/><br/>Was the main Hero really a hero? He always dreamed of going to elysium, but not until he was on his deathbed did he attempt to make it a reality. He's even asked after obtaining crucial data that could help all of mankind to stay to utilize it(which would kill him), but instead decides that his life is more important and within 10-20 mins is on a ship heading there. And until the ending does not show much compassion for anyone but himself(and he dooms elysium). <br/><br/>The action scene's are good somewhat but the shacking camera effects started to give me a headache by the end(STOP DOING THAT ITS NOT COOL).<br/><br/>Lastly the changes they made to elysium could have been easily reversed(but we got a happy ending..i guess). <br/><br/>The movie is worth seeing but the points it is attempting to make is laughable."
"rwstone-671-8884","5","7","14","12 August 2013"," Simplistic Allegory
","While a entertaining movie the movie is clearly a allegory for the for U.S. and Mexico. The people left on Earth spoke Spanish (even Matt Damon)and wanted to ""cross the border"" so they could get better health care and a better life in the rich and non-Spanish speaking Elysium world. Jodie Foster plays the politician wanting to keep the illegals out at all costs. Our politicians complain all the time about Mexicans coming to the U.S to get free health care and education for their children and of course want to keep them from that and even send them back to Mexico. Jodie Foster did this movie and played the one dimensional character because she wanted to send this message. The majority of the people that like this movie would not really consider giving free health care to immigrants or suddenly allow illegal immigrants to become citizens so they can have the benefits of U.S. It is an interesting movie in that the director pushes this theme very strongly and gives it to us in the form of an action movie. The movie falls apart at the end by giving us a fairy tale ending where some hospital ships come down to heal the millions or billions of people living on Earth. The allegory again is that the U.S. spends billions on war and billions on border patrols and not for sending hospital ships to countries that could use some free health care and education."
"rhetoricallycorrect-764-513292","1","11","25","14 August 2013"," Worst movie since The Wolfman with Benicio Del Toro
","I strongly advise against seeing the movie Elysium. I haven't seen something that bad since ""The Wolfman"" with Benicio Del Toro in 2010. Shame on Jodie Foster for acting so poorly and having a totally laughable accent. Matt Damon needs to assess what scripts he will support. Elysium enters the Top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>None of the characters are believable. Remember, people, a movie starts and finishes on the story and the pathos the audience has for the characters. The storyline is a flawed patchwork of logic-free nonsense, especially toward the end of the film. The weaknesses just keep adding up on this monstrosity of sophomore filmmaking. What a waste of great technical effects! If this is state of the art sci-fi, I would rather watch The Valley of Gwangi. At least with that movie I get to laugh at the campiness. <br/><br/>There is no chemistry between Damon and his love interest whatsoever. The acting ranges from grossly overacted, like when we first meet Spider, Diego Luna's character, to catatonic drudgery, most of the shots of Jodie Foster.<br/><br/>And, by the way, when you blow off 2/3 of a guy's face and expect me to believe that his brain function is ""normal"" after being in that condition for about 10 minutes, then you are completely insane. That is not left to ""suspended disbelief"", but ranks amongst the script idiocies like how a shark can outrun a jet, like in Jaws IV (or V, can't remember). Neil Blomkamp should be run out of Hollywood on a rail. This is the second attempt at a movie he has made, and while District 9 may have been watchable, it was excessively boring for a sci- fi. This travesty called Elysium is totally without merit. <br/><br/>I'm sure the checks all cleared the bank, but Damon and Foster should not sleep well at night after this fiasco. Their careers should be in question now that they have decided that this is the kind of trite that they are okay starring in. This is 109 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Damon's character had 5 days. Too bad. He should have had 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Interesting to note that Diego Luna entered the movie without reading the script. I wonder if Damon read it? Is this the type of movie that the guy who wrote and starred in Good Will Hunting is up to now? Sad."
"beautifuldesperation","10","5","9","9 September 2013"," A quick note
","I personally just wanted to say this was the best film I've ever watched and whilst I usually just rate film's, I felt I needed to just add this comment as well to prompt you into watching Elysium. You defiantly should. The plot I loved and the ending was quite powerful, how easy it was for everyone on earth to be healed, yet they wouldn't do it. I thought the whole story line was brilliant, I love film's where the world has gone to ruin's, just too see the different way's people create as to why and I think this was one of the best and in someway's; to a certain extent the most realistic for a future, the rich and the poor being separated. I don't really like Matt Damon but I looked past it as he did excellent in this film, although it did go a little bit too action/thriller for my taste in the middle, it still remain's one of my favorite film's and I would recommend a watch, I hope you like it as much as I do."
"jsmith01","6","5","9","9 September 2013"," Entertaining, but some Major Issues
","First off, all the talk about how Elysium promotes socialism is silly. This is what the world is really like - the wealthy hoarding everything (for context see the You Tube Wealth Inequality in America video) while most people don't even know how worse off they are. Obviously the movie shows a more extreme situation than most of us in the developed world live in, but it's not TOO far off the mark.<br/><br/>In general I found this movie to be pretty entertaining - I like the sci-fi effects and Matt Damon always delivers great acting. And while Sharlto Copley's character was just despicable, I love the actor after having watched District 9.<br/><br/>A few things stood out about this movie that rubbed me the wrong way:<br/><br/>1) Jodie Foster's accent & dialog was ridiculously irritating. I normally like her and don't understand what happened to her in this movie - she tried to maintain this snobby voice which was simply annoying. And she kept repeating certain lines e.g. ""I want Homeland Defense to apprehend everyone on that ship!"" <br/><br/>2) While the movie tried to show diversity in general across cultures (more so than most), it followed the usual Hollywood cliché - the HERO is a WHITE MAN, Matt Damon. Just about every character in the movie was Hispanic or one of color....except the main one, Matt Damon. Who of course goes on to save the whole world. Because only white guys every do that in Hollywood. Not those of color, and not women.<br/><br/>3) The ending. (SPOILER ALERT - DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING) Haven't we seen this SAME ENDING a gazillion times in movies lately? The hero sacrifices himself and dies so the viewer is supposed to get all emotional about it. Give me a break. At this point it would be more original for Hollywood to show an actual happy ending where the main characters survive. All I could think about when I saw this particular one was ""didn't I see this already in Blood Diamond????"" In the latter movie, Leo's character (a white male hero of course) dies while talking to his love interest on a cell phone and watching a ""pretty view"". In this one, Damon's character dies while doing the exact same thing. Talk about an overdone scene. ALSO - if Elysium is so advanced that they can make someone whose head was blown off by a grenade come back together - they can't use the same technology to bring Matt Damon to life who didn't have nearly as much damage done to his body? This brain-data-security-hack tool is THAT effective??<br/><br/>4) The long fight scenes made it feel like more of an action movie than anything else. This is just a personal thing, but I don't need to see fight scenes that are this long....this is also overdone in Hollywood.<br/><br/>5) Finally, I think the movie was hinting at wealth inequality messages etc. but didn't really delve into that and instead went for a typical Hollywood mindless action flick approach. I think it could have been deeper, and characters could have been developed more. Even the relationship between Max & Frey seemed to be forced for the sake of having a love plot in the movie.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 6 because it did keep my interest as I watched, but overall the above issues really overshadowed what could have been a much better film."

"khanbaliq2","8","5","9","26 August 2013"," Elysium is an exciting, emotionally involving action-thriller.
","Elysium is the most original science fiction film of this year. Writer/director Neill Blomkamp delivers a gritty and seemingly realistic vision of the future. In the year 2154 the very wealthy live on a luxurious space station called Elysium, and the poor live on an overpopulated, devastated Earth. I didn't find the setting very appealing but there's enough there for an entertaining action-thriller. Matt Damon doesn't play a typical hero. In fact, at times, I didn't feel compassion for him. This, I'm sure, was Damon's and Blomkamp's intention and by the end Max Da Costa goes through big changes. This approach is commendable but I didn't find it very interesting. Still, the ending is a triumph as Max redeems himself in a big way and manages to change the world. As a child Max gazes longingly at the picturesque space station above while dreaming of one day escaping Earth with his best friend Frey (Alice Braga). This impressive image works wonderfully in the emotionally-charged ending that will definitely make viewers think. In this way Elysium is structured similarly to Blomkamp's debut film District 9 (2009). Elysium isn't as big a triumph as District 9 but it comes very close. This time Blomkamp has a more experienced cast to work with. Jodie Foster provides a good performance as the power-hungry, cunning Jessica Delacourt. Sharlto Copley's C.M. Kruger is a rather frightening creation. Another name worth mentioning is Wagner Moura as Spider. Moura's performance turns the determined Spider into more than just a shady employer. At times he's even more sympathetic than Damon. The film's intense action sequences are aided by excellent CGI. Blomkap's talent for showing inventive weaponry and striking visuals is again present in Elysium. Moreover, just as in District 9, there's a good underlying political message. In this sharp disparity between wealthy and poor one man can make a difference. In conclusion, with Elysium Blomkamp delivers another innovative satisfying science fiction film that's well worth seeing. I definitely recommend it."

","Elysium is possibly one of the best science fiction movies of the last two years & is! Th plot is intelligent, has a meaningful message & brilliant if not amazing special effects. Somehow, despite these three factors, people are ranting & raving, negatively, about Elysium. i mean here's a conversation I've had with a lot of people about this movie & they all sound like this: Person: ""Elysium? That movies f***ing sh*t!"" Me: ""Why is it 'f***ing sh*t' Person: ""'Cause it's unrealistic! Earth will never get that bad! It's unrealistic!"" This is what I've heard a lot of people say about Elysium & it make me wanna fly-kick a pinata llama. EARTH IS ALREADY LIKE THAT! EARTH IS ALREADY THAT F**KED UP! ELYSIUM IS JUST AN ENTERTAINING, SCIENCE-FICTION, FUTURISTIC VERSION OF TODAY'S SOCIETY THAT HIGHLIGHTS A FEW MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH OUR SOCIETY! Take Mexico for example, its a slum, the people are poor, they resort to messed up things like burro shows to entertain themselves & have probably never spent a day in their life clean. Then, right next to Mexico, is Texas with its abundance of rich people, mansions & other rich people things. Think of it like this: Texas is Elysium & Mexico is Earth.<br/><br/>Putting the negative things behind, Elysium has some great acting in it. You have Matt Damon who plays the character he's given very well & in a way that really makes you feel for the character. Secondly, Jodie Foster's acting was good, I mean any middle aged actress that was OK with dying her hair white & acting like a bitch could have played her, but that doesn't mean Jodie Foster was bad. Lots of people criticized her accent in this movie but I'm not sure what they were complaining about. She sounded British to me...... <br/><br/>Finally, Sharlto Copley. Holy sh*t. He played possibly the most malignant & psychotic villain I have ever encounter & played the character perfectly. Seriously, no-one else could've played the character. Every scene Sharlto was in, he sol the spotlight. <br/><br/>Overall I give Elysium 9/20 for its brilliant CGI, entertaining story & a message that had me thinking the whole car-trip home for the cinemas plus a few hours. I would've given it a ten but it felt just a bit to short. I wouldn't go s far as to say that Elysium was as good as Neil Blomkamp's previous film District 9, because it's not, but Elysium is definitely up there."

I was solely focused on the screen. <br/><br/>Matt Damon is as reliable as ever; he just does his job every time; whatever the part, he plays it as well as he can. It is in no way his finest performance, but he still acts very well. The rest of the cast follow his lead, well apart from one; Sharlito Copley. Easily the star of the show; it is now clear that Copley and the films director Neill Blomkamp are a force to be reckoned with. With Blomkamp directing him he seems to excel; as he did in District 9 and with the upcoming ""Chappie"" it will be a hat trick for the duo. His role as Kruger is amongst the best I've seen in the last couple of years. Vicious, relentless,ruthless and even funny at times. It is an outstanding performance and the best part of a great film. I would love to see a prequel focused on the life of Kruger; he is that good.<br/><br/>The plot has a solid basis and it accelerates as the film goes on. It projects real life issues, injecting them into a big screen blockbuster and it works well.

So lets get down about the positives:<br/><br/>1. Matt Damon. Great casting choice! You can really tell the guy put a lot into his character, and you felt that he was a real person and that made his character more relatable. You really want to root for this guy in his quest to take down Elysium. <br/><br/>2. The world of 2154. You can tell that Neil Blomkamp has put so much effort into the world of this dystopian future. Nothing is clean and all pretty like a lot of futuristic movies; no Earth is an over-populated waste land, full of people dying and looking up at a world that orbits there's, wishing for a way out. This is a world you can sink into, and a lot of people felt that it was just a huge social message slapping them in the face- (immigration and health care) But the film really doesn't yeah the symbolism is there but its not in your face. Only hard core conservatives are saying that this movie is a huge political porno. <br/><br/>3. Special effects-not one moment in this movie did i think any of the things were CGI. Much like Pacific Rim that came out last month, the special effects are mind blowing. And what's better is the use of practical effects; there is a lot of it in this movie and that boosts the realism of the film even more. The droids, the world of Elysium, all look visually spectacular. <br/><br/>4. Kruger. Okay, I saved the best for last. This is with out a doubt the best part of the film and you will hear this from nearly everybody. Shartlo Copely completely steals the show. In a great movie, he is the greatest; he stands out over his counter parts as the menacing, electrifying, creepy, and crazy Kruger. We don't see a WHOLE lot of kruger, but when we do, its awesome. Shartlo puts so much into his performance, giving us the joker vibe. There is a scene towards the end of this film were I was watching Kruger and legitimately felt he was a futuristic heath ledger joker without make up. He will go down as one of the best villains in history. <br/><br/>I really didn't have any really issues with the movie except one, but its not like it brings down the entire experience.<br/><br/>1. Jodie Foster. The moment I heard she was in this movie and saw her in the trailer, I knew that she was going to play a role that any woman her age could play...and i was not wrong. Even though she is able to get the whole corrupt politician down, her presence doesn't feel as important as Damon's and Copely's. She does a good job, but not great; she's the weakest link in the film for sure but doesn't bring down the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I loved Elysium, and I think there's another reason why people are feeling disappointed-they win expecting District 9. And they should not have done that at all. I went in expecting an entertaining conventional, original sci-fi movie and that's exactly what I got. I didn't go in expecting an original mockumentary/sci-fi thriller. That's like going into a transformers movie expecting a strong, clever story with deep characters and heavy emotion. Change your expectations people. Seriously. <br/><br/>10/10"
"timesinthesun7","1","8","17","31 August 2013"," Just terrible
","This is without doubt the worst film I have seen this year. The worst Matt Damon film ever. What a terrible mish mash of ideas, none of which really gel together, more of a 109 min extended trailer of ideas ripped off from other movies. Looks very much like the director was under intense pressure to deliver something really good and just tried too hard. What on earth is going on with Jodie Fosters sound track? Nearly all of it looks post dubbed, she gives one of the truly awful performances I have seen for a long time. You could almost believe that this movie is a spoof, it is that bad. Will be on peoples most disappointing list I am sure as we have all be looking forward to seeing this and the trailer offered so much. Misses the mark on all levels."
"quinnox-1","5","8","17","11 August 2013"," Damon gives it a good go, but the movie disappoints in many ways
","I had several problems with this movie. The ending went on far too long, leaving a bad after-taste. I also hated how the politics of the current day were injected so blatantly into the movie - I don't go to a supposed science fiction movie to get lectured about political issues (illegals). I want escapism from a sci-fi movie above all. <br/><br/>Damon is the only thing good in the entire film. He gives it a good college try, but he can't save this movie from failure. A very awkward story line about a childhood sweetheart runs throughout, and the love interest is cold as a fish, and there is no chemistry between Damon's character and her. None of the other characters make an impression.<br/><br/>This movie felt really clunky and unsubtle and just awkward is the best way to put it. Recycled robots from other better sci-fi movies didn't help matters. The space station, Elysium, was kind of cool, but that is about it. 5 Stars only because Damon is always an engaging presence to watch, even in a lousy movie like this one."
"pregno1970","Null","8","17","9 August 2013"," Copley should have been the leading character
","Once again Sharlto Copley steals another movie. He brings the kind of energy, intensity and focus that is totally captivating when he is on the screen. He absolutely should have been the main character in this. he would have been far more watchable than Matt Damon, who, quite honestly, is out of his depth with films like this. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster is good as the villainess but should have had more screen time. Alice Braga is...on screen. I think that's all that can be said.<br/><br/>Production design is excellent and the hardware is beautifully designed.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said of the script which is underdeveloped. It feels like a first draft.<br/><br/>Pacing is poor, some parts drag, but there are some impressive action sequences. Shaky camera work reduces their effectiveness at times but still some moments of excitement."
"griffolyon12","6","8","17","9 August 2013"," Far From Fun
","Writer/director Neil Blomkamp's Elysium is much like his prior feature, District 9, a message movie that takes itself too darn seriously and never has much fun.<br/><br/>The title of the film refers to a space station orbiting Earth, called Elysium. In the future, the rich have left Earth to live on Elysium, while the rest live in poverty and squalor on Earth, that's where we find Matt Damon's Max. Max is given only five days to live, but they can miraculously cure him if he can get to Elysium, but of course the ""border patrol"" of Elysium don't want any illegal immigrants on their space station and will fight him at all costs. Sound heavy handed? That's because it is. The thing is, nothing is wrong with a message movie, but when the film is zero fun, that's when I have a problem with it.<br/><br/>The thing with Elysium is that none of the characters are really that likable. There is no real sense of hope, warmth, or just the goodness of humanity. The film's just all doom and gloom while trying to hammer home Blomkamp's personal beliefs. The thing is, this could have been a five times better film had Blomkamp made the characters we're supposed to care about enjoyable to spend time with. Would it have killed for Matt Damon to of cracked a joke once in a while, or behaved in any way truly heroic? Whether anyone wants to admit it or not, this is a $100 million Summer popcorn extravaganza, and I don't wanna feel depressed when I leave a movie where I kind of just wanted entertainment with a little bit of substance, rather than substance with no entertainment.<br/><br/>While Elysium manages to skate by with enough action and dazzling imagery to not be a complete waste of nearly two hours, if you've seen the trailers you have seen the best of what this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>I give Elysium a 6 out of 10!"
"jbrady65","3","6","12","28 August 2013"," Way to go liberal Hollywood

","Elysium started with a decent build up but the film lacks any real substance. Staying awake for me was nearly impossible 45 minutes in. I might have walked out on this one if I hadn't fallen asleep. I missed the climax but have no intention of ever watching it, ever.<br/><br/>!!!!Spoiler alert!!!!Mat Damon couldn't carry this film to save his life (pun intended) and you can learn the entire breakdown of the whole movie by watching the trailer no need to watch the ""extended version"" of it in the theater. There were some good performances in small portions which can be appreciated. The lack of a meaningful coherent story made for a very dull ""epic"" modern Sci-Fi. <br/><br/>Wait for digital release on this one. Not a worthy Sci-Fi epic period!"
"lizziebeth-1","5","6","12","19 August 2013"," A film desperately missing its female collaborator
","It's not even its thematic unoriginality regards Earth's slum-ridden overpopulation and the related notion of gated communities (cf Wall-E(2008), Back to the Future 2(1989)) that is such a disappointment: the biggest problem with Elysium is that it's soulless... Matt Damon and his love interest notwithstanding. <br/><br/>The South African slum redesign of LA is only a little irritating, but the film's ham-fisted and artificial plot device of a desperately sick child is so hackneyed that it doesn't muster any emotion in the audience at all.<br/><br/>Later, the scientific inaccuracies and the glossover depiction of the orbiting habitat will silently irk an informed audience. For instance, there seems no evident cause for, or mechanism by which an atmosphere is maintained on this ""Stanford torus""-space station, which is itself apparently so small that you can see its curvature from a couple of feet off the ground - its scale when viewed from Earth would instead dictate that it be far larger, be visibly spinning, which it apparently isn't, and have a visible dark-to-light stratospheric barrier, which is nowhere in evidence. The people who live there can't just breathe direct space in the sunshine! <br/><br/>Stratospheres have consequences dictated by physics and engineering: they necessitate an- and aerobic engines, and impose different crash results for the ""landing"" shuttlecraft. And there is a second, equally preposterous ""Biddleonian""-Firing-Squad-scene (shooting turrets arranged in a circle), in which the spacecraft's exploding shards neither burn up nor behave ballistically, because they're hitting the non-existent atmosphere.<br/><br/>So Blomkamp's space station fails to measure up to Stanley Kubrick's far more plausible 1968 effort in the classic 2001:A Space Odyssey. Never remind an audience of a classic and then suck by comparison. Elysium's irkingly ignorant ""...Ehm... and then future science happens"" attitude just can't draw audiences in anymore.<br/><br/>The other annoying plot device is the imposition of radiation poisoning on Matt Damon's Max. This choice is so badly jarring (too serious a sickness for so many physical challenges to overcome) that it's just impossible to accept the really dying character fighting baddies at all, let alone getting alternately better then worse, then better, better, better, then worse, and better again, whenever the plot required.<br/><br/>Clearly this wasn't just a problem of shooting scenes out of sequence. Max's implausible bouts of robust/ill-health and back again is just careening overcontrol by the plot, which needed him to frequently forget that he was mortally ill - all while undergoing the physical assault of that horrid, unhygienic, and implausible exoskeleton.<br/><br/>Worse, the two neglectful human perpetrators of Max's irradiation, the mercs-for-hire, as well as the pointlessly ruthless robotic ""policemen"", were all so poorly drawn (caricatured) that they degraded the film's tone during their scenes to that of a graphic novel . Yes, the very same graphic novel that Blomkamp used to pitch his story to the movie stars who signed on board. Unfortunately there is little human feeling in the story to uplift it all afterward. <br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's first feature film, District 9(2009), had been full of organic and unforced pathos four years ago, emotionally recalling and paying silent homage to the far more earnest Enemy Mine(1986)). District eked out surprising amounts of empathy from its audience and totally captured our hearts. Blomkamp's second film simply does nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>So Elysium is commonly experienced as soulless.<br/><br/>Interestingly, perennial recent bad guy William Fichtner now seems to specialize in roles that are soon-to-be-""red- shirted"" (Star Trek parlance), as he again undertakes here.<br/><br/>The third act's last-ditch effort to make Sharlto Copley's ruthless mercenary Kruger suddenly develop a psychic break (the plot just lost its mind here, too) just to turn him into a crazed Terminator type in fact totally loses the film any of its elevated themes. Themes such as its internalised debate about aggressive border protectionism. If anything, that should have been the thrust of this sci-fi plot, but it's lost in this morass of careening, hackneyed, and embarrassingly ignorant cartoonish set of action pieces.<br/><br/>There was utterly no reason or rhyme for Copley's Kruger to go ""Terminator"", so again, Elysium is reminding its audience of a classic, then sucking by comparison. If you introduce a sudden gross plot change without on screen explanation with character linkages, it will be necessarily perceived as careening. Rarely are a big budget feature's ostensibly shrouded graphic novel origins so embarrassingly on show.<br/><br/>In the end it's just glaringly obvious that Blomkamp's past collaborator, screenwriter Terri Tatchell, had too little input into his follow-up film (she only gets a Thank You credit), because this grinding screenplay eventually wears back down into a graphic novel without her: code for ""boys only"". Dear Terri, please come back....(5/10)"
"bcansevgisi","3","6","12","18 August 2013"," Terriblium
","Before I begin criticizing this title harshly, let's take a trip to the 1870's (about 150 years in the past from now)In 1870's, the telephone (its most basic form) and the first camera were invented. Invention of the light bulb happened in this time period as well. Jules Verne published ""Around the world in 80 days"" so we can say that hot-air balloons were becoming popular for air travel as planes did not exist. If we compare the 1870's to our time, we can clearly that technology evolved greatly. Now, let's go forward in time to the year 2154 AD. How would you expect the world to be? Taking into consideration the previous 150 years (from 1870's to 2013),you'll probably expect scientific breakthroughs, settlements on other galaxies, drastic changes in people's lifestyles (and clothing), right? Well, according to Elysium's world, nothing will change except that tanning beds will be transformed and become med-beds to heal rich people of all kinds of sickness. It's a pity that these beds weren't modified to treat disappointment as well. This would have been great after watching films like this. Apart from tanning beds, bicycle handlebars will also find another use in the future, as exoskeleton parts! The world of 2154 shouldn't have been pictured like this. Now, let's take a sneak peek into the characters: Errr...,well, there aren't any!I mean, there are people acting in the film but they can't be considered as characters. The definition of character is ""the mental, ethical and moral qualities of a person"" In conclusion, I think this film was a bad mixture of ""Total Recall (original version) and ""Johnny Mnemonic"". Unfortunately, the mixture didn't work."
"stephenlovelette","10","4","7","29 June 2014"," The best motion picture released in 2013.
","I've put this off because I don't want to oversell it.<br/><br/>But Elysium is the best motion picture released in 2013.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp, this is his follow-up to District 9, which was nominated for best picture back in 2009.<br/><br/>I hesitate to use the word ""perfect"" to describe movies, so I'll say that Elysium is 'seamless' instead.<br/><br/>You can watch films in one of two modes: Regarding it much like a critic, or a willing member of the audience. I always try to consider both sides of the equation, but I lean more towards the audience. I'm slightly more forgiving of stretch marks and minor chinks in the armor.<br/><br/>That being said, I couldn't find any in Elysium. It's seamless. You might be able to come up with something, but it'd be a far-reaching criticism.<br/><br/>The narrative unfolds at a swift pace with high stakes and an intelligent undercurrent running beneath. The CGI is excellent and the futuristic technology is realistically depicted.<br/><br/>All of the characters; their motivations, conflicts, societal positioning, relative levels of power, etc. are so well thought out and polished. It's a vast group of players in this narrative; each with a complex and justifiable problem.<br/><br/>So enough general talk about Elysium - if you haven't seen it, stop reading. I'm going to spoil some things now.<br/><br/>It's almost a story where 'right' and 'wrong' have zero effect on the end result, and yet, goodness triumphs in the most satisfactory way.<br/><br/>If you really think about the tension underlying the different scenes, you'll notice the conditions are truly horrific.<br/><br/>The interaction between Damon and his robotic parole officer is one of many brilliantly dark moments. The aggravation is palpable when he tries to explain himself, and the robot interrupts with, ""Stop talking. Stop talking. Stop talking.""<br/><br/>In a way, it's a beautiful and chilling scene. The higher class of humanity has become so far removed from the judicial system of the lower classes that all tasks have been delegated to inhuman mechanisms. The parole officer illustrates the inefficacy of robotics streamlining interpersonal relations, especially when moral judgment becomes a factor. A misstep, momentary foolishness or poor decision can't be allowed in a realm governed by pure efficiency.<br/><br/>This theme of intertwining humanity and robotics is touched on heavily throughout. It's explored in several intriguing ways, including the mechanical parts Matt Damon integrates into his biological makeup.<br/><br/>The cocky, loose-tongued and rabble-rousing protagonist has been done so many times, yet Damon performs the role excellently. Even while interacting with a gun-toting CGI robot!<br/><br/>That man sure is talented. When he gets mouthy with the guard in queue, it's the type of exchange that is so easily criticized as a cliché but he makes it work, creating a truly disturbing scene.<br/><br/>I don't like Jodie Foster as a person, but her character in this movie is spectacular, and she deserves serious praise for her performance. Her role might be the most compelling character in the story. When she dies it feels like the moral synapses in my brain are twisted. I want to keep talking about her character, but I must move on.<br/><br/>If you've seen/read enough stories in your life, much like a critic, it's easy to notice commonly recycled narrative elements. Such as 'the parable.' It's tough to write one into a story without it feeling abrasive to the critical eye.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's playful use of a parable is, for me, the crowning moment in Elysium.<br/><br/>Three months after seeing the film, I was explaining to my mom why it's such a great scene where Damon interrupts the girl's story about the hippopotamus and the meerkat. We were in the kitchen and I think she was chopping onions, because I had to leave the room without finishing my explanation. I got so choked up I couldn't get the words out.<br/><br/>If you buy in, it's a profoundly moving moment.<br/><br/>Sure the ending's been done before. I bet there are critics who've compared his work to that of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John's. But that's silly, and I truly admire Blomkamp's decision to write it the way he did.<br/><br/>All in all, Elysium's a great film that hasn't received the credit it deserves.<br/><br/>Despite its lack of praise, I hope it won't be lost in the buzz of award season, and eagerly await Blomkamp's next project."

","This movie is ultimately about the other half. The holy grail they are looking for is an instant medical cure which serves as a good metaphor for a lot of other things. At any rate, we can all appreciate what happens when one's health goes bad.<br/><br/>It is a pleasure to see Diego Luna on the screen again. He is a charming actor, who unfortunately has a bit part in this reel, but at least his part is well-played. Copley plays his part to the hilt and Jodie Foster is no slouch either. Her French is quite convincing.<br/><br/>I have observed some of the complaints about plot errors but they are poorly founded. It is highly likely that medical technology would remain restricted - it's about profits, people. If you look at how fast the people on Earth were pirating tech, you can see why the meds didn't make landfall. It's the same reason why Intel doesn't have a fab in China - the tech would be long gone in a matter of months.<br/><br/>In any case, this movie pushes all the buttons. It's well-written and well-acted and reminds us of a few human truths. We don't see what happens after the curtains close and that is a wise decision by the producers, as it will not be pretty.

"nictrasvinabl4","Null","4","7","19 September 2013"," Racist Communist propaganda to divide people
","There were many many plot holes and problems with this movie first of all. But the major problem with this movie was the massive racism in it. Basically every bad person is white (even Matt Damon is essentially Mexican), all the ""good"" people are brown. And its the evil rich white people who live in luxury and what not who cause the problems. Guess what Im Mexican too but racism is racism, and this movie was racist.<br/><br/>So Matt Damon decides to go into a chamber that will be irradiated in a few seconds to unblock a door that was closing, good idea moron. The door closes and he gets irradiated, 5 days to live. Guess who's fault it is? The rich white exec who had nothing to do with it, and he obviously deserves to die b/c some moron did something moronic and he wasn't sympathetic to some idiot worker he doesn't know who was going to die. Also he is white so he probably did lots of other bad things right, so he prob deserved it? Well thats how the movie puts it, blatantly racist.<br/><br/>This movie is about immigration and Obamacare essentially. Apparently everyone on Elysium can afford to have the equivalent of an MRI/Catscan miracle healing device in their HOME, but the tech doesn't exist on earth due to expense not even in hospitals, or racism, or something. You know how it is, rich people hate brown people too much to make money off them, so they are keeping the tech for themselves right? Oh wait no thats not how capitalism works, the tech would exist everywhere because its not cost prohibitive enough to have one IN EVERY FREAKING HOUSE ON ELYSIUM. There is no free lunch, there is no free healthcare, you can't just give everyone the best healthcare free, sorry this is reality and it will be way worse under Communism (hence EU).<br/><br/>Look at what happened to LA, it became Mexico. Its a 3rd world hellhole with mass overpopulation and destruction, just like Elysium will be when open border policies are allowed. Where will you run to then? This is the only accurate part of the movie, LA will be like this if people do the same things they did in Mexico, and they will need to escape to somewhere else after they ruin it, so at least they were right there. Communist policies are why Mexico is so bad off along with drug war politics of USA, but its mostly the former.<br/><br/>So apparently USA owes everyone health care (its not a right, sorry) and isn't allowed to defend its own borders like every other sovereign nation. Lets just have 7 billion people live in USA, yeh thats it, and healthcare is free and the only reason its not given to people is due to racism. I know, lets have 20 billion people live on a small space station. Apparently a trip to space is affordable for the poor people, but somehow this miracle tech in everyones house on Elysium isn't, probably b/c of bearucrats spending all their money and being corrupt and inefficient like govt always is vs free market capitalism on Elysium.<br/><br/>They even call the illegal aliens trying to invade Elysium ""undocumented"" and they have the nerve to say this wasn't political when they said it was at first, then they tried to lie and say it wasn't. Not only is the political but this is identity politics and flat out racism against whites. Imagine if the races were reversed. Lawsuit. Race riots. Protests in the streets.<br/><br/>The rocket agent guy is racist and a rapist and they are either South African or Aussies. They are bad too. Remember, all white people are inherently evil and racist, and all brown people are inherently good even if they are career criminals who victimize poor people and send them to their deaths to Elysium in shuttles that will get shot down, they obviously aren't bad... sigh...<br/><br/>Nevermind the career criminal gang mexicans who break laws and steal cars, they have hearts of gold and due to the color of their skin, not the content of their character, they get a free pass. They are also brain surgeons and rocket scientists apparently, but they can't get jobs because of... um... must be white people, lets create division and class warfare to promote communism. We all know brain surgeon engineer rocket scientist air traffic controllers all join gangs instead of getting a job, yeh racism or something.<br/><br/>This movie makes me sick, it spits on America and is extremely racist. And even without the propaganda there are about a million flaws in the science and everything else, but the racism is what got me. Lets create division and class warfare, lets have identity politics, remember your oppression is due to white people and they are evil. I can't even believe a movie like this was made, its disgusting. Its so blatantly racist and full of crap."
"herbatienen","9","4","7","29 August 2013"," Neil Blomkamp does it again, after District 9 he delivers us Elysium.
","We went to see this movie last night, I have to admit one thing when leaving the theater, that Blomkamp surely knows how to make an entertaining movie, that sticks in your head and that makes you discuss and debate social and moral issues. And that is what makes a movie strong for me, the mere fact that when the movie is over, the discussion is still on. <br/><br/>Yes I can agree with comments that this movie isn't up to par with D-9, but it is also a different kind of movie, it is a new story. The only similarity I could find, is that Blomkamp has a love for depicting a black/white society, just as he did in D-9. He takes on the moral high ground when it comes to poor vs rich, adequate health care for the rich and the more improvised inadequate system for all others. That is quite clear from the get go, but I don't mind that, cuz if you want the bring something into the public eye you need to go to the extremes, and that is what he is doing in this movie, there's no gray area. You either belong to the elite, or you don't and you will do anything to be part off it. <br/><br/>And it is exactly this premise that is the building foundation of this movie. The characterization is building on a slow pace in the beginning, and yes it could have been done slightly different to give it a more easy pace for watching, but in the end you do realize why Neil has chosen this approach. In the whole of things, the build up of characters, the slow pacing in the plot, the flashback back and forth all nicely come together and give this movie quite a high credibility and an understanding in why Damon's character does what he does and the decisions he makes in the end. We witness how Max (Matt Damon) transitions from being an irresponsible joker and gangster into the anti-hero he becomes at the end. I hear people complaining about the fact that Damon wasn't Bourne enough (for the fighting scenes) but that would be completely laughable as Max isn't a military man, he comes from the streets, he is a survivalist, someone who will only fight to survive. If Blomkamp would have given him unmatched fighting skills that only well trained military would have, it just would have destroyed the whole character. No this guy, lives and thrives on emotions and on his wits on solving a problem, and that is just exactly how he fights, which is a very good thing and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>Scharlto Copley on the other hand, makes a perfect villain, my god is this guy good. He was great in the A-team, sublime in D-9 and does he nail the bad guy in Elysium, this guy one to watch for the future. As Agent Kruger he sets down a very great villain, a psychopathic killer on a leach by a corrupt government Secretary (A very good and convincing Jodie Foster). But Kruger (Copley) undergoes a transition just as Max, only it is in the opposite way, he sees a chance to get rid off the government leach and gain the ultimate power through Max, and it is that where the whole movie is building up to. These 2 guys, both with a destiny to fulfill, only it's inevitable that they wouldn't duel as they cross paths right before they reach their goal. <br/><br/>Without giving to much away from the plot, the ending and final sequence and scene is quite fitting and it ties the whole story together, and leaves you (the audience) with some serious moral issues to think over and to discuss with your friends. <br/><br/>I know I have enjoyed this movie very much, and I am looking forward to see more work of Neil Blomkamp and Sharlto Copley. And in final a big cheer for the magnificent work from the WETA workshop for the special effects and the decors, they're truly breathtaking."
"dfle3","8","4","7","27 August 2013"," Mad Max...with a Hollywood budget. 80+%
","This film really grabbed my attention with its opening shots...an urban canyon with decaying skyscrapers...such an iconic image. Where can I buy the poster? Anyway, it's that image which put in mind the thought that if the Australian movie ""Mad Max"" (or its sequel) had a budget, that's how it might have spent the money instead of doing it on the cheap, on the outskirts of Woop Woop. There is definitely a ""Mad Max 2"" aesthetic at work in some scenes, especially the ones featuring cars. Then you'll see a grand image outside of Earth and think that image was taken from ""2001: A space odyssey"". Or you'll see an image and recognise ""The terminator"" reference. ""Elysium"" nicely homages these movies without feeling derivative.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie concerns Max's (hmm...surely that's not a co-incidence? Played by Matt Damon in any case) need to go to the titular space station in order to cure himself from a terminal disease due to a workplace accident (the scene where that occurred put in mind those Work Safe ads you see here in Australia!). The Earth that Max lives on is basically a slum like environment. Even though I haven't read any books by Charles Dickens, the phrase ""Dickensian"" definitely comes to mind for that vision of Earth's future workplace!<br/><br/>In contrast to this future Earth, Elysium is a paradise orbiting Earth for the privileged. They have clean air, acres of private gardens for everyone and a medical pod in each home which can literally cure anything. Watching the movie I felt quite clever for seeing the implications of this state of affairs. Surprisingly, the movie rams home the implications for that at the end. I like that narrative device in the movie...you really can't argue the toss on the morality and ethics of that situation. On Elysium, to be without privilege is terrifying for the inhabitants...hence the martial presence which is subtle in those early scenes.<br/><br/>Apart from movie homages, I was playing 'spot the real world equivalents' throughout as well. Much of the movie is set in a predominantly Spanish speaking Los Angeles. It made me wonder if this represents an actual fear of some Americans. Of course, the modern day equivalent is the situation with Mexicans attempting to sneak into the U.S. for a better chance of success in life in America. In this movie, you could view Elysium as 'New America' and Los Angeles as 'New Mexico'...which is probably historically accurate, as the U.S. sneakily annexed land from Mexico centuries ago and incorporated it into what is now the U.S. of A. Anyway, for obvious reasons many of the people of Los Angeles also wish to escape to Elysium for reasons of a better life or just to save a loved one dying of something.<br/><br/>If Elysium is meant to be 'New America', it is disguised...perhaps they speak French there? (there was language switching in Los Angeles too, but I don't know if that was meant to show bilingualism or a transition to something the audience wouldn't require subtitles for). Jodie Foster plays security bigwig ""Delacourt"" on Elysium. Perhaps she is meant to have a South African accent but if she does, it's an interesting 'failure'...a hybrid of South African, English and perhaps French too...which I liked. In a film like this there really wouldn't be a 'wrong' accent...like there would in Meryl Streep's take on Lindy Chamberlain in ""Evil angels"". Definitely sounding South African is dodgy security contractor ""Kruger"" (played by Sharlto Copley). For some reason he brought weird South African music group Die Antwoord to mind...I mean the male singer of that...not that I've heard much of them! You even see the South African flag on his spaceship...in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Other modern day equivalences are brought to mind by this movie. The role of the current U.S. government in military operations and surveillance is brought to mind as was the previous government's reliance on private military contractors (like Blackwater). Some shots with thermal vision (I think) remind me of that Wikileaks' footage of U.S. helicopter gunships killing innocent civilians abroad and Kruger actually brings to mind some of the atrocities of Al-Qaeda (I mean his work with his sword).<br/><br/>If I have one criticism of the movie it is that it reverted to Hollywood type as far as the actions of Elysium's regular President at the end of the movie (played by Faran Tahir). It didn't have to play out like that and in fact the eventual outcome isn't really justified by the personal histories of those we have come to know in this movie...it assumes too much for what happens, in other words.<br/><br/>I like ""Elysium""'s mythic quality, one which it shares with Mad Max 2. Emma Tremblay was really sweet as the daughter of Max's young love ""Frey"" (played by Alice Braga)...especially in that scene where she tells Max a story. I'm guessing that internet forums devoted to this movie will have plenty of people wanting to know what moral Max gleaned from that story at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>A very nice movie and I think it will have repeat viewing value...my provisional score for this movie kept going up as it progressed...from 75% to 75+ (which translates from 7 stars to 8 stars on this site) to 77.5% to 77.5+%. Final score 80+%."

","I have seen many of the best Sci Fi films; Bladerunner, The 5th Element, and others, and I honestly think that Elysium is far better than all of them. I strongly disagree with many of the reviews on here who claim its not a very good film , poor plot and so on... DO NOT listen to them! The story has many twists and turns, and even after seeing both trailers, and researching the film, I was still completely amazed by how the plot developed. The acting is superb, the environments and props are very real looking and the ""droids"" in the film look excellent and very well designed! I URGE you to go and see this film - Neil Blomkamp does NOT disappoint!!!"
"jessicareid","8","4","7","23 August 2013"," Interesting futuristic action film
","Elysium is another film which depicts what earth will be like in the future and how our society and civilisation will survive. In this story the classes are even more divided and the rich and powerful all reside on the perfect habitat that is the space station Elysium, while the rest of the human race are struggling on overpopulated earth. The story follows Max, who Matt Damon does a great job of portraying, as circumstances lead him to go on a mission to disrupt the way of life and the inequality between the two.<br/><br/>This film has some great action which is bound to keep all viewers entertained and the whole futuristic aspect makes it more interesting. There were quite a few memorable characters in this film one of which was an unpredictable and manic Elysium agent played by Sharlto Copley. Also the relationship between Max and his childhood friend was quite moving and added more meaning to the story.<br/><br/>There were some gory moments in the film which I noticed shocked some of the audience but these were few and far between. Overall I think this was an enjoyable and gripping film which is something quite original and definitely worth a watch."
"abisio","10","16","42","9 August 2013"," Just perfect; but only for people with brains
","When was the last time you left a theater from a sci-fi movie really thinking. Well in my case, it was Neill Blomkamp previous masterpiece; ""DISTRICT 9"". Elysium is not for everybody. The strong social / apartheid critic on District 9; is magnified here ten times more. Those looking for brainless and empty action packed entertainment might be disappointed. The violence level is really high and almost non-stop; however there are no super-heroes here. Damon's character, gets beaten a lot and humor is almost absent; just because the reality been depicted here has nothing to laugh at.<br/><br/>In LA 2154, an small percent of the population lives in a space station called Elysium where technology and cleanness let people live for a long time and illness are easily cured.<br/><br/>While overpopulated Earth has become a factory field where poor people lives in unhealthy condition working as slaves and controlled by very fascist robot-policemen<br/><br/>Max (Damon) plays a petty thief who in work accident gets contaminated (he is forced by a supervisor to enter in a dangerous place ) and will die in 5 days. His only option, try to reach Elysium and get cured; but that is not easy. Jodie Foster is Secretary Delancourt; the security chief of Elysium. She is not really kind with illegal immigration (""we must defend the house we built for our sons ""; she states in one moment; forgetting they live in paradise thanks to the hell people in Earth are suffering).<br/><br/>In order to get the resources to reach Elysium, Max must first steal secrets for an Earth gangster; but those secrets are really important for Mrs. Delancourt so she hires Kruger; an assassin / mercenary the kind government officials use and then discard. Things get pretty ugly. <br/><br/>Everything that happens is a reference to social issues; not only in America but in other countries. A couple of Cuban friends; immediately cataloged the movie as ""SOCIALIST"" or ""LEFT""; nothing far from the truth. The movie is only concern about the abuse that governments and governments officials do against common people.<br/><br/>It is great movie; put your brain to work and see it immediately"
"tzeup","4","7","15","16 August 2013"," Why do movie makers treat audiences like idiots?
","(Warning : Contains very minor spoilers so stop reading now if you hate this kind of thing).<br/><br/>Elysium is an OK movie for people who want to check their brain at the door, or watch 2 hours of visual effects eye candy. It looks great, but the movie makers treat the audience like brain dead idiots. There are so many plot holes in the movie that I gave up counting. <br/><br/>Even worse though, there are huge glaring scientific errors.<br/><br/>Elysium is big space station shaped like a spinning wheel. It's inhabitants live on the inside of the wheel getting artificial gravity from centrifugal force. The ""top"" of the wheel does not exist. It's not closed or sealed off in any way so other space ships can come and go. There is nothing to hold the atmosphere in place. GLARING TECHNICAL ERROR!<br/><br/>The spaceships come and go and land on the inside of the space station near its edge, where it should be spinning its fastest. GLARING TECHNICAL ERROR! Any ships would have to enter and leave from the center hub of the wheel, not the edge. <br/><br/>In order for Elysium to remain in space it would have to be in a Geostationary Orbit which is 22,236 Miles above the ground. Small spaceships lift-off from the earth and travel to Elysium in only a few minutes meaning the ships travel at over 7,000 miles per hour. GLARING TECHNICAL ERROR! Forget the fact that the occupants suffer no G-forces, that the ships couldn't possibly carry enough fuel etc to get there or get there that fast, etc. <br/><br/>I'm no scientist and I'm no math geek but this kind of stupidity in a movie has to go. <br/><br/>Oh and if this isn't enough, the movie also has characters that look at computer screens of pure random gibberish and suddenly realize that ""This is the code that will save the day!"". I mean it - except for maps and other flight data once in a while, the most important computer screen showing the most important data that is the most important part of the whole movie is just showing garbage - random characters - crap - nada - nothing. WTF, movie makers? <br/><br/>Sure the movie is ""just"" sci-fi and sure it's ""just"" fantasy. But really how much does it cost to hire a science consultant so that idiot stupid BS mistakes don't slip into your $150M movie? <br/><br/>Attention movie makers : Hire me and I'll make your sci-fi 10 times better by stopping you from making GLARING TECHNICAL ERRORS in your films."
"jimspencer7","3","7","15","16 August 2013"," Disguised as Entertainment
","I was sort of a Matt Damon fan, and of course how could you not like Jodie Foster? While the film is visually stunning, and the characters sway the viewer to and fro, I found the underlying theme political. I followed Matt Damon through the Bourne series, and like a lot of people, I found myself rooting for him as the underdog.....unfortunately, because I was following his career, I began to read more about how he thinks. That would be fine, except his politics seem to ooze out into the Panoramic Screen, albeit subtly, but obvious. I wouldn't care about his politics, except for the fact he seems to use this movie to further that view. For just pure entertainment, this movie will keep your pulse at a steady high, the graphics are excellent, and it is pretty much non-stop. Recommend this movie to someone? I'm not so sure, because in the end one is supposed to leave the theater hating the rich, bolstering what media wants us to believe. Whatever happened to ""Just the facts, ma'am?"" I think I will concentrate on the animated movie scene from here on out."

I would love to see the films put out by all of the negative reviewers to see if they can do better than this one. <br/><br/>The film was a fantastic thrill ride. It was visually stunning. The props and environments were excellent. The camera work was great. What i mean by that was every frame of this film was well composed. The fight sequences were a bit jarring but I could still follow the action. The vehicle designs were spectacular, I felt that the designers of the vehicles really tried to reflect real physics when developing these assets. The robot storage in the side of the executive spaceship was a great touch. the robots were gritty and believable. The robot animation was top-notch. I even liked the script.<br/><br/>Looking through the credits I saw that the famous designer, Syd Mead worked on this one. The shots of the space station really reflected his work.

"trnjamesbond","3","7","15","13 August 2013"," A Technological Mish Mash Mess.
","Just got back from the flicks, It's Monday night weekend after the premier. Elysium is a dramatic outlook on how things in our reality could end up. This is the story of a civilization that has actually separated the 1% rich people living in a Kubrickesque space station while the other 99% poor and disease ridden people still live on the planet and doing what they can to survive. Life on earth actually doesn't look that much different from our own reality just on a larger scale. The population on planet Earth would do anything to get a one way ticket to Elysium so that they could cure themselves of all their impurities with healing beds which is a device you lay on and completely heals every faulty molecule in their bodies.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Max who at times seems kind of weak and dismal, portrayed as a beat down factory worker slaving away in a factory that produces robots for the rich,He also has a criminal past but now is trying live a straight miserable life instead of a miserable criminal life. All the while thinking of his boyhood fantasy, which was whisking away his girlfriend up to the space station Elysium.<br/><br/>An accident at work leaves him with only 5 days to live. Of course here comes the old story of a small group of men taking on the 1% rich elite.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster who I love and have always enjoyed watching plays a cold hearted conniving woman who is in charge of the security of Elysium. It's kind of nice to see her in a different role as a villain. But, her character Delacourt becomes highly annoying the more she is on screen. Aside from her terrible fake accent, which I think was supposed to sound British or something your guess is as good as mine. Delacourt turns against the President of the Station when he undermines her authority when she goes trigger happy and orders one of her rogue agents on Earth to kill 47 people that tried to land on a station after they stole fake ID's that get branded on there skin so that the station will recognize them as a citizen. Delacourt(Foster) feels that these people are threatening the very fabric of the stations population.<br/><br/>I'm not adding all the storyline details to this review that would take way too long to point out all the faults on why this film doesn't work well. So read on for the short version.......<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Jodie Foster seemed very detached from their characters, I don't know if it was the directing or not. The film seemed rushed in most parts even though it had a fairly lengthy runtime of 1hr 49mins. The technology in the film also doesn't match up. The station has the ability to have biobeds which can heal any disease in human history but they still have to use key cards to move from room to room in high security areas. The space station itself looks just like something from 2001 A Space Odyssey, except it has an artificial atmosphere made by plant life and trees. The fight scenes were of course filmed in seizure cam mode(If you don't know what that is, it's short for nauseating and annoying). Jodi Foster's role is pretty much pointless in the end. Max and his cohorts eventually land on Elysium to set things straight. Max's computer hacking friend in one scene has to decode a bunch of secure doors with a pin reader laptop that looks like it's more from 1990's than 200 years from now, all to gain access to the mainframe eventually rebooting the station so that it accepts all citizens as equal not just the rich elite.<br/><br/>The more I think about this film the more I hate it. The visuals are stunning, the sound is amazing, but the storyline is old and rotten like a song being put on repeat. The film seems out of place and cliché most of the time. The villains in the film are boring and not worth mentioning except for the fact that they stole the main villain from Mad Max.<br/><br/>I don't understand how they have the ability to heal everyone but still use computers with keyboards and doors with key cards. Most of the technology is not explained it's just thrown abruptly on the screen, and never gives us any explanation. As far as I'm concerned by the time we figure out how to molecularly heal our bodies of all diseases we will all be past this pathetic storyline of monetary gain and greed. The story is dumb and a waste of time, I expect this form of acting from Matt Damon, but not from Jodie Foster, she should of turn this role down. Also we have all seen Matt Damon in this type of gun wielding role way too many times to even give a crap.<br/><br/>The two sides of the coin good and bad are certainly operating on two different frequencies and never truly are in tune with one another. This film had a lot of potential but spirals out of control, due to lack of character substance, and integrity. The film looses it's cohesion after the first half hour. <br/><br/>Don't waste your time."

I respect more as an actor more and more with every movie choice he makes.<br/><br/>The movie was awesome. I don't like futuristic scientific movies because they tend to be on the silly side with the costumes and décor, but Elysium did not have that problem. It was futuristic but tasteful. The fight scenes were a bit shaky but also tasteful.<br/><br/>This movie was filled with suspense and humor and emotion. The guy who played agent Kruger was superb. This guy definitely has talent and range(I was a fan of him in District 9). The director of this movie has found a fan for life. I will follow him like a cult and run to watch all of his films.

"rodolfoIII","8","13","33","8 August 2013"," ...Impressive _GO SEE IT!
","Wow! I just finished seeing Elysium I must say that director Neill Blomkamp is definitely growing as a filmmaker. As in his prior work  despite the impressive technology, he focuses on the human factor which elevates the movie than just mere blow-up shootem up film. He has definitely made something new once again. The movie stars Max(Matt Damon) as he grows up with Frey(Alice Braga)  though their lives take different paths as they grow up it intersects like an explosion later in life. The basis of the movie is that people living on earth are living in desperation and day by day. There are pockets of rich people but mostly to build ships, sophisticated robots and anything else the very rich needs. The rich actually live in a space station called Elysium which is not only a living habitat but it actually keep people without any sickness and in a good environment. Something people on earth no longer have. Max (used to be a thief) is now a factory worker making robots, but one day due to an accident he is expose to too much radiation and has 5 days to live. Prior to that he meets Frey again who is now a nurse with a very sick daughter. Max tries to get to Elysium for a cure but the only way to get there is through Spider(played by Wagner Moura) and doing it underground, but 1srt Max has to be equip with a 3rd generation exoskeleton which allows him to be faster and stronger. Unfortunately, the person in charge of protecting Elysium is Delacourt(Jodie Foster) who is very ambitious and utilizes an agent name Kruger(well played by Sharlto Copley) with all the means at his disposal to achieve to stop anything from reaching Elysium or even if reach to stop them at all cost. With Spider downloads unto Max a program meant to ""reboot"" Elysium and possibly change everyone's lives but what ensues is a battle between the haves and have-nots that's decided only by one side completely dying or transformed. the human factor definitely keeps the movie grounded. Is bloody, is not for the meek but like everything it serves it's purpose."

"Dylan_Gansen","8","12","30","9 August 2013"," A Breath of Fresh Air
","The summer movie season is wrapping up soon. Hollywood had a great start this season with the ""Star Trek"" and ""Iron Man"" franchises' latest adventures kicking it off, as well as a polarizing adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" that I had more fun with than I was anticipating. Then we saw ""Man of Steel"", a movie that for many fell short of expectations. But these films, as with most films that we see playing in the cinema, weren't original ideas, they were sequels or reboots. <br/><br/>We needed something more, and sure ""Pacific Rim"" was a great original take on a giant monster flick, but something that was more than just a summer popcorn movie had to be somewhere out there. Now we come to the end of our summer journey, and our wishes have been met with ""Elysium"".<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" blends his signature top-notch sci-fi action with an intelligent plot, something that we've come to expect after his last feature, ""District 9"". And although ""District 9"" had a smarter and more intricate story, ""Elysium"" is no slouch. <br/><br/>""Elysium"" appears to touch on many current issues in today's society, such as illegal immigration, health care, and the power of the elite few over the masses in general. The film takes place roughly 140 years from now on an overpopulated and polluted Earth that is orbited by a space station paradise called Elysium. Only the rich can afford to live on the space station. There is no war and there are machines that can cure nearly anything including cancer, so its citizens have virtually nothing to fear, as they go about their lives on the man-made Heaven. <br/><br/>Our hero, Max, played by none other than Matt Damon, is of course one with the masses trapped on the hellish Earth and he must fight for what he and his fellow Earthlings deserve. Preventing Max from reaching his goal of getting to Elysium is the film's main antagonist, Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, who starred as the protagonist in ""District 9"". Shartlo kills it in this role, being one of the most intimidating villains on screen this year. <br/><br/>Kruger is an psychotic agent living on Earth who must prevent the civilians from escaping to Elysium. He is truly unpredictable in his actions which include blowing people to bits (something that Blomkamp loved to do in District 9) as well as harming women and children to get what he wants. The story builds to a terrific, action packed climax that is sure to leave everyone on the edge of their seats. <br/><br/>Though Copley's performance stood out, Damon's was near perfect and helped carry the masterpiece. Jodie Foster plays a corrupted Defense Secretary very well, and William Fichtner is great as a mean-spirited businessman. All in all, ""Elysium"" was the most fun I had in the theater all year and I recommend it to anyone who wants to see an intelligent action movie that takes place in the future but comments on issues in the present."

Post Production: The space shots were the only golden moment (Spolier: you spend no time in Elysium only for a few short chapters at the end of the film)<br/><br/>Though the reason why this film falters so badly and so quickly - the social commentary - ""Whites are privileged"" and ""everyone else is not"". These outdated and overused stereotypes make the film look cheep. The directed tries to address immigration as a sub topic, but ends up feeling like a BBC segment used for cheep tears.

"mstoil122859","4","5","10","7 September 2013"," HG Wells would have called it silly
","Yesterday, I saw Elysium at the movies and then saw Fritz Lang's 1926 scifi epic Metropolis on television. They are basically the same story: future world divided between wealthy living in isolated splendor and poor folk living in squalor, until a crisis forces an ultimately successful rebellion. H.G. Wells called Metropolis ""silly"" and its story is certainly laughable. Elysium was equally silly, without the excuse of being a silent movie. In science fiction, we want to know something about the future world. Elysium explains nothing. Why would the wealthy place themselves in the vulnerable position of depending on a hostile, overcrowded Earth for supplies for their isolated space station? Why would they defend their space station from invasion from Earth by having a raggedy guy in Los Angeles fire hand-held missiles? If medical technology has advanced to the point that a single machine can cure broken bones and leukemia in less than 30 seconds, why would this technology be withheld from most people? And, by the way, Elysium can't possibly be for the wealthy only because we see working stiffs—cops, technicians, etc.—who are clearly NOT multimillionaires on the space station. So Elysium ends up being nothing more than an excuse for two lengthy chase scenes and a clumsy attempt to encourage us to cheer for scuzzy barrio dwellers and boo the arrogant Anglos (and their French and Boer lackeys). It could have taken place in a high-rise luxury apartment house. I'll take Metropolisat least its original and the scenes with robot Maria are scary!"

"Nokitron","6","5","10","27 August 2013"," Max has fulfilled his destiny, but is it ""Elysium""'s destiny to be a better movie than District 9?
","Okay, first of all I am so excited about this movie, especially it is directed by Neill Blomkamp, the creator of the awesome ""District 9"", and I thought this gonna be ""awesome"", too.<br/><br/>Set in 2154, where Earth is drew over-populated, messy and such things. All the problems that you can imagine is now a reality in this planet. The only reason to go to space is for the Earth life as we used to know. Unfortunately, as the greed of human never stops, they keep the facility, this Elysium, only for the rich-folks.<br/><br/>Max De Costa, an ex-criminal who decided to work on Armadyne, a robot servants factory, got an accident on workplace, leaving a radiation that will kill him in five days if he doesn't go to Elysium, where the medical pod and such things could be happened.<br/><br/>So I will start with the plus. There are so many sci-fi(future imagination especially) that failed. Let's just say Pandorum, G.I. Joe(I don't know if this sets in future, but well), they are barely give us the real deal of future. But in Elysium, it's too ignorant to not believe what Earth would be. Over-populated, advanced tech(even I am not so sure with that medical-pod), even the genius AI. Hell, they are seem so real in a distant future.<br/><br/>Another aspect is Sharlto Copley. Yes, you maybe recognize his face from ""District 9"" as Wikus Van De Merwe. You see, the accent he uses in two different films are flawless. And the characters between a mutated human become a #1 mercenary, he just cannot fail. I love his act and impression, really.<br/><br/>Beside that, there was nothing special, more than my expectation from D9. The plot is flat, there is no co-op relationship that really matters(Between Wikus and Christopher Johnson, it is so intense), and easily forgettable. One more thing, the action. I have watched the trailer for this movie, and it seems promising a great fight between exoskeleton-guy with a robot, a genius AI robot. But as far as I can see, I only saw a man that ripping of a robot's head. That's all. No more robots. Ever. The camera is unconformably followed. I mean, why could they just put it on a certain spots, and let the editing do the work? I was really surprised when the Director of Photography is exactly the same as D9. D9 is better at fight scene.<br/><br/>The verdict is, this movie may be forgettable, but the act from Sharlto Copley leave my disappointment that this movie would/should have been better than District 9. A great dystopia future and actors, but really missed the chance because the freaking camera shoot and standard plot. But still, I am looking forward to D9 sequel. Hope it will get more awesomeness from the franchise.<br/><br/>P.S.: Sorry if this review is too comparative with District 9. Since I like District 9, the director and writer is same and I expect something more, so. . ."
"cartman_1337","3","5","10","24 August 2013"," Another disappointment from Neill Blomkamp
","South African director Neill Blomkamp was discovered by New Zealand director Peter Jackson a few years ago, and he so believed in this director that he produced his first big movie, District 9. Having been a fan of Peter Jackson since well before his step up to the big league, through the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I was optimistic about District 9; if Peter Jackson believed in it, it had to have some promise. That's what I thought, anyway. Ultimately I was severely disappointed by District 9, which in boring documentary style explored the treatment of aliens in South Africa, seen through the eyes of a character no one cared about, watching characters we didn't know enough about to care. The underlying message; this is how rich people treat the poorest of the poor. The message is a good one, the execution extremely poor.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2013, and we have his second big film at the theaters. Without Peter Jackson as a producer this time, but instead he has attracted big stars like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster to the film. Matt Damon playing Max; a poor, unfortunate orphan on earth, struggling in a low pay, high risk job, hoping to save up enough money one day to take him and his childhood girlfriend to the haven in the sky; the off-world, man built colony called Elysium, where only the rich and beautiful are allowed to live. An accident at work gives him only 5 days to carry out his dream, and to be saved by the health beds on Elysium, which can cure any illness in seconds, without any side effects what so ever. To assist him he gets a group of rebels who on a semi-regular basis sends their own spaceships up to Elysium with fugitives who've saved up enough money for the ticket. On Elysium, chief of security Delacourt (Jodie Foster) does everything in her power - and more - to prevent them from landing.<br/><br/>Once again it seems that Blomkamp is more interested in conveying a message than actually delivering a good, coherent sci-fi/action epic. The message this time; the rich consider themselves elevated over the poor, and do not want anything to do with them. While this certainly rings true in today's society, no one watching a movie presented as a big star sci-fi/action epic really cares. So, as far as conveying a message goes, Blomkamp once again fails. Unfortunately his failure also extends to his ability to convey a good action movie.<br/><br/>The characters aren't fleshed out enough for the audience to really care. Jodie Foster is a great actress, but she seems badly miscast in the role of rogue security officer, planning to overtake the presidency. It's sad to see her struggling her way through this movie, in what is probably the worst performance I've ever seen her give. South African actor Sharlto Copley, who also got a slight break with District 9, is certainly the most entertaining of the characters, but the movie fails hugely in his credibility - we lack the background information to make his place in the movie believable. Matt Damon plays pretty much on auto pilot, and that works well enough to get him through the movie. His character Max and his girlfriend Frey are given some background information through some scenes from their childhood - scenes that are repeated annoyingly many times as a reminder of what we've already seen. Yet when it comes to their adult versions, we are given no background between then and now at all, ultimately failing even there to make the characters fleshed out enough to be believable.<br/><br/>To top it off, every action sequence in the movie are filmed using a fast paced camera following the action. The problem with that is that the 24 pictures per second that film is able to convey is not enough to make the motion fluid. In other words, all action sequences are shaky and blurry, making it hard to follow what's actually happening. At the end of the movie I also had a bit of a headache, which I didn't at the beginning. I don't know why this type of action filming has become so popular, because I can't remember ever hearing of anyone actually preferring this type of filming over more steady and fluent presentations of the action on screen. But when it comes to effects it might be cheaper to present them in a blurry way, than having to flesh out all the details in proper action sequences...<br/><br/>The movie's vision of the future is an interesting one, though, and the presentation of 2154's Earth isn't really too far fetched as of now. However the presentation of Elysium leaves far more questions than answers, and does not seem credible at all.<br/><br/>At the end of the day I sat through a movie with a disappointingly simple story, with disappointing and non-credible characters, and with an ever more disappointing ending yielding even more questions than answers. Blomkamp shows once again that his ability to create entertaining sci-fi/action movies is non-existent. Does he have a message in his movie? Who cares? If he wanted to really address the problems of society of today he should do it through proper documentaries, or even contemporary big star action movies with the message up front and clear, instead of what he does now, which is failing at entertaining and failing at conveying messages. So for those who've read through this review and not seen the movie; don't bother with it."
"Hellmant","10","5","10","14 August 2013"," Gives viewers something to think about and digest while enjoying the action.
","'ELYSIUM': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Writer/director Neil Blomkamp's second feature (and follow-up to his immensely popular and critically acclaimed 2009 sci-fi hit 'DISTRICT 9') is yet another sci-fi action film laced with social and political commentary. Where 'DISTRICT 9' deals with social segregation and racism in South Africa this film deals with class warfare, immigration and the healthcare system in America. The film is set in a future world (2154) where the poor are forced to live on an overpopulated, disease and war stricken Earth while the rich live on a space station (called Elysium) without these problems. Blomkamp has been quoted as saying although it's set in the future it's about right now. Above all it's an awesome action movie. It stars Matt Damon as a an ex-con who's exposed to a deadly level of radiation, at his crappy job, and will stop at nothing to make his way onto Elysium in order to cure himself. It co-stars Jodie Foster and the star of 'DISTRICT 9' Sharlto Copley (who's a scene-stealer).<br/><br/>Damon plays Max Da Costa, an ex-con who now lives in a ruined Los Angeles working a dead-end factory job. The factory is ran by CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner), who routinely visits Earth in order to make sure his company becomes profitable again. While returning to Elysium a high ranking government official, named Jessica Delacourt (Foster), asks Carlyle to write her an illegal computer program, that will allow her to override Elysium and make her the President, in return for years of defense contracting business. When Da Costa is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation (that will kill him in five days) doing a deadly job for Carlyle's company (and simply 'thrown away' by him) he wants revenge. He agrees to take a job, from a smuggler named Spider (Wagner Moura), stealing corporate information from Carlyle in exchange for a free ride to Elysium. Due to the fact that Max is deathly ill Spider has a strength enhancing exoskeleton surgically attached to Max's body (to help him do the job better). When Delacourt finds out what Spider and Max are up to she enlists an insane South African mercenary, named Kruger (Copley), to stop them. <br/><br/>Damon is once again a great action hero (but nothing too much, in terms of acting, is required of him here). Foster makes a good despicable corporate villain as well but it's Copley that once again steals the show. He and Blomkamp make a great team and going from bumbling nerd hero (in 'DISTRICT 9') to treacherous lethal villain in this is remarkable (He was also a great scene-stealer in 'THE A-TEAM' in-between). Copley makes a classic and very memorable movie villain here and the movie overall is just great sci-fi action. The drama isn't quite as effective as it would like to be but it works. Like all great science fiction the film is a thinking man's movie and full of brilliant social commentary. Everything the movie says about society is exactly true, as well, right now (like Blomkamp says). It's only a matter of time until things turn disastrous or we do something about it. The movie delivers this message in a very effective way. I've heard people complain (as they did with 'DISTRICT 9') that the movie absorbs itself in action by the end and turns from smart to the routine. I agree but I think it's a good thing. This (like 'DISTRICT 9') is primarily an action film; Blomkamp obviously loves action and movie violence and he glorifies it in both films. It's not that he turns his films from thinking man's movies into action films it's that he makes his action films 'thinking man's movies' as well. That's a good thing! He gives viewers something to think about and digest while enjoying the action and the thrill ride. He's an awesome action film director and I love his movies. I can't wait to see what he does next!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMJBjPRxAc"

","This movie was the sole reason I created this IMDb account, as I could not believe how terrible it was. While it has the usual CG and action you'd expect from a movie in this genre, it's an absolutely horrible knock-off of District 9. My friend and I decided to leave the movie halfway through because we couldn't stand the complete lack of concern regarding continuity. I get that it's a Sci-Fi movie (one of my fav genres), but nothing connected and the whole thing made absolutely zero sense. For example, at the beginning of the movie and within the same context, some street and building signs in Spanish, while others in English with no apparent correlation. It might seem like a small detail, but when you start noticing dozens of things that don't add up, by any stretch of the imagination, you feel cheated out of $10+ and 2 hours of your valuable time!"

","I should have known from the trailer and choice of actors what this movie was all about. No spoilers here. It's the usual choice for Hollywood's villains - rich people (especially capitalists). In this case they are not only greedy, but murderous. The political message of income and health care inequality is so in-your-face, it was hard to enjoy the movie. The rich separatists have unlimited health, and effortless medical cures. All the ""poor"" need to do is become citizens of the Elysium paradise, instead of ""illegal aliens."" <br/><br/>Problem: an automated ""MedPod"" doesn't have the problem of 8-10 years of medical school, a quarter-million dollars of student debt, long hours, on-call weekends, and unlimited liability to lawsuits. Of course a machine makes things easier.<br/><br/>Problem: The ""capitalist"" is seen on the phone worrying about making ""restoring profitability."" Really? Have we gone past ""excess"" profits being a bad thing, and now ""restoring"" profitability is a bad thing? I suppose it's more honorable to be losing money? How do you stay in business and keep people employed if you're losing money? Oh, I forget - government bailouts. But where does the government get its money? They don't tax themselves, and they don't tax non-profits. That's right - the ONLY place they get money is from PROFITABLE businesses. You might say, ""but those employees pay taxes"" . . . but the employees of government get their money from capitalism, and non-profits get their donations from ""profits"" of others.<br/><br/>So. Preachy. And ignorant."

Hated her fake accent as Secretary Rhodes. Suppose they were trying to make her someone of exceptional intellect or something???? I think intent was one was supposed to not like her; however, the voice just made her annoying.

","This movie had good actors, good acting, great special affects, and stunning landscapes, but it just didn't do it for me. The plot was slow to take off and I found the plot rather boring. I loved everything about this movie except the storyline and I left the theatres scratching my head as to why I didn't like this movie.<br/><br/>I never liked District 9 and this movie has the same kind of style to it, so maybe that's why I didn't like it. Matt Damon as a sci fi hero...I found that very interesting and was hoping I would like it, but I think Matt should stick to the genres that he has done in the past. He's great at drama, great at spy/military/soldier type movies. I like him in a lot of the movies he does, and honestly, his acting was great in this movie. I just didn't like the story. And Matt looks weird with a shaved head.(girls perspective) I think that a lot of hard core sci fi fans will like this movie and I'm recommending it would be worth going to see, just to check it out and see if you like it. If you hated District 9, I probably wouldn't go see this movie as it has a very similar feel to it.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a rating of 5 because I hated the story line."

","I must say that all the hype about this movie has left me perplexed about how terrible it was. Half way through I found myself nodding off several times and struggling to maintain interest. I was further shocked by the constant stream of ""F"" words, which were completely pointless and warrant less. Given Damon's history and reputation, this was not a film that I would like to remember seeing him act in. Throughout the movie I kept thinking that I was watching a rerun of Mad Max with Mel Gibson. It had the same feel and same bizarre flash in filming. The scene would flash in, there would be some screaming, yelling, f bombs, and then, back to the plot. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen in the theatre. Ridiculous plot and amateurish acting. The bulk of actors were unknown to me other than Damon, Foster, and a smattering of others. I cannot recommend this film now or in the future; as I said, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Left me laughing because it was so terrible."
"PEGShane","1","6","13","20 September 2013"," Dumbest movie I've ever seen at a theater

And everyone *in the movie* at least was going for the magical medical machines (that are for some reason kept in living rooms--but not in factories or government facilities on Elysium). But *no one* has set up medical machines on Earth? And don't say ""All rich people are evil and want the poor people to die"" because even if you believe that tripe the rich get rich by making money--which they could make in the *trillions* if they sold access to the machines. <br/><br/>3) The big reboot at the end.

Too bad it's not so bad it's funny, like Escape from LA. <br/><br/>In the end, Elysium is hopeless and only worth watching for the OK special effects in places.

"TheSoFlyGuy1359","9","6","13","11 August 2013"," Liberal Sci-Fi ""Elysium"" Shines over Disappointing Summer
","The incredible disappointing summer blockbusters of 2013 come to a close with August slipping away from our grasp.<br/><br/>A quick recap of the summer: Star Trek 2 got good reviews but I sadly did not get to see it. The Man of Steel gets shot down with poor critical reception. Iron Man 3 was just OK, if that. World War Zombie or whatever was awful, and Del Toro's Pacific Rim, although lacked heart, was completely badass but lost in the box office to GROWN UPS 2 (i'll just let that sink in for a little bit). So a sequel to that is about as unlikely as a life long marriage between Kim and Kanye. So you could say that this summer was a huge let down.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for Elysium. Its Neil Blomkamp's second attempt at his signature ""smart-sci-fi"" movies, the first one being the amazing ""District 9"". Also, it has a bald Matt Damon in a dirty robot suit fighting the rich with sweet guns on a giant floating Halo in the sky. Oh yeah, and its also about health care.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, it could've fallen flat on its face.<br/><br/>This film, being a movie with an opinionated message concerning the rich and the poor, gets very mixed reviews. It did OK in its opening weekend, and barely managed to NOT score a rotten on Rotten Tomatoes. So what makes it one of the best films of 2013 (the other being The Place Beyond The Pines)? I'll tell you. Its the explosive action and gripping realism behind this applause-worthy hour-and-a-half sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>The scenery and cinematography are breathtaking, and none of it feels CGI or fake. Especially the way Blomkamp tackles these gritty robotic tales: giant planes are pushed to the background or not in focus because they aren't a big deal to the people of 2154. This is directing at its best.<br/><br/>The performances are almost all top notch across the board. Matt Damon plays a likable protagonist named Max who wants to help people, but his hint of selfishness inside him sometimes holds him back. He does a lot of the stunt work himself, and he plays his character well to make him enjoyable to watch on screen. I really cared about his character, which really surprised me. <br/><br/>Max's teammates do not appear in all that much of the movie, but are enjoyable as well. While some are a little over the top (Spyder, played by Wagner Moura), there are others that are loyal to Max and try to help him on his journey (Diego Luna as Julio), and serve as one of Max's motivations to fight the ""bad guys"".<br/><br/>Jodie Foster, however, is a different story. She gives a lazy performance as Delacourt. Her accent in the movie annoyed me, and her lines, while well-written, felt unnatural and uninspired, due to her over the top delivery. Oh well, you're supposed to hate her character anyway, so I guess it worked. Alice Braga is good as the main love interest. She and Max have a complex relationship that existed long before the events of the film, so the romance does not feel forced at all. It's very unusual for a summer blockbuster, I know.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley as Kruger seems like another one of Delacourt's hired guns at first, but once his story and Max's story cross, he shows his true colors. Kruger is a totally different role for Copley, but he manages to own the role. He made Kruger feel just as likable and fun as he was menacing. He steals every scene he's in, making the third act exciting and full of life.<br/><br/>The plot, while at first glance seems generic, is actually a metaphor for foreign immigration. Elysium is basically America's wealthy, and Earth holds America's less-fortunate, as well as foreign ethnic groups including Max, who appears to be part of the Spanish heritage. Some might call Elysium racist, but I completely disagree and think it tackles a very apparent problem in our society and hits it hard into my brain without being too preachy.<br/><br/>When there is action, it is brutal, intense, and jaw dropping. There's plenty of big budget explosions and eye candy. Cars are spinning and flipping, robots are exploding, planes are crashing, grenades are taking people's faces clean off, and amazing high-tech guns are literally blowing up people, not to mention some serious hand to hand combat that was worth the price of admission alone. Despite all of this, I wouldn't call this movie an action movie. <br/><br/>What shines over this action is the deep drama between the characters and the heart that this movie really has.<br/><br/>The ending may be identified as cliché to some folks, but I thought it tied this futuristic ride up in a nice little bow. See, even if you don't agree with Elysium's message, I can't seem to shake the fact that Blomkamp made this movie with passion, and at a rare occasion: during another summer movie season in 2013.<br/><br/>Great script, good characters, interesting premise, amazing spectacle, and a controversial but powerful message that leaves you thinking long after the credits. <br/><br/>Sounds like my kind of movie. Is it yours?<br/><br/>For me, this easily deserves a 9/10. Tell me what you think. Cheers."

","I've read a lot of negative stuff about Elysium in IMDb lately and I don't think it's all warranted. Certainly many of the negative points are true. There is a lack of story development/backstory for the Elysium world. I really feel the film skipped across the actual people and world of Elysium in a way that actually made it feel a bit budget. Everyone wears suits or bikinis and the lawns are perfectly manicured - apparently I'm supposed to think that this means Elysium is the perfect utopia. The shaky cam is a little distracting and frustrating at times. The story is just OK. The ending a over the top cliché. There are a bunch of plot holes. D9 is in an entirely different league in these respects and is overall a better film by some way.<br/><br/>But what is fantastic about this is the gripping, visceral action. Sharlto Copley returns as a psychotic mercenary is an unbelievable departure from his wussy character in D9. Honestly I was amazed how effective he was as a scary bad guy given the roles I've seen him play before. The futuristic weaponry and robots is a feast for the eyes and ears. The violence is jarring, realistic and left me speechless at times. In these ways the film matched D9 and I was again impressed at what Neil Blomkamp had created on screen. Matt Damon is a great actor and was solid in this film. At the end of the day I was entertained from start to finish and had a great time watching the film. Granted, its no District 9 but it is a great film to watch anyhow. Go check it out."

","Like bad action movies of the past with a big budget but no brain, (Can you say Reloaded? Can you say Revolutions? Can you now say Man of Steel?) This movie pretends to be smart but ultimately there was no thought put into it on any level other then how to make an overall socialist agenda look cool. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacks any real energy. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma. Yes, even the normally charismatic Matt Damon spends the film in pouty face with nothing deep to do. I know the characters are facing horribly depressing events but those monotone performances, interrupted by bursts of anger, are terrible. Since the movie tries to put some sort of emphasis on a theme, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. Just like the Matrix sequels, this movie works as eye candy for a combined 15 minutes of its running time. The rest is crap.<br/><br/>To reiterate, what sinks the movie is that it lacks a sense of wonder and never emotionally connects with us. Sure, the CGI isn't bad but that clearly isn't enough in today's digital day and age. YAWN. Elysium is yet another victim of the spend more and think less way to make movies. You couldn't pay me enough to see it twice."

","One of the things I loved about ELYSIUM was the idea that the main character was a criminal. Yes, you read that correctly. As a matter of fact, one of the things that I absolutely LOVED about this film was the fact that the primary characters were mostly criminals, trying to etch out a life in a less-than-satisfactory world.<br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as Max, a nice enough guy who is obviously trying to put his life back together now that he's tasted the punishment of his criminal days. Alice Braga plays his love interest, back in the days when love and friendship were like gold to us, back in the days of our childhood.<br/><br/>Funny how bonds like that never really improve. Indeed, it is like STAND BY ME said, ""I never had friends like I did when I was twelve. God, does anyone?"" <br/><br/>No. We don't.<br/><br/>Max, who's trying to play by the rules, is abused by his boss, resulting in his aforementioned death in a matter of five days. With nothing to lose, his only chance is to reach Elysium, the hovering station of prosperity and economic elitism that has decided to separate itself from the problems of Earth (believable because the upper one percent truly do believe that the rest of us are just scum, as they are portrayed in the movie. I think that's why the movie suffers in the ratings department, but more on that later).<br/><br/>Sharito Copley plays the heavy here, Kruger, and does it masterfully, as he plays both sides like a true mercenary, caring only about his immediate pleasures and his profit as he goes about his business raping women and slaughtering people.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster does not phone it in as Delacourt, but I do have to wonder why they insisted on having her force an accent here, when it was painfully obvious how much trouble she was having with it. Would anyone really have cared if she just talked normally? Did it have a purpose in the overall plot? I don't think it did.<br/><br/>People argue one way or the other about the plot, but the one thing that sticks in my mind is the overall negativity regarding the CLASS of people represented here. I honestly believe, after what I have read, that there are two things that hurt the reviews of this movie: One being the fact that it is the follow-up to the obviously superior DISTRICT 9, and two, the terrible bias toward a selection of characters that society of today believe they have some right to look down upon.<br/><br/>You read that correctly. Reading people's reactions to this movie, I have to say it has revealed some very disturbing and even alarming patterns with regard to prejudice in our culture. Prejudice, of course, is judging a person without knowing them. On the Earth presented to us in ELYSIUM, criminal behavior is, in my opinion, understandable. Robotic policemen and computer-programmed parole officers raise our already pointlessly labeled ""correctional facilities"" to a whole new level, where the idea of the upper crust carelessly throwing the poor aside is no longer a matter of veiled faces smiling at you while they lie, but a matter of flat-out uncaring as to whether or not the poor know it. It is the equivalent of urinating in your face, if you are a poor person on Earth. Faced with these kind of odds, ANYONE can be a criminal. And for good reason.<br/><br/>Even when Max TRIES to play along with society, DESPITE the fact that it is terrible and unfair in every aspect, he has no rewards to reap. His death is all but an illustration of what he and his fellow inhabitants of Earth have become: Roaches, waiting to be eradicated.<br/><br/>Unable to choose our origins, unable to choose your place in the world, and faced with the life of the Earthlings presented in this film, criminal behavior would almost seem NECESSARY, just to try and stay alive.<br/><br/>One of the things that constantly comes up in a lot of movies is the positive reward for breaking the rules. Batman does it constantly, assaulting criminals and getting away with it on a regular basis. He breaks into buildings, he raids computers. One of the ONLY things I liked about BATMAN V SUPERMAN was the statement that ""Alfred, we've always been criminals"".<br/><br/>There are so many movies where breaking the rules results in positive change. In WORKING GIRL, the only way Tess (Melanie Griffith) can get ahead is to cheat her way into a business deal by committing fraud. Andy Duphresne (Tim Robbins) is only able to find and enjoy his freedom after stealing the warden's money in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. In THE DARK KNIGHT, the only way to find the Joker is to invade the privacy of everyone in Gotham. How many of those screens had people having sex in them, while Lucius was trying to pinpoint the Joker? <br/><br/>Cast your judgment aside, and try to accept all human beings as equal in their abilities and their desire for survival. Do that, and you might enjoy ELYSIUM as much as I did."
"cdjh-81125","8","3","5","1 July 2016"," A Very Underrated Movie With A Few Story Flaws
","Say what you want about Neil Blomkamp but you can't help but admire the passion he puts into his movies it's so great to see a writer and director making original Sci-Fi movies today and I really enjoyed Elysium and thought that it was extremely underrated. I loved the world that set up to feels real as other than some of the space travel aspects they keep thing plausible and explainable by science. The special effects in this movie are some of the best I've ever seen to the point where they feel so real and part of the natural environment. Neil Blomkamp has been controversial as a writer but you can't help but praise this mans skill behind the camera because he directs this movie beautifully. The performances are also terrific in this movie especially Matt Damon and Shartlo Copley the reason Matt Damon is so good in this movie is because he's very grounded in this movie he gives a very venerable and angry performance and because of this like the world Blomkamp created it feels real. But by far my favourite performance in this movie is what that I legitimately felt deserved an Academy Award nomination, Shartlo Copley he was so good here his characters is so vile and disgusting but you can't help but just want to see him back on screen and Copley plays his characters flaws by not holding anything back creating a terrifying and unpredictable performance. However while I do think Elysium is underrated I still have to admit it has some flaws for one Jodie Foster is pretty bad in this movie her performance just doesn't feel real like everything else and her ridiculous accent just didn't work and was extremely Annoying. Another issues had was with the Frey character she just didn't add anything to this movie and like Foster was very annoying. The set up for the world was far to brief and vague I would have like people to have seen a more detailed back story as it would have added to the plot and maybe made the conflict even better than it already was. Elysium gets way to much hate seeing as people are still crying out for original movies this was one of my favourite movies of 2013 and I really hope Blomkamp keeps making movies while taking on some of the criticisms from this movie and Chappie. 87%-A-"
"guisreis","9","3","5","19 February 2015"," The future of capitalism
","This is an extremely interesting sci-fi movie which discusses economics and society deeply. Basically, it simulates the future of capitalist production system. In a society so dependent on electronics, with robots, droids and cyborgs, plants full of blue collars still exist (and not an increase of financialization as we could expect), with workers working in the worst conditions possible, in a labor Darwinism. As there is a great unemployment, workers accept very bad jobs. Businessmen look for profit caring nothing about workers' rights. There is a deep split in society in two classes (well, Karl Marx could agree with much of what is shown in the film), with the richest living comfortably outside the Earth, in an artificial satellite called Elysium (full of beautiful gardens and gorgeous houses), and the others surviving in poor conditions: human rights abuse, garbage, lack of health-care (what is extremely developed for high class in the space), crime, degraded areas, pollution... Not surprisingly, Latin people are concentrated in the lowest economic strata in this futuristic Los Angeles, speaking a mix of Spanish and English. The state is focused on keeping that elite privileges in Elysium, keeping the poor outside by means which remind us a lot about the immigration control in USA/Mexico borders. Lobbyists are inside the State in order to cooperate with private interests, and private firms may cooperate with a coup d'Etat if it is economically interesting for them. Unfortunately, the film does not keep the same level throughout its length, as it gets too melodramatic and focused in chases and fights, but it is nice until its end. All the actors did a good job and it is hard to choose someone to highlight."
"alindsay-al","9","3","5","11 June 2014"," An exciting sci-fi that blew me away
","Before watching this film I had heard mixed reviews about this film and I am truly in the camp of those that love this film and see it as a great new sci-fi film. The story starts with the poor on the destroyed Earth where the rich people are in heaven in space on Elysium and due to unforeseen circumstances Matt Damon's character Max must invade Elysium to survive. Now Matt Damon's performance is really good and he is a charismatic and tragic character throughout this whole story. The supporting characters are really good too Jodie Foster plays the head of security on Elysium and she plays her evil woman role well and it seems to have been natural. The villain mercenary Kruger played by Sharlto Copley is the best performance as he does his job very well, his accent is unique and he is truly menacing. The story is good and it gives a reason for everything to occur and it gives this whole circumstance a logical reason for it to happen. The script is average and doesn't really stand out as one of the huge strengths of the film but it also isn't a huge negative. The style is the best part of this film as the Elysium reminds me of the citadel in Mass Effect and it just looks cool and with the tech and droids it reminded me of Star Wars which is a huge positive and Earth stands out as a complete contrast. This film also looks at social issues in our lives in this futuristic lifestyle. unfortunately there is quite a bit of shaky cam which I cannot stand and some of the information is loaded in a small amount of time. But overall this is a fantastic film with a lot of positives."

","One night I was so bored. Found a movie listed with my On Demand movies for free. Wasn't at all sure about it but it turned out to be a really good movie. Matt Damon was great and I am not even a real fan of his, but he did an awesome job in the role of Max.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster plays a heartless bitch from hell. Totally cold and uncaring with no compassion for the earthlings whatsoever. They were basically bugs to her. She was very convincing in the role as well, but I would expect that from her.<br/><br/>The movie kept me enthralled from the start to the end. Lots of action, and what Max has to go through is what really keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that he sacrifices himself at the end to save all of his people on earth. But by doing that the critical data he was trying so hard to get into the system is put there by Spider and so saves the people of earth. Even so with the main character dying, the movie was great and well worth watching.<br/><br/>The other characters such as Frey played by Alice Braga, Julio played by Diego Luna, Spider played by Wagner Moura and John Carlyle played by William Fichtner were equally good.<br/><br/>Honorable mention goes to the crazed hit-man, Kruger played by Sharlto Copley. He was somebody I wanted to see destroyed only he was SO difficult to do just that! <br/><br/>All in all a good movie and I would recommend this to people who love action SciFi movies."

The special effects are great, and Jodie Foster just gives an amazingly believable heartless bureaucrat performance. I found that I Enjoyed the movie as a decent sci-fi/action movie, a great choice for Friday, or Saturday night with your favourite snacks.

","I can't believe the number of ridiculous reviewers here who have given this 1 out of 10. That is unbelievably unfair and is actually the main reason why I didn't go to watch it in the cinema. Boy did I miss out as a consequence.<br/><br/>This film is not pretending to be high art and if you go to a see a main stream futuristic science fiction film you should expect all sorts of ludicrous futuristic inconsistencies to propel the story along. This is true of almost every equivalent I can think of.<br/><br/>If you think about these things too hard it will spoil your enjoyment and any other equivalent film. However by dwelling on these obvious failings people are missing the point. It does a great job of immersing you in a world and making you really care about the main protagonists and their fate. Add this to beautiful cinematography, sound and superb special effects which are a real treat and way up there in my opinion.<br/><br/>Yes it does have flaws but that doesn't prevent it from being top class entertainment that I would highly recommend.

","*** POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT *** <br/><br/>Visually, this movie came off as almost believable. The CGI was not too over-the-top. The story was not bad either, though many aspects of it looked like other movies (i.e. District 9).<br/><br/>It really feel apart for me in the last 30 minutes or so. Max gets into the lab, albeit by force. Then he escapes. For the next half an hour, he is running through hallways, rooms, corridors, elevators, etc. Not one single person any where, except for the mercenaries. Really? Was the fair in town and everyone was at the cotton candy vendor?<br/><br/>Then, this facility has incredibly high tech equipment, yet Spider's ship lands and no one notices? No cops, guards, droids? Oh yeah, I forgot, everyone was at the fair.

","Not much to say about Elysium. If you watch the trailer, you'll be expecting a decent and entertaining sci-fi movie, and Elysium is just that. Nothing new in terms of story,(although the first 30-40 min let you think you're in for something more), good special effects, good acting(considering the genre), overall good movie. I would like to praise Sharlto Copley on his performance on this one, a very pleasant surprise portraying the villain. To sum up, Elysium isn't a mind blowing movie, but its very entertaining, you will get your money's worth on this one if you go to the movies to be entertained, if not, Elysium is still preety decent, but don't expect big twists and turns, its all very predictable. Still, a solid 7/10."

","ELYSIUM : IT'S the promise of a new environment for the future people living in Los Angeles. Max is a special kid from Earth , Frey is his friend. Frey is working in hospital, and she has a sick daughter called Matilda. They are from the hills of Los Angeles. Elysium is a artificial place up in the sky, where only chosen people can travel. Up there, people live in big houses with lots of spare time and ability to cure every disease. Everything is glowing with green gardens and clean air, while down in Los Angeles, Droids are bullying people. Everything is sweaty and brownish. People are poor and live in bad conditions. Max is working for a company which is building droids. The company top person in charge : Caryle has this secret with Elysium person in charge He has hard time working , one day by accident he enters the production line restricted for humans , and the heavy machines detects organic tissue. He gets exposed to high level of radiation which is bad for human health. After the accident he deals with underground old friend :Spider;to become one droid. He gets surgery by some bad looking guys, he has something installed in his head, and a small device inside his headconnected up is neck. Matrix ? He also wears some kind of arm. Artificial hands and chest.<br/><br/>In the meantime, up in Elysium , government try to control the security for their private atmosphere and they block people who try to immigrate up there without visa . They just explode 2 spaceships with people inside with the help of their agent from Los Angeles Kruger. Kruger send the bombs from the land and hit the exile ships. Two spaceship explodes while one spaceship landed in Elsyium . Droids detect all humans which are not citizen of Elysium and they kill people. Only one small girl is saved from this brutal , robot attacks. Her mother using the device inside a citizens home, delete the data which knows her as human from earth.She saved her daughter from the attacks of Droids. Droids are under command of Elysium government.<br/><br/>Down there Max is angry , he don't want to die, he prepare a sabotage plan to Caryle and steal his data from his brain. Kruger is set to block this operation while Max trying really hard to accomplish the promise he made. Elysium is monitoring all the events from up there with information piles from stations. The data is really important. With the very important data from his ex boss' brain he can travel to Elysıum and change the rules because it's a program boot service which can rewrite all the rules and change all the admins. Piece of law on computer.<br/><br/>Dansdeka adds; Film has really good cast, visual effects. Color correction and lights are volumed and exhibits nice tones of scenes. That is really nice. Lots of laser effects- lots of aerial scenes, artificial droids, pick ups and aircrafts. Action- is up there. Sound editing is very good. It's a distopic future science fiction ; i recommend for the action film lovers"
"mjterr03","9","3","5","9 September 2013"," One of the More Enjoyable Movies of 2013
","Elysium stars Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley. It comes from the creator of District 9, Neil Blomkamp. Because of this many people have been comparing this movie to District 9, which I understand but don't agree with.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved this movie. I felt that Damon was very good and Copley was excellent as Kruger. He was the highlight of the film for me. He has some pretty memorable quotes. The action is filmed really well, with some mind-blowing visuals. The world itself is engrossing and developed.<br/><br/>Now the movie does has problems. I felt that Jodie Foster could have been played just as well by many other people. Also, I feel that some characters were just there to propel the story along. But I really liked the story. It reminded me of District 9 a little, which is never a bad thing.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this movie. There was never a dull moment, the story was intense, there were great visuals, and some really cool characters.

"Scene13","8","3","5","3 September 2013"," Blomkamp is definitely one to watch!!!
","Elysium is the the second film from the director (Neill Blomkamp) who debuted with District 9. District 9 set the bar very high for Blomkamp and he must have been nervous about the reception his next film would get. but he should've have been as it was great! Exciting, fast paced and visually stunning, Elysium did not disappoint!. Elysium... reeked of what maybe Blomkamps style we will have to see after he has released a few more films. Blomkamp will definitely be on my watch list for the future.<br/><br/>4 likes and 3 dislikes are described below:<br/><br/>Likes <br/><br/>1) Visuals and Special Effects: Probably the best part of this film was the stunning visuals, as expected they were absolutely spot on. No expense spared. <br/><br/>2) Characters and Acting: The acting though out this film was strong, and the characters i felt were strong. Matt Damon did Matt Damon and it worked well for his character, Max. I also enjoyed the flashback style character development providing depth the Damons character. Jodie Foster played a very believable strong female character, Delacourt, the only let down was her Accent but that will be discussed below. It worth noting that Sharlto Copley (who played Wikus in D9) played Kruger in this film, his performance was also strong. Even though Damon and Foster did have good performances I wish that Blomkamp was left to cast little known cast like he did with D9 instead of being forced to cast a-list celebs. I felt this made the film lose some charm.<br/><br/>3)Futuristic Inventions: Bar the weapons (discussed below) I found the futuristic inventions throughout this film realistic, interesting and innovative. From the Re-atomisers which can heal those who a privileged, the exoskeletons and the robot-police/ social worker. We must not forget Elysium itself. It was stunning. <br/><br/>4) Future Earth/Future Elysium: I found future Earth and future Elysium very believable concepts. It should be noticed that we don't see the whole of earth just Southern America and therefore the fact that people speak a mixture of English and a Latin American language maybe Mexican or Portuguese this makes sense as does the slum type housing. Future Elysium is just as believable. Some reviewers have commented ""Saying why does everyone speak French?"" my reply to this is simple...""They don't"", (Spoiler) Jodie Foster's character is called Delacourt and is French (even with here rubbish accent) and she has a family party (which she makes us aware of) and it would be understandable for her family and therefore the party goers speak French but this was not a reflection of Elysium as a whole. Elysium will have many have representatives from many nationalities all the most wealthy families. (Spoiler End)<br/><br/>Dislikes <br/><br/>1)Cinematography within Fight Scenes: This was awful. I can't believe that any film director would allow the camera to be so shaky. Nor do I Understand why Blomkamp didn't look back over the footage and think...""sh*t I can't tell who is throwing what punch this isn't working and try again"". It seems to get worse as the film goes on and one very pivotal fight towards the end of the film is almost impossible to follow... this was incredibly disappointing and highly unnecessary. <br/><br/>2)Futuristic Weaponry: Every weapon exploded. Every future weapon had been designed to ensure bodies exploded? Even on a big floating spaceship...explosions...didn't seem safe to me or realistic. I think this choice of explosive only weaponry was only put in place to allow for the use of some very good and well put together special effects. The special Effects were really good as previously described. I felt that it was unrealistic that weaponry would become more messy and less ""accurate"" when surely the ideal weapon would be something that could be more precise than a explosion.<br/><br/>3)Jodie Foster's Accent!: Jodie Foster's accent was horrific it was supposed to be French, it was one minute and it wasn't the next. After the first so few minutes she seemed to throw it out of the window. On the plus side it did lighten up the mood a little providing a comedy aspect to the film.<br/><br/>On a final note. Some reviewers have pointed out this film is carrying a message. I didn't feel that this was anything to do with the American/Mexican immigration which so many early reviews were ranting about. But as Blomkamp has stated in interviews himself it was about the global wealth discrepancy of today for which he is using America and Mexico as an example, although this is not the only example worldwide. This film is clever it makes us think, it makes us think about this wealth discrepancy and makes us feel that it is in the future, or fictional... but when you sit and think about it you see that it is actually here and now. I welcome the fact that this film has message and am glad that it is attempting to open the viewer's eyes to the world and asking those tough questions.<br/><br/>In conclusion this film was fantastic, its visually stunning and it has a strong storyline which although not ground-breakingly original it is enjoyable and interesting. The plot wasn't very original but Blomkamp made up for it with his original look at the future of the world, the inventions and society. Well Done Mr Blomkamp! Watch it see what you think!!"
"quicksticks","8","3","5","3 September 2013"," Blomkamp's futuristic gamble pays off
","AN original science-fiction film these days is a gamble, it's either going to be a hit or a miss. Luckily for Elysium, the man behind one of the hardest hitting sci-fi films for the last few years isn't Michael Bay. It has been about four years since South African-born Neill Blomkamp totally shocked international and local audiences when he released District 9 in 2009. This time he is back in the director's seat and is well equipped with Hollywood A-listers Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. In the year 2154, Earth is over populated and basically turned into a massive slum. The rich leave to a man-made space station known as Elysium where everybody lives in perfect harmony with lovely gardens and suburban homes, and the health care is beyond excellent. Foster plays the Secretary of Defence on Elysium who is challenged by her superiors on her actions trying to protect the well­being of the utopian society. Damon plays Max, a criminal with a rocky past, who now leads a mundane life as a worker in a robot manufacturing plant on Earth. When he is exposed to a deadly quantity of radiation, he has no choice but to try and find a way to Elysium, but it's not that easy for our leading man. He seeks the help of one his acquaintances from the criminal underworld to help him get to Elysium, and it is at this point the film really kicks up a gear. From the onset, it is clear that the film is far more than just an average popcorn sci-fi watch. It is obvious – but I'm going to say it anyway – this film is a social narrative on issues relating to the rich and the poor, class differences and the health system. And these issues are common to all societies, whether you live in Paris or Parys. As far as science fiction goes, the film delivers, with a worthy plot, believable character development, outstanding visuals and a decent amount of action. Blomkamp comes from a visual effects background and it is evident that he didn't hold with the elegant use of CGI, far better than the ""summer"" blockbuster we saw a few months ago. Although the film is primarily driven through dialogue and storytelling, there are a few well executed action sequences with some entertaining gun battles and futuristic weaponry that will put a smile on your face. There are, however, a few downs to Elysium. It suffers from some of the classic Hollywood pitfalls — aspects of the story are just too convenient for our lead character and for the progression of the story. (It won't be too hard for audiences to predict how the film unfolds). Foster's character plays an important role in the film, but it doesn't seem like she put a whole lot of effort into it. Without a shadow of a doubt, the absolute highlight of Elysium is Sharlto Copley. Just when we thought we saw one of the best villains earlier this year in JJ Abrams's version of Khan, Copley gives Benedict Cumberbatch a run for his money playing a menacing South African mercenary hired as a sleeper agent by the higher-ups of Elysium."

","While this doesn't have the power and impact of District 9, there's no denying that Blomkamp is a sci fi master.<br/><br/>With Elysium, he has created a dystopian future that Philip K Dick would be proud of.<br/><br/>The set design and CGI work brilliantly together to create a beautifully realised world that is all at once recognisable and at the same time clearly of the future.<br/><br/>This is a romp of a movie with great action sequences, believable characters and an in your face social subtext that although not fully explored, offers enough bite to create an emotional bond with the characters. <br/><br/>Yes it was all a bit obvious and yes you've seen it loads of times before but it was so well done that I was having too much fun to care.<br/><br/>Like District 9, this is a nice piece of body shock that while grim, never becomes pornographic.<br/><br/>Matt Damon does a fine job. In fact, the acting on the whole was good. Sharlto is brilliant as ever with his absurd and hilarious marine. Only Foster feels like a fish out of water. She would have done better to have reprised her role from the Inside Man.<br/><br/>All in all this was a very enjoyable summer blockbuster with a good story, decent characters and great CGI."

","Great Sci-fi movie. Elysium displayed a beautiful rendition and variety of CG and effects, as well as great acting by the actors. Some scenes may be disturbing, while these scenes serve a greater purpose. Lots of twists and turns made the movie less boring. Another thing that was done well was the character development. In the movie we see protagonists such as Max (Matt Damon) and antagonists such as Delacourt (Jodie Foster), as well as in- the-between characters like Spider Julio, etc. These ""middle"" characters did not necessarily have the leading roles, yet their personalities make each unique and important towards the development of the story.<br/><br/>Again, this movie deserved a 8, but since I am a sci-fi fanboy, I'll give it a 9/10.

","I went for an evening out at the cinema had previously seen the trailers for Elysium and this was a film I had been interested in seeing as I have been a huge fan of the Bourne Trilogy and some of Matt Damon's other work.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with the film for a number of reasons. Firstly, I would like to start with the theme as a whole. I thought that it was relatively new and original, however I would admit to not watching that many futuristic Sci-Fis before. I thought that the whole theme tied in perfectly with the unpredictability of the story. Personally, I think that the originality was the film's strong point. It was very hard to figure out what was going to happen next as something else normally happened in my case, when I tried guessing. Additionally, I was very impressed with the graphics, I personally have never seen graphics that looks as good as that, I thought that the Elysium itself look almost real. Finally there were many good action scenes in there that were both different and gory at times and they used both the combination of Brains and Brawn.<br/><br/>Overall I thought that the film was pretty decent and would recommend watching it, however, it's unlikely to be your choice for Film of the Year."
"ScottSF","9","3","5","1 September 2013"," Finally some Science fiction with a good story!
","After the colossal disappointment of Star Trek Into Darkness, it's good to see some people still care about Science Fiction in film. The story, acting and action are all solid. Only issue is shaky cam. I know why it was used but it can really go away from film all together. Still the best story of the summer action movies. <br/><br/>For pure entertainment value it was on par with Iron Man 3 and Pacific Rim which had stories that weren't as good but had charm that kept me entertained.<br/><br/>Also, for those of you who like your military action with lots of gore then it's a big win. If you are squeamish during films like Saving Private Ryan then you may want to steer clear."

","The movie looked much better than I expected. The set design and special effects were for the most part well executed. The main villain Kruger was unintentionally? funny. <br/><br/>By the way he doesn't have a speech impediment that is a South African accent but it was definitely played up on the parody scale. What I liked about the movie is it seemed to be paying homage to the first terminator film in very many ways and that was a plus.<br/><br/>It looks like in the end the team wanting to make it an action movie won out and I suspect that the fights etc. are better than average but I don't watch action movies and so I can't make that comparison. <br/><br/>I find all of the shooting and grunting tedious and pointless would have liked the story to have more heft.<br/><br/>There were a few moments when the film struggled to make a more emotional connection and I would have liked more of those.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster really just has a cameo role that could have been played by any sleep walker. I imagine the script notes said ""act wooden"" and that would have covered all of her scenes. <br/><br/>As for the idea that they could simply reboot the space station (core code) and change the ""law"" it is so simple anyone can understand that but at the same time it is profoundly stupid for anyone who knows about coding.<br/><br/>Still if you like action movies this is worth seeing and for the bad guy (Kruger) hamming it up furiously he was so bad he was good."

","Unlike many of the harsh comments and reviews I read about this movie, I found the movie quite entertaining and relevant.<br/><br/>I watched this movie last day in Sydney. I have to admit that I went to theater to see a District 9 kind of movie and came quite satisfied with what Elysium had offered. District 9, in its essence, painted the apartheid in Africa with a extraterrestrial brush. Elysium painted the refugee and immigration ugliness with the future and did a good job in doing so. What would happen if the entire earth becomes a refugee camp!.<br/><br/>The computer graphics were pretty impressive. Elysium (the city) was a piece of art and the space ships looked cool and realistic. Acting was generally above par and captivating at times. Matt looked very believable and he had that balance in acting without overdoing. Blomkamp, I believe, fitted the whole thing together marvelously as he has done with the District 9. However, I really dint like Fosters acting. She looked a bit misplaced and found struggling to express at many places. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth of the money and I would recommend it to anyone as I did to my friends."

Now people from Earth (illegal border crossers) want to go to Elysium (USA) to get health care. There's a 20 sob story in the beginning that made me almost walk out of the movie. I am tired of rich liberal Hollywood trying ram immigration down our throats. I gave it a 2 out of 10 because of the special effects which were very good.

"cguldal","4","4","8","3 December 2013"," Not worth the time
","I saw the big Hollywood bucks, and the two big stars, and I thought that this surely would disappoint. And I was, unfortunately, right. Just for action and CGI, this is an OK film to watch. Otherwise, not worth the time. <br/><br/>Unlike others, I thought Jodi Foster did the maniacal bitch very well, especially astutely playing a French upper class careerist who speaks fluent, but slightly accented English. The accent, the mannerisms, and the facial gestures are perfectly fine tuned. Matt Damon was OK, nothing special. Some of the supporting roles were well played. I liked that the people who were supposed to speak Spanish actually spoke proper Latin American Spanish (not some Americans pretending to speak Spanish in horrible accents; Matt Damon did this well, though you would think that if someone grew up with Spanish-speaking nuns, he would have a better accent).<br/><br/>The plot and the dialog were severely lacking. It seemed like the first draft of a film, except for the special effects. It seemed like someone in high school had a ""cool"" idea, where the rich people would live in the sky, and the poor people would suffer in an overcrowded Earth below. Why bother with space; this already exists here on Earth. Rich people have access to medical services way beyond anyone poor can ever hope for. They can choose to bathe in bubbly and travel in jets. How is the space thing make this any different? Most of the time, there is a air of profoundness in the film that is misplaced or completely lacking. <br/><br/>And a word about med-bays that detect in one second the medical problem and fix it in, oh, ten seconds... This will NEVER happen. OK, it will happen, when all laws of physics change. Until then, no. So it is good to dream, but maybe a bit too ridiculous. And ridiculous would be OK, if this was the only thing wrong with the film, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>So in the end, what they did is supposed to solve the world's problems? So now the human population that Earth cannot handle will not only continue to live on Earth, but will do so in perfect health, breeding freely and healthily, to... increase their population further? How is this going to help anyone? Overpopulation is supposed to cause disease and hunger and death. These are not problems in that context, they are solutions from Nature's point of view (of course, one hopes that we prevent such an outcome, but then again, humans are never very good at prevention).<br/><br/>In sum, barring the action scenes, not much that makes sense here. It is not clear what the film is doing or saying, though it is clear that it is trying to say or do something."

","Hailed as this Summer's break-though extravaganza may not be saying much in a season of big budget flops. ELYSIUM has received a fair amount of critical acclaim and, yes, it has better acting, plot, writing, etc., than many films of it's ilk. But in the end ELYSIUM is just another post-apocalyptic survival movie. Matt Damon, presently risking over-exposure, does his usual fine role. Jody Foster is perfectly cast and wonderful in her role but her demise is premature and extremely disappointing. The ""baddie"" character is ill defined and, frankly, unnecessary. The fight scenes are chock full of the now-overused ""jerky camera"" technique. But again, I was led to believe there was something ""special"" about ELYSIUM but in the end we've the same populist tripe: Poor is good and virtuous, Wealth is evil and a conspiracy NOTE: Diego Luna is just a treat and would have been better cast in the chief of the resistance role rather than killed off so early."

","I enjoyed this movie, always love watching Jodie and Matt, but...the hand-held camera thing has really gotten tiresome.

I thought my head would explode trying to keep up with the jerky camera work in Elysium. I know this is supposed to add ""drama"", sort of like the incessant music in current films, but it seem like a cheap way of covering up a lot of flaws in plot, continuity, production...whatever. A good action film, but not what I had hoped.<br/><br/>It seems that the real art of cinematography is a thing of the past. And if loud and endless music is needed to bulk up a movie, then the screen writing or directing is lacking something. A well choreographed action sequence, and a little bit of restraint can go a long way. I guess it depends what one is selling."
"Likes_Ninjas90","6","4","8","15 August 2013"," Built on a promising setup that held me in anticipation
","Elysium is built on a promising setup that held me in anticipation, only to fizzle out into a series of generic setpieces that downplays the smarts of this sometimes exciting science-fiction thriller. It's a good idea still waiting to happen but ultimately a disappointment bred from a weak screenplay, questionable casting and a lack of ambition.<br/><br/>District 9 director Neill Blomkamp helms the film. He was born in Johannesburg, South African in 1979 during apartheid. After making a number of short films about South Africa that featured spectacular use of CGI drawn robots, he was set to direct a film version of Halo, one of the most popular video games of all time, with Peter Jackson as a producer, but the deal fell through.<br/><br/>It is hard to read what the filmmaker is trying to achieve now. His mother has said that her profession of running an interpretation company for the United Nations has influenced her son. Yet the thirty-three year old director believes that films are not impactful. ""Anybody who thinks they can change the world by making films is sorely mistaken,"" he commented.<br/><br/>He's wrong. Cinema's influence is limited by how ambitious and how unnerving a filmmaker is willing to be. Films can teach and educate people about the world and different cultures. Mainstream blockbusters choose not to aim that high. Film critic Roger Ebert also argued films can either be a positive or negative influence on society.<br/><br/>District 9's limitations were forged by a partition between form and content. It visualised a compelling dystopian world where aliens were the hunted, a discriminated life form. Yet the film resolved itself through action rather than thematically supporting the world.<br/><br/>The same is true of Elysium. The visual details are outstanding. The film opens over the city of Los Angeles in the year 2154 in what could be the slums of South Africa. Overhead helicopter shots photograph the dusty wasteland - a result of overpopulation we're told. Blomkamp's hand-held cameras shakily take us around the slums and gang filled streets that are patrolled by robot police. The atmosphere, with Mexico passing for LA, is thrilling.<br/><br/>Juxtaposing the slums is the world of Elysium, a space station that has been constructed for the wealthiest people from Earth. There are mansions and gardens and special medical bays that can instantly heal people. The colours are more sanitised but also harder and colder. The soundtrack plays Bach's Cello Suite No. 1 because what else would the wealthy listen to? Refugees arrive by spaceships, seeking to use the medical equipment if they aren't mercilessly shot down first.<br/><br/>The film isn't subtle about its socio-political concerns, but the two contrasting worlds are stunningly visualised and the thematic outset of immigration and segregation has rarely felt timelier. The first half of the narrative is promising too. Matt Damon plays Max, who was raised by nuns but grew up to become a thieving convict. He now works in a factory run by John Carlyle (William Fichtner).<br/><br/>One of Max's dreams as a child was to make it to Elysium but this seems unlikely because bureaucrats like Delacourt (Jodie Foster) are intent on keeping the immigrants out. She uses a crazed mercenary on Earth named Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to help shoot any immigration aircraft down.<br/><br/>After having his arm broken by a robot, Baldy reunites with his childhood friend Frey (Alice Braga), who is a working nurse and has a sick daughter who she'd like to take to Elysium. Later, Max suffers a radioactive accident in the factory he learns he only has five days to live. Needing to find a med bay to heal, he crawls towards a local crime boss for help and is offered him a job: a heist to steal some important information off Carlyle's very person.<br/><br/>The heist is the climatic high-point of the movie, an exciting, viscerally staged standoff against a number of robotic enforcers. From this point onwards the film struggles to sustain an engaging through line and doesn't fulfill the initial promise of the themes. The second half of the film is disposable, reduced to running and hiding, predictable corridor shootouts and a dully conventional boss fight, capped off by a laughably simplistic ending.<br/><br/>Three or four threads converge into a soulless action structure and the casting and the characters are treated with irrelevancy. Blomkamp wanted South African rapper Ninja and then Eminem for the part of Max. They would have been grittier and suitably uglier leads. Damon is a fine character actor but he's miscast playing a tattooed ex-con. After having armour surgically fused onto his body you'd think Max would have a greater reaction than saying: ""What did you do to me?"" Jodi Foster plays her character as suitably merciless and uptight but the role lacks additional shades. Copley is appropriately scruffy and intimidating as the psychotic and sometimes frightening mercenary.<br/><br/>In Elysium corporations have built an amazing world, but withheld it from those who dream bigger and could truly use its amazing technology. If the impoverished were to live on Elysium and have access to this healthcare technology would it be reduced to another wasteland? Films are able to change the world and influence people when they test our beliefs and create indistinguishable lines between the right and wrong answers. Wealth does not simply segregate class - it's a limitation of the imagination too."

","I couldn't decide whether to give this a 6 or a 7. Either way this film has its strengths and has its weaknesses. It all just eventually cancels out to the point where there really isn't a score to rank it. It isn't a good movie, but at the end it isn't a very bad one either. Neil Blonkamp is probably one of my top ten contemporary directors. Props for him for finding an original, solid story to satisfy moviegoers. However, it can only satisfy. The characters are a little flat, except for Sharlto Copley's (which I will get to later), it gets to the point where some of these are screaming to be noticed before they're thrown to the side. I liked the three leads though, Matt Damon gives a strong performance as always. I was pretty surprised where Jodie Foster went, this is definitely a change of pace for her, and I really don't know what to think. Sharlto Copley was the stand out for this film. He hasn't been in much since his flop The A-Team, but this guy has range. I'm excited to hear that he's doing some more stuff this year. The effects I thought were outstanding. I know that its pretty much expected these days that effects have to be great in films, but in my opinion these are probably one of the best ones this year. The film has its weak spots, but Blomkamp does give it his all directing-wise. But in the end, it's really your choice if it's worth seeing"
"treregoblue","8","4","8","11 August 2013"," Visually Stunning, Great Acting, but...
","I'd give it a 7.5/10 honestly, the visual and special effects in this film are remarkable and should be rightly appreciated. The acting from Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, and Sharlto Copley, William Fichtner, and the rest of the cast are electrifying. However, I felt that some of the characters were too short lived and there was a lack of their development, specifically Jodie Foster's role. The film kind if delved right into their mantra without really any sort of background or progression of the characters, this is where I felt some of a misconnection with the film and its characters and is the basis for my 7.5 rating. Nonetheless, the film is very action packed and suspenseful guided by great special effects, specifically the weaponry and gadgets induced in the film were very cool. Damon and Copley definitely gave great performances, I think Copley stole the show though with his performance in portraying the psychotic military operative stuck on earth. All in all it is a great movie to go see in theaters, as a huge fan of District 9, Elysium is in the vicinity of the greatness D9 gave, but still needed more in the end."
"atlasmb","7","4","8","9 August 2013"," Worth Seeing but Less Than It Could Be
","I saw Elysium in IMAX, so my review is only for that format.<br/><br/>In a future where Earth is like the slums of Mexico City, the richest few have escaped to live on a satellite world. Our protagonist, played by Matt Damon is just another nobody in the overpopulated Los Angeles of 2154. The story is about his character trying to get to Elysium against seemingly impossible odds.<br/><br/>Elysium is cut from the same cloth as District 9 (also directed by Neill Blomkomp). Both of them owe their gritty, industrial tone to Blade Runner.<br/><br/>The idyllic world of Elysium is visually wonderful. I wish more of the action was set on that world. Perhaps viewers in 1939 felt the same way about the world of Oz, feeling that the bare glimpses of the Emerald City did not satisfy.<br/><br/>The primary antagonist to Damon's character is Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. Like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, she is ""civilization's"" line of defense against the enemies beyond the walls. She plays her part with an iconic stoniness that some might find annoying. I thought her acting was fine.<br/><br/>One thing that I found distracting to the point of annoyance was the overuse of hand-held cameras. I want to be thinking about the action, not the cameras.<br/><br/>The story itself is filled with action. That may be enough. But I wish I had cared more about the quest of our hero. Maybe I didn't because it was overshadowed by the political and social implications of the story. Not that it was preachy, but distracting. Imagine The Wrath of Khan if Captain Kirk were just one of a population of millions, not an individual who is a genius warrior with an unbending will."

This, for me is why it deserves a six star review. Ignoring these blunders however, it's a solid flick. Or rather its enjoyable. Is it a classic? no, far from it. But it's watchable, and ignoring the extremely ham fisted political commentary which you may or may not agree with, it's relatively well done, and gorgeous to look at. <br/><br/>In short: very political, which could please or disgust you, but beyond that it's enjoyable."

","Elysium, a film that I was not at all excited for, but still saw it. Blomkamp is back after the success of one of the best sci-fi films in along time, D9.<br/><br/>So, visually the film is incredible and that's what I think is the films strongest aspect. The vast landscapes of this poverty filled Earth is beautiful, yet so dirty. You can actually believe this is Earth because with a lot of neglect over time, Earth may or may not turn out that way. And then there's Elysium, that I find to be an extremely cheesy Utopian world. I was chuckling every time there were shots of that world and the people in it. Everything too perfect. Yes, I know that's the point, but I just think the way it's executed is really cheesy. The visual effects are perfect and blended extremely well. The CGI looks as real as you can possibly get with CGI. There wasn't a moment when I was questioning whether it's CGI or not. I honestly thought it was all real. The robots are so fascinating because of their colors. The robots are bright colors like red, yellow, orange, which is a contrast to what Earth is. The set and production designers are top of their game with Elysium. My biggest problem with the direction of this film is the shaky-cam. I'm usually a fan of the shaky-cam because it can add a grittiness to the film and most of the times it does in the film, except for the action scenes. Almost every action scene has so much shakiness you get disoriented to what actually going and which character is where. I would have loved smoother and more clarity to the action scene because I want to see what's going and what fight technique each character has. And having a ton of cuts during the fight scene doesn't help either. It's like one shaky tight shot, cut to another and another, then to a medium, then to a wide and back to a million more close ups. Thus being said, that didn't stop me from getting into most of the fight scenes. My favorite fight scene is probably the first one once Max is attached to the exoskeleton machine because you get introduced to the weapons and the strength this machine brings to Max. My least favorite is the final fight scene between Max and Kruger because the way it's shot makes me so disoriented and seems really rushed to get over with. Also, I love the gore. Get ready for some imploding and exploding humans. <br/><br/>The script is by far the weakest aspect of the film and it really turns me off big time. The film starts out pretty good with comparing the situations on Earth and on Elysium to show the social and economic inequality. But we kind of lose all that once the action starts. These issues just back into a corner and stay hidden, so it just turns into the ""good guys"" vs the ""bad guys."" And that's it. Of course you know the character's motives and what not, but I still just found that way over powered by one dimensional characters. There's hardly any character development for except for Max and Frey, which told through flashback, which I fairly enjoyed, but nothing new to storytelling. Finding out about Max's and Frey's relationship/friendship in the past still doesn't get me emotionally attached to the two character. Their relationship and motives seem way too mechanical. No other character has any character development. I think it's really comical that basically everyone on Elysium are rich white people, which are portrayed as evil bigots and then Earth is only filled with people of different race and Matt Damon is apparently the last white person on Earth. The film also takes cheap shots at health-care. Elysium just rudely slaps you in the face with a political agenda about inequality of wealth, health-care, and race. The whole film is also carried by really cheesy dialogue that is quite laughable at times. <br/><br/>I'm just going to start out by saying that I think Jodie Foster is comically dreadful. I remember when she is first on screen and delivers her lines, my girlfriend and I look at each other with confused looks. Foster is way too over dramatic with the way she delivers her lines and facial expressions. She literally pauses after every other word. And what kind of accent or should I ask accents is she speaking with? Her movements are stiff and robotic like. Foster is a bad actress by any means, but holy sh*t, she's unwatchable in this. Matt Damon is decent in the film. He does what he's hired to do and shows some emotion, which is nice, but nothing special. I don't have anything to say about Alice Braga besides, bland. Now, Sharlto Copley has by far the best performance out of everyone, but I still don't like him in the film. Copley disappears into his one dimensional character. His performance is very much a caricature, but that voice, that voice! My best, yet poorly way to describe his voice in the film is like a high pitched Australian Grouch from Sesame Street. I was annoyed from beginning to end. I almost forgot, Diego Luna is my favorite part of the whole film and he only has like 15 minutes of screen time. I think he has the best performance and most likable character. He connection emotionally with me without any character development, weird. Maybe I'm in love with the actor. <br/><br/>I saw Elysium with three other people and we all left the theater joking about how bad it is. At least we got $10 worth of laughs out Elysium, right?"
"jules-125","6","5","11","9 August 2013"," Hollywood, stop with the shaky cam already!
","Enjoyable film. Many moments where you just have to check your brain to make sure that you forgive the plot holes. Damon is great. Kruger is positively unintelligible. Do not understand how some equate this with good acting. I found him very irritating, but not in a good actor way.<br/><br/>The contrast between earth and Elysium is stark but for God's sake, why do directors and cinematographers seem to think that shaky cam = the gritty reality of the main character's angst-y situation? LET THE ACTORS ACT IT! While I held it together this time, the film would be best served with a Dramamine for every moment they're on earth or in a fight scene. I would definitely have ranked it higher if they could have located a freaking tripod on set."
"filipemanuelneto","5","2","3","14 January 2020"," A lot of money, good CGI and effects, good actors, but a simplistic script and lack of emotion are really a problem.
","The problem with films that are overly based on social criticism is that they almost always portray society in a simplistic way: on one hand the poor and marginalized, on the other the rich and powerful. There are no half terms. In such movies, the rich are usually cruel and egocentric, the ruling class. Likewise, the poor end up trying to organize and take away their power and money in the name of a fairer society. Karl Marx would approve of these films.<br/><br/>In fact, things are never that simple, and society, no matter how bad it is, is generally far more heterogeneous than the portrayal of this film. Even so, there are moments when criticism brutally approaches reality. For example, when the guns of Elysium destroy the ships with the people who want to reach it. At that moment, it was hard for me not to think about the ships loaded with illegal immigrants who cross the Mediterranean every month in the worst conditions, looking for an Eldorado they think exists in Europe.<br/><br/>Despite the unappealing simplicity of the plot, the film pays off with good actors doing a relatively satisfactory work. Matt Damon, while not one of my favorites, is quite good in his role. Sharlto Copley is a convincing and rude villain, Alice Braga and Wagner Moura, two good Brazilian actors, do not disappoint but I have doubts about their ability to accompany American colleagues, who have a whole different dramatic school. In any case, they do not disappoint and honor the credits of Brazilian dramaturgy. The worst of this movie, as regards the cast, was the artificial performance of Jodie Foster.<br/><br/>The movie has good special effects, state of the art on a big budget movie like this. However, the pace is quite uneven and unbalanced. But worse than that is the feeling that we are watching a cold movie, unable to emotionally connect us with the story or the characters. It's worth seeing, but it's not that kind of movie that stays in our memory and makes us spend our money on it."

","This film has all the hallmarks of a badly designed film. The plot is thin and the lead actor is not known for having a wide range of emotion in my book, but somehow they pulled it off. Max, after being exposed to a lethal dose of radiation on a planet devoid of resources, fights his way to the only place with the technology to heal him: the floating city of elite members of society, Elysium. The built in time lock of Max's impending death of radiation poisoning does create a sense of tension on top of the main struggles and conflicts. The visuals are very well designed, and the world design is clear: an earth in decay, and a world apart for the elite rich containing eery luxury the world below is forced to go without. Max is not relatable, per se, but he does behave distinctly morally, which ingratiate him with a protagonist focused audience."
"skepticskeptical","5","2","3","14 September 2019"," Dystopic premise; Action flick execution
","I finally got around to watching Elysium because it was on Sky, and I figured that since Matt Damon was in it, it would be good. For years I have depended on Matt Damon to be judicious in his choice of scripts, having seen that he never made a bad film. All that changed with Elysium, sad to say. Effective today, I can no longer say that Matt Damon makes only good films.<br/><br/>Elysium begins on a dystopic premise holding great potential but descends into a middling action flick severely compromised by plot holes and implausibilities. On top of that, there is a plagiarism problem here. Basically everything interesting in this production has already been presented and executed much more skillfully and intelligently in films such as Robocop, Blade Runner, Gattaca, an episode of Black Mirror, and elsewhere.<br/><br/>My distinct impression is that Damon was tapped for this movie because the lead protagonist has somewhat of a Jason Bourne demeanor. Why he accepted the role is unclear (maybe his kids are approaching college age and he needs some cash?). Unfortunately, Elysium is nothing like the brilliant Jason Bourne series and I cannot recommend it. The schmaltzy ending is especially unbearable."

","Easily one of my favourite movies out there; fast, action packed, emotional and badass. No idea why there is so much hate for it, I've re-watched it four times now and it's still as entertaining as when I first saw it. Sure the story isn't great, but it makes a clear message about the world today and how it could easily run into the same problems in future that are illustrated in the movie, and I think that's where it was going with the story line.

There was clearly a lot of care and attention put into this and it immerses you into the world extremely well.<br/><br/>However, the story for me is one that's just fine. It could have explored its ideas and concepts in a lot more detail but overall its paced well enough to keep it mostly engaging.<br/><br/>The characters are also rather bland, except for Sharlto Copley who is hilariously over the top as the villain Kruger and appears to be having a lot of fun in the role.

"bonzo-86534","9","2","3","17 March 2017"," Review of elements of movie
","Elysium is a fantastic movie set in the mid-22nd century where the rich live on a beautiful space station (Elysium) free of illness and war. The poor live on Earth which is overpopulated, disease ridden, and full of oppressive violence. Matt Damon's character Max could only dream of getting to Elysium, then an accident at work has put him in a race against time to cure his terminal diagnosis. The only way to survive longer than 5 days is to get to Elysium and get healed using one of their med-bays.<br/><br/>The major thematic element that is constantly being brought to light are social problems. The contrast of life on Elysium and life on Earth is like night and day. Earth is portrayed as having minimal resources and also being extremely hot and arid. Elysium on the other hand has lush green vegetation, beautiful white homes and happy citizens. Jodie Foster's character Delacourt is always portrayed in white clean-looking outfits as if she is being depicted as extremely wealthy. On the other hand, Max, is always wearing dirty outfits with holes in them. One scene towards the beginning of the movie, Injured and unhealthy citizens are piling into space crafts to attempt to land on Elysium. They attempt to cross the border despite the risk of being shot down in space. Only 2 of the 3 ships lands safely and all the refugees wanted to do was spend 10 seconds in a medical bay to heal themselves. Most of the movie had me wondering why Elysium residents were hoarding the healing technology for themselves instead of sharing with the rest of the human race. Even when Elysium residents are on Earth for various reasons, they talk down on Earthlings and even go as far to remind the Earthlings not to breathe on them.<br/><br/>The director used lighting and color schemes to really compare the difference of living styles in Elysium vs. down on Earth. When shooting scenes on Earth the color palate used was mostly reds, browns, yellows giving it a desolate feel. When on Elysium there were a lot of greens, blues, and whites being used to give the feel of comfort. Neil Blomkamp used a lot of the same color schemes on Earth in Elysium as he did in the movie District 9. Overall this was a fantastic movie because it sent a strong political message, was extremely entertaining, and Matt Damon did a fantastic job acting."

","Elysium (2013): Dir: Neill Blomkamp / Cast: Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, Alice Braga, Sharlto Copley, William Fichtner: Futuristic science fiction film about hope. Elysium is a space station that resembles a ferris wheel. It looks like a human paradise that homes high profile rich types. The poor live on earth and are under rule by robots constructed to prevent these people from getting to Elysium. Matt Damon plays Max, an ex-convict working in a factory that manufactures these robots. When Max comes into contact with radiation he needs to get to Elysium where healing beds can cure him. Director Neill Blomkamp made the acclaim District 9 and here he presents what can play as a double billing. The screenplay is effective until its hokey climax that is centred around action and robots that have more personality than most of the characters. Damon fares well as someone whose life is on a time line and he sacrifices all in order to break the barrier between Elysium and earth. Jodie Foster is a surprise disappointment as this head official determined to keep Elysium for the upper class. Alice Braga is cardboard as Max's childhood friend now a doctor whose daughter has cancer. She will be dragged along by this tyrant savage played by Sharlto Copley who follows orders by Foster. William Fichtner also has a laughable role as a CEO authority figure to create a program to override Elysium's computer. It might have been nice had the film concentrated more on the wonderful image of life created on Elysium as oppose to subduing itself to violence and an excuse to have two high powered individuals duke it out. Score: 5 ½ / 10"

","I like dystopian films where there is a hero in the midst taking on a dangerous regime, and in this case it is literally a segregationist regime (like apartheid South Africa) where the rich are in Elysium, and the poor are relegated to the planet where they have little access to food, health care or even basic hygiene.<br/><br/>I personally found this a very fitting metaphor for the kind of thing that income inequality leads to and is spot on when it comes to the kind of world we can be living in when people just don't care anymore.

","This movie is literally one of the best movies I have ever watched. After Niell's District 9, I wasn't expecting much (really didn't like District 9). But was absolutely blown away by this film. Although the special effects were great, the story line is what really grabbed me. In a society where inequality grows daily, it isn't very difficult for someone like me to connect the dots and see a future state where the elite are even more isolated from the masses they rely on exploiting for their wealth. We see the same trends in every country on Earth. If you haven't got an entitled disposition and have had to work for an honest wage, you'll really enjoy this film. However, if you're more like the citizens of Elysium, you're bound to hate it."
"winopaul","9","2","3","20 January 2015"," Nailed to a cross of Aspergium
","Boy, the Asperger crowd are sure excoriating Blomkamp for this one. This is a film with an even grander premise than Total Recall. I guess the Aspies can't even relate to a hero that sacrifices himself to save humanity. They are too busy pointing out that he didn't refuel before flying to Elysium. Good gosh, I am an Asperger retard too, but at least I have some tiny shards of empathy, compassion, and a dim understanding of allegory. My favorites are the Aspergiacs that have numbered lists of all the things they think are just totally unreasonable in the movie. Don't be mad at them. You wouldn't go to the Special Olympics and start slapping around the kids because they can't do a 4-minute mile. You also shouldn't wish bodily harm on reviewers so literal, so linear, so left-brained, so detail-oriented, and so lacking in any analog understanding. Just be glad your brain does not lack the synaptic pruning such that when presented with an image of people running for their life, your first thought is ""Hey, shouldn't they gas up the car?"" Perhaps it will give comfort to know it is a simple retardation, and when we get older, maybe move out of our parent's basement, and maybe have some life experience, we will be able to understand why this is such a great movie. Heck, maybe in 30 or 40 years, all these Asperger sufferers will come back and edit their entry to admit that maybe there is a thing called great art, and maybe we Aspies have a hard time understanding it, but maybe, just maybe, this movie does not suck.<br/><br/>I will try to explain. It won't do much good, since along with the literalness, OCD, and social impairment, comes a monstrous dose of stubbornness, but lets give it a try. OK kids, see, when you make a movie, well, it has to be visual. Now the real future work hell is all you guys sitting in open-plan offices, with free cafeterias and 14-hour days. But see, filming a bunch of dudes sitting all day and typing is just not very visual. And sure, it will kill you, with diabetes, and stroke, and morbid obesity, but that is kinda boring to watch too. So this living hell you are in --right this minute-- see, Blomkamp showed it like a factory with stuff moving and loud noises and dangerous radiation. And it will kill you in five days. It is not important that every little detail be coherent to how you think the future should be. Its an allegorical representation of the life you live-- right this minute. If you don't recognize the two bosses, then you should apply to work at any billion-plus-dollar corporation and you can meet dozens of guys _exactly_ like them.<br/><br/>And no, Blomkamp is not going to ""show us more of Elysium"" because watching privileged rich pricks living privileged lives in a perfect place is almost as boring as what you do for a living. And before you complain that it was stupid to have to shoot the illegal aliens down from Earth, did you ever consider that maybe weapons of any kind are banned on Elysium? I can excuse Asperger brain function, but blithering idiocy is a bit harder to forgive. Watch the darn movie and try to admit that its world does not have to work exactly like the way you want it to. Were you screaming about the woman wearing a 45ACP Colt pistol in Star Wars? I am fairly certain that many people sensed the populist political slant in the movie early on, and decided to hate it from that moment. So they start pointing out ""the angle of the thruster could not possibly get the ship to escape velocity hence the entire movie is crap."" Well, maybe they can cling to the belief that if we all act like selfish pricks everything will work out just peachy, but I gave up that bogus ""philosophy"" long ago.<br/><br/>The script is brilliant, the CGI is brilliant, the performances are brilliant. I found myself thinking ""So that's what Jodie Foster is really like,"" since I need to hate her to console myself that I don't wake up in bed with her every morning. I bet she is a really nice when she is not acting. Dang. The only thing I hated, and I really hated it a lot, was the Spaz-cam. Just like the Bourne movies, where an IMDb commenter said ""get a tripod and some lights"". What is it with Matt Damon and cameramen having epileptic seizures? Leave that crap for MTV and Mad Max movies. I dinged it a star for this alone."

","In the year 2159, the earth has become an overpopulated, polluted and disease ridden place. A new ""habitat"" called Elysium - a kind of space equivalent to an island paradise - has been created, but is a place where only the wealthy and rich are ""allowed"" to live. It's also a place that is run by people who will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws. After a serious accident at his place of work, Max (Damon) is desperate to get to Elysium any way he can, but to do this he has to retrieve critical information from the CEO of Amardyne - the company that created & built Elysium -, John Carlyle (Fichtner). If Max succeeds, he will not only help himself but also millions of people on Earth.<br/><br/>OK straight to the point here - Elysium is a fantastic action/sci-fi movie. The visual effects are stunning to say the least, and the acting is really top notch but in saying that with the likes of Foster, Damon and Copley it should be well acted. Foster brings a really good performance in playing Secretary Delacourt, a cold & heartless government official of Elysium; Copley is really impressive as Kruger, a ruthless Earth-based sleeper cell agent; and Damon once again brings it home as Max, an ex-con who works for Armadyne.<br/><br/>Elysium also has a very District 9 (which I also loved) feel to it, and I suppose the two movies really aren't too dissimilar to each other with two parties wanting to get to their own ""paradise"". The movie itself isn't a non-stop action roller coaster ride and actually pays attention to story as well which is good. Don't get me wrong...the action in Elysium when it happens is excellent but it's not self-reliant on ONLY action like some films.<br/><br/>Some people will do doubt find it slow or ""boring"" in-between the action scenes, but I didn't find this the case at all, and even in these ""slower"" moments the story still ticks along nicely and keeps your interest.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought Elysium was brilliant and I definitely recommend watching it."

The correspondence is pretty much one-to-one, with that clear global vision that a really fine South African filmmaker can bring to the party. <br/><br/>Somebody in the FAQs calls Elysium ""leftwing propaganda"". I didn't actually click on that post, but my guess is this person is an American. (Possibly a Canadian or British spear-bearer.) For the record, all Blomkamp does here is press the haves and have-nots together on one screen; the scenarios are current fact (again, with allowance for sci-fi analogy). The alleged ""politics"" of the film are the kind of politics you get when it's raining outside and someone says, ""It's raining outside."" <br/><br/>The performances are fabulous. Matt Damon is basically Will Hunting in a favela, Jodie Foster is icy as Dick Cheney in heels (and we get to hear her native-fluent French!), and Sharlto Copley is skin-crawlingly evil as the hatchet-man; somehow, the same Afrikaner accent that was so cute in District 9 is freakin' satanic here. <br/><br/>So see it.

In Elysium the visuals are stunning and visually amazing which makes the audience perplex its thoughts and it gravitates are minds. I am in agreement with several critics that the storyline was not as appealing or interesting but with the visuals, and likable lead character in Max (Matt Damon), Elysium is a wonderful ride.<br/><br/>The film brings a new definition to sci-fi films as we have not seen before. Not only are there new techniques and visuals, but we are more than aware of the emotion borough upon in the film. The characters are life-like and we want to see Matt Damon succeed. The supporting cast of Jodie Foster and Shartlo Copley as the villain do bring in the film as we see more of him towards the end of the film. The film shifts and changes towards the end while it can somewhat become more apparent as a slasher film, although still very good to watch.

Outrageously violent action scenes? check. <br/><br/>So the film hits the list on action cliché's but what made it lose a lot of potential in my book was the fact I felt like I was watching an action flick where the director constantly wanted me to notice that only bad guys have money, drive Bugatti's--in this case fly--and always are found in the corporate scene.

The World is policed by Robots, and this is the world ""Max"" (Matt Damon) grew up in. All his life he has tried to save up enough money to buy a ticket to Elysium, but he himself has succumbed to the fact that this is basically impossible.<br/><br/>But the company where Max works, who make the robots, is the same company that built Elysium. And things are not quite as pleasant as they seem up there, ""Delacourt"" (Jodie Foster in a great character role) wants unparalleled Martial Powers as the head of Security for the whole habitat. And she sets her aims much higher than just enforcing the ""No People from Earth Allowed"" policy.<br/><br/>Helping her enforce this is Sharlto Copley as ""Kruger"" looking particularly old, he is the one called on to perform any and all unscrupulous acts.<br/><br/>Mainly the point of this film is that One Piece of Information can either make the world worse, or make it better for all citizens, not just Elysium. And this information falls to Max, it takes him a while to understand just what he needs to do with it- and as much as he wants to save his own life, he has had a responsibility thrust upon him that he alone becomes uniquely capable of making happen- With the help of a Hacker named Spider.<br/><br/>This film shares the Bleak landscapes of District 9 and also Sharlto Copley who is as great a villain as he was a geek in D9, and the only real Threat to Max being able to do what he needs to do. His South Africa heritage comes out well here, along with his two sidekicks.<br/><br/>The side-story here is between Max and ""Frey"" (Alice Braga), as she gets caught up in the mess as well, but this is just more motivation for Max to do what he needs to do- So as Max had a fairly selfish motive at the beginning of the film (Survive) it becomes more than that.<br/><br/>Niell is a great world maker, although I really would not want to live in his vision of the world which has Elysium floating over it.<br/><br/>But overall there is the hope that we can prevent it from ever becoming that way.<br/><br/>ǂ - ""Ringworld"" is a series of books by Larry Niven about a huge habitat orbiting a star 200 light years from Earth, a habitat that is equivalent to the surface of 30 million Earth-Type Worlds, built by a race called Pak. Elysium is a mere fragment of that size, but it's internal surface is very reminiscent of Ringworld."

","...isn't every Sci-Fi movie flawed? Elysium has its plot holes and certainly some of the contradictions, i.e weaponry undermines the 'credibility' (given that credibility is inherently absent in sci-fi: hence the term science fiction aka not possible). Early on our hero uses three large calibre bullets which explode next to a droid and reduce it to 'dust'. Two minutes later a car he is traveling in is hit with two armor piercing missiles which just turn the car over? Now I know that bigger doesn't always mean better but when it's bullets or missiles that exception never applies.<br/><br/>If we can forgive this and other over sights and, as is necessary in all space sci-fi/sci-fantasy movies, we suspend Newtons laws on gravity, invent the total regeneration medical scanner and human cyborgs...we have a damned fine movie... Good actors, Good CGI and an EXCELLENT metaphor for our times.. <br/><br/>A handful of obscenely rich (lets say 1500 or the Forbes rich list) control everything from an ivory tower.

The result is exploding space ships, battles with advanced weaponry, and android fights, all used both to entertain and to further the message.<br/><br/>While entertaining, Elysium isn't especially convincing. The movie has a very black and white view of the dynamic between earth and Elysium, dividing the world a little too neatly into purely evil bad guys and noble folk. There is also a moment at the end that, while effective, doesn't really make sense if you think about it. <br/><br/>Still, this is a movie with its heart in the right place, and performances are quite good, especially Sharlto Coopley as a disturbingly scary enforcer. I like the message, which in essence I believe in (i.e., the Koch brothers would totally do this if they could), and even if you don't like the message, there's lots of fun running around and explosions."
"midge56","5","2","3","30 January 2014"," Realistic future but mind-numbing violence & poor script
","Spoiler alert for the thin skinned.<br/><br/>Although this movie has a promising start, it rapidly deteriorates into nothing but mind numbing senseless violence & killings with almost no dialogue or story for 80% of the movie. (best if you fast forward through the mindless killings). It is clear the director & writer are totally clueless that you can't carry a movie based solely on pointless violence & gore like some old B grade western or war movie. Quite frankly, we are sick of it.<br/><br/>Sci-fi fans want an engrossing story with compelling characters, adventure, exploration, challenges & discovery with pristine, futuristic architecture & glass towers filled with awe inspiring futuristic technology, progress & gadgets (like Oblivion, Total Recall (the original), I Robot, 6th day, Moon, etc.) This meager excuse for a story & plot fails to generate any audience sympathy for the ""victims"" in this movie who are mostly the have-not's consisting of thugs & gangs; overrun with immigrants, hordes of unruly petty thief children (an obvious need of birth control) and generations of self concentered dregs of society wallowing in the debris without lifting a finger to repair, clean, maintain or contribute to their community while blaming the have's for their lot in life. Like locusts consuming everything until it becomes a decaying wasteland then moving on to destroy the next green patch. (Like Idiocracy & Wall-E).<br/><br/>While this is clearly one of the most realistic, likely renditions of Earth's near future, it fails to induce any audience compassion for their situation. Who would root for these dregs to gain control so they can turn the orbiting paradise into another wasteland while they lie around, taking from others, gratifying their indulgences, expecting someone else to clean & maintain it.<br/><br/>When the have-not's endeavor to access the orbiting paradise of the have's; (tantamount to watching drug lords & thugs crossing the borders), we find ourselves rooting for the wealthy have's to shoot down the undeserving disenfranchised. Which is the reverse of the intended plot.<br/><br/>This poorly written story would be analogous to expecting the audience to cheer for hordes of murderous escaped prison inmates plundering & killing Beverly Hills celebrities. Destroying elegant mansions to cure themselves & their progeny does not give credence or promote sympathy for their actions.<br/><br/>The medical theme wasn't enough. The medical care could have been obtained without turning over the asylum to the inmates & Jodie's character could have had a better role in this. Thus, the writer & director failed to sell the plot to the audience.<br/><br/>Scarcely little is seen of this orbiting paradise, the inhabitants or technology, which should have been the key point of interest for a Sci-fi movie. Not scenes like ""Escape from NY"".<br/><br/>The failure to focus more scenes on the futuristic orbital Eden, it's upper crust society & high tech gadgets was clearly a wasted opportunity which would have been an improvement to the nonstop killing & violence between a bunch of thugs (aka Robocop).<br/><br/>Jodie & Matt's talents were wasted on shallow character themes, poor dialogue & absurd story lines we might expect to see written by some no talent preteen. The actors did their best with what they had to work with.<br/><br/>The director & writer failed to engage the audience in connecting with any of the characters or their plights. Who would feel sorry for a bunch of self-serving thugs? The audience also has very little tolerance for character stupidity, self consumed arrogance, needless deaths and a medical device that can restore an entire head blown away by a grenade but can't handle a little brain damage. Not to mention basing the entire movie on the main characters race to undo a death sentence from an unbelievably stupid act, only to crap out his character after forcing the audience to endure 2 hours of senseless violence to get there. Guaranteed to PO the audience.<br/><br/>For sci-fi movies in general, it seems all the writers & directors of the past 15 years use violence, battles & killings as scene fillers to compensate for their lack of imagination & inability to create a compelling story without using violence and grimy dark basements and dregs of society.<br/><br/>I hope these writers & directors are reading these commentaries since we are all telling them the same thing. We're sick of the violence & battles. We need engaging stories of exploration, discovery, adventure, accomplishment, compelling characters of good integrity, pristine futuristic architecture in the daylight, utopic societies, fantastic high-tech gadgets & some decent aliens who aren't trying to kill us."

","A great idea--wealthy humans have abandoned a demolished Earth for a luxury space station, leaving behind the poor and disenfranchised while controlling them from afar--is ignored in this run-of-the-mill sci-fi action flick. It should have a lot of provocative things going for it, what with its socially conscious topic, but the bulk of the film is consumed with lead Matt Damon getting from point A to point B, facing obstacles all the while. By focusing on the surfeit of action, so little is made of its original conceit that it feels like a wasted effort. There are absolutely no surprises in writer/director Neill Blomkamp's Hollywood-101 storytelling (there's even a race to save a little girl dying of leukemia) and no depth to any of the characters. Damon is given little to do while Jodie Foster plays the villain--this might have been fun to watch, if only to see her overact and play against type, but, like everything else that might have mattered, Blomkamp could care less."
"tiger86-2","6","2","3","24 January 2014"," Well, at least it looks gorgeous...
","Sadly, the writing is just horrible. Not mediocre. Not acceptable. Not even bad. Just horrible.<br/><br/>OK, let's start with the good stuff. As I already said, the movie is visually stunning. The production designers knew what they were doing, that is for sure. The visual effects are very nice and the action scenes are poetry of blood and gore. The acting, given the script, is actually perfect.<br/><br/>But that is it. The bad stuff is just... I don, know, bad? Sorry. As I said, the movie is just awfully written. The first problem is the overly serious tone. I am sorry, one of the reasons 'District 9' worked so well despite sharing some of 'Elysium's faults was the humor. Yes, it lacked subtlety, it had some plot holes... But it was a satire, and a good one. 'Elysium, however, plays it deadly serious. And while I don't mind seriousness in my movies, I find it very hard to forgive some writing flaws when it seems that the writer thought they wrote the best sci-fi script ever. I will write a few spoilers here. Be warned.<br/><br/>OK, first, I don't really like the ""haves vs have-nots"" conflict for some reason. I guess it is because every time I see it in a movie or a book it is so incredibly polarized it looks ridiculous. 'Elysium' is not an exception. Anybody who has more money than the main character (and the main character is literally dirt poor) is plain evil, no matter if we are talking about his employers or the actual people in Elysium. If you are not dirt poor, you are an evil oppressor. End of story. 1%-ers are evil. It is incredibly one-sided. What is ironic is the fact that Neil Blomkamp, the creator of this movie, is a 1%-er himself, being the most famous South-African director right now. The polarization is shown even visually - 1%-ers are sterile clean, the poor people living on Earth look like they haven't taken a shower in their lives... And... Well, sorry but, while I am not a 1%-er myself, I understand why they treated the ""have-nots"" like they did. Again, I am sorry but you don't need money to launder your clothes and to take a shower. Being poor does not equal being dirty. The people from Elysium looked superior - and were superior - simply because they knew how to use soap.<br/><br/>Then come the real problems. OK, Matt Damon's character is oppressed. We got it. He is oppressed by the evil ones and they oppress him. But... There are moments when you just tell your boss to go F himself - like when he cuts half of your daily wage because you have come to work with a broken hand and then he sends you to do a job that you both know is definitely going to kill you and there is no other way. You may need the job but you need your life more. You may be willing to take some humiliation but you wouldn't kill yourself for a sh!tty job. And yes, that is exactly what Damon's character did.<br/><br/>Then... OK, there is this machine that can heal all diseases instantly. No, there isn't just one machine, from what we are shown the amount of these machines is infinite. Literally. We are shown not only that there is such machine in every single house on Elysium (and most houses on Elysium are just empty since nobody lives in them) but also that infinite amount of these machines can be sent to Earth with a simple voice command and nobody will lose anything. And, I am sorry, but this just doesn't make sense at all. We are shown that all resources on Elysium come from Earth - and from people on Earth. One would think that people on Elysium would value their resources enough to send some of these machines on Earth - may be not in every house but at least in the hospitals. Especially since sending them anywhere is, as shown in the movie, completely free. They have infinite amount of machines that can resurrect a man from the dead and yet they let millions of people die just because. Sorry. I know Blomkamp wanted to show how heartless the 1%-ers were but this is not heartless. This is dumb. It is a waste of valuable resources - it is like letting your food rot because you are too lazy to put it in the fridge. We are even shown that people from Earth are attacking Elysium and destroying the ridiculously expensive houses there just to get those machines - you see, by not allowing them to use the machines the 1%-ers are actually losing their precious homes. Ironically, had Blomkamp chosen a more satyric approach this would actually make some sense. Had he chosen to make the conflict less polarized this problem could be avoided. Had he chosen some different plot device instead of the all-healing machines half of the movie's problems wouldn't exist.<br/><br/>Alas, he made it this way. It is still watchable. Even if he wrote it horribly, he directed it well. But it could be so much better. I hope he won't make the same mistakes again."

","The movie is from the director of 'District 9' which sets in the year 2154 about the people of severely damaged earth and luxurious artificial habitat in the space. I could say this movie was not much distinct from Tom Cruise' recent science fiction. Both the movie deals about ruined earth and wealthier space station colony. More like it is a prequel to 'Oblivion' where robots are taking over from the human race. I enjoyed both, they were the finest science fiction of the year. 'Oblivion' was unique but 'Elysium' gives the same feeling to the movie 'District 9' where protagonist from both the movies get infected and suffers severely.<br/><br/>Max (Matt Damon) is an orphan young man who is dreaming to escape the polluted earth and settle down in the luxurious place in the space called Elysium. He works in a factory where security robots are manufactured. One day something goes wrong with him while working, he begins to get sick. In order to get cured he must immediately visit the Elysium where poors from the earth are not allowed. He knows he can't enter legally so he must find an alternate way where he could reach his target.<br/><br/>2013 was one of the best year in last the ten years for science fiction movie fans. I thoroughly enjoyed many movies along with my favourite of the year 'Gravity'. 'Elysium' is better than the average, I don't know why it was rated such low. But I could not get a few things like why should one install electronic chips and devices into his body to steal the classified data. I thought the pen drive or external HDD are more than enough. Whatever, this movie looked good to me and expecting you to enjoy it as well."

","This movie is sick. Mr. Matt Damon has fallen into perfect circumstances to take on a Hail Mary mission with %1 chance of survival. He must become the hero that men rarely can be, to save himself and his lower- class people left to die. <br/><br/>Bad ass fight scenes and survival action in a very well done Blade Runner like future. Halo comes to life in these fight scenes. Everything was believable and cool. The type of story was somewhat realistic in that it had believable actions of the characters. The actual sci fi setting is kind of far fetched, just because humans are still half good even though they are half evil. Also, people benefit from a balanced world, more than if it was a cruel dictatorship, for example. So for a slight story aspect that I felt could have been healed through story writing, I cannot give this a perfect score. For example, maybe there could have been more explanation given as to why the classes had become so stratified. Perhaps resource diminishment would lead to the world going into a natural and abrupt depression, causing a necessary evil of about half the population, on average, over no more than 20 years. I'm just thinking out loud.<br/><br/>It was too good for words. You need to see this if you like Sci Fi movies or Actions movies."

","'Elysium' excels at most chapters—very intense, well written, masterly directed, sharply acted, etc..

","I had been waiting for Blomkamp's new film since District 9, and I was not disappointed. Amazing FX throughout, the shots of the station are truly beautiful, and so is the rest of the photography. But one of the most entertaining things are the designs of machinery, vehicles, and such. (what could you expect, really, if Weta is involved, obviously, it's going to be great...) Sharlto Copley's acting is spot on for his character, bringing to life one of the most brutally likable villains I have seen in a long time. It's definitely a popcorn movie, do not watch expecting some life changing revelation, but if spending a couple of hours truly entertained is what you want, then this is surely a great film."

Whereas I am very pessimistic when it comes to new movies as usually they are unoriginal and unexciting and I hadn't seen a good science fiction in a long while. Though Elysium has a lot of action scenes it is still very much a science fiction film. The vision of the future was very realistic and the grit of the film gave me the feeling that what was happening could really happen. Elysium is a brilliant film, sometimes hard to watch but the fact that it could make me feel so emotional I think is the mark of a well made movie. If you like science fiction or action this is a fantastic movie and I highly recommend it."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","3","31 August 2013"," Worth waiting for
","In 2009, a new talent burst on the cinematic scene in the form of writer and director Neill Bllomkamp, a South African living in Canada, who gave us the startlingly original and political science fiction movie ""District 9"", a bitingly satirical take on apartheid South Africa. It's taken him four years to come up with his follow-up work, another sci-fi project, but it wipes the floor with the other genre offerings of this summer ""After Earth"" and ""Oblivion"".<br/><br/>This time the setting is an over-populated and environmentally ravaged Los Angeles in 2154 (the same year as ""Avatar""). In classical mythology, Elysium was the home of the blessed after death; in this film, it is a space station where the ultra-rich escape the crime and ill-health of Earth. The head of security at the station is the icy Delacourt played by Jodie Foster and the person who is trying to break into this Brave New World is ex-con, now radiation worker Max portrayed by Matt Damon with shaven head, exo-skeleton and a brain full of code. Delacourt's special agent and Max's intended nemesis, the ferocious Kruger, sees the return of South African Sharlto Copley from ""District 9"".<br/><br/>Comparing BlomKamp's two films, both use the genre of sci-fi to make political points, this time the scourge of inequality and the injustice of immigration control. The difference between the works is the budget: an estimated $30M has become an estimated $115M which means bigger stars and bigger special effects, so ""Elysium"" looks great - especially in IMAX - but the plotting is somewhat simplistic and the conclusion overly sentimental."

Put your brain in neutral, get your popcorn, and enjoy the eye candy, which is extremely impressive.<br/><br/>But, whatever you do, don't take your brain out of neutral, because you will find yourself asking all sorts of questions.

"moviescoundrel","8","2","3","13 August 2013"," Heaven not on Earth
","I initially thought this looked much better than ""District 9"". I did enjoy ""District 9"", it was original, aesthetically pleasing and somewhat suspenseful. This looked a bit more action packed however, and more star power, it does not disappoint. The movie feels similar to ""District 9"" with the environment, and the setting might as well be the same town. There is a brief intro to Max's life and we learn that Max has had a tough go of things, and has made some bad decisions. When an accident at work leaves him dying with no other choice to get to Elysium, we see a desperate man on a dangerous path to a forbidden space station. I enjoyed seeing the backstory get set up due to the look of Blomkamp's future.<br/><br/>We also get a brief glimpse of Elysium. Delacourt (Foster) is basically the Secretary of Defense on Elysium. She is basically in charge of border control, and required to keep others out. Other political figures would rather she not take as violent of a stand against intruders, but she wants to keep Elysium safe and secure from immigrants from Earth (cue political theme). Delacourt hires a crazy mercenary named Kruger (Sharlto Copley) who has a bit of evil in him. He looks like a nasty animal and behaves accordingly. Kruger and some fellow mercenaries are in charge of stopping Max and some of his fellow cons before they get away with some valuable information or end up in Elysium. This leads to some suspenseful chases, great aviation scenes with some sweet looking ships and flying. The subtle theme and message take a back seat to the action for the rest of the film, which was fine with me.<br/><br/>The good: I love much of Blomkamp's take on the future. The probation attendants and the police bots are amusing. It seems like once Max hooked up to the exoskeleton he would've taken more of these things out, not so much. The large scale chase, fight, and flying scenes were amazing in IMAX."
"dvc5159","6","2","3","8 August 2013"," The future's a bloody mess, literally
","Neill Blomkamp's ""Elysium"" is far more flawed than his debut ""District 9"", yet it is still skillful summer entertainment and a worthy continuation of the thematic backdrop that Blomkamp has set in the latter - futuristic social inequality. This film however takes the quote ""the rich get richer and the poor get poorer"" to orbital heights, literally, as the eponymous 2001-esque space colony gets filled to the brim with the wealthy while the rest of the poor folks gets damned on a vastly overpopulated Earth. Here in Los Angeles, a criminal named Max (Damon) struggles to board Elysium after a freak accident, while corruption and paranoia seethes through Elysium official Delacourt (Foster).<br/><br/>This social commentary on whether society is doomed by their own doing is used as a clothesline for frenetic sequences of violent action, all combined to form one feature-length race against time for the underdog to triumph over all. Thing is, the underdog has to face an even crazier dog, a disgruntled and psychopathic mercenary named Kruger hired by Delacourt to off Max for, um, doing good stuff. Sharlto Copley, the flawed protagonist in Blomkamp's previous effort, plays a despicable and barbaric villain so well here that he's in danger of being typecast as such, as opposed to Matt Damon who can play an action hero in his sleep. Even when Damon suits up in a clunky brain-controlled exo-skeleton following the accident, we root for him because he's a clear underdog that the audience supports.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's screenplay is flawed, with certain gaps of physical logic here and there, and the story seems cobbled from previous superior sci- fi classics. But where his screenplay fails, it's his direction and vision that delivers. Blomkamp successfully materializes two different worlds - rich and poor - in technical aspects, and presents them as a black-and-white prophecy. Gritty scenes in the L.A. slums on Earth are compelling to watch when compared starkly to the spectacular-looking utopia-like Elysium. Any space colony that can rebuild exploded faces is a colony worth living on, no? It must've been a challenge for production designer Philip Ivey to come up with concepts for both sides, but he succeeds.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the other factor - the action sequences, and Blomkamp delivers thoroughly on that aspect. Frantic action sequences mixed with crowd-pleasing and squeamish moments made me realize - here is a modern- day filmmaker who knows action, and what his audience wants and keeps on that promise. In my opinion they were far more exhilarating and refreshing to watch than any other movie this summer, as they provide no shortage of old school bloody thrills - and I do mean bloody.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" may be flawed and familiar story-wise as it should have been half an hour longer with more scenes set in the colony, but it still has a thought-provoking concept and enough action to vastly satisfy both the popcorn crowd and the action crowd. This is a summer blockbuster that delivers."
"Deckard-16","8","2","3","20 August 2013"," A fine & worthy follow up to ""District 9""
","The problem with Neill Blomkamp's last film was that it came from absolutely nowhere for paying people like me & floored us. Obviously. we all asked how was he going follow that act?<br/><br/>The answer to that question is ""pretty damn well"". ""Elysium"" gives him bigger stars & a bigger set of toys to work with & probably gives his buddy, Sharlto Copley, a bigger paycheck.<br/><br/>This is a constantly entertaining BIG sci-fi film filled great visuals, interesting characters & a very satisfying story with as much political subtlety as a Michael Moore film.<br/><br/>So what if Jodie Foster is rather one-dimensional as a villainous ""suit"" (think ""Avatar's"" Quaritch wearing Armani)? She makes that one dimension very entertaining. Matt Damon may not be Bourne-terrific here but he is fine form nevertheless. His ""Max"" has a story we actually care about. The two standout performances here are Wagner Moura as the computer ace, Spider & Copley as the hit-man/machine/sociopath/mercenary, Kruger. Unlike the two idiot scientist who almost ruined ""Pacific Rim"" for me, Moura has fun with the role without ever making fun of the role. There is hardly any humor in this movie, but that doesn't make it a downer. Copley has a voice & a way of speaking that I'm sure seems very strange to anybody living in the western half of the U.S. As he showed in ""District 9"" & the terrific ""Europa Report""(his other ""E"" sci-fi movie this summer) he has a unique screen presence that always holds our attention. I don't know if this makes him a particularly good actor, but he is fun to watch. Kruger is written as a scary guy & Copley makes him one.<br/><br/>Blomkamp keeps things moving at a fast pace that never seems rushed. There is only one fight scene that seems a bit like overkill (unlike just about all the fight scenes in ""Man Of Steel"" -which I otherwise loved). There is fairly bloody stuff going on throughout this movie. One scene nearly matches the infamous self-abortion in ""Prometheus"". The gore flashes in front of you quickly & never lingers. Just keep the kids home.<br/><br/>This movie is probably not going to go over very well with people who keep their bank accounts on the Cayman Islands, but for the rest of us it is rollicking entertainment"

At Elysium live only the better people, who have their luxury food and drinks and where classical music is played. They also have the best medicines at Elysium and a machine that can treat all diseases and can replace lost body parts.
Only poor, poorer people live on the earth, who do all the hard work there. Matt Damon's character, Max Works in a factory and tries to improve his life and eventually to Elysium. After an accident, his body gets weakened. He thinks his only salvation can be found at Elysium. With the help of his friends, he gets a robot implantation, which brings him back to strength. With his new implant he tries to enter Elysium. Jodie Foster's character finds out what Max is up to and sends an agent behind him to stop him. The agent named Kruger is a crazy maniac who will do everything to prevent Max from coming to Elysium.
The film has great effects and a good cast. All actors play their part great. The best actor is Sharlo Copley. In District 9 he plays an ordinary agent who makes some changes, but in Elysium he plays a dangerous maniac. Sharlo Copley steals the show in Elysium. I would definitely like to see Sharlo Copley again in more films.
Elysium is a great Sci-Fi with a beautiful story a good cast and leaves just like District 9 a message. You can see that Neil Blomkamp is a director who puts passion into his films.
It is a Sci-Fi that tour is rendered in a realistic way, making you think that the world could look like this in 2154"
"tabuno","8","1","1","16 January 2019"," A Memerizing Sci Fi Socio-Political Commentary
","19 August 2013. It appears that director Neill Blomkamp has found a much more even and polished sci fi thriller in Elysium than his last disappointing turn as director in District 9 (2009). In Elysium there is a believable tragic hero portrayed by Matt Damon and a consistently cold, underplayed Secretary of Defense played by a now older looking Jodie Foster (interestingly with some overtones to former Secretary of Defense Hillary Clinton's own physical transformation over time). Like Crash (2004), the audience is immersed into a politically charged topics of health care and immigration which strike deep chords of discontent for those who can appreciate the current political state of the United States. What's rather ominous at the same time breathtaking is the possibility that some of the slum footage in Elysium may be just at outgrowth of real actual location shots around this planet that would only heighten the deepening visual reality blurring both our present sociological tragedy wrought by the frightening magnifying class divisions facing world today and what it is likely to become in the near future.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp has avoided the wasted pseudo-docu style of District 9 and The Blair Witch Project (1999) and Cloverleaf (2008), incorporated a judicious use of rich flashbacks, and created a emotionally resonating straight forward storyline, almost potentially mythical in its origins for future generations of this mythical future scenario. Unlike the logical flaws found in District 9, Elysium only once glosses over its technically intact storyline for laypeople. The one glaring problem is the ease by which one the Elysium-bound ships conveniently slips into Elysium airspace. Blomkamp retains justifiably the rich and sweeping visual design of the movie while including a politically and personally potent story. The only slight dissonance is the script outline that involves the coup plot that interestingly has some overtones to the current plight in Egypt. Even more interestingly is the resemblance of this movie to the core outline to Demolition Man (1993), except without the mesmerizing future talk or even the more recent Upside Down (2013) and has the similar emotive power of human perseverance and hardship as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (2006) or a less than epic version of Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves (1990). Other class movies would include Gattaca (1997), Fahrenheit 451 (1966). As starkly rich as THX-1138 (1971) was Elysium is as messy and chaotically amazing, echoing the horrors of today's slums and governmental insensitivity around the world and here at home.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is an engaging and personally riveting movie, a great reminder for those of the mass audience to reflect on the current state of affairs in the United States and resonates with the anger and frustration that the masses are experiencing at the hands of those who have the power and control. It holds out both moral outrage and a tenuous glimmer of hope for the rest of us or perhaps its just a salve to keep us in our places."

","I honestly wasn't a massive fan of District 9 but was intrigued by this movie as it seemed to have an interesting plot and one of my favourite actors Matt Damon in it. While it's definitely flawed Elysium is a solid action flick and well directed by Neill Blomkamp. Matt Damon was great in this movie he was really good in the action scenes and his motivations were very good and clear. Shartlo Copley was fantastic in this movie one of the best movie villains of 2013 he was just insane and extremely entertaining to watch. The CGI was very good especially during the space sequences as it looked very real just like the action in the movie. The future is very well done it just looks like an awful place to live and they really sold that in this movie and really sold the paradise that was Elysium. The problem is they never bother to explain the future how the world got so desolated and the origins of Elysium. While Copley was fantastic in the movie Jodie Foster was not there was just nothing to her character, her accent was strange and out of place and she had no understandable motivations. While is definitely a flawed movie I really like Elysium and Blomkamp was do hard on himself with this movie and I really don't want him to give up now. Very impressed mostly great performances, well done and realistic action and special effects make for a very entertaining movie. 7.5/10 B"
"cmdrmorosco","9","1","1","16 November 2015"," Why do people hate this movie?
","I've been a fan of Sci-fi and fantasy for as long as I can remember. I've seen the bad, I've seen the good, and I've seen life changing. Elysium is not life changing by any means but it is very good for what it was trying to accomplish. Very simply Elysium is a class struggle between the super elite (on the space station Elysium) and the incredibly poor (everyone on Earth). During the story both sides do absolutely horrible things to each other and yet at it's darkest moments it does show a glimmer of what the human race is capable of when those selfish attitudes that led to such a huge class division are instead replaced by cooperation and determination. I give Elysium a 9 because it isn't a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination but it does lead to some profound philosophical questions and that to me is far more important than any visual effect or Oscar worthy story. Any movie that can introduce philosophical and moral dilemmas (The Matrix, 1984, V for Vendetta, Blade Runner, etc.) is worth a look at. Watch the movie and make your own judgments."
"CleveMan66","6","1","1","30 September 2015"," ""Elysium"" is intriguing, but gets bogged down in its own negativity.
","Class warfare, health care, immigration. ""Elysium"" (R, 1:49) is an action thriller that explores all these social issues and more.<br/><br/>Less than a century and a half in our future, the rich live in the ultimate gated community – a man-made satellite shaped like a bicycle tire, which hangs in the sky within sight, but out of reach, of the poor people of earth. Earth has become a dirty, run-down planet full of dirty, run-down people who are lucky if they have a job. Elysium is a paradise with a swimming pool in the middle of every manicured lawn. Every home is beautiful and they all have a device that looks like a cross between a tanning bed and an MRI, which can heal any citizen of Elysium of any injury or disease.<br/><br/>Naturally, the citizens of earth want to be on Elysium and the citizens of Elysium want to keep that from happening. Whenever the citizens of earth attempt their futuristic version of a border crossing. well, they're stopped. Leading that effort is Secretary Delacourt (played by Jodie Foster) - a Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Homeland Security, National Security Adviser and border patrol agent all rolled into one. She's also ruthless and she talks funny. In the future, unusual accents are plentiful, but morals, not so much. Delacourt will do anything to keep Elysium pure and secure, while people like Matt Damon's character, Max, yearn, and sometimes really NEED to ""get up there"".<br/><br/>When Max suffers a serious accident at work, he knows that getting to Elysium for medical attention is his only chance for survival. The same need exists with a little girl, the daughter of a childhood friend of Max. Max knows someone who can get him to Elysium, but only if Max does something for his ""friend"" in the process. And that ""something"" could turn out to be a game-changer for everyone in this Orwellian morality play.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in ""Elysium"". Maybe too much. Incorporating so many social issues into the plot makes the film feel cluttered. The condition of earth and its people is portrayed with an nearly overwhelming grittiness and the ""every man for himself"" mentality of almost all the characters is pretty depressing. The story is interesting and the action is exciting to watch, but I would call other aspects of the film. too much of a good thing. ""B"""
"MrAwesome1022","7","1","1","23 August 2015"," Beautiful, Stunning, Yet Missing Something
","The cinematography of this movie was amazing, it is visually beautiful. The story within itself is very relevant to the socio-economic situations of society today. There are numerous elements of class warfare, the subjugation of the middle and lower class to substandard living reins strong throughout.<br/><br/>The message of the plight of the poor leaves a psychological mark on the viewer as the wealthy within the film never show any care for their lives nor their well being. Aside from one character that mostly stays in the background, which is a shame.<br/><br/>I felt the acting was quality aside from Sharlto Copley (Kruger), who left a lot to be desired whenever he was depicted. Instead of depicting the character with a more psychological interpretation he went with the stereotypical violence enthused henchman.<br/><br/>While that could also be a result of the writing as overall it did feel that something was missing from each character to make you care about their plight. The aforementioned character that could have shown a more human element of Elysium was an extremely minor character, a gross missed opportunity to improve the plot.<br/><br/>Nothing about Matt Damon's character truly captures the situation of Earth and why change is needed. He seems forced into his role out of his own selfish desires rather than out of the common good. Which in essence makes him no better than those on Elyisum.<br/><br/>While the over arching theme of the movie is outstanding, the cinematography eye catching, and the action seems well executed there were a number of missed opportunities that caused the movie to go from memorable to a movie that was simply enjoyable at the time.<br/><br/>True Score: 6.6"
"karen5778","8","1","1","23 August 2015"," Like a pretty good episode of Twilight Zone with explosions
","This director is very much the descendant of Rod Serling. He takes people and dumps them in a wild situation and has them continue to act more or less normally. Some people knock on this movie that the characters are under stated, but people are understated, and this makes the movie better, especially in how little chemistry there is between the main characters which may be a spoiler.<br/><br/>Like Serling, he always works in some maudlin content, but in this one it is so tied in to current events that it isn't as saccharine as the pathos in District 9 or Chappie. I did think the criticism that no society would get like this was pretty funny, considering how far down this road we already are. Unlike Chappie, the plot line is so simple that it doesn't bite off more than it can chew. The humor is humorous, the story line relevant and the explosions are beautiful. We watched this because we liked Chappie and District 9 so much, but I think this is actually the best of the three."
"lucasversantvoort","6","1","1","6 May 2015"," Disappointing, yet consistent
","Whenever a director breaks through with only his first feature film, expectations run high on whatever he'll do next. Neil Blomkamp did just that in 2009 with District 9, a film much liked at the time (not by me though).<br/><br/>That was a sci-fi film based on the following premise: what would happen if the aliens finally landed? Instead of it being utopian (see Close Encounters) or terrifying (see countless horror films), it reverses everything with the aliens being forced to live in South-African slums. The premise was interesting and it had some interesting ideas, but the last half hour betrayed the rest of the film. Elysium doesn't suffer from the same problem, which doesn't make it the better film, but it does make it the more consistent one.<br/><br/>We get an obligatory flashback where two kids dream of going to the Eden that is the space-station called Elysium, a place where the rich live in peace and have access to instance-cures for every possible ailment, whether internal or external. Max and Frey dream of going there and Max, of course, promises that he'll take them there someday. Years later, they're both grown up with Frey (Alice Braga) working as a nurse and Max (Matt Damon) working in a factory, although he also has a history of stealing cars. He becomes exposed to radiation in the factory and is told he only has a few days to live. Realizing the medical bays in Elysium could save his life, he seeks out a criminal 'friend' who tells him he can get him to Elysium with a fake 'passport' if Max does a job for him. Of course, this is no ordinary job, leading to events which pits him against Delacourt (Jodie Foster), Elysium's Secretary of Defense, and mad ex-Elysium agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley). Despite doing it out of self-interest, he eventually becomes the only hope for mankind on earth.<br/><br/>The first thing that springs to mind when thinking about this film is 'missed opportunities'. There's a scene where it seems like a conflict will arise between Max's own desire and the fate of mankind ( 'the-needs-of-the-many-outweigh-the-needs-of-the-few'). This immediately sounds promising. You start thinking 'maybe he will have to choose between his own well-being and the health of mankind on Earth'. Unfortunately, this is ultimately avoided. Another missed opportunity is the lack of a clearly explained world. We are dropped in a typical dystopian, cyberpunk-ish world where the rich are rich, young and healthy, living comfortably on Elysium and the poor struggle on a desolated Earth. This premise is in itself not the problem. The problem is the lack of 'history'. How did we get here? Another question in the same category: if there are so many med-bays on Elysium, why not manufacture more and place them on Earth so the rest of the people can benefit from them? The fact that the world created in Elysium is underwritten definitely lets this film down, especially during the climax where I was supposed to feel elated, but instead didn't feel much of anything.<br/><br/>Speaking of underwritten, Jodie Foster's character also fits that description. It's always awkward when famous actors are used for parts that eventually do little more than belittle their filmography. Foster's Delacourt is (up to a point) the film's antagonist, but remains a boring, 'the-end-justifies-the-means' kind of villain.<br/><br/>The music, while functional, firmly resides in Cliché Valley. If it doesn't smash your eardrums, Hans Zimmer style, then it tries to appeal to your emotions with those overdone exotic, female laments. Underwrittenliterally.<br/><br/>It may sound like I'm bashing the film (I am), but it's not really a bad film. It checks the basic amount of boxes for a film to be 'decent': we do want Max to succeed (which has more to do with Matt Damon's acting, I think), we want both him and Frey to survive their predicaments, we want Kruger to die, etc. But in the end, I expected way more of a sci-fi film of this caliber. It's the lack of interesting and well-explored sci-fi themes that disappoints me the most. I'm aware I'm judging the film by what it lacks and not by what it does have, but that's what happens with sci-fi films.<br/><br/>I realized beforehand that Blomkamp's main problem would be to balance his sci-fi ideas and themes with the obligatory action, necessary for mainstream appeal. He has both succeeded and failed. He has succeeded in the sense that Elysium is the more balanced, consistent film when compared to District 9. It doesn't suffer from a too noticeable shift in tone (like District 9's last half hour). On the other hand he has failed in the sense that the film is only more consistent in its use of straightforward action, depriving the film—and subsequently its audience—of well-explored sci-fi themes and concepts and thus a more interesting, daring sci-fi experience."

","After my last little foray into the world of Sci-Fi (With Jupiter Ascending... *shiver*) I feared the worst for Elysium. Thankfully, my misgivings turned out to be groundless... This turned out to be at LEAST 94531 times better. (It's true, I did all the mathematics meself) This sounds miraculous, when when you consider Jupiter Ascending is actually Satan in disguise, your expectations should drop from 'outstandingly perfect' to 'pretty good'. Which I'll take any day, considering how much WORSE it can get...<br/><br/>A shaven-haired Matt Damon plays a man living on a future overcrowded Earth, which seems to be one big shanty town... Where the lives of it's inhabitants are valued less than cattle, and the rich have long since jettisoned our planet to live on a utopian space station. It's got grass and twittering birds and everything. A sign of things to come, perhaps? Regardless, life for Damon in this poverty stricken hellhole couldn't be much worse... And then, in an accident at work, he gets infected with nuclear poisoning, which will cause multiple organ failure in a few days. Nice.<br/><br/>His only hope of recovery is by getting access to the modern medical treatment on the far-off shuttle called Elysium... Which is strictly for the EXTREMELY well off. And that's where the plot really starts, as Damon suits up in a cyborg suit, and faces off against b*tchy Jodie Foster (haven't seen her for a while) and ruthless bounty hunter Sharlto Copley. The special effects are predictably impressive, the actors give their all in their respective parts, and the story is SHOCK! HORROR! very easy to follow, unlike a certain other recent release where after the first twenty minutes, you'd need a SatNav and a bag full of flares...<br/><br/>As soon as a small, sick child is introduced into the mix however, and it becomes a straight flip between her life, and our lead's, the standard formula starts to take shape. In other words, don't expect any fireworks towards the end... We've all seen this kind of 'noble sacrifice' hero before. Wouldn't it be nice, to have an utterly morally bankrupt anti-hero who was determined to preserve his life AT ALL COSTS? He may not engage the audience's sympathies, but at least it would be an original concept. I'm all for it!! An imaginative backdrop, arresting action sequences and a clear plot with obvious objectives make this worth a watch. Not especially memorable, but it'll do for now. 6/10"

No, he just wants to blow stuff up and shoot big gins. I wouldn't even call this liberal propaganda because it's all there so Matt Damon can go Bourne on everyone and kick some ass. And even when he does change the system, it's a hollow victory. Any world-building is all in service to the run-and-gun latter half.

","People seem to dismiss Elysium due to the obvious political overtones in the movie, but really the film pushes across the issue that has been plaguing the world from day one: the struggles between the rich and the poor. If we look at the histories of every country and even compare to modern times, this film takes a look at a very relevant issue. Now as a film itself, it's pretty entertaining. The story may be lacking, but there is plenty of action to be had. It is a plus that the visuals are excellent. I loved the looks of the futuristic Los Angeles, as well as the space station outside Earth. The film had a very District 9 look to it at times.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's follow-up to his successful debut, District 9 takes place in the future. Earth is an over-populated wasteland where people live in poverty while the luxurious reside in a man-made space station. The people of Earth dream about traveling to the space station, but it's nearly impossible due to tough anti-immigration laws. Now an ordinary man named Max is pushed into the battle so that equality can persevere.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. The film makes good use of Matt Damon's talent and it shows why Damon is one of Hollywood's best. Jodie Foster doesn't have much screen-time as one could hope, but she is an effective presence. Sharlto Copley as one of the bounty hunters plays evil so well, a complete opposite of his role in District 9. In Elysium, his character showed no mercy, not even to little girls suffering from leukemia.<br/><br/>Overall, Elysium is a interesting film to watch due to its political themes on such topics such as illegal immigration, measures of equality, an unfair justice system, and so on. For a summer film, it's really smart and we need more films like this. A better screenplay and the film would have been near perfect. But this sci-fi film is action-packed and fun to watch. While it does not reach the heights of District 9, Elysium is not a bad second feature for Blomkamp. I rate this film 8/10."

","""Above ground you have the Haves, pursuing pleasure, comfort and beauty. Below ground you have the Have-nots, the Workers who are continually adapting to the conditions of labour. Those predisposed toward misery and rebelliousness soon die, such that the survivors become as well adapted to the conditions of their underground life, and as happy in their way, as the Upper-worlders are to theirs."" ― H.G. Wells (""The Time Machine"")<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp directs ""Elysium"". The plot? In the near future, the world is starkly divided between the rich and the poor. The rich live in an idyllic floating space station, complete with robot servants, spotless mansions and superb health-care. Fittingly, this station is dubbed 'Elysium', an allusion to the mythological segment of the afterlife reserved for the privileged relatives of Gods. The poor, meanwhile, live on planet earth, which has been reduced to an industrial wasteland rife with pollution, crime, unemployment and marauding gangs of criminals. The poor want to get to Elysium, the rich want to keep them out.<br/><br/>Enter Max (Matt Damon), an ex-con who works at a factory. As employee safety is last on the minds of his bosses, Max is injured at his job and given mere hours to live. Ticked off, and mad as hell, Max straps himself into a robot-suit, jumps aboard a space-ship, lands on Elysium and gets himself some sweet free health-care. Along the way he kills mercenaries, bureaucrats and instigates a little social reformation; Elysium's health-care is now accessible to each and every human being. Elsewhere the film contains a little allegorical subplot; Max must ""die so others may live"", a gesture which speaks to the film's message of self-sacrifice, altruism and old fashioned sharing.<br/><br/>Every major past and present mode of societal organisation has been but a giant energy accumulation system. Such systems (feudalism, monarchism, chattel slavery, mercantile and late capitalism etc) hinge on the organisation and exploitation of labour, and primarily act in the interests of a minority which organises its state apparatus for the oppression of the majority. In each case, such systems are deemed ""natural"" or ""moral"" by the vast majority of human beings. Those who exist within such systems tend to engage in denial, disavowal or tend to remain oblivious as to the workings of the system. Or to quote CLR James, at no point in human history has the vast majority of the planet not been misguided or outright wrong about its overriding belief or organising systems. Eventually, of course, such systems are condemned, forcing them to mutate, though they never break away cleanly from that which came before (there now exists, for example, more slaves globally than at the height of the slave trade). <br/><br/>Though set in the future, ""Elysium"" offers but an extremely cartoonish version of our contemporary world. Today, roughly eighty percent of the planet lives on less than ten dollars a day, even in MEDCs like the United States over 76 percent of the populace lives paycheck to paycheck, in all countries full employment is inherently impossible (with a 5 to 15 percent rate being deemed a systemic ""ideal""), and even in the First World, having 10 to 20 percent of your population in poverty is unavoidable. This is all accepted as standard operating procedure. <br/><br/>Whilst ""Elysium"" is well intentioned, its little tale of worker revolt (""Metropolis"", ""Viva Zapata"", ""Bread and Roses"" etc) is far too simplistic for our contemporary world. While Blomkamp's bashing bosses, today's cutting edge critiques of capitalism veer from neo-Marxian critiques (capitalism's many contradictions and cyclical tendencies) to ecological critiques (the absurdity of ""limitless growth"") to thermodynamic critiques (the systemic inherency of exponential debt creation, poverty and ""value"" destruction) to proponents of outright monetary reform (the absurdity of our contemporary central banking and interest-based currency creation systems). Scientists have even begun mapping the ""heat flows"" of money, providing insights too complex to get into here. Suffice to say, most of these angles are ignored by classical and neo-classical economists, or pundits who focus on micro-economics over the macro. With the ""experts"" so backwards, it's not surprising to find cinema's handling of these issues still firmly entrenched in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Still, you want old-fashioned rich-people-bashing, you got it. Damon has always been drawn to ""liberal action heroes"", but here he goes all out, sticking it to the One Percent with machine guns and hand grenades. Epitomising the superficiality of American liberalism, Damon then engages in a little financial redistribution. The welfare state, then, is offered as the only solution to the inanities of capitalism. Nevermind that, historically, such measures were implemented by the ruling class specifically to preserve capitalism, to prevent uprisings, to keep the game running, and that such ""well meaning redistributive policies"" must be as unsustainable as the system they are embedded within. No, in ""Eylsium"", food-stamps and Medicare save the day!<br/><br/>As politics, ""Elysium"" is dumb and heavy-handed. As a straightforward action movie, it's worse. Blomkamp's plot is unwieldy, bouncing from one MacGufin to the next, and his action scenes are derivative and lack even the mildest of thrills. Elsewhere, Damon's exo-suit is gratuitously shoehorned into Blomkamp's plot, and the film's villains are a dull trio. Jodie Foster costars in a role reminiscent of her work in ""Inside Man"", a better popcorn flick about race and class in America.<br/><br/>6/10 – Worth one viewing. See ""Land of the Dead"", ""The Molly Maguires"", ""La Chinoise"" and ""The Remains of the Day""."

","Do not read these reviews , make your own judgment. This movie is not about Elysium or Earth , this movie is about Max (Matt Damon) . People had unreal expectations. I was blown away by District 9 and this movie was no disappointment. In the way things are moving in todays world , the future envisioned by Neill Blomkamp seems quite accurate. Sharlto Copley plays the character of an Elisium marine (mind-fuc*ed by war or something) extremely well. It is a movie about people and their characters rather than the world they live in , if you want mindless junk then go check out avengers or spider-man. Of course there are plot holes, which sci-fi movie doesn't ?<br/><br/>My only complaint about this movie is the initial 10 minutes about Max's past which was too cliché<br/><br/>Sorry English is not my first language."
"burlesonjesse5","8","1","1","1 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Elysium
","With a somewhat original and visionary take on the sci-fi genre, Elysium gave me the ultimate spine-tingling feeling I've been hoping for in a summer movie. This flick has elements of other science fiction fare but it doesn't try to copy them, it just tries to add new perspectives. Director Neill Blomkamp (he shot the Academy Award nominated District 9) has a unique style all his own. He likes to bring a sort of dirty, non- pristine look to his films (not exactly the same but in a similar vein to what Ridley Scott did with Alien). And at the same time, the cinematography is undoubtedly top notch. Being that Blomkamp is from South Africa, the film I'm reviewing along with District 9 have the look and feel of one of its cities which is Johannesburg. So in a rare feat these days, Elysium combines effectively, the complicated elements of futuristic culture with stellar action sequences. Yes, this exercise can sometimes lose a little focus with its sort of jumbled storyline, but by the last half hour, everything seems to come together just fine. As I viewed this picture with its hair raising, horn-filled musical score, I was reminded (in a lightweight sort of way) of two classic films: The Road Warrior and Blade Runner. Again, Elysium does not copy off these films by any means. But it serves as a worthy companion to both of them (it has the distinction of feeling like a true dystopian flick and a post apocalyptic flick like the aforementioned movies).<br/><br/>Giving star Matt Damon a deglamorizing role to sink his teeth into, Elysium takes place in the year 2154. The planet has become split up into two completely different worlds. A beautiful space station called Elysium (of course), is tailor made for the wealthy and disease free. Then there is earth, a now poor, overly populated slum where the order that exists, projects misery to everyone living there. Damon's character (Max Da Costa) is propelled to take on a mission that might possibly bring the two worlds together and provide uniform equality. Here's the dilemma: he's got to get past a cold, icy Secretary of Defense (Jessica Delacourt played stiffly by Jodie Foster) and John Carlyle (William Fichtner), a misguided CEO of the Armadyne corporation (they built Elysium). I'm not going to give anything more away. You just have to know that Elysium's plot doesn't quite kick in immediately. You just have to be patient and let this concoction take you for a ride.<br/><br/>Harboring a solid enough cast, I would only consider Jodie Foster to be Elysium's weak link. She is a great actress no doubt about it, but this is not the Jody Foster we know and love. Saddled with an unnatural, uncomfortable screen presence and a silly accent (I guess it was British, but I could be wrong), this might be one of the worst performances she has ever given in her 40-plus year career. On the other end of the spectrum, there's Damon. I can say with confidence, that he has found the perfect role to enhance his attributes as a rough and rugged actor (the image of him firing machine guns in slow motion is pretty darn cool). He gets totally put through the wringer in this slam bang actioner and indelibly shines throughout (his character reminded me of his Jason Bourne but more vulnerable and living in the near distant future instead of present day).<br/><br/>With summer sort of coming to a close, I'm glad I took in a screening of Elysium. It's a refreshing and welcoming surprise considering what's been out lately at your local multiplex (in August, there hasn't been anything write to home about, that's my report). In a sense, this is a cunning, breathtaking, challenging, and exhilarating sci-fi trip par excellence. I truly want to see it again."
"sychonic","Null","1","1","15 April 2014"," Envy
","Envy. <br/><br/>The writers, the producers, the actors, nor the actors probably intended that one word to be the defining feature of the film, but that is what it is. Envy. As much as they wanted to create a rich fabric, a tapestry of social commentary of the current state of political affairs, they failed. <br/><br/>Though they dress it up with stock themes from left wing fantasies, the plot is simplistic. In about 140 years from now, the Earth has fallen into ruin. Why that happened is not explained, simply that Earth is now polluted, diseased, and overpopulated. As this degradation occurs, the rich and successful flee the planet and build a habitat in the sky, an ""Elysium"" – a variety of heaven from Greek Myth. <br/><br/>One can hardly blame them, since what they have left behind has become an admixture of the Road Warrior movies and the Gaza Strip. The story never quite explains what happens to most of the planet since the scenes only occur in southern California. That is of course offset by plot lines involving heartless and Machiavellian politicians, mindless robots, a faceless profit driven corporation, and a protective nativism (if one can call a space habitat refuge a native home). <br/><br/>Among the many parallels between this fiction of the future and the facts of the present, the denizens of this earth have little inclination to better, to improve, their own places, but would rather look to a place others have built in the sky, or look over the walls, and try and get there any way they can. Perhaps they believe it is easier to climb in through a window to illegally live in someone else's mansion than to build one's own home."
"view_and_review","6","1","1","13 March 2014"," Not Original but Worth Watching
","Elysium: ""any place or state of perfect happiness; paradise,"" as defined by Dictionary.com. <br/><br/>Based upon this definition, you can somewhat gather what the premise of the movie is. The year is 2154 and Earth is overpopulated, disease ridden and in disrepair. The world's wealthiest live in a fortified space station above earth called Elysium. There they enjoy every luxury including mechanisms that will cure them from almost, if not every, illness or injury. The people of Earth want to be there and the people of Elysium definitely do not want the Earth dwellers coming to their abode.<br/><br/>From the start of the movie I was thinking ""Dredd"" or even ""In Time"" with Justin Timberlake as the scenery and the plot reminded me of those two films. Initially, I was wondering where the conflict would come from and what it would be. I mean, even today the wealthy live in beautiful protected areas away from the general public and they typically don't want strangers invading their neighborhoods. Is that so wrong? <br/><br/>As the movie played out the conflict became clear. A movie needs one protagonist or more and one antagonist or more. It was clear who were supposed to be the protagonists and who were supposed to be the antagonists, but the writers and/or director had to really cement the fact that the protagonists were on Earth and the antagonists were on Elysium. So, in not so subtle fashion, they made the Elysium citizens depraved and nearly inhuman in their behavior and mannerisms. Essentially you were supposed to loathe Elysium and all it stood for. I think it was a little over the top and a bit unnecessary. Yes, wealthy people are going to make decisions and do things to protect their wealth, but that's not to say that they have no moral fiber whatsoever.<br/><br/>Putting that aspect of the movie aside, it did make for a riveting film after all. Eventually I was drawn into the saga and I was whole-heartedly pulling for the hero. There is a lot of symbolism and parallels in this movie to life as we know it now, some of them discrete and others are overtly obvious. The effects and graphics were a big plus. The robot police and guards were extremely human-like in their movements such that you would think they were people in robot costumes. And graphical representation of Earth and Elysium made the disparity between the two locations very pronounced. This movie, while not that original, is worth watching."

"drmnc1","6","1","1","5 February 2014"," The film that didn't have an ending.
","I saw the trailer for this, and I was really geared up for watching the film. Interesting though unoriginal story, dazzling dystopian and utopian views and a stellar cast. Unfortunately though, the film was let down by an all-over-the-place plot and a terrible ending (if that is what it can be called). I can't explain my frustration behind the ending without spoiling it, so read no further if you don't want to be spoiled.<br/><br/>The first issue that caught my attention was that I could see absolutely no way how the film could be resolved satisfactorily, and part of the reason why I wanted to see Elysium was because I wanted to see how things panned out in the end. Just breaking into Elysium and cutting the rich people down to size is far from a satisfactory ending.<br/><br/>It gives me absolutely no pleasure to say that I was right. The concept of the film was just complete nonsense and a complete oxymoron. Matt Damon runs around gormlessly for the second half of the film because even he knows that what he's doing doesn't make sense. HUGE SPOILER INCOMING. So he goes off on a one-way trip to Elysium to sacrifice his life so everybody on Earth can get citizenship to Elysium. What? What? So, what, these idiot directors believe that we're actually going to just absent-mindedly think ""Everyone on Earth gets free healthcare, citizenship and access to Elysium, happy ending! Yay!"" The whole concept of the film was just flawed from the start. Here are the main issues, unaddressed and unsolvable:<br/><br/>1.) So everyone gets to join the party now? How do these moron protagonists expect the whole population of Earth is going to get a ticket to Elysium and how would they even accommodate them all? It's as if there were no other people on Earth apart from those in Los Angeles. What about all the other of billions of people?! <br/><br/>2.) Who decides who gets the life-saving healthcare and resources first on Earth? How do they decide? Won't it create conflict? Even Elysium couldn't account for probably around ten billion deprived people all making the same demands at once. How will they re-build and prioritise the infrastructure of Earth? Again, who decides? This is another significant problem. <br/><br/>3.) If the researchers looked into population demographics, population momentum ensures that although better quality of life that is handed to the people of Earth from the revolutionary cancer-curing healthcare of Elysium comes with a lower birth rate. The population would continue to rise at a staggering rate, continue to explode as the planet continues to implode from squalor, overexploitation, in-fighting and population strain. Which was why the rich decided to segregate themselves from the rest of the planet in the first place.<br/><br/>So actually, Matt Damon achieves nothing. In fact, he probably creates more problems than they started with.<br/><br/>If you thought the film 300 was amazing: 300 Spartans taking with them over 10,000 Persians in the Battle of Thermopylae, you'll absolutely love this. Perhaps 6-7 men (and they were a rabble at that) and one rogue overthrew millions in the absolute fiasco that was the Battle of Elysium. I'm sick of this trash. Where were the robot guards? We saw a few when the ship landed, they got shot and that was it. Elysium's defences were non-existent. I'm sure only a dozen would have been enough to mop them all up.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the film was decent. The plot with Delacourt attempting to take over Elysium was clever and interesting (although it would have been nice to see what the citizens of Elysium thought about the whole Earth affair), and as that was reaching its climax, even that was cut abruptly and unceremoniously short. It seemed a habit. Whether it be a character, a plot line or an idea, everyone was quickly driven off a cliff and never mentioned again. <br/><br/>Major gripes over, otherwise Elysium was interesting (though flawed) conceptually, and there was some great set pieces and brilliant acting. It was heart-breaking at times, and others had us crying with laughter (robots are not empathetic when telling a person they have radiation sickness and are going to die within days). If they had stuck with the plot lines they had and added 15 minutes on the ending to resolve everything, it would have been an outstanding film."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","1","1","21 January 2014"," Although you'll know how it's going to end pretty much from the start, Elysium is still an OK film, but it did have some problems.....
","Los Angeles; 2154. Earth as we know it has become over populated and rife with pollution to name but a couple of problems. Those that are wealthy are given the option to live in an idyllic utopian society called Elysium which is situated in Space and has been man made to create a perfect living environment. Those that are poor are forced to endure the dreadful conditions on planet Earth.<br/><br/>Part of the problem for me with this film was the protagonist's motivations; we learn that Max (Matt Damon) wants to get to Elysium so that he can be cured from radiation poisoning (due to the fact that any disease or ailment can be cured on Elysium as long as you are a citizen). With the help of his friend Spider, Max is implanted with DNA which means that he will be registered as a citizen of Elysium meaning he will be able to cure himself once he arrives at Elysium. Spider agrees to assist Max as long as Max gets information from the brain of Armadyne CEO John Carlyle. Max agrees and equipped with an Exo Skeleton to increase his strength and a small team Max sets to work on recovering the information from Carlyle. OK here's the issue; Max is only motivated to go to Elysium when he is told he has 5 days to live and doesn't seem very interested in helping anyone else, he even refuses to help his life long friend's daughter from getting to Elysium (her daughter has leukaemia and she too only has a limited time to live). Whilst, I understand that he was being pursued and was perhaps worried that they would get caught in the crossfire between himself and Kruger, I still found it hard to warm to his character. He only helped them when they all end up being taken to Elysium when Frey and her daughter are captured by Kruger. I thought from the premise (and from the first 5 minutes of the film) that Max would take it upon himself to try to bring 'equality' to Earth and Elysium, sort of as a 'freedom fighter', but he turns things into a personal crusade and seemed very selfish generally as a person. I understand his necessity to help himself, but his cold nature was a problem for me. Considering he's the protagonist, I didn't exactly find him to be a likable person.<br/><br/>Second problem is that the film is called Elysium. OK, so how about we see some of this man made space station called Elysium? Apart from at the very start and a couple of times when space shuttles are crashing into it, what else did we see? I think it would have been nice to perhaps 'see the differences' between Elysium and Earth - when I say 'see' I mean beyond just looking at it - perhaps we could have been introduced to a few characters actually living on Elysium, check out what they got up to, how they lived. This was explored pretty well on Earth, but seemed to be ignored on Elysium. It just felt a little one sided.<br/><br/>Third problem - the camera work; oh it was shocking for the most part. There were a couple of times when I had to look away from the TV. I found it irritating to the point of distraction.<br/><br/>Where Elysium excels is in its visuals and cinematography so from a superficial perspective it's fantastic, but if you scratch beneath the surface it's not quite as pretty. Acting wise, I felt that Copley faired well as the barbaric Agent Kruger and Jodie Foster put in a good turn as Delacourt (Elysium's evil president). The story is predictable and you'll know how it's going to end pretty much from the start, but it's still watchable. <br/><br/>Inevitably, this film will be compared to Blomkamp's other major science fiction film District 9. I'm not going to go into details, but all I'll say is that District 9 was a masterpiece and Elysium is quite a long way off being anywhere near as good as D9. As a stand alone film, it's fairly good, but anyone who has watched this film after D9 is bound to be (at least) slightly disappointed."

","Obviously a story that has been told before, about rich people getting what they need while others suffer in poverty and are controlled by robots. But it was still great. Damon was awesome in it and I thought the story line was convincing and enjoyable. I loved the videography, the special effects and the action. It kept me engaged and watching. It made me feel anger and moved me to want to help. I was moved by the social aspect of it. Jodie Foster has such a limited role, Damon outshone her because of it. I would have liked to see her character developed a little more. Maybe there is more to the story about Elysium, it made me want more. I love good Sci-fi and this move is worth watching for its moral lesson. The end left me in tears."

","The standard for which we hold to movies is based upon what we are expecting of them. There are sci-fi classics, and there are sci-fi wonders, and there are sci-fi entertainments. Not every sci-fi movie has to hold up to one person's standard of expectations for ALL sci-fi films.<br/><br/>I do admit, I left the movie having enjoyed the movie greatly but also feeling that there was a lack of depth. But that is hardly anything to affect my rating of the movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed what I paid for. I would probably be willing to pay for the movie.<br/><br/>I believe there is a great story in the movie. But it's depth does get a little crowded out by the action and the visuals... but it is still there. I'm sure with multiple more viewings I will come to see more of the depth because I will not be distracted from everything else.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. It was hard for me to see the guy from D9 and A-team as the villain and take him seriously for a tough guy. But in the end he did a great job with his character.<br/><br/>I thought the other actors did a great job as well.<br/><br/>Of course, the action and visuals were amazing and worth the price to see on their own.<br/><br/>I did find a good level of emotion to the movie.<br/><br/>I feel like another 10-15 minutes to the movie could have been used to set up the characters better, including the side characters and add more depth to the movie's story.

"domienappelsien","2","4","9","19 September 2013"," One of the worst movies I've seen in a while
","Massive spoilers ahead! The main concept of Elysium is a dystopian future (a mere century from now, actually) where Earth has turned into an overpopulated, poor and diseased slum and a small group of super-rich people have managed to build a better life for themselves on a space station orbiting the planet, called Elysium. This space station, which looks suspiciously like a cross between the one from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and the Citadel from the ""Mass Effect"" games, comes complete with artificial gravity and air, gorgeous houses, beautiful gardens and lots of pretty women in bikinis. Perhaps if the film had spent more time on Elysium, it would at least have been more agreeable to look at. Instead, three quarters of it take place on Earth, more specifically the postapocalyptic garbage heap that is L.A., where hero Matt Damon is trying to make up for his previous life of crime by being a factory worker. Of course he also has a love interest and tries to prove to her that he is now a decent guy. In order to make us care more about the love interest, the movie gives her a cute, terminally ill daughter. Heavy-handed storytelling is an understatement, but I have to admit that the woman who plays the love-interest-nurse does an admirable job and at least made me care more about her and her daughter than about anyone else in the story, including the actual protagonist.<br/><br/>The concept of ""Elysium"" is not a bad one. Sure, dystopian futures are hardly original, but the main idea here is interesting. I was hoping that the film would tell us a bit more about this terrible future: its politics, what people are like on Elysium, how it got this far. It does none of these things. Instead it focuses entirely on profanity-spewing, muscular tough guys with tattoos who shoot each other all day long and talk in gravelly voices, emphasising words like ""fuck"" and ""kill"" a lot. The only people from Elysium given any time to do anything are Jodie Foster's one-dimensional arch-villain and her accomplice, some ridiculously caricature of a snob who dies in the middle of the movie. Foster's character gives the impression that she's sick of her job as protector of Elysium, and not in an ""I'm starting to have moral qualms about this whole thing"" kind of way, but just in a ""how many innocent civilians can you blow up before it just gets boring"" kind of way. So she sends out yet another caricature to do the dirty work: this time it's an alcohol-swilling, bazooka-wielding, South-African lowlife with a heavy accent.<br/><br/>Anyway, Matt Damon has an accident in the factory which will cause him to die in five days. This sets him on a quest to get to Elysium ASAP because they have technology there that can cure anyone in literally a few seconds... Of anything. Whether it's cancer or broken bones, all you need to do is lie down in a glass cabinet and -poof- you're healed. It's like walking over a heart in an old video game. Now I'm not even saying that every sci-fi film should be scientifically sound but if you're actually trying to comment on where we're headed as a society, and you're trying to present a bleak vision of a possible future, you should at least make some effort to be in the slightest bit credible. This wouldn't happen in Harry Potter. And it's not like the writer-director is ashamed of his painfully cheap solution to the world's health problems. In fact, he seems to be in love with it. In one of the most ridiculous scenes I have seen since ""The Room"", the South-African thug's entire face is blown off (shown in gory detail), so they put him in one of those medical thingamajigs and guess what? His face grows right back! Tadaa! This is not the only magical technology in the film (there is also the uploading and downloading of data straight from one man's brain into another) but this is so stupid, I thought I had fallen asleep and started having an absurd dream. But I checked with my girlfriend who was also there and unless she had the same dream, this is actually in the movie. Anyway, after long, long stretches of gritty action scenes set in ugly, graffiti-infested locales, the movie wraps up with Matt Damon sacrificing his life (*yawn*) and changing the whole system of Elysium so that now, the same medical technology that makes the inhabitants of Elysium so ridiculously immortal is given to everyone on Earth. Aww... And they lived happily ever after, the en-- wait a minute? Wasn't the big problem on Earth the massive overpopulation? And now they're going to make everyone immortal? And suddenly everything's solved? Apparently so, because the music signifies we have to be happy now and end credits have made their way to the screen already. What makes me so angry with this movie – besides the horribly clumsy action scenes where I can't see what's going on and I just get seasick – is that everything about it seems to shout that this is a serious, mature sci-fi thriller about pressing social and political issues (because it's GRITTY and THEMATIC, you know) but it has absolutely nothing intelligent to say. So you want to talk about the massive gap between the haves and the have-nots? At least show us something from both sides instead of just one-dimensionally vilifying all the rich and powerful. You say overpopulation is a problem? Then don't pretend you're solving anything by bringing physical immortality to the poverty-stricken, crime-infested masses. If this were just a simple dumb action movie, I would have still been bored, but I'd have shrugged and moved on, but the filmmakers want to make you feel they have made a statement about the world. This is not it. This is an insult."
"Dracolicious","6","4","9","16 August 2013"," Nothing unexpected
","Your typical movie set in the future with two different images of a dystopia and utopia. Story unfolds to how the audience would expect. The lead character Matt Damon living in the slums on Earth dreaming one day of going up to Elysium the utopia only for the selected elite class. Everything that happened was to be expected. From the lower class earthlings fighting for equality, to the elite class 'Elysiumzens' fighting them off to sustain their way of life. With the main idea being that earth was overpopulated hence Elysium was created, there were no scenes that reinforces this idea. Instead both Elysium and what was remaining on Earth seemed somewhat deserted. I did however like the opening scene where they showed what the overpopulated earth had become - the houses built stacked onto buildings. Despite the clear inequality that was shown, no one else besides Matt Damon seemed to dream about one day going to Elysium. The medication facilities seemed to be whats the most valuable desire of Elysium over Elysium the utopia itself. <br/><br/>Therefore overall it was a good movie, but nothing out of the ordinary. Story unfolds as one would expect it to. <br/><br/>What I found most amazing was how the young Matt Damon looked so much like Matt Damon. <br/><br/>Good movie, but would recommend to wait for DVD instead."

","This was an awful movie. Social commentary drives every character who resemble stereotypical socialist Utopian card board cut outs. The plot is insipid and predictable, the action sequences okay but the Matrix it's not. Even as a boring action movie it's boring. Don't waste even one minute on this garbage, it's better burned and or deleted. The character development and I think Jodie Fosters dialogue were dubbed (badly) with an indistinguishable accent that I am guessing was supposed to be French(?). <br/><br/>I'm not sure how else to disparage this movie without just saying it was a horrid story, horrid acting, characters who are unsympathetic. I was actually rooting for the good guys to get flattened by a truck. The producers, investors and directors of this travesty should be publicly flogged and their SAG cards confiscated."
"arnold-koger","3","3","6","6 December 2013"," Shallower than a baby pool
","Well, there isn't a whole lot to say about this movie. It turns out to be a typical CGI-heavy Hollywood production where producers, once again, thought that the CGI effects would carry the story. They never do, and they certainly don't in this movie. The story itself is so forgettable you'd think you're on roofies waking up the next day after submitting yourself to this snooze-fest.<br/><br/>The most protruding attribute of ""Elysium"" is its constant and unrelenting shallowness. The characters, in particular, are ill-conceived and don't have any kind of depth. In the end, we do not care whether the little girl gets healed or not, whether our ""hero"" dies or whether the earth population, that appears to be made out of Mexicans only, prevails. I personally found the Elysium habitat extremely boring: people just seem to be on an extended vacation, lingering around, not showing any kind of productivity. In the end, I rooted for the robots to blow everything up (10 minutes of this nonsense might even have been a good Terminator prequel)...<br/><br/>As stated, the characters were unremarkable, but so was the acting. Matt Damon provided us with a wooden and lackluster performance, alternated with interludes of hammy overacting and weird facial expressions. Jodie Foster looked scared most of the time with her ""Panic Room"" face on. She never appeared threatening and it was just a question of time until someone ""put her in her place"". The South African ""secret agent"" gave it his best shot, but, due to his heavy accent, some scenes that should have been serious or pathetic came across as involuntary comedy. I'm not sure that he was intended as comic relief, but who knows what went on in the minds of the producers... The rest of the cast was instantly forgettable, the ""Mexicans"" were more of a cliché than individuals.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a ""3"" due to the fact that the sphere looked fairly interesting (although the involved ""science"" is laughable) and because I am feeling generous today."
"jackasstrange","5","3","6","5 December 2013"," Big deception, nowhere near the level of District 9
","I genuinely felt insulted after watching this cliché guided film with a running time of apparently interminable 109 minutes. Everything on Elysium was done in past films, and done much better. It looks like Blomkamp decided to mix up the hacker concept from The Matrix, the Wachowski classic Sci-Fi film, with some of the visuals and the 'fast cure' conception from the unconventional Sci-Fi film by François Truffaut 'Fahrenheit 451', and it has even a lot of digested subjects used in District 9 that are used again here in Elysium. The film was lazy made in the creation aspects, as you can see.<br/><br/>The character development is incredibly obscure; the film don't reveals nothing important or attractive about the life of the character, so the viewer barely knows who this zero personality and extremely apathetic protagonist is, you just know of course that he is going to lead something great and probably will need to sacrifice himself in order to save the earth. OK, i couldn't care less. Matt Damon does not help either, he brings the enthusiasm of a sloth to his role. Copley was a cartoon like villain, but cartoon is perhaps a definition that all the characters he play may receive. He is good playing the over the top guy, though.<br/><br/>Some parts does not even make sense. Sharlto character's letting the protagonist escape without any reasons is one of them. And Elysium should be a much better prepared place than it really was. I mean, five dudes almost blew up the entire thing. <br/><br/>And the worst part is that this film is totally predictable and cliché. You know exactly how it is going to end, because it has so many overused ideas that it seems impossible to NOT predict what is going to happen next. What happened with the creativity?!<br/><br/>Well, the cast overall was average or above average at best. Definitely nothing remarkable in that aspect. The cinematography is meh, nothing that can't be seen better made in like twenty films in this year alone.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this film. Go watch District 9 instead. 5.3/ 10."

","The visuals, graphics, and action was good. The acting from Matt Damon was a bit sluggish. The story was garbage though. It made no sense for greedy rich people to keep earth its consumer base so poor that they would loose money. They have super articulate robots that could do almost everything from building more robots to making the earth a paradise but instead the simply use slave human labor that is slow, weak and inefficient. I guess none of the billionaire on Elysium would have thought of that? It is ridiculous the lengths that liberals must go to in order to inject their propaganda into Hollywood. The rich in Elysium have advanced so far technologically that they have re-atomizers but they can't spare any technology for humans on earth despite the huge pool of resources that even the evilest of rich people would have noticed. They can't even figure out decent contraception for the dirty earthlings. Also why are most dirty earthlings Hispanic with tattoos while the overlords are mostly white. Another attempt at race baiting as well. what the hell can't I just watch a movie without all the BS propaganda."
"danew13","6","3","6","9 November 2013"," A Wasted Attempt at Picturing a Possible Future World
","Elysium's main plus point was, as with Blade Runner, picturing what an over crowded world may look like. But it didn't delve anywhere as deep at Blade Runner.Instead of dwelling on one or two issues it took superficial swipes at several social problems without seeing people.<br/><br/>We are given a now typical dystopian view of Los Angeles, where appropriately the street language has become Spanish since illegal aliens have apparently taken over the town.<br/><br/>This has caused the power brokers and old money to decamp from Beverly Hills, I guess, to a massive space station version of Beverly Hills. But we never see the rich at play or work.In fact we never see much of this fabulous station. We just see a few leaders such as Jodie Foster, in what must be her worst role.<br/><br/>The sad aspect is this is a very real possibility for a future world. In South Africa the wealthy white minority lives in gated guarded communities. Does this point to a bleak worldwide future? Matt Damon's character isn't a heroic type.

"alanjk-2","4","3","6","24 August 2013"," Deluxe Far-leftist Political agenda run-amok!
","Save Your Money! I went to Elysium expecting a decent movie. What I got was trite, stereotyped, and a thinly veiled far-leftist political rant masquerading as an action film. Matt Damon, Jodie Foster (who admittedly does look an incredibly fetching 50) are totally ""on-board with this agenda so let's make a 2 hour politically brainwashing infomercial. The many attempts the movie made to state political or historical simile fell abysmally flat. First, there was the ""evil rich"" vs the ""virtuous, enslaved poor."" (Kinda like watching MSNBC nightly news ;-D) Then the Director plays ""Homeland Security as psychotic, rapist, murdering thugs."" The plot thins when ""withholding medical care from the poor because they're evil,"" gets launched. Finally there's a Moses or MLK-like ""I may not get to the Promised Land with you..."" attempt which falls on its face. The story line is trite, hackneyed illogical and weak tripe. This aside, one needs delve into why all this and Blomkamp's ideas are still deeply rooted in his native South Africa and his Afrikaner heritage, and in Elysium he sticks it hard to his own people. The leading bad-guy, ""Kruger"", with his thick Afrikaner accent, is cast as the evil, violent relic of Apartheid days past. ""Kruger"" is of course an allusion to Paul Kruger, the father of the nationalist Afrikaner homeland that was eventually bally brought down by the British in 1902. Similar to the aims of the French FN party, Kruger's short-lived Transvaal Republic was established with the intent of preserving Afrikaans culture from invading British and native black cultures. Sadly, it failed. (So did eventually Apartheid, nearly 20 years ago- but apparently Apartheid can never really die in the minds of liberals such as Blomkamp, as they always need some kind of ""white racist whipping boy"" aka. ""cracker"" at their disposal on which to blame the world's ills, nevermind the profound failures and overt racism found in many black/minority run governments, especially ""modern"" South Africa.) Good riddance say the multi-culturalist pot melters. But their own native culture is precisely what nearly every modern nation (rich and poor) is struggling desperately to preserve, as the forces of globalization slowly erase borders. With modern-day South Africa, which has a very real immigration problem now because of its relative economic success (due to the infrastructure colonialism built) compared to the rest of Africa, South Africa is viewed as a land of opportunity for other Africans- similar to the USA, except that the unwashed hordes yearning to be free, flow in from the north rather than the south. But legal and illegal immigration into South Africa has caused a very negative reaction among native people in the country- mostly from poorer blacks, who fear that the even poorer blacks from the north, who are willing to work for even lower wages, will take precious jobs away from the natives. There have been gruesome attacks on immigrants by angry black South Africans. Social scientists call this phenomenon ""xenophobia"", but Africans know this simply as ""tribalism"" (which is just hate/racism without the litmus of color) and which has been a long-standing feature on the continent. Of course, this kind of intra-minority intolerance flies in the face of liberal mythology, and thus does not get any airtime in Elysium. At least in District 9, Blomkamp attempted a more honest rendering of the topic. For example, the Nigerian gangsters in the movie were definitely bad guys, even though they too were illegal immigrants who came to South Africa for opportunity. This is consistent with real life, where native South Africans (black and white) perceive immigrant Nigerians as fly-by-night scammers and drug dealers. And then there's the character of Wicus, the white Afrikaner who, while having his share of politically incorrect moments, was at least honestly trying to do what he thought was morally right (not unlike the original Afrikaners, who were devout Christians). And you may have noticed that many of the police who were killing the ""Prawns"" were in fact black. Again, this measures up against real life, where it is teams of black/colored South African police that have shot and killed striking miners and farm workers in recent months- all of whom are black, and some of whom are immigrants from much poorer countries to the north.<br/><br/>Thus, the reality of the immigration/class/race debate is complex, and I thank Blomkamp for at least trying to give it fair treatment in District 9. But we got none of this in Elysium, which is 100% in-your-face progressive American liberal propaganda. No balance or subtlety whatsoever. No attempt at presenting the conservative perspective on illegal immigration and socialized healthcare. No attempt at seeing the owners of industry as anything but detached, selfish slave-drivers. The takeaway from the film is simply that rich people are evil elitists- the ""1%"", who are resoundingly white (and racist, naturally)- and that immigration and healthcare should be universal human rights (paid for by rich people, of course), because if they don't, poor immigrant children will suffer and die. (So Boo hoo. Gosh, if only more white people like Matt Damon would stand up and do the right thing and support fascist communists like Obama and give ""free health care to the poor"" yeah? That's what this not-so-subtle message is ALL about)."

No. Just NO! <br/><br/>As a South African, Copely's characterisation would have over-the-top if this had have been a spoof of a bad 1970s ""Boetie gaan border toe"" style film. (A reference to the young white South African men who had to do two years military service in the SA bush war).<br/><br/>But in this context it is taken even beyond a spoof into outright cringe-worthiness. Quite bluntly I was embarrassed to even watch this movie when seeing Copely's character.<br/><br/>Then I realised it was by the same director as District 9.... When this was done in District 9 (to a lesser degree) it worked because in District 9 this type of heavy handed over play worked because the whole of District 9 was a send-up of all of the things about our history and culture that we should think about and our laughter was tinged with guilt.<br/><br/>But there is not much that is funny about this movie and the director has embarrassed South Africawith a junk characterisation that one wouldn't even come across in this day and age - never mind in the 150 year's time. (Not because we don't have our home grown psychopaths - but because they certainly don't talk like that and anyone behaving like that even now would be locked up in the loony-bin!) It's just plain ridiculous.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, character extension and plot progression.... Just really, really bad.

For example, if the technology has advanced so much that something like Elysium could be created then why do they need someone like agent Kruger to shoot missiles. Missiles are launched automatically now but not in future according to the writer and need someone to shoulder launch them! Homes could be invaded easily without any security systems going off! They do now. Do we regress in future? Why transport data through someone's brain? What happened to future WiFi or blue tooth! We send data to satellites in space and they send data to us now!

","Neill Blomkamp plummeted to the movie-event scene in 2009 with the interesting-concept, blandly-executed District 9. Sure, the first act is quite good with its documentary style of exposition, but then it gets tiring, realises that and awkwardly abandons it for an action movie instead. Nevertheless, on rewatch, Sharlto Copley is the one that holds it together so I'm quite glad he rejoins Blomkamp again for Elysium, this time as the antagonist where I'm still not sure he belongs. In the lead, a more experienced action actor, Matt Damon, who's always reliable in this type of role bringing a sense of humour to an otherwise humourless film and a sincerity to his pain and struggle. However, although Blomkamp wisely decides not to paint himself in a corner and start with a certain style and fizzle out again, opting for an all-out action style, it doesn't feel like a fully fleshed out world and just a high concept.<br/><br/>It's a world where characters often make decisions that are obviously designed to put themselves in danger. It's quite frustratingly contrived to get to where it wants to go and its on-the-nose comments on shared healthcare across classes is almost cringeworthy in its sentimental and overly simple execution. While Jodie Foster is getting the biggest bad rap for how misguided the way the Elysium residents were directed, the real criminals are the dreadful over-the-top performances from William Fichtner and Wagner Moura. But still, the special effects are rather exciting, which is an aspect District 9 is also undoubtedly notable for, and it is an entertaining film when you stop trying to think about it too much. Nevertheless, I'm sure Neill Blomkamp will enjoy his crown as the King of half-baked popcorn sci-fi as his ambitions don't seem to stretch much further.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This futuristic film presents us with a dystopian vision of a future Earth which is overpopulated and polluted. There is however also a utopia, 'Elysium', which orbits Earth and is the home of a rich elite who have had it built and now have a carefree existence living there.<br/><br/>Film opens with shots of a young boy who bears a remarkable resemblance to Matt Damon the star of this film. Earth has been in a bad state all of his life and his desire is to go to Elysium. People on earth do go to Elysium though. However they do this illegally. If they pay enough money to the people-smugglers they get taken on craft that fly illegally to the artificial world and sneak in.<br/><br/>Trying to stop the illegal immigrants and deal with other security matters, are the security personnel. They are human and robotic, and are based, and act, on both Earth and Elysium.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays the part of a simple worker, luckier than most of his unemployed fellow neighbours living in the slum, an ex-criminal who has now turned his back on crime. However his life and work are both hard and dangerous. Life on Earth is cheap, and unlike on Elysium, by contrast the medical services are poor.<br/><br/>Worker Damon suffers an industrial injury that requires treatment and is the plot device that requires him to travel to Elysium. There is a plan to get him there but things don't work out as planned.<br/><br/>In some ways this film reminded this reviewer of 'Demolition Man'. In this futuristic film, just like 'DM', the people are politely nasty. They are abrupt, rude and very plain-speaking, but all this is done in a very polite way of speaking. Some of the time anyway.<br/><br/>Casting has been done in such a way as to emphasize the points that the story is trying to make. The people of Earth inhabit slums and shanty-towns. They look like poor immigrants and peasants anywhere. By contrast up in Elysium the people look and sound very different. Accents and language also play a part in illustrating this.<br/><br/>Earth is crime-ridden and covered in graffiti, whilst Elysium is a peaceful haven. So for Elysium to be protected from the violent gun-wielding people of Earth, Elysium must also use some violence for protection. This requires not just robots, but also human security and military personnel. These military operatives, and their world, and outlook, are portrayed well, and stereotypical casting and accent choices make their attitudes and role unambiguous to the viewer. They also function in this film to pose the question to the viewer of the role of the military in society.<br/><br/>Star Matt Damon gives a great performance in his role as a simple worker. However some of the decisions of our simple worker do not impress. His judgements are a little too simple and he makes some bad decisions. Damon is well supported by a good cast. The great Jodie Foster has second billing, however her character is strange and even stranger is how the film-makers have used Miss Foster. A powerful performance came from Sharlto Copley who dominated in every scene he was in. This reviewer was happy too, to see William Fichtner, a well-recognized face, that this reviewer last saw giving a tremendous performance in 'Heat'.<br/><br/>With all the robots, this film reminded this reviewer of 'Oblivion' from earlier this year. There was a similar theme of a dirty Earth below and a shiny top-world. However this film is somewhat less unoriginal. Some scenes also reminded this reviewer of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' another film from earlier this year. However unlike that film this seemed less of just a collection of action scenes, though dumb decisions by characters did cause some of that.<br/><br/>The film set up the hero to have some serious fights with a seriously bad guy. Just like 'Demolition Man', sadly however, some fight scenes were filmed in such a way that it was difficult to even see what was happening, they were that fast. Special effects concerning the gadgets were all uniformly good. The high-tech gear, the low-tech salvaged gear, the flying machines; all were totally believable throughout the film. One item that jarred was the total absence of background music. Instead we were attacked by very loud music that was far too intrusive. On the other hand, all scenes, sets and locations were good, particularly of the grim cities of Earth.<br/><br/>Better than the comparable 'Oblivion', it is on a par with 'Star Trek Into Darkness' and 'World War Z'. Rather like 'WWZ', the narrative of this film gives us comparisons with present day Earth and it's problems, and poses the question at what cost can you build a utopia, when is the cost too high, and how do you balance the rights and duties of the people within the utopia, with the rights and duties to those who are outside of it? 8/10."

Cut us some slack here.<br/><br/>That things happened with totally unbelievable coincidence really displayed a script desperately searching for some continuity...a good rewrite might have saved this.

It could have been very good.<br/><br/>Most of the acting was credible. A few characters were overdone, especially Foster's...victims again of an immature script. Overall the movie could have been so much better had they found a way to introduce some medical verisimilitude ---Damon's face didn't even have contusions after being brutalized by the arch villain of the film---and some plot credibility.<br/><br/>I so wanted to like this film.

","Director Neill Blomkamp set the world on fire in 2009 with his surprise sci-fi box office hit District 9, which would later collect four Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Now in 2013, Blomkamp has returned with a new sci-fi film, Elysium, with names people know, including Matt Damon and Jodie Foster.<br/><br/>Elysium's exposition shows us that in the late 21st century, Earth has become overpopulated and terrible to the point where only the rich can go to a fancy space station called Elysium, where they also have Med-Pods that cure people almost instantly. The film then focuses on Max (Matt Damon), an ex-con who lives in an overpopulated and devastated Los Angeles. Max works for Armadyne, the company who provides robots and weapons to Elysium. On his way to work, Max is stopped by robot police officers and an altercation results in a broken arm. While at the rundown hospital in Los Angeles, Max reconnects with a childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), who has a daughter dying from leukemia.<br/><br/>When some ships try to illegally bring Earth citizens to Elysium, Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) orders sleeper agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to shoot down the ships as they return. Shortly after, the president yells at Delacourt and fires Kruger. Delacourt is out to be sure that Elysium is protected and her integrity is intact. Delacourt then convinces billionaire John Carlyle (William Fichtner) to write a program that will make her president and in return, Elysium's contract with Armadyne is renewed for 200 more years. Carlyle does so, and keeps it in his head (literally) until he returns to Elysium.<br/><br/>After Max is forced into a task he doesn't wish to do, he exposed to a deadly level of radiation and is told he only has five days left to live. Max then seeks the help of Spider (Wagner Moura) to get him to a Med-Pod. The film then primarily is about Max's mission to make it to Elysium to be saved and make things right.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp shows his excellence as a storyteller and shows his expertise in the sci-fi genre. He knows how to keep the story interesting and as a writer, knew how to keep the story flowing. Blomkamp shows that he is a directing talent to be kept an eye on for a long time, and I look forward to whatever he makes next. If I had to pick between Blomkamp's two films, I still pick District 9.<br/><br/>Matt Damon as the lead in this film shows why he is one of today's best leading men. While Max is not as much of a stretch compared to other roles he has done, it shows that Damon can still lead the film, and works great with his on screen partners. Jodie Foster is quite different in her role as the ruthless Delacourt, who will stop at nothing to keep Elysium entitled to only the rich. She shows that she is still one of the best living actresses. Sharlto Copley is the MVP as Kruger the bounty hunter. I loved how I had no idea what Kruger was going to do next, thanks to Copley's menacing take on the character.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, there are many great things about Elysium. DP Trent Opaloch does some very nice camera work here. The editing by Julian Clarke and Lee Smith is exciting and does great at keeping a nice pace. I think the best of all the technical aesthetics was the production design by Philip Ivey."

","Elysium is, in a word, disappointing. After the originality of District 9, I (and most everyone) expected more from Neill Blomkamp. However, it is not quite fair to judge the film based on a comparison to its predecessor. With that in mind, let's be objective.<br/><br/>The two A-listers in Elysium are Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Damon plays an ex-con named Max, trying to keep his life on the straight and narrow. He has a manufacturing job producing the mechanized police force that keeps everyone on Earth and Elysium in check. Foster is the grim Secretary of Defense of Elysium, a giant space station where all the wealthiest people of Earth have fled. She is in charge of immigration to Elysium, and she has no love of illegals.<br/><br/>Typically, the protagonist is a round character – a character that undergoes a personal transformation. But in Elysium, Max is a flat character – an unchanging character, used as a narrative ""prop"" for contrast. All of the characters, in fact, are flat, which makes them very hard to feel for or connect with...<br/><br/>For the rest, check out our blog at: http://www.theeighthrule.com/elysium/"

District 9 wasn't perfect, but it was full of grim humour and oddball characters, and it was driven by a plot as wild as a rabid dog. Elysium dispenses almost entirely with humour (the sole laugh in our auditorium came two minutes from the end), throws together a bunch of bland stock characters, and its plot is as predictable as its Zimmer-lite musical score.<br/><br/>""This is now,"" says Blomkamp.

An avoidable accident at work leaves Max (Matt Damon) lethally irradiated. Only Elysium can save him - except he's not a citizen, so he must turn to the local gangsters for help. Max can take down ""The System"" and save the world. And off he goes, amped to the... err... max inside an Iron Man-style exoskeleton.<br/><br/>There are really bad things about the film. Jodie Foster, an actor I thought incapable of being poor, puts in agonising performance as Jessica Delacourt, her movements twitchy, her delivery uncertain, and her accent visiting every corner of the globe. She's not helped by the script, whose dialogue ranges from the banal to the excruciating, and which is dominated by contrivances, coincidences, and unclear motivations.<br/><br/>Damon is fine in a hero role he could do in his sleep - which, given the amount of time Max spends on his knees or unconscious, is practically what he does. When he clunks into spasms of action the movie briefly comes alive. But while the action scenes have weight and some imagination, they are mostly shot in the infuriating hand-held style, combined with hyperactive editing, which makes them difficult to follow.<br/><br/>If ever there was a movie that was screaming out for Paul Verhoeven to come along and inject some wit, energy, and clarity, it's this one. There are themes in this movie, but they aren't explored, they're presented - or, worse, preached. What could have been simple, satirical super-hybrid face-off in the vein of Battle Angel Alita turns out to be another drab appeal to the senses, none of which are stimulated, with or without neural implants."
"mecheart","5","3","6","17 August 2013"," An assay of class warfare of our own era disguised as eye candy science fiction
","Many science fiction films have been based on quintessential novels of the genre fueled by plotting intended as in depth treatments on the most impactful social problems of the era in which they were written. Often, by the time the translation to film has occurred the urgency or relevancy of their messages to the current generation gone to see them on the sliver screen have been lost.<br/><br/>While 'Elysium' is not based on a classic novel of the genre, writer/director Neill Blomkamp presents his sophomoric science fiction feature as if its visual representation of a dystopian society where the rich live in a Mount Olympus like garden of eden and the rest of everyone else occupies hell on earth, as if it is towing a weighty line for the nonexistent literary classic it is not based on after all.<br/><br/>The overall tone of the film, while deadly serious throughout, trades moments of expected high drama for a sometimes buoyant humor that feels placed only to reap laughs at less than stellar one liners spouted in the form of most action films you're familiar with. Indeed, the humor present does not at all suit the violence committed alongside it or in step with it - in a few scenes. In one such scene as a robot policemen seriously injures the protagonist, he cracks jokes even as his bones break.<br/><br/>From the opening act onward the narrative instills in the viewer a sense that a lowly impoverished ex-con in the protagonist, is going to seize some momentous epiphany so colossal it will enable him to shake the halls of the gods themselves. The foreshadowing is plainly laid down for the viewer, and because he has seen this setup in other heroic movie plots, his mind races to get slightly ahead of the protagonist's ascension to mystic warrior, yet such never comes in the expected form. The manner in which it does finally arrive feels wholly underwhelming, undeserved, and accidental. Any of hundreds of men or women shown us by the film could have achieved the same end.<br/><br/>Visually 'Elysium'stuns with first rate computer generated spacecraft and robotic bipeds perhaps the most well rendered in any science fiction film in recent memory. Particles dance from the nozzles of hovering ships and shards of metal fly from damaged androids. The effects certainly impress.<br/><br/>However design of the titular orbiting Garden of Eden was very obviously drawn from the ring world in the HALO series of video games and appeared neither realistic nor functional with its lush estates and forested parks somehow open to the void of space.<br/><br/>As for the premise itself ... supposedly in the future world of 'Elysium' the earth is a wasteland abandoned by the wealthy for the paradise of the aforementioned orbiting space station. What left me puzzled most were shots of the ""ruined"" planet earth which seemed plenty habitable enough. The masses of poor denied nirvana on elysium station wore no breathing apparatus against polluted air, moved healthily enough around their shanty neighborhoods, and no mention was ever made of irradiated wastes or a failed ozone layer. What made this future earth so harsh and inhospitable? The movie never shows or tells us.<br/><br/>Main character 'Max' played as Matt Damon - by Matt Damon - is an ex-con machine shop worker who is the sole remaining Caucasian inhabitant of future Los Angeles (or so it seems). Flashbacks show him growing up with a Spanish speaking guardian and beautiful Hispanic girl now nurse, 'Frey' played by Alice Braga, who reminds me very wonderfully of Maria Conchita Alonso.<br/><br/>Max's criminal past as a serial car thief refuses to let him go, and one day a ghastly workplace accident leaves him with no choice but to try and get up to elysium for medical care not available on earth. Though rendered almost completely unable to move under his own power, a way is given him to perform one last heist with the payoff he seeks as reward.<br/><br/>A mention of suspension of disbelief is due here. A number of dare I say wacky events occur which defy the laws of reasonable belief. Now, because 'Elysium' is a science fiction epic, you'd expect far fetched goings on. Not an issue so long as some even brief explanation of the technology involved is presented. Rather than provide the viewer with some ""this is why that can do this crazy thing"" 'Elysium' tells us to believe in it because it is set in the future. Well, in the future shoulder fired rockets can take down spacecraft well out of the earth's atmosphere.<br/><br/>Most of the rest of the cast is watchable if not necessary to the plot or likable. Psychotic assassion 'Kruger' played by Sharlto Copley may be a merciless mass murderer, yet his high pitched thickly accented voice draws humor instead of horror. Secretary of Defense on-board Elysium 'Delacourt' played woodenly by Jodie Foster was highly unnecessary to the plot. She's a real bad girl who delights in smashing the hopes and bodies of the poor; why Foster attached herself to the film is a relevant question.<br/><br/>Like most avid science fiction fans I can't get enough future thrills, kills and tech from print or silver screen. Unfortunately 'Elysium' is neither a filling nor pleasant genre fix. At its heart it is a cruel story which conducts its study of the disparity between rich and poor, entitled and impoverished with sledgehammer instead of subtle brush strokes to convey its message. Much like Blomkamp's 'District 9' 'Elysium' portrays the South African as a genocidal, jackboot wearing specimen of the human race.<br/><br/>Five out of ten stars for amazing special effects and Alice Braga's channeling of Maria Conchita Alonso.<br/><br/>Recommendations suspended, as unless you watch this film for the effects alone, it will disappoint you."
"jdkraus","6","3","6","16 August 2013"," Filled with clichés and a pretentious message
","""Elysium"" takes place in the year 2154. The wealthy live on an utopia ring-shaped space station where their is no poverty or sickness. This is Elysium. On earth, resides everyone else. One man, who has little time left, embarks on a journey that could create a bridge between both societies. Elysium after all is the place where to postpone mortality. Millions desire such an option. The concept is interesting but its delivery and undertones rub me the wrong way. Why? All the people who live on Elysium are Caucasians led by a power-hungry Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster). The majority of the people depicted on earth are poor, disheveled, crime-ridden Latinos, except of course for Matt Damon's character Max. Coincidence or planned by writer and director Neill Blomkamp, this seems to be a futuristic retelling of the US and Mexico immigration problem gone awry. <br/><br/>I am sure I'm not only person who notices this. ""District 9"", Blomkamp's 2009 breakthrough film is not so much different than ""Elysium."" Instead, of white people and Latinos, it was oppressed aliens and violent Africans. Either way, immigration gone wrong and the inhumanity towards different races is a common theme for Mr. Blomkamp's movies. It is a noble topic to explore, but it is delivered in a such a way that it feels demeaning and pretentious. The figures that run Elysium are depicted as caricature isolationists that are willing to kill in order to preserve their perfect society whereas all the poor suffering earthlings are all good people who have no choice but to result to thuggery in order to survive. The movie runs into the clichéd scenario of rich versus poor. <br/><br/>Even more clichéd are some of the later plot devices and characters. Jodie Foster plays the typical stuck up witch and Sharlton Copley as her crazy henchman revives the badass head mercenary from ""District 9"". Diego Luna plays Max's caring friend to the tee, and Wagner Mourna, the high-tech sidekick, is like a mastermind with too many television sets and too much red bull. As for Damon himself, he does fine. Playing a feeble anti-hero in the first half and then a heroic ass kicking fighter in the second half works to his advantage. After all, he played Jason Bourne right? The performances aren't all that bad, just not that memorable. I get the vibe that the actors were hired to have more fun with their roles rather than take them seriously.<br/><br/>What works for ""Elysium"" is the gritty raw visual style that Blomkamp has brought for us to the screen. Sure, the movie feels like the unofficial sequel to ""District 9,"" but it is still fun. I can never get tired of exploding human bodies, cuts between jerky hand-held and cool slow-motion, or even trashed invested regions. The Visual Effects are another positive addition. When it came to the action scenes, the lines between CGI and animatronics for the robots became blurred. The VFX is that good. While I do not much care for the underlying tones for Neil Blomkamp's new movie, I cannot deny that I found it entertaining."
"jmyersgoucheredu","7","3","6","13 August 2013"," More character, less action, please.
","This is an enjoyable movie that uses science fiction, as it is often used, to present an allegory of what 21st-century America has become since Ronald Reagan began what has eventually turned into the Tea Party. We have walls to keep out illegal aliens; the 1% living in a paradise they think is separated from the great unwashed; unsafe working conditions that lead to the deaths of workers who produce goods for the 1%;medical care available only for the 1%. The characters include an ineffectual President clearly modeled on a liberal fantasy about an Obama who is powerless to do anything. Jodi Foster is a combination of Hillary Clinton and Dick Cheney, ruthlessly combining Homeland Security and the State Department. There is even a weapon-obsessed Tea Party type who is a tool of the powers that be--a tool who gets out of their control. Much more could have and should have been done to develop these characters; Matt Damon's heroic orphan and hero of the people, Max, is the only character developed to any extent. And this is what keeps the movie from being great: character development is sacrificed for the sake of fight scenes. Still enjoyable and even moving, but it could have been much better."

","District 9 set the bar pretty high with its unique, semi-documentary point of view, bumbling yet likable protagonist, absurdly powerful weapons, and a robot fight scene that I wish could have gone on for another hour. Unfortunately Elysium failed to come anywhere near the the bar set by D9. All the in-your-face political and social bias aside (what Hollywood film doesn't deliver that in spades these days)?, Elysium simply fails to deliver, placing it squarely in the sci-fi junk pile. I hated the acting, the story line, the characters, the plot holes, the over-the-top shaky cam, and even the action sequences. If you've seen the trailer then you have seen the best this movie has to offer. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money watching this film."

","Minor spoilers used!<br/><br/>Books are almost always better than movies. They have no real time constraints, they have the best CG in the world (your imagination) and you almost always have more detail.<br/><br/>Elysium was a let down for me. How can people spent 10's or 100's of millions of dollars on a movie and have so many holes? It also reminded me of a Johnny Mnemonic too much, but with out the dolphin.<br/><br/>The visuals of this movie are awesome, but the characters and technology used by the characters were a let down.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's character was angry all the time, as if she needed to get laid. Her character only had one gear, but then maybe the book gave more depth to the character? Maybe she was cast wrong for this movie?<br/><br/>Matt Damon was good but he didn't have that rough feel to his character. Yeah he had tattoos, but he had an awesome body. Where does a person like him get the time to work out? To make myself ready for this part I would have let myself go a bit. He doesn't look the part of being a ""typical Joe turned saved the world hero"".<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley played an awesome antagonist. Really. I mean kudos to him on a part well played. He was rough, cruel, psychotic... I was really anticipating his characters death. I really hated his character, as in, ""die you SOB die!""<br/><br/>However, I think the death of Kruger (Copley) was weak. Again, I didn't read the book, but tossing him over the edge and having him blow up is, well, ""huh?"".<br/><br/>I find this the biggest let down of the entire movie. Why work the crowd up in to hating this villain then making his death so impersonal? I was hoping to see Matt Damon's character crush his skull and have his brains pop out.<br/><br/>The technology used was cool, but there were many questions left unanswered (which again I'm sure the book explained):<br/><br/>1) why do doors on Elysium only use 4 digits to lock? 2) why did William Fichtner's character put a ""terminal"" code in to the download (which was there for the purposes of killing the hero), when it would have killed him also? Wouldn't it have been better to have Matt Damon's character die from a technical malfunction? 3) why is Jodie Foster's character using rockets from the ground to shoot down transports when Elysium was supposed to have its own defense system? And no, no and no to your responses. 4) Why is radiation being used in the assembly of robots? 5) Why is Elysium's scanning Earth at the end? How does it know X number of people need help? Even then, it would take months to figure out the number of sick people rather than seconds.<br/><br/>The list of flaws and bugs goes on and on with this movie making it suck for me; but again the book is probably better.<br/><br/>CG - 1 Direction - 0 Acting - 1 (for Sharlto Copley) Script - 1 Action - 1 Continuity - 0 Use of technology - (-1) The death of Kruger was weak - (-1)<br/><br/>2 of 8"

The characters were driven by purpose and the directing was flawless. If you go to a movie looking for faults, you will probably have a hard time ever being satisfied. If you are like me and want to be stimulated and entertained and just need a believable film to do so, then watch this movie! No, it is not like District 9, which is a good thing! It is its own movie and should not be compared in any way! Overall, I honestly believe it was the best movie of the summer and was and am fascinated by it.

"jeffrey-utley","9","4","10","13 August 2013"," Great End to the Summer Movies
","The summer movies come to a close with 'Elysium', from the director of 'District 9'. I didn't see 'District 9', but I was still hyped for 'Elysium'.<br/><br/>How was the acting in 'Elysium'?<br/><br/>The acting in 'Elysium' had some good aspects, but it did have some bad parts of it. The good parts included Matt Damon, Sharlto Copley, and Diego Luna. Those were not the only good actors in the movie, but they were the parts of the movie that were more than good. Matt Damon was the main actor, and did well in this role. The way he portrayed Max was brilliant. He did very well in this film. Diego Luna did well in this movie, too. He was in the supporting cast, but I think that he should have been in the movie more. He also portrayed his character well. Sharlto Copley was definitely the best part of this film, though. He was amazing playing the ""crazy guy"" in the film. While the character changed, he changed and portrayed the character definitely. He did excellent in the movie. The bad parts of the acting included Jodie Foster. She was the only actor/actress that did badly in this film. With every syllable she said, she either fidgeted, blinked, widened her eyes, or did all three. She didn't portray that character very well either; and lastly, her voice was obviously dubbed. This wasn't that big of a problem with her, but the film. Sometimes when she talked, the vocal track was obviously off.<br/><br/>Was the writing in this film good?<br/><br/>The writing in this film was good. It seemed realistic, and the choreographed fighting didn't really seem choreographed. That's really all I can say about the writing, though.<br/><br/>Did this film have an interesting premise?<br/><br/>Yes, this film has a very interesting premise. It puts problem we have today into a premise for a science fiction film that actually seems kind of realistic. The premise for the film is also very engaging and focused.<br/><br/>Was this film entertaining?<br/><br/>Yes, this film was slow at first, but had intense action sequences that provide thrilling elements using the technology they have in this film. There is some CGI used for the sequences, but it was not easy to notice. There was also a slightly overused factor of this film. It was the use of slow motion. I just didn't think that it was necessary to use the effect as much as they did. Other than the action sequences, the film was entertaining and enjoyable. This film had very rich characters and entertaining dramatic dialog. It did go in an overly-emotional direction in some scenes, but other than that, it had enjoyable buildup to the action sequences. The slow parts did get boring and have dialog that wasn't enjoyable, which did somewhat weigh the film down, but not too much.<br/><br/>What things in particular did I like about this film?<br/><br/>Some things that I particularly liked in this film are the rich characters, very entertaining action sequences, and the very intense ending. The characters in this movie were very deep and the writing in this film made me want the antagonists, or ""bad guys"", to lose. Due to the technology inside the story of this film, very entertaining action sequences were provided. The last act of this film was very cool and intense. It had several things going on at once that had a sketchy thought to them the whole time. It made 'Elysium' what it really is.<br/><br/>What things in particular did I dislike about this film?<br/><br/>Some things that I particularly disliked in this film are the slow parts and bad performance by Jodie Foster. This film had a bit too many slow parts that had boring dialog. Those parts didn't weigh down the rating and quality of this film too much, but it did somewhat bring them down. The performance from Jodie Foster was forgettable, underdone, and had several bad aspects. With every syllable, she either fidgeted, closed her eyes, widened her eyes, or all three. She also had an obviously dubbed voice, and the track for her voice also badly lined up to the movement of her lips when she said the words on screen. Sometimes it even looked like she was saying something else.<br/><br/>How was the film overall?<br/><br/>The film overall had a few problems but was mostly strongly entertaining. 'Elysium' was a great film.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend 'Elysium' to see in the theater for anyone who is considering seeing it.<br/><br/>I will probably buy this film on Blu-Ray when it comes out."
"oberondixon","8","4","10","10 August 2013"," Excellent visuals and a dark, if heavy-handed, message
","The first thing that struck me about this movie, and continued to strike me throughout, was how damn good it looks. It takes the slums as seen in District 9 and makes them much, much cooler - then contrasts them with the immaculate perfection of Elysium. The other components were admittedly not as good, but it still stood up. The characters are strong, if not particularly vivid (except for Kruger, who steals the show as the villain). The story is strong, though it moves slowly at times. Ultimately the film has a nice dark message, but it feels a bit to force-down-our-throats to add to the film, in fact it takes away a bit from the rest. I would certainly recommend this picture, but it was by no means perfect."

","Not at all the film I was expecting. A so-so plot and storyline with a nice realisation of the said Elysium soon degenerated into a boring shoot-em up in space. No character development, no suspense, no tension, no plot. After the first 20 minutes, nothing other than CGI and weapon-effects. Complete garbage. These type of films should come with a new classification, not based on actual age etc. but whether it is suitable for those prepared to watch cardboard acting and robots shooting at each other. Maybe a spoiler alert that it is drivel even for under 12's who are allowed to watch some violence. A total rip off. Those concerned should be ashamed to put their names to it."

The only things missing were the bomb with a big red clock counting down the seconds and the cyber criminals emptying bank accounts one dollar at a time.<br/><br/>It's depressing to see so much talent devoted to making such a pointless hashup of every third rate movie you have ever seen and wished you hadn't. It is incomprehensible that there are unemployed people in the USA and yet the studios hired the writers responsible for this weak and unconvincing plot. I could have done better.

","It's my fault for wasting time and money going to see this movie, given I knew it starred Matt Damon. The one positive was that the Sci-fi special-effects were excellent, giving a relatively 'realistic' view of where technology/spacecraft/weaponry might actually be in the year 2154. <br/><br/>Yet I don't think it was worth the price of a ticket to have to undergo such a barrage of the same old naïve Marxist preachy propaganda wrapped up in a Sci-fi genre flick with all-too-predictable plot with the typical boogey men being all those 'rich' people and their Republican meanies who care nothing for the poor, and have no problem launching missiles at them to protect their standard of life. I mean, in actual reality, not that Neo-Con Republicrats aren't culpable also for all the global policing/regime change/world control through the barrel of a gun (i.e.,drone strikes), but it amazes me how liberal Obamaphile actors like Matt Damon are oblivious to the totalitarian worldview, policies, and actions of their own beloved leader/government, which are equally as bullyish and violent if not moreso than any Bushite would be. But since it's his guy/his party, it's suddenly OK? <br/><br/>My only hope is that viewers get smarter to how much they are getting ""preached at"" by Hollywood, no matter what genre it is. Would that our directors/actors would be 'libertarian' at least in their approach to making movies, and just stopped preaching any particular political position in their movies, at least in such an obvious, over-the-top way.

He only has one goal: to reach Elysium. But along the way he changes the reason(s) why.<br/><br/>The story is great, the characters are well played, the antagonist is really evil and the look and feel of the movie is disturbing and serves the story very well. The only thing I found annoying is that the dubbing of Jodie Foster was not good, she was the only one where her mouth and the words coming out of it were not matching.

"inkblot11","8","3","7","13 August 2013"," Another Max saves the world, hooray! I liked it, yes!
","Max (Matt Damon) was an orphan as a child, growing up in a ruined City of Angels. Despite his tendencies to get into trouble, he did have a pal, a girl named Frey (Alice Braga as an adult). Now, its 2154, and after a life of petty crime, Max has gone straight, working in a factory that makes robots. Those with money and power have left the planet entirely and live in an elaborate space station called Elysium. Not only do these folks have clean air to breathe and wonderful habitations, they also have machines to cure all illnesses, in every residence. Also, as can be expected, they shoot down any rickety shuttles that try to land on Elysium. The person in charge, Secretary of Defense, is a tough as nails lady named Delancourt (Jodie Foster). She is ruthless, using an equally heartless earth-dwelling minion named Kruger (Sharlito Cooper) to help in her beat back the riffraff. She even has plans to take down the President, if he crosses her decisions! One day, Max meets Frey, unexpectedly, when his arm is broken by an over-zealous droid policeman. They make plans to meet for coffee in a few days, even though she seems reluctant. That's because her young daughter is dying of leukemia. But before this date, Max becomes locked in a room at work, due to a malfunction. He receives a lethal dose of radiation and is given five days to live. Well, its goodbye ""straight"" life, as Max wants to live. Therefore, it is necessary for him to re-align with a criminal named Spider, who can get him on a shuttle to Elysium, where he can be cured by the machines. Oh, Max, its tit for tat, as Spider asks him to kidnap an Elysium leader, Max's former boss, and download the man's memory in a special chip. With this information, Spider and company can take down those in charge on Elysium and benefit everyone on earth. But, will Delancourt and Kruger allow that to happen? Also, can Max, who is given bionic arms and legs, fight them to save himself, too? This new Max, in the tradition of Mad Max, is an anti-hero with a big heart. He's just the person earth needs to work miracles for the ""little folks"". As such, Damon does a great job as the main star. Foster, too, is enormously entertaining as the Stalin sister in charge. Braga, Cooper, Diego Luna, and all of the others do fine work as well. Since the film is another in a long line of apocalyptic films, it has to have good effects, and it does! The decay on earth and the patched-together housing and vehicles are wonderful to behold. Equally fine is the glorious Elysium, which resembles a posh resort in some warm, fabulous climate. What a nice touch, too, it is to see the ""healing machines"", last time I saw those, the Sun God of Stargate was keeping himself young and beautiful. Critics may charge that the film mimics other movies of a similar theme and that the ending is predictable, but this viewer says it has plenty of originality to enthrall. Elysium is a great late-summer film that will please its audiences the world over."
"jimmoir","7","3","7","9 August 2013"," Good, could have been great
","This movie is very successful on one level, a flop on another. As a high octane, action based sci-fi thriller, it is great. The visuals and special effects are some of the best I have ever seen, it is well acted, and has tons of heart-stopping action sequences. Its downfall is that it takes itself too seriously, and tries make a social statement. The parallels between the inhabitants of a future destitute LA (mostly Chicano) trying to gain citizenship in the prosperous (mostly white) world of Elysium, are so obvious they are laughable. Its like something you would expect a high school student to come up with if they were given an assignment to write a story outlining the evils of our society. Very superficial and shallow. I wont give spoilers, but I don't really have to - you know how it is going to end after about the first 30 minutes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, even though I knew what the eventual outcome would be, I didn't know how we would get there, and the ride along the way is a lot of fun. I was thoroughly entertained for 2 hours, was never once bored, and was often on the edge of my seat. And who says every movie has to have a ""message""? If you are looking for something deep that makes you think about social issues in another way, save your money. If you are looking for two hours of solid escapist fun and entertainment, I highly recommend it."

I would not recommend the Imax experience for this one since the shaky cam is overwhelming in that setting (and i usually don't complain about shaky cam). The story is highly political involving themes of healthcare, immigration, and homeland security with a slant favoring liberalism. LA now looks like a third world slum with gang graffiti in every nook and cranny. Also, the Jason Bourne comes out of Matt Damon in the fight scenes which is always fun to watch. Doesn't have the same emotional punch as District 9, but a decent addition to the genre. 7/10 is what I would rate it personally. The visual effects alone are worth the price of admission on this one."

","This could have been a tremendously interesting movie but the story and character development were an insult to the viewer's intelligence. C'mon Blomkamp you definitely had something more to offer here than a boring little action flick with woeful characters that nobody gives a toss about. So utterly weak. The two bad guys (the special ops guy and the jodie foster character) had nothing to them ... she's an angry security official and he's a mindless killing machine. That's it? That's all we get? And what's supposed to happen at the end? Elysium turns into a hospital so the overpopulated hell hole on Earth can get even more overpopulated? I just don't get the point.

(sorry Mat) anyway, just got back from watching and I'm speechless. Waste of time. Waste of money.<br/><br/>To top it off, What amazed me most is the huge gap between the reviews here in IMDb and the movie I've just seen. many users gave it a rating of almost 7 so i guess they weren't all payed to do so, but it may say something about the common taste these days.

Like that kid at the daycare that has all the Hot Wheels and doesn't want to share them with his fellow toddlers because he just doesn't feel like it.<br/><br/>One could argue that in our present time, the same concept exists in that humanity is grossly unbalanced and if we ended up ""rebooting our system"", then every earth citizen would be happy.<br/><br/>The list of reasons that would explain why this can't be done smoothly defies imagination, but in Elysium, we are driven to believe that through it's cinematographic metaphor, the entire structure of humanity as we know it is just an illusion.<br/><br/>That if a similar turn would take place on earth, everything would suddenly turn out awesome.<br/><br/>There would be no economic, political or especially religious tension among the suddenly healthy humans left on earth.<br/><br/>I really wanna see a sequel just for a good laugh.<br/><br/>Elysium 2 : where the earth ends up worse than the beginning of the original movie because overpopulation reaches an unprecedented scale, and humanity reverts to it's primal roots of god worshipping warfare and it's back to square one."

","In 2154, the population is divided in two social classes: the wealthy people live in Elysium, a space station with all the resources; the poor people lives in the exhausted Earth. In Los Angeles, the former car thief Max da Costa (Matt Damon) is on parole and works on an unhealthy factory Armadyne managed by the CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner). He dreams on saving money to travel to Elysium. Meanwhile the Secretary of Defense of Elysium, Delacourt(Jodie Foster), plots a coup-of-stat against President Patel (Faran Tahir), with the support of Carlyle. He programs a software that can override Elysium's data system and make any change, including the president's name to Delacourt. Carlyle uploads the software to his brain to increase its protection. Max is exposed to a lethal amount of radiation in Armadyne and has only five more days of life. He seeks out the criminal Spider (Wagner Moura) expecting to travel to Elysium, where he can use a medical chamber called Med-bay that is capable to heal any disease and save his life. Spider tells that if Max steals profitable information, such as bank accounts, from the brain of Carlyle that is on Earth. Max accepts the proposal without knowing the powerful knowledge in Carlyle's brain. When Delacourt learns that the information she needs to become president was stolen from Carlyle brain, she sends the notorious agent Kruger to hunt down Max and recover the software at any cost.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's Elysium is absolutely fantastic to look at, but it has no substance beneath all its glitter. It creates a believable future for the residents of Earth, yet Elysium doesn't look 'lived in' and the tale that's told isn't very compelling either. No matter how noble the intentions are to implement a class allegory into the sci-fi world, this was just hamfisted all around. Not once during the film did I really feel connected to the characters, story, or action. The script was way too-heavy handed in it's themes, while the characters were all woefully under-developed. The supposedly dangerous infiltration into the world's safest entity, Elysium, which has its own robot army, was breached so successfully without any defense measures when the protagonist wanted to. This is the kind of superficiality that hinders most sci-fi movies. In principle, this is the kind of movie I usually root for, but Elysium has mediocre acting, awful dialogues and one-dimensional characters along with a far-flung and completely illogical (within its own conventions) third act for me to support it. I like District 9, but don't worship it like its superfans, but this is miles apart from that movie. The only way to enjoy it is to turn your brains off and even that may not help its cause too much. Ideas don't make the movie, execution does.<br/><br/>5/10"

","It is as if Neill Blomkamp, inspired by the (baffling) success of District 9, got hold of SciFi Movie 101 and started ticking off the oh-so-predictable recipe items required for such a movie. The two big Hollywood names (Damon and Foster) could not mask the atrociously thin storyline and mindless action / violence scenes. The plastic character of Kruger (the one with the ludicrously phony accent, spitting out over-used one-liners) did not provide any pain relief either.<br/><br/>The story is then wrapped up in sugary soap-opera type ending, so simplistic and dripping with syrup, it almost makes you cry (of frustration). There is no depth to this movie, just characters going through the motions in a gritty environment. Foster basically just had to say her lines, the script was that undemanding. Damon did his best not to come across as the new Robocop. He failed.<br/><br/>A brave SciFi interpretation of the classic those-who-have-and-those-who-don't type of story - the righteous oppressed vs. the evil privileged view. Mixed with some action scenes and very good visuals and CGi - enough to make the movie predictable and not enough to make it memorable."

","I starting by reading a few of the user critics entries. I was never going to give this movie much respect but after reading all the plot holes, I realized this was a really bad movie.<br/><br/>2 things that I did take away from this movie, 1 Matt Damon should never take a roll that he has to shave his head in. This not a good look for him. 2nd Jodie Foster should stay away from rolls where she has to do an accent. In fact she shouldn't do roles where she is the bad guy, or bad girl in this instance.<br/><br/>The entire theme of the movie shamelessly steals from the Tome Machine and HG Wells' Eloi and the Morlocks. Other than that than spend a couple of hours watching something that will no doubt, not leave an impression on you. Definitely wait for the BlueRay release."
"breathial1967","4","2","4","7 November 2013"," Big on special effects. Short on originality, script
","If you're looking for originality, something that is intellectually stimulating, this isn't the movie to watch.<br/><br/>The special effects are very good. While having a sci-fi edge, the Earth scenes are gritty and dark. The space station (Elysium) is therefore contrasted in a pristine state of cleanliness and beauty, making the difference between the elites and the commoners all the more stark.<br/><br/>The ""heavy"" in the movie- a character named Kruger- is a tough, nasty sort. Unfortunately, his accent is so harsh that half of what he said, I simply couldn't understand.<br/><br/>The ships, the fight scenes, the guns and frankly most every other piece of hardware looks like it was taken from other sets, and combined to look marginally different: the ships from the Battlestar Galactica (remake) series + Aliens, the drones from ""They Live,"" the robots a combination of the Terminator + Robocop + Boba Fett (Star Wars).<br/><br/>The script is rather banal. Imagine a combination of the terrible Johnny Mnemonic and Robocop. Yeah, it's that bad. There are lots of action scenes, but with such a silly plot, there's not much the actors can do to help the film. Nothing to entice interest, unless you're looking for another shoot-em-up. And that, ultimately, is what this really ends up being.<br/><br/>The only bright spot is that Jody Foster *smashes* this role. She plays the evil politician- Secretary of State Delacourt- clearly modeled from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. From the blonde page-boy haircut, the makeup which subdues all features but the pursed lips and piercing and beady blue eyes, the clenched jaw and seemingly constant scowl, she is what Hillary Clinton would look like, if Hillary had the lap-band. On the one hand, you can't help but see that this is clearly modeled after Hillary Clinton, and yet you also see Foster take it to a completely new level of viciousness.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it four stars. The cast- while hobbled by a terrible plot and script- worked it to be at least good for ""mental chewing gum."" But if you're looking for something that gets the mental juices flowing, this isn't it."

The movie offers you with very sparse glances at the beautiful space structure, aside from some houses and government buildings. This left me wondering about the space station and made me feel unfulfilled. <br/><br/>The characters are flat. You probably won't remember anyone from this movie. I'm going to be very straight forward with this part of the movies. The characters just aren't something that will be brought up at your evening dinner at home with the friends and family. The characters in Dora the Explora are more well rounded than the ones in this movie. <br/><br/>The next thing that got me all worked up was the suit in the movie. I mean it didn't really feel awesome. Now, you might say that this is just another way of showing a power suit without all the flashy powers, but I think that they could have pushed the power of the suit further than a couple action scenes. Even the protagonists suit took a back seat for this one. Honestly, when you're done with the movie, you'll think that the movie took a back seat to the movie. Nothing really stands out.

","I wasn't one of those that found District 9 original and compelling, but it was, for certain, much more original and compelling than this nonsense.<br/><br/>I know only too well that Hollywood studios look for the formulaic as films made to a 'successful' (ie financially rather than culturally successful) formula are less risky than those 'on the hoof' so to speak. But one would have thought that someone, someone along the line would have said 'Hey, wait a minute' this is just a re-working of bits of 'Avatar', or 'Aren't we in 'Children of Men' territory? or 'Hey this is treading on the toes of 'Metropolis' etc.<br/><br/>OK, to use are moderate, mediocre or great (respectively) film as a launch-pad for a new work can be justified, but 'Elysium' doesn't even seem to bother to conceal the origins of its 'inspiration'. <br/><br/>And there's the rub (Hamlet), the film uses thematic and structural cast-offs to hide the fact that it actually lacks its own inspiration.<br/><br/>The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film is engaging enough, but thereafter its lack of originality, for me, at least, became increasingly irritating, as did its clumsy ways of papering over plot holes.<br/><br/>Along with the undigested 'references', the characterisations are weak as well, with the arrival of that cliché of clichés.... the sick little girl.

"cnitinb","5","2","4","28 September 2013"," A generic sci-fi movie, low on thrills and intelligence
","Neill Blomkamp's Elysium starts off with a moderately interesting yet not completely original premise. Its 2154 and earth is in a nearly dilapidated state. The rich have moved on to a Utopian space station called Elysium where exists a nearly magical device that can cure any disease while the poor remain on earth still struggling to make ends meet and dying of various illnesses. One such orphan Max(Damon)a dreams of visiting Elysium before he dies. Events at the factory he works for, force him to take drastic measures to make his dream come true. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster plays the antagonist Delacourt and sadly its one of her worst roles ever. Her character is a caricature villain who exterminates poor sick people while trying to become more powerful and with the corny lines written for her,there is not much of a performance she can muster. Another antagonist in the film who is far more menacing is Kruger, a psychotic mercenary played impressively by Sharlto Copley, who was the protagonist of Blomkamp's fantastic debut district 9. <br/><br/>Although the pacing of the movie is good there is an inherent fatigue in the way the vaguely familiar plot unfolds. Throw in a female lead who is a childhood friend of Max who somehow gets entangled in his messed up life and a child who mouths off kiddish tales that you know will somehow reflect the movie's ending, the film drivels towards the predictable climax. <br/><br/>Although the freshness and trenchant tone of his earlier film is largely missing, the realistic CGI that blends with the somber looking backdrop is back and is quite impressive. However CGI is only a part of sci-fi genre which makes this film only partly worth the time and money. All I can say is if your in a mood for a film that involves trashed out earth and a man made space abode, hey there is the infinitely better WALL-E!"

","Well, as a big fan of District 9 I was VERY enthusiastic in watching this new movie from the same director. Also, two Brazilian actors in the cast, so I was curious to see how that would work. I wish I had not. Elysium story takes place in a decadent XXII century Los Angeles in which capitalism has brought population to its knees and rich people had migrated to a space station called ""Elysium"", where every single house has a medical healing curing miraculous device that could fix you no matter what is the condition you are in. Matt Damon character ""Max"" works as a blue collar worker in Armadyne, the bad profit seeker security company that forces employees to work unsafely which causes Max to be exposed to radiation in a way he'll be dead in a five days' time frame. He's fired as tough he is a piece of garbage and as a result he joins some other criminals in a job to kidnap and steal data from a Elysium citizen who is at Earth (by coincidence, the CEO of Armadyne). Well, to make a long story short, in the end they get the data and manage to make all earth citizen be recognized by Elysium system as Elysium citizens and hence a gazillion of space ships equipped with healing machines are sent to earth to cure all people. So, if you are a left wing nut, you will probably love the move, as Max is pretty much a Sci-Fi Che Guevara, but if you got brain, well, skip it."
"eline-hoskens","3","2","4","19 September 2013"," A cold, depressing movie that lasted too long
","I really wanted to see Elysium on big screen as the trailer appealed to me. The first minutes of the movie were visually gorgeous and the setup raised my expectations. But then 80% of the movie, if not more, turned out to be a setup. You expected them to leave the cold, dirty, matcho, depressing world full of cursing and gunshots behind and make a difference on Elysium, as that's the title of the film. But only in the last 15 minutes of the movie the story seemed to unfold. Then they rushed to the end and it was all an unpleasant memory. A couple of things that really bothered me: <br/><br/>1. The characters: The characters left me uninterested. I felt no empathy whatsoever when I'm actually the type that bursts into tears when characters get a phone call that their nephew's great aunt's ex-husband just died. <br/><br/>2. The music: A dime a dozen score matched the dime a dozen storyline. <br/><br/>3. The story: Sure, there were some original details in the story but the look was stolen from Mass Effect for a great deal and the main plot was completely predictable. You knew about the nuclear accident from the moment you visited his working environment, you knew he would give his own life at the end. Not only were most of the story elements very predictable, they were also very very very naive. How can you possibly explain curing a human being from leukemia in less than a minute, especially since the display says something (vague) like: ""reconstructing atomic structure"". Even if that were possible, it would SHOW and at least take a while. Same with the weird South-African assassin's face. ""What?!"" And last but not least: Do they really think the world will be a better place if everyone is suddenly a legal resident of Elysium. Unless they make a sequel where the entire population tries to crawl itself a way on that beautiful star symbol and all turns to chaos, the story doesn't make any sense. It's utterly naive. If a child had the ability to turn everybody on earth super rich, he would do it, but of course the matter is much more complicated than that. If the makers of this film truly believe the ideas behind it, they are a bunch of grass eating dopes who need a reality check. <br/><br/>4. Heart and soul: There were so many opportunities to give the story a heart. For example: When the life of the Jodie Foster character was in the hands of an unhygienic nurse of earth, you would think she'd reevaluate her shallow motivations after they were actually able to save her life. In stead, she just asks her to stop trying and dies. And as part of the audience, I didn't care about her dying.<br/><br/>5. Acting performance: The acting was simply weird. Especially, the way Jodie Foster behaved and acted. I'm usually a big fan of her acting but this time, she left me puzzled. What was up with the weird accent and the weird gestures, the weird moving around. Fans will probably say there's some far-fetched arty-farty meaning behind it but if it leaves you puzzled and has no clear meaning, it's just crap. Matt Damon was...well, yeah, Matt Damon. <br/><br/>6. The ""meaning"": The movie was very one-dimensional ""rich people are evil; poor people are good"". It would have been better if there had been good people amongst the rich on Elysium trying to help the poor. It would have been better to see the two sides of the coin, not just to make the story more interesting but also to alternate the horrible, dirty, depressing chaos with the peace and quiet of Elysium.<br/><br/>But actually, despite all the arguments above, there's only one true reason for me to say this is a bad movie. It may seem small, subjective and insignificant but still... In the middle of all the action, I grabbed my mobile to see what time it was. I NEVER do that, unless I'm bored. I did it during Man of Steel and I did it during this movie. I've seen three- and four-hour movies that never bored me one second. Some of them I watched several times. There are very long movies where time flies and you regret the movie to be over in the end. With this movie, I was actually relieved to see the end credits. So even movies packed with action, noise, gunshots and explosions can be boring and I usually don't back away from them. Hell yeah, I love a good Emmerich or Bay movie but making good action actually requires a talent that Neil Blomkamp did not seem to possess, at least judging from this movie. At least I hope his next movie will not be an 'almost classic' ""morally gray"" ""dark and gritty"" movie that ends with peace on earth for everyone after a tough guy main character with a soft spot for diabetic children pushes the green button of happiness."

A good story will present you with a moral dilemma, and allow the audience to choose right and wrong. This movie did nothing of the sort. The people living on Elysium were not shown at all. They were almost backgrounds. You only saw the corrupted people in charge. I find it very hard to swallow that an entire group of people would think exactly alike as if they were one person. Movies with messages like this should have both sides to the story, and there wasn't. And knowing this movie was made by the same person as District 9, it was frustrating. Both movies have the same moral message, and are sci-fi movies. The worst part about these two sci-fi movies with the same message is the fact that they have the same issues with story telling. No view on how ""the other side"" lives and thinks. This movie was flat, and often dull, and very transparent. I feel this movie thinks too little of its audience and their ability to decode a movie. It hands you what side to choose, and what to feel on a platter and doesn't expect you to think. The overall message is also too in your face. We get it already, both movies are about immigration reform, their isn't much else to them. I think the director should look into making documentaries and stay away from story telling."

","For a sci-fi film, Elysium is neither beautiful, fun or brilliantly written. Rather, it attempts to be a socially-minded, emotionally-driven dystopian story with some action. The thing about making such a gritty sort of film is that the plot needs to be really tightly constructed. It does not have to be complex or high-concept - it can be tooth and nail simple - it just has to be seamlessly put together, whatever it is. Elysium has too shaky a script and too many contrived plot points to hit as hard as it needs to.<br/><br/>It is not a horribly bad film (except for those turned off by a constant barrage of the F-word – for those viewers, this is a horrible film) but there is little attractive about it. And in spite of what seems on the surface like a surefire premise, it is not really emotionally or ethically compelling. It tries to be, tries quite overtly in fact, but it does not manage to get there.<br/><br/>The Good – The visual effects, particularly the robots, aircraft and spacecraft. Sharlto Copley deliriously crazy, sadistic, over-the-top antagonist. Frankly, that is about it.<br/><br/>The Bad – Lackluster script. Overly contrived plot. Matt Damon is a fine actor, but his understated persona does not help here. Underutilization of Jodie Foster. Failure to make the very obviously emotional beats truly sink in. Unconvincing ending.<br/><br/>After viewing Elysium, I could not escape the feeling that this film, as it exists, does not really add much to the universe. It is more ambitious than Neil Blomkamp's previous effort District 9, but not as good. More effort, less to show for it. There are some clear (and unquestionably relevant) thematic elements related to immigration and human rights, but those issues deserve a stronger vehicle than Elysium provides. A rather mundane film overall."

","This film which utilizes the most advanced technology for its special effects has as a core a very ancient myth. I am not writing my personal idea I just reproduce the characterization that Dimitris Bouras, the film critic of ""The Kathimerini"" newspaper in the issue of Thursday 22nd of August gave to the central hero: a Messiah leading the downtrodden to heaven/redemption- that is to Elysium. Truly it is one of the times that I agree completely with the film critic. Perhaps I should have read the critique after I had seen the movie.<br/><br/>Briefly the plot is that in a future world human society is sharply divided between the poor masses who live in filth and the privileged rich who live in an artificial world, a satellite of Earth called Elysium, from the Greek name of the after-world where the souls of heroes dwelled- the equivalent of the Christian Paradise although the qualification for entry were different. This point is very strongly made from the first instance of the film. It follows a long line of dystopian fiction such as ""The Time Machine"" by Wells, ""The Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley, ""1984"" by George Orwell, the science fiction comic ""The Incal"" by Jean Giraud(Moebius) and Alejandro Jodorowsky and also the theories of many theorists of oligarchical rule in the 20th century such as Vilfredo Pareto, Gaetano Mosca and Michels-even James Burnham. It is also based on the experience of a great part of human recorded history which witnessed a great cleavage between the ruling class and the popular masses.<br/><br/>This perennial theme is set in a not so distant future and with a cast of characters that E.M. Forster would term flat: The central hero, an orphan raised by nuns, a semi-criminal type and factory worker who after a terrible accident follows a path that leads him to martyrdom and the saving of the poor- thus confirming the prophecy of a nun that he would achieve great things despite his humble background- in the same sense that Jesus Christ did- although in his case he expiated the sins of others not of himself; the ruthless defense secretary of Elysium that does anything to safeguard the interests of the rich and advance her personal ambition; the sadistic and vicious undercover agent that is illegally hired by the powerful, is dumped by them and then betrays them in his turn as all self-respecting mercenaries do. And some other characters less or more sympathetic that fill the canvas of this predictable and simplistic movie.<br/><br/>But I have to point out that it is not a bad movie. Many people accuse it for being naive but frankly class hatred and political oppression are pretty black and white concepts and most people in history have experienced them in such a manner. Sophisticates and intellectuals may complain here but one must not rationalize too much. When sources are divided very unequally hatred and chaos follow and one does not need the theories of Jurgen Habermas or Noam Chomsky to state the obvious. Yes the movie is as subtle as a tone of bricks falling on your head as a reviewer wrote but it is a movie and not a sociological treatise. And as we know political and religious myths are more powerful motors of history than the writings of learned intellectuals.<br/><br/>Briefly speaking if you are conversant with Christian mythology and modern dystopian fiction and you love visual and sound effects go and see this film. If you want sophisticated descriptions of modern social problems and are offended by the idea that the poor are good and the rich evil then don't go."

","I saw Matt Damon's newest movie – Elysium. I had great expectations, and I was curious to see this movie since it was directed and written by District 9′s director and writer Neill Blomkamp. Elysium reminds very much of that awesome movie and it has an interesting story and a good cast, so I think it was natural to suppose, and hope, that Elysium would have been District 9′s worthy successor. Unfortunately, this movie was a pretty big disappointment – and even if you decide to ignore the existence of District 9 and don't compare the two, it remains a bad movie. Also, I would have loved to see Ninja of Die Antwoord play the main role, but he turned the director's offer down.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Max, a young man living on Earth in the year 2154: our planet is polluted, unsafe, filled with criminals and poor people who hope to one day get to Elysium, a man-made space station where all the wealthy people of Earth have moved and where they can live forever thanks to special medical machines. The rich would do anything to stop the poor from getting to Elysium, and the poor just want to get there in order to be cured. After Max is injured at work and has only five days left to live, he joins a group of criminals who attach an exoskeleton to his body and send him on a mission to steal some data from a rich person, and afterwards go to Elysium.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie looks great. But let's not emphasise this: it's supposed to look impressive and have great visual effects, it's a sci-fi with a $115 million budget! Also, while there are some good scenes that manage to keep you interested, others look like a video game. Then we have the story. As I said, it's interesting, mainly because you have so much possibilities and you can exploit it in so many ways: you can show the sociological aspect of the situation presented in the movie, you can analyse the characters psychologically, or describe the class wars between the rich and the poor so we can understand how things happened before the rich went to Elysium and we can sympathise with the poor. The director did nothing of this. Instead, he just showed us – this is Earth and it's ugly and it's really sad, this is Elysium and it's nice but the people are evil. It's a pity, since Blomkamp wanted the movie to send a powerful message and to be a metaphor for today's society. Yes, we get the metaphor, but it's faintly delivered and it makes Elysium look like just another silly Hollywood sci-fi trying to be all smart and stuff (Oblivion much?).<br/><br/>Regarding the acting, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were good, but their characters were too undeveloped. Especially Foster's role as the movie's antagonist, the Minister of Homeland Security Delacourt, should have gotten more attention, if not more screen time. Blomkamp could have just taken the hint from Foster's last name. Matt Damon, on the other hand, is constantly present, in almost every scene of the movie, so he manages to be a bit more developed. But there's his childhood friend Frey, decently played by Alice Braga, whom we should believe he loves and cares for, even though they haven't seen each other in years, and she has a child with another man (that we never meet). Their zero-chemistry relationship is just taken for granted in the script, and consequently, we can't care. Perhaps the worst characteristic of this movie is that's it's so damn long, it gets so boring and still manages to leave some things unexplained. I guess we can just hope Blomkamp will create something better the next time.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more at passpopcorn.wordpress.com"
"joey-ziemniak","6","2","4","23 August 2013"," A lot of untapped potential
","New filmmaker Neill Blomkamp had his work cut out for him in his sophomore effort, Elysium. Following up on Oscar-nominated District 9, arguably one of the best sci-fi movies of this generation, is no easy task. While Elysium doesn't come close to matching the raw originality present in District 9, it's still a very enjoyable, mostly original sci-fi film that is still streets ahead of standard fare.<br/><br/>Elysium's main concept is easy enough to wrap your head around. The year is 2154, and Earth has become overpopulated and overpolluted. The rich have left Earth and settled on Elysium, a synthetic planet, where they reside in luxurious mansions and live like royalty. Elysium is perfect, there is no war or poverty, and every house even has a med-bay to cure even the most infectious diseases.<br/><br/>Elysium's strength lies not in its concept, but in its brash execution. Elysium takes us through the life of Max (Matt Damon), an ex-convict living on Earth in the poor shambles of Los Angeles. Max is your working class hero, and he works in restoring the robots who help keep the peace on Elysium. After an accident at work, Max is left with five days to live and must travel to Elysium to save his life. Meanwhile, Elysium's president Delacourt (Jodie Foster), has developed a program that could rewire Elysium's inner workings, allowing all humans to become citizens. Her inside moles on Earth, John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and Kruger (Sharlto Copley), help keep the peace and keep foreigners away from Elysium. Max stumbles upon an old friend (Wagner Moura), who agrees to help him travel to Elysium in exchange for the sensitive information that Elysium's leaders have been working on.<br/><br/>It goes deeper than that, but without getting spoilery, I'll leave it there. Elysium runs into some action-clichés, but thankfully the film's resolution never feels like a cop-out. In fact, the first 1/3 of the movie is basically exposition, and from then on it only gets better, leading to a great final act. A romance is thrown in here and there, however it actually has context within the plot, as Max's old ""girlfriend"" Frey (Alice Braga) has a daughter who is in the final stages of leukemia, so she herself has a predisposition to get to Elysium as well.<br/><br/>The sharp contrast between life on Earth and life on Elysium is very obvious, but personally I would have liked to have gotten more history on Elysium, as well as more information about life on Elysium. Life on Elysium for the proletariat citizens is barely shown, for example, only in brief snippets. It's small details like these would greatly enhance the film as a whole, and make it a more enjoyable and, to an extent believable, universe.<br/><br/>Blomkamp has created such a rich and unique world, but he only uses it within the context of an action movie. He unfortunately never goes further than what the plot demands, never asking ""what more can we show the audience about (blank)?"" This leaves the viewer underwhelmed by the end, only wondering what could have been. The movie is short, and when you leave, you feel like there is more that could have been delved into. This is why movies like Inception, Looper, or even Avatar succeed, because they have expansive, well thought-out worlds that give the movie lasting value. Elysium almost feels like a festival film that is only 45 minutes long. More backstory could have made Elysium almost to the level of District 9.<br/><br/>Elysium explores some themes present in society today, and for the most part, everything ""beneath the iceberg"" is typically black-and-white. There isn't much digging to be done here. This concept of rich and poor is something that has been done before, but Elysium makes this idea unique enough thanks to its main conflict. In terms of social commentary, Elysium has all the makings for a 60 Minutes special. It explores themes such as social stratification and immigration, but en masse it's pretty shallow.<br/><br/>The characters created are very well done, with well thought-out motivations and interesting personalities for the most part. Damon's Max is kind of boring himself, but you would too if you were working hard on Earth while all the rich are living it up on Elysium. He is somewhat sympathetic, but on the whole he never develops, never learns anything new. His childhood friend Frey is similar, and the two have almost non-existent chemistry. Their story is told in flashbacks, which I could have used less of, but it works.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast and characters is great. Jodie Foster is chilling as Delacourt, Elysium's top dog, and she steals the show here. She isn't present in too many scenes, but when she is, the spotlight is on her. Foster has done a great job of playing a convincing rich leader, and even evokes traits found in today's headlining politicians. Also good was Sharlto Copley as Kruger, a ruthless warlord-esque character hired by Delacourt. Copley is brutal, and even though he never evolves from ruthless killing machine, he is still a huge force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Visually, Elysium is stunning. Earth is a horrifying depiction of the future, think Wall-E but worse. Elysium is gorgeous, a planet with its own walls carved out in the shape of a circle. There are some phenomenal shots here, and the cinematography is top-notch. <br/><br/>Elysium has all the workings for a sci-fi hit. All things considered, it has a good set-up and premise, but Blomkamp never explores the world to its full potential. It does just enough to keep you interested, but not enough to keep you remembering it long after the credits roll."
"BlairMcLovin","6","2","4","16 August 2013"," Enjoyable action romp/blunt force political allegory
","Elysium is the second feature length effort from Neill Blomkamp whose District 9 was a brilliant debut that covered many of the socio- political issues present in Elysium with a dose more subtlety. It must be said that Elysium is never boring as music cues and startling shots of the space station thingy and an overpopulated Los Angeles do a great job of establishing a back story sans dialogue. However, as effective with pacing as the film can be it has an over-reliance on musical cues during emotional moments and a heady use of metaphors in the dialogue that don't give the audience much credit when it comes to connecting the dots.<br/><br/>My gripes with the heavy handedness aside, projects such as this that set out to insert messages about other political issues such as overpopulation within the confines of a studio system is something worth commending. These issues may often fall by the wayside as the focus is often drawn to fetishizing the action into making it look as cool as possible, but the action never fully dilutes the political messages and remain quite cool to watch.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of the gutter mouthed Sharlto Copley as the antagonist who's over the top nature and South African accent shone a light on how bad some of his dialogue was. Added to this I found his dialogue so riddled with swear words that my fragile ears could simply not permit it outside of the context of a dockworker stubbing his toe.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's performance was one of my personal favourite's I've seen from him and the film had me pondering issues and stuff during and after the run time which is damn fine value for $12 on a student discount. I'd recommend seeing Elysium, but there's a lingering sense that it could have been executed far better in some easy to fix areas."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","2","4","16 August 2013"," Turns out even re-heated and big-studio-ized, Blomkamp's material is worth your time
","In a world with a class divide so wide it's fatal to those on the lower end, with professional health care out of their reach, and people will go far to save their loved ones, including illegal immigration in spite of it being extremely risky... well, this movie was made(I had to go there). And those issues are addressed, albeit the heavy-handed-ness and naivety of their handling grows exponentially from the first to the last I mentioned. The rich live on Elysium(where we spend little time, making us ""miss it"", cherish what we do get, similar to The Hulk in The Avengers - with that said, at the end of the day, it does wind up feeling over-hyped, and the third act is when the low-level generic and predictable aspects double in concentration), named after the Ancient Greek version of paradise, where only the gods could go - presumably titled after Prometheus scored some points with the pretentious. It has magic healing beds. And... actually, that might be it. We learn nearly nothing about it, or the people of it. Except that it is as nice as Earth used to be, before it became one big third-world slum.<br/><br/>Max(Damon, rendering sympathetic a not very fleshed out classic hero) is one of the 99% living there, with stop-and-frisks, police robot brutality(getting sarcastic with one of these AI will get you beaten up and/or offered meds) and awful jobs that you're lucky to even have. He dreams of ascending to the titular space station, and once he contracts cancer and has five days to live, he decides that it's time. Desperate, he agrees to have an exo-skeleton attached to him(yeah, it ain't a suit... we see the nasty, gut-wrenching surgery procedure; nearly every instance of violence in this is short and painful, making us feel every broken bone), and tries to go there. He will have to contend with the Secretary of Defense Delacourt(Foster as a hammy ice-queen, seeming determined to prove she can do horrible acting - she is one of the only two performances that are unintentionally funny, and the other one, Moura's Hollywood hacker Spider, is much less bothersome) and her asset, the creepy, insane hobo-beard of Kruger(Copley, giving us a truly despicably villain).<br/><br/>Neill had to prove that District 9 wasn't just a fluke, and in spite of the heavily reused elements and structure(their freshness now grown stale), the more conventional approach here and the earlier mentioned preachy, idealistic take on these very current issues(thus serving more to add emotion than information to a complicated, nuanced issue; and yes, I am a bleeding heart Lib), he shows that he is near the top of the short list of sci-fi(the tech looks advanced and yet slapped together - utilitarian) directors to keep an eye on today. I do hope he gets help on the writing, as the dialog can be unwieldy, the plot bloated and this simultaneously goes to great lengths to craft impossible-to-overcome problems, and contrive ridiculously convenient fix-all solutions to them. The world is detailed and feels like we're already there, with the prevalent realism heightening the intensity of the appropriate-in-amount-and-length action scenes - think '88 John McClane. Use of slow-mo and hand-held camera, while infrequent, are the only real negative of these exciting sequences. Build-up to them is solid, at times swift and subtle, with sudden bursts of thrills, seldom anticipated and thus all the more effective.<br/><br/>There is a lot of strong language and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of supplementing their Summer blockbuster with a side of social commentary - provided they can live with it being more focused on flavor than nutrition. 7/10"
"moviexclusive","6","2","4","14 August 2013"," Fans of ""District 9"" will find ""Elysium"" similar but with an added emphasis on fast-paced action sequences and gore
","In ancient Greek mythology, Elysium refers to a place where mortals related to, or who were favoured by, the gods were allowed to enter in afterlife, where they would never grow old and lived there doing whatever they please. Following this idea of a paradise, the Elysium in the movie is a manmade satellite containing the wealthy upper class, where they are free of illness, and lead generally pleasure-seeking lifestyles on the station. In contrast, the working class is forced to toll on the overpopulated and polluted Earth. The government plays god in this futuristic dystopia, as they decide who is qualified to be on Elysium. Within the government, the Secretary of Defence, Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster), spearheads the harsh treatment of illegal immigrants from Earth to protect Elysium from running out of resources. <br/><br/>""Elysium"" is director Neill Blomkamp's second full-length feature film, after ""District 9"", which was a critical and commercial success. There are several similarities between both films, such as the long overhead shots showcasing a birds' eye view of the terrain, the theme of suppression and the character development of the protagonist.<br/><br/>That said, those expecting ""Elysium"" to be entirely similar to ""District 9"" would be disappointed. The use of shaky cam, fast cuts and multiple scene changes worked in ""District 9"", capturing the attention of the audience. ""Elysium"" tries to use a similar method to engage the audience, with the shaky cam to portray a first-hand experience, while presenting the fight scenes through rapid cuts from different angles. Furthermore, while ""District 9"" took a long time to build up to the climax, 'Elysium' sped things up with faster and more frequent fight sequences. Despite the fast pace, the audience was left feeling more disorientated than engaged. The large amount of time dedicated to the fight sequences also led to a hurried character development of Max Da Costa (Matt Damon).<br/><br/>As expected, the character with the most development is Max. Max Da Costa is a factory worker and an ex-convict who seems to be perpetually under parole. An accidental radiation exposure leaves Max with five days to live, and he becomes hell-bent on getting to Elysium for a cure. This desperation led to Max ignoring Spider (Wagner Moura) and Frey's (Alice Braga) attempts to convince Max to put others in front of him. It was only until upon reaching Elysium when Max had a sudden change of heart, sacrificing himself for the greater good. However, this change comes off as being abrupt and it seemed as if the director was running out of time.<br/><br/>Of the other characters in the film, Copley stands out in his role as the main villain – a South African mercenary, criminal and Delacourt's personal hit-man, Agent M. C. Kruger. Kruger is vile, capricious and lecherous, and Copley's portrayal of the role successfully leads the audience to feel repulsed yet fearful of the character.<br/><br/>There is an overwhelming amount of violence and gore throughout the movie, and the director seemed to take every opportunity to insert blood and body parts that were blown apart. The blood and gore confronts the audience and gives a first-hand view of how violence tears apart, literally and figuratively, the society and its people.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Elysium"" presents a possible, if unoriginal, future dystopia. The large amount of violence and gore, however, forms the bulk of the movie and distracts the audience from the main message – a warning against the continued destruction of our planet."

","Is Elysium the masterpiece of thought-provoking sci-fi cinema of 2013? No. Is it the masterpiece of action and spectacle of 2013? No. Is it terrible or a total letdown? No.<br/><br/>And given that, it's a much more entertaining 'thinker' sci-fi than Oblivion, which was really trying too hard and overstuffed with convenient clichéd or fortuitous plot devices. In comparison, the only similar type of plot device that made me really groan was the defense mechanisms of the Elysium space station: a rather laughable construct used just to force the allegory of today's illegal immigration problems in the USA.<br/><br/>Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley give strong performances as opposing characters. For the most part (except for a couple of brief scenes), continuity is maintained well for the deteriorating state of Damon's character's health. Their first battle has exhilarating staging.<br/><br/>Personally, I really enjoyed Jodie Foster's full-tilt aristocrat, but I can see where some will be turned-off by her accent and execution. I think she pulled it off.<br/><br/>Outside of the above, and where Elysium falls down a bit, is that no one else is very memorable. There's an underground resistance leader (Diego Luna) who's solid, but a bit of a cardboard character, and William Fichtner puts in a short deliciously loathsome performance as an Elysium elitist. But, Damon's love interest, Alice Braga, is 'just there', and there is a needless subplot involving her injured daughter which really plays more as the standard abhorrent 'child in distress' cliché.<br/><br/>While you get a glimpse of the disparity between the Haves and the Have Not's, you really don't get to see that much of the 'star of the show' (Elysium itself), and the story feels a bit empty being focused primarily on the 3 main stars. Fleshing out the plot is sacrificed for action at the end of the day. Which is not to say the movie is bad overall. It's a decent watch, and pretty stunning in an IMAX theater. It just could have been more."
"jdesando","Null","2","4","10 August 2013"," It's not 2001, but it is August. Let's be thankful for a small gift.
","Elysium is a Kubrick/Clarke-like 2001 spoked wheel hovering and tormenting the L.A. underclass still suffering in the environmentally-challenged earth of 2054. Writer-director Neill Blompkamp has another gritty, chaotic future like his acclaimed District 9, only this time he hews closer to traditional sci-fi with bald political parallels to 2013 and pervasive fighting to the exclusion of the more cerebral possibilities of the intriguing premise. Put simply, the have's are flying high while the have not's are miserable in an underworld recalling the workers in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.<br/><br/>""Cerebral"" is how I would characterize Kubrick's sci-fi; ""visceral"" is what I see in Blomkamp's. Like our dreams of paradise, that place must be better. In Elysium it is manifestly so: The rich have set up a gated community in the sky where all their needs are taken care of, especially medical because they can be cured immediately by their individual health-care machines and virtually live forever—not available on earth. The didactic implications of stern immigration laws on Elysium coupled with a lack of universal health care on earth provides Elysium with enough allegorical ammunition to keep three of these movies going. Alas, violence dominates as it usually does in contemporary sci-fi.<br/><br/>Those allegorical implications are almost heavy-handed: Earth is over-populated, minorities are now the majority, and the rich have become so rich they can abandon earth and live isolated from the woes of working people and an over-burdened planet. Enter hero Max (post-apocalyptic Mad Max?), played by the durable and always intelligent Matt Damon, a good-hearted ex-thief on the right path, who needs to get to Elysium to stop his imminent death from radiation. Saddled with a desire to help the ailing daughter of a life-long friend, Frey (Alice Braga), Max has a reason to subvert the ruling class on Elysium and enfranchise him and the rest of the abandoned earth.<br/><br/>The premise is 2001-worthy, but the execution is dominated by the old chase motif with accompanying fisticuffs that last forever. Why not, like 2001, have a few fighting apes and then an ominous monolith or two? Suspense and satisfaction don't need to rely on violence. Nor does Jodie Foster as defense secretary Delacourt need to rely on a French accent so flawed as to be distracting from her thespian excellence (remember agent Starling?)<br/><br/>While hand-to-hand combat still seems absurd in a world where a scanning machine can cure you of what ails, even death, Blomkamp falls in to the modern CGI obsessions related to combat rather than wit. Still, this is August, and an intelligent actioner with figurative possibilities is a minor gift. I'll take it and dream of an Elysium where Oscar-worthy films appear each month, not just in December."

","What seems to be a trend in big budget SF films occurred, once again, in Elysium. I'm continually impressed with what is being created (visual effects wise)today, but remain disappointed when it comes to the associated screenplays/plot lines. At the end of this film, I had the same, perpetual feeling that no one out there making SF films gets the message: without a good story, you don't have a really good film. Elysium hearkens me back to Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott. I would have thought he, at least, would appreciate the need for a good story to match the visuals. Especially after being the brains behind Bladerunner. But, oh no - same thing. I suspect that so much talent and expense is spent on the visuals that insufficient amounts of funding and time are left for the associated story.<br/><br/>I just wish that, when someone comes up with future plans for making a legitimate SF film (sans comic book scenarios), they contract a real science fiction author to write the screenplay. There are any number of SF writers out there that can, I believe, turn out much better scripts than currently making their way to the big screen.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the world building in Elysium was excellent. Probably some of the best since Avatar. I wish there had been some of this when Bladerunner was produced. As an avid, and long time fan of true science fiction, I thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film. As for the story, it could have been a lot, lot better."

","That's the only reaction the film managed to get out me, ""meh"". It's a nice concept and the visuals are great and it does seem pretty believable but the film is honestly nothing special.<br/><br/>The story is nothing we haven't seen before: flashback to someone telling the protagonist he's destined for greatness, flashforward to protagonist trying to get by quietly, turn of events that launches protagonist into a situation he wants no part of, desperate battle to complete mission, protagonist sacrifices himself for someone he loves. By the time the film reaches the halfway mark, you can probably guess the ending.<br/><br/>It's not bad by any means and it's a great way to spend a Saturday night but it's nothing you haven't seen before. Really nice sets though and Kruger is a fantastic character."

","Elysium rested upon quite a thought provoking premise, and one that is becoming more and more relevant for our times. One of my major gripes however was how familiar the whole film felt. There was a definite feel of District 9 to the futuristic earth, and the tone and atmosphere was nothing revolutionary. Blomkamp creates masterful and beautiful visuals in his direction, but the similarities to District 9 were a little too jarring for me.<br/><br/>The plot was largely predictable and didn't always move along at a steady pace. There seemed to be some indecision as to whether this wanted to be an action movie or a dystopian film with an underlying moral message. Ultimately it found itself stuck somewhere between the two. When it did come to the action I found it slightly derivative although not unenjoyable.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was fine... nothing special and nowhere near his best. Jodie Foster's performance was rather odd as I'm not sure what she was doing with her accent. Copley's villain was a tad tedious and I was bored with him almost as soon as he was introduced.<br/><br/>There is nothing dramatically with Elysium, however I did expect better from a team up of Blomkamp and Damon.<br/><br/>Unfortunately what could have been quite a clever sci-fi ended up being rather generic.

","The theme of the movie Elysium is focused more toward a social injustice between citizen of earth and citizen of Elysium. People of earth were depriving to receive health treatment where millions of citizen were dying from illness that could otherwise be cured by the Elysium medical technologies. Corruption burst out, crime rate increased, theft skyrocketed, hunger strike, children are malnutrition, and while all of these happen the rich citizen of Elysium are having a far better life. Elysium corporation uses earth citizen as a slave for workers, paying them as low as possible and replacing them if needed. <br/><br/>Two of the movies main cast are Max actor Matt Damon and Delacourt actress Jodie Foster. Max after he has been diagnosed with a serious illness where he has only five days to live, he does everything in his power to purchase a ticket to Elysium to cure himself before it's too late. Max was told by spider he needs to get data transmitter from one of the citizen of Elysium if he wants to go to Elysium. On his journey to retrieve the data, Max got shut by Kruger who was hired by Delacourt to retrieve the data that was stolen from one of Elysium's citizen.<br/><br/>At this stage, the movie is already highlighting some of real life experience that is reflective by people where citizen in Africa today are facing the same challenge. A challenge where they have no clean water, high unemployment, hunger, famine, and high rate of illiterate. In consequence of such event, there is high crime rate especially on the slump, theft, murder, and illegal trades. Eventually citizen of these countries as it happens in many African countries protects against their government and worst case scenario the diseases that were ignored by first world country eventually affect them. That is why injustice system should be taken serious before further consequence becomes inevitable. <br/><br/>Max noticed at the end of the movie his last option before they get arrested is to give restore the injustice system between earth and Elysium back to balance by restore all the files in Elysium and making all earth citizens, citizens of Elysium. The android police received an update patch into their software where they started to send out medical aid back to earth to cure all the citizens of Elysium of illness regardless of its severity."

","This film is one that Neil Blomkamp can be proud of in the visual sense, it has great visual effects, great CGI and is in many places very spectacular.

"jdproductionstudios","5","0","0","10 March 2015"," Blomkamp's heavy handed social views fall flat without a relatable protagonist.
","The overarching problem with the film is how it's shot; I won't condemn the style it's shot in, as many films, ""District 9″ and ""Cloverfield"" among others benefit from the style, but rather the employment of the shaky cam in ""Elysium"" feels so forced and unnatural, along with excessive, that it strongly detracts from the film. I want to use Spielberg as an example here; In nearly every Spielberg film, order and control are overarching visual themes. He almost always uses a Steadicam, a crane, or a dolly to achieve a smooth, cogent shot. This is important in his films because there's a lot of background action that would be lost if only the foreground were intelligible. One of my favorite examples is in ""Jurassic Park."" In every scene, including where the crew is running through a herd of dinosaurs, is shot as steady as possible. This was more of a technical issue than aesthetics, but the visual result is quite striking. It was a technical issue because placing dinosaurs into a shaky frame would've been near impossible at the time (1993), but what the Steadicam shots achieved were a thing of beauty; the beauty of the landscape, complete with beautifully rendered dinosaurs, beasts extinct long before our time finally portrayed in a film along with a large depth of field created an immersive experience. A shaky camera in any of these scenes would've highly detracted from the movie because it would defeat the purpose of putting these amazing creatures in an amazing place for the audience to gawk at with open mouths. Now look at ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998). By this point in time, Spielberg is already established as an astounding director with a certain visual style. He completely reverses his visual style to meet the film by changing the shutter speed on the camera (something rarely done in film) and going hand-held. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a perfect example of a mature filmmaker understanding the needs of the film and adapting his style, if only for one film, to create a larger emotional impact on the audience. The reason I mention this is because it's a shining example of how a director with a certain style changes it to fit the film he's working on. I don't think everyone should shoot their film like Spielberg – that would make for a boring selection of movies.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of ""Elysium"" is to show how derelict and deformed Earth has become, imploring the audience to show sympathy to the lower class down on earth by juxtaposing beautiful images of the upper class's Elysium. The fundamental problem with this is that the camera is always too shaky to see anything going on in the background. The result is a lack of emotion toward the people of earth. We're told multiple times that Earth is disease ridden and overcrowded, but we never see this. As a viewer, you try to immerse yourself in the film, soaking up dialog and connecting that to the images you've seen. The impact is far diminished if the audience never actually gets a chance to see how horrible the living conditions on earth are. So the final result of all of this is that Blomkamp attempts to provide a social commentary that never gains traction because we literally can't see what he's trying to show us.<br/><br/>I have to compare the film to ""District 9,"" not because I want to, but because the plot of ""Elysium"" and ""District 9″ are incredibly similar, however somewhat reversed. In ""District 9″ a man in the upper class is disgusted with how they treat the lower class and decides to fight back. In ""Elysium,"" A man in the lower class is disgusted with how the upper class treats the lower class and decides to fight back. Furthermore, the person fighting back is at first only doing so to save his way of life. After a tech-savvy person and he become friends, the tech savvy person has access to technology that can save his life (turn him back into a human) and they rebel against the upper class, eventually reaching the technology hoarded by the upper class to save the lower class. Of course, in District 9, the lower class is the alien species. There are no differences really in plot. One involves aliens and a spaceship, the other involves humans and a space station. Conveniently enough, the technology to save the lower class rests aboard the space station (Alien Ship) (Elysium). Blomkamp made the same film, used some of the same actors, and tried to invoke sympathy for the same social issues. He even shot both films the same way. The problem is that they're not supposed to be the same film and yet they resemble each other far too closely.<br/><br/>Just as a side note, I found it somewhat funny that the main focus of the film was the medicine that could eradicate disease when that may have been the least of the world's worries. I'm actually surprised that nothing was said about the failing environment. (That would've actually been interesting for Blomkamp to explore) What didn't make sense was that the end goal of the film is to say that if all disease were cured in the world, problem solved. The bigger problem in film was the overcrowding, the crime, the malnourishment, and yes, a polluted environment. How in the world is a death rate of near 0 going to fix the rest of those problems? You've got 5 more years left to live, enjoy being hungry, living in a shack next to 5,000 other people and fending for your life from organized crime. The film focused on all the wrong issues."

","After the entertaining ""District 9"", I looked forward to seeing Neil Blomkamp's next movie, this one. But the disappointment I sensed from critics and audiences made me put off seeing it until today when I had the chance to see it for free. After watching it, I can kind of understand why a lot of viewers felt let down. Although it promises to be a more cerebral sci-fi adventure, there were a number of parts in that didn't feel written enough. The biggest disappointment is with the Elysium space station itself. We learn it's full of ""haves"" who have retreated from the ""have nots"", and that they have machines that give great healing power, but that's IT. We don't learn anything about the citizens, how their government is run, or a number of other issues that could have been interesting to see.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this is a terrible movie. It's never boring, there are some exciting action sequences (though also some that are hard to follow), and the special effects are very good. Still, watching the movie I often felt there was a lost opportunity to really explore some interesting ideas. In the end, this is a movie to hold off watching until you are in an undemanding mood."

Just invited Jodie Foster, Matt Damon, Alice Braga, William Fichtner and Faran Tahir. Sharlto Copley only changed his costume and personality of the character. That's all.

","The world we live in right at this moment is currently split into two people, those who have and those who don't. Most of you reading this I'd dare say would be part of the ""haves"" crowd, what if though, what you currently possess was stripped from you and all the things you have were gone? What if suddenly you were no longer a person who had it all but a person who had nothing, a person who struggled to find food, a person who struggled day to day just to survive? What if though you had an opportunity to escape that life and move to another place where perfection was everywhere, there was no food, no work, no housing shortages everything was perfect. What would you be willing to do to escape your situation to make it to the next and become a have it all once again? The year is 2154, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, and everyone else. The very wealthy live in a place set amongst the stars high above the planet on a space station called Elysium, everyone else lives amongst the ruined Earth in squalor and hovels amongst an over populated, sick and desperate peoples. Max an ex con works in one of the very few factories that still run on the Earth's surface maintained by the workers of the planet but Managed by the wealthy citizens of Elysium. After a major accident Max's only chance of survival is to make it to Elysium and into a medical bed that has the ability to fix any ailment no matter how close to death the subject may be. The problem is the wealthy citizens of Elysium will never let the poor Earth people to live amongst them. Max agrees on one last criminal activity and as a reward his payment will be a trip to the space station that can save his life. This film has one purpose, one message and that message is so political in its nature it's actually quite arrogant about what it's trying to say. The writer director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) definitely has a political agenda with everything he does, Elysium doesn't escape this. It doesn't help the movie much it just makes it quite preachy but with all the action going on you can forget what lies underneath and enjoy more what is being played out on the screen. The story was actually pretty interesting the problem I found more were the characters created to help create Blomkamps ideas. Matt Damon (Saving Private Ryan, Interstellar) who plays Max is very one dimensional in his approach, I would have liked to seen more from him or even better one of the original actors who Blomkamp had chosen being Ninja from the South African Hip Hop group Die Antwoord or Eminem (actually in all honesty I'm glad he wasn't chosen). It could have given the character a very different feel. The one character I despised though was that of Kruger played by Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A-Team) he really annoyed me, I'm not sure if it was the accent used or something but I found it so forced and over the top (really hope that's not his natural voice) either way he really annoyed me. The two worlds Blomkamp and his team have created was actually quite stunning for both its beauty and ugliness, Elysium itself is just a picture of beauty in every way you can imagine very much makes you want to be there. Violence, death and destruction is throughout the film and the death scenes are very imaginative and brutal not too bad at all some of them. Not really one for the kids but let that be your decision. Elysium is a fun fast paced ride with some interesting moments and a very heavy message for the leaders of our world. Also Jodie Foster who plays Delacourt is in it too and I know how many people can't stand the poor woman, she's OK but nothing special so don't expect much from her."

In a movie like this nobody wants to see an old, scared man fighting for a super wealthy high-tech space city, he seems completely irrelevant and was not needed, they could have substituted him with anything else.<br/><br/>What bothers me the most about this movie - They show a torn up Los Angeles, and guess what? 99% of the population is Mexican, really? Really, Hollywood? That is very disrespectful, showing a bunch of poor scum living on a destroyed earth and they are all Mexican? That is racist and i just couldn't get along with this idea. Also, everybody on earth is partying, drinking alcohol like 24/7, very few people work, how the hell can they sustain themselves? Where do they get the alcohol, it falls from the sky?

He needs to find a director that can tap into the potential that was shown in District 9. Diego Luna was over-the- top ""cartoony"" as the lead rebel while Alice Braga was bland as the love interest. I don't even know what Jodie Foster was doing in this picture (I sure don't know what her accent was).

The themes of overpopulation, a lack or resources and poor health care on Earth with the contrast of a utopia on Elysium was great. However, this wasn't utilised. Elysium was hardly shown beyond the inside parliament offices. Again, the politics of 'zero- tolerance policy' with the police on Earth was just forgotten about. The automated robots that gave you a chance to talk to real humans was an interesting concept. Now the plot was interesting, but it only really got started because of the accident with the radiation. And the leukaemia. Which brings another point. If health care was so simple on Elysium, surely it would be better on Earth. Could people not club together to buy a machine that makes you a better in a matter of seconds? Once the story got moving it interesting downloading the data from Elysium. But why take the child to Elysium? why care? Once they got there I felt as though they were just running down unknown corridors, shooting unknown people. It had all been done before and got boring.

","While it doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by DISTRICT 9, ELYSIUM is a very entertaining sci-fi film with a message. Something that Neill Blomkamp does very well is create a believable world with interesting characters, and he does that here as well. The world in the film feels very realized and believable. Also, the special effects used to enhance it are very effective as well. The story is rather simple. Matt Damon's character, Max, gets a lethal dose of radiation and has to find a way to Elysium to get treatment. In this movie, the poor remain on Earth while the richest in society have migrated to a torus satellite called Elysium. However, some needless complications to the plot bring down the movie a little bit, most notably a coup d'etat subplot that feels shoehorned in to give Jodie Foster's character more to do. The movie also isn't very subtle in its messaging, practically hitting the viewer over the head with its plea for universal healthcare. Still, it's an admirable message, but one that could have been handled more deftly. Another thing that could have been improved was the central relationship between Max and his childhood friend, now a nurse whose daughter is dying from leukemia. Even though this has to be one of the biggest coincidences ever, it still works in the context of the story. Still, despite the over-complication in the plot, Elysium delivers an exciting story, with great action (although edited a little too chaotically) and a timely message."

The acting is decent, the visuals are fine - and on some occasions very impressive, and the story is sort of interesting. But none of it really feels convincing.<br/><br/>The film tries to do too many things at once and therefore doesn't quite hit home in any specific area. There are several significant story arcs here.<br/><br/>Firstly you have the relationship between the protagonist (Damon) and his childhood sweetheart. There is a little bit of time devoted to this relationship but it ultimately comes across as very superficial indeed. This relationship binds the main characters together to some extent but you never quite feel that there is any chemistry between the two. We never really end up caring about either of them, or their ""bond"".<br/><br/>Secondly you have the interesting spacecraft ""Elysium"" orbiting above Earth. This should really have been explored much more deeply. There are lots of ideas here that are relevant to modern life and the disparity of wealth that we have in the world. The ""haves"" and the ""have nots"". You have parallels with issues of immigration where people will take any risk for a better life. You have the wilful separation of those with money and those without, and the draconian enforcement of law for the masses through an automated and touchy group of robot law enforcement machines. But all of this stuff just ends up becoming a flimsy background to the next bit...<br/><br/>And that is of course the devious computer programme designed to help the failing business of... some guy, by installing a new person in charge of the Elysium space craft. It's just a bit silly and hard to buy into yet this issue is what it all revolves around.<br/><br/>Prior to watching this, I did not know that this was made by the team behind District 9. I thought that was a great film, and it really did strike home. I think the major difference is that this film takes itself a little bit too seriously, has almost no humour, and doesn't convincingly tackle the themes it addresses in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>A fairly pedestrian film, which is surprising given the cast.

","I'm writing this after only watching once so don't expect much detail or correct names of the characters. I'm a massive sci fi film buff and looked forward to this one as Matt Damon is a good watch. The start of this film set a great picture of the intended plot and laid a base of what could be a great film. But not long in I was thinking ahead and I foresaw the end pretty much at the start. The film felt like it started at a good pace in order to build to a climactic finale but soon became rushed and I felt the acting was hurried and too much happened in the middle of the film. The attempt of an emotional end was too reminiscent of blood diamond . There were hardly any real memorable scenes and there wasn't enough footage of what it is actually like living in Elysium, no twists and a pretty poor storyline and the end left me thinking is this the end or the beginning. On a positive, the special effects were great. Too much crammed into one film and left me thinking how Tom cruises 'oblivion' had no competition for the modern sci-fi. I feel a bit let down."

","This is a bleak imagining of the future on Earth: the carefree rich capitalist class all decamp to a safe and remote playground leaving the stricken poor working class to stew in poverty and grind out profits for them. Hey, isn't that the present?<br/><br/>Elysium is the vast elite space station of which everyone wants to be a citizen, Matt Damon plays a rather dying man eager to bring about regime change and helped by a gang of geeks armed with tinpot laptops and big ideas. And there are some good ideas in here, some good cgi cartoonery on display – pity none of the characters are worth bothering about though. I was left thinking why all the time, money and brains spent on this couldn't have instead been gone to produce Ringworld on film at last. Now there's a good story! Mentioning brains: there are a few gratuitous gruesome violent scenes in here too, probably completely acceptable to the majority of people, but such childish indiscipline doesn't appeal to me. Also, to think a change to a computer programme can reboot global capitalism and bring NHS saviours to a renewed perpetually smiling populace is not only childish but woefully misleading. If capitalism is still in force in 2154 then it will be solely because the majority of the world's human population have wanted it that way in the intervening years. It'll be entirely our fault if it turns out like this movie.<br/><br/>For all that, I would've absolutely loved it as a kid (especially the violence), quite like it as an adult (especially the shortness), but now to press delete and log off as a cynic ""from which there's no coming back""."

","In the future evil people will wear suits and not want to live in slums. Therefore they construct an almighty space station called 'Elysium' to orbit the earth which is protected by robots who can shoot as straight as the Stormtroopers from Star Wars. Unfortunately, anyone who can't afford to live up there feels aggrieved and is therefore constantly trying to get up there in shuttles (to live for free at someone else's expense presumably?).<br/><br/>Enter our white Latino hero (?), Matt Damon, who is a hard working and virtuous pauper on Earth, who falls victim to an evil suit-wearing man's cruelty and only have five days to live. So he must find a way of getting up to Elysium to get the urgent medical treatment he needs.<br/><br/>So, he and his friends basically set out to steal, kill and blow up any evil person in a suit who stands in their way. Jodie Foster is the most evil person in a suit who is so evil she believes that Elysium should be inhabited by people who can afford to be there, instead of anyone who simply wants to go and live there for free. Therefore, she sends her top hit-man Sharlto Copley (by far the film's best part) to hunt him down. And, while Copley is the best part -amazingly - Jodie Foster is the worst. For a great actress, she doesn't really shine. She delivers all her lines like she's reading them in the most clichéd way possible. If this film was made in a single day then it would definitely be Jodie Foster's 'one bad day.' However, Elysium does look good. It's written and directed by Neill Blomcamp (of District 9 fame) and could almost be a companion piece to it. It has a great 'future-industrial' feel to it.<br/><br/>What lets this film down is its total in-your-face political message that 'all poor people are virtuous, hard-working and there simply to be exploited by the rich' while anyone who has earned their money (and wears a suit) is evil. In every second to Elysium the story rams this message down your throat, showing how whatever violent means the poor take, it's justified because they're poor. Yes, the film looks nice and Sharlto Copley is great (as ever), the whole thing seems a little too preachy to be taken as seriously as it tries to be.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

Instead the bulk of the plot follows Matt Damon as he tries to get there.

","Neil Blomkamp made a great directorial debut with 'District 9', one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. This time he teams up with Academy Award winner Matt Damon for 'Elysium', a futuristic film that reflect the wealth gap in nations in the entire world. Matt Damon plays Max, a man who lives on earth in 2154. Earth is in horrible condition due to overpopulation, war, disease etc. Since its sci-fi there's a space ship. It's called Elysium and is prettier than Disney World. Here a corrupt Jodie Foster in an ill-cast role is in charge of the ship and kills anyone from Earth who attempts to join her in space. Max eventually has to go to Elysium in order to safe himself and Earth. I wouldn't spoil why he has to go up. This is a total popcorn film that isn't pure stupidity and explosions. It has a really interesting theme of immigration and how wealth in shared unequally in many nations, just how District 9 had a message about apartheid in South Africa. The visual effects are very well-done as well and provide excellent entertainment. A good futuristic film is always fun, and its even better when there's robots, explosives, cool guns, and strong themes to back it up so it isn't complete trash."

","Elysium, first off there's something one should really know about this movie. The end is Matt Damon getting into a Cyborg fight with a samurai sword involved while in space. If that sounds kickass to you, then you'll probably have a good time watching this.<br/><br/>But beyond the well directed action scenes, and some beautiful FX work, the story of Elysium feels rather too small for the big screen. It feels like District 9, but less personal, or ""Source Code"", that's a good comparison. There's neither a real personal attachment to our protagonist and his struggles, where he comes off a bit too much of a ""generic everyman with generic feeling problems"".<br/><br/>Nor yet is there some overwhelming feeling of attachment to large events. Elysium, the super cool looking space station, feels like an abstraction. We never get to know about the people there, what they're like, who they are, what the station is about. So when the fate of the station hangs in the balance we just kind of shrug.<br/><br/>The same goes for the people of this future Earth. Beyond ""shitty"" we don't really get a sense of place or purpose. Is the whole world like this, is it just LA, what is the world even like? We don't even get to see much of beyond a few locales Damon visits.<br/><br/>The second problem is with the morale of the whole thing. What exactly is it? It feels like there should be one, like it's trying to say something or other about... healthcare. But what it's trying to say beyond ""it would be really nice if there were enough cool robot doctors to treat everyone on the planet"" isn't really clear.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, because an action movie with an actual moral beyond some idiotic and meaningless platitudes/totally weird megalomaniacal plots like in The Dark Knight or The Winter Soldier would be nice. Like something that makes sense and people can relate too. And Elysium feels like it wants to have a morale like that, but can never quite decide what exactly it is so viewers are left feeling like they were hit over the head by very vague and unclear morality tale.<br/><br/>But let's go back to the beginning. Because I said there was a cyborg fight in space involving a Katana. And it did indeed kick ass, and there were more such moments all throughout, interspersed with awesome sci-fi eye candy and solid acting jobs from Matt Damon and Sharto Copley, even if neither really had some sort of overarching bigger story to add too."
"david-meldrum","6","0","0","11 April 2014"," Plenty of promise, but fails to fully deliver
","A peril of blogging about film is that it can give the inadvertent impression that my opinion of a given film is fixed. My blog about District 9 is a case in point. I enjoyed much about that film the first time around, but I concluded that it didn't have the depth it liked to think it did. I've re- watched it multiple times since (largely because it's a film people like to watch when they visit us in South Africa), and my admiration has grown and deepened. I still find it exciting and fun, but I keep seeing new depth in it too. It turns out that it was I who wasn't thinking deeply enough.<br/><br/>So it's with a little apprehension that I finally settled down to watch the director (Neill Blomkamp) follow-up to that film, Elysium. Worryingly, my conclusions are similar if less positive overall; there's much that's good about it, but it's ultimately disappointing. Like the former, this is a science-fiction earthed in the director's South African reality. This time the context is the division between rich and poor; Earth has been left behind by the elite for an idyllic space- station called Elysium, always in view and out of sight by the teeming masses of poor left behind, grinding out lives of subsistence, dead-end jobs and subservience to a system loaded against them. Matt Damon gets caught up in an industrial accident on Earth; seeking healing he's embarked on a dangerous course of action to earn illegal passage to the man-made paradise and certain healing.<br/><br/>There's so much about Neill Blomkamp's emerging style. He knows the grammar of science- fiction films well, but his is an authentically original voice and style. He directs actions scenes brilliantly in a post-Bourne world, using hand-held shaking cameras well but in a subtly different way. Every action scene is gripping and involving. As someone who lives in South Africa I like that he uses South African talent and patois alongside better known talent and language. Throwaway South African slang is brilliantly used to draw into the film's world, not alienate. District 9's star is back again, similarly intense but in a key supporting role and a world away from that film's fear-struck vulnerability.<br/><br/>Overall, though, it just doesn't work. Key supporting roles (Jodie Foster's being a case in point) are under-written to the point that we're never quite sure what they're for even at key plot moments; the coldness of the privileged elite seems less like the gap between rich and poor and more like lazy writing. Other than good medical care and nice gardens, Elysium itself doesn't seem to have any actual content - which means the gap between rich and poor is never quite established beyond a need for good health care. Which might make sense (and it does) in South Africa, but just doesn't work for the film's central theme. By the time the climactic scenes roll around, you're impressed and entertained, but confused as to quite what's happening and why it all matters so much to so may people.<br/><br/>It's a shame, but not a crying one. It's still a decent film, but I'd be really surprised if I grew to feel about this film the way I do about District 9. What we do know for certain, though, is that Neill Blomkamp is a director to watch with excitement."
"oceanic_osprey","7","0","0","21 February 2014"," Nothing like a bit of segregation......
","Greetings all, Let me start by stating that which is most obvious. Yes we all know that nothing of Blomkamp's will ever stand up to his masterpiece that is District 9, but never fear, as this does a reasonably good job! I am always one for visuals and here we have another treat, with cgi performed by the same team from D9 this is stunning once again, while still able to capture the grit and feel of world in poverty and the polar opposite, being the Stanford torus design of Elysium. My first major gripe is that the space habitat does not feature nearly as much as I had hoped.<br/><br/>All political sub-plots and messages aside, I found myself often not buying the juxtaposition of both worlds, most importantly the impoverished population just did not seem to gel for me. And with so little showing of the Elysium inhabitants it was difficult to draw any real comparison. For that reason alone I found this film lacking in such respects.<br/><br/>In which case I would relish the opportunity of more hyper-violence and action as substitute for the lacking of a real-world feel, but unfortunately the action is few and far between. And when we do get glimpses they are as astonishing as ever, which leaves us only wanting more.<br/><br/>I may sound overly critical here but to me all this was mere foibles, and nothing that could tarnish what I already had thoroughly enjoyed. Damon fits the lead as good as he ever has before, he brings an inner strength and silent resolve that this character sorely needed. With a decent supporting cast, especially from a certain recurring actor in Sharlto Copley. And not, in some cases, such as the out of place Jodie Foster or the difficult to understand Spyder character.<br/><br/>Overall I found this a highly entertaining movie, this time (when referring to D9) with less to think about and more to watch, with some very, very nice set pieces to dwell on. Should you long to feel more dystopian future-ness, then by all means go into this with having slightly lowered the bar from the echelon of District 9 and you will be pleasantly surprised!"

","Android : What is in the bag? Max: Hair care products, mostly.<br/><br/>Lately we are getting quite spoiled in the SF area. Elysium is a pessimistic view of the future with an overpopulated earth with the known problems. Elysium is an artificial oasis of tranquility where only billionaires can buy a place to live. Each home is equipped with a ""cure-bed"" so that all the inhabitants can enjoy a healthy and disease-free life. The less fortunate stayed on Earth and try to survive in an unhealthy poor environment under strict supervision of droids.<br/><br/>You can obviously sense the paternalistic social message of the widening gap between rich and poor. It's illegal to try to reach Elysium. It makes you think of the border between Mexico and the U.S. which at this very moment people still try to cross so they can exchange the poverty with a more blessed future. Furthermore, I see it as a reflection of the health-care as it is known now in the U.S. Those who can afford it, get the best treatment.<br/><br/>I've never seen the movie ""District 9"" (but now it's surely on my list), and have no idea whether ""Elysium"" looks identical. I must admit that the CGI is spectacular. The design of the residential areas on the Earth, the immense factory where droids are assembled, the droids themselves look flashy and sexy, the vehicles used (especially the scene with Carlyle's transport) are magnificent, Elysium itself is staggeringly brilliantly imaged and the robotic armor that Max gets is stunningly realistic. The visuals are actually almost as stunning as in ""Oblivion"". The action clips are sensational filmed and the used weaponry fits perfectly with the rest of the entire movie. The movie has a damn high rate and makes you sit on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The content of the movie and the story are so clichéd and told in similar movies (but you can always come up with that argument). The overpopulated world reminded me of that one in ""Dredd"". And the separation between rich and poor was also shown in ""Upside Down"".<br/><br/>The characters are a list of stereotypes: an ex-prisoner back on a straight path and who became a decent citizen earning his daily bread by doing a shitty job. Of course he will be the hero of the story. For me it's also a sort of love story with the obligatory little nurse and a gang of ruthless criminals who'll chase him until they drop dead.<br/><br/>There were also some things that were absolutely ridiculous. There's radioactivity in the plant and everyone works without protective clothing? OK, they were all people who are negligible and can be replaced by others. But where is the radioactivity when the droids are assembled? Spider could have already used that instrument that he put on Max and used one of his henchmen to form a super-killing machine ! Arriving on Elysium is illegal and not so simple since all is terribly guarded, but when everything comes online again, Spider can land there quite easily. Kruger's head is almost completely blown off by a grenade, but his brains are still functioning so he can be fully restored. Okay, it's called SF but that was a bit over the top. Especially when afterwards Delacourt dies of an innocent stabbing wound in the neck. Well, must have been a retaliation for her bad acting performance.<br/><br/>Yes lets talk about the acting now. Matt Damon did it again on autopilot and it was a joy to see him again in an action-packed role like ""Bourne"". The ""worst acting performance ever""-nomination goes to Foster. I sometimes had the impression that she was a droid. Inspiration-free conversations, a ridiculous accent and she made no impression as the cruel and unfeeling Secretary of Defense. For me, Kruger was the most colorful person in this movie. Surprisingly he sang a Dutch sounding song at a given time. After a bit of reading on the net, i found out it was South African. In any case, it was a perfect portrayal of a deranged and canny mercenary who is used to do the dirty jobs. The young nurse and her daughter suffering from leukemia unfortunately only were used for the corny part. Luckily they didn't go to far in using a possible love story between her and Max. To me they were just childhood friends who have grown apart.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A first-rate SF with extremely titillating images with a social message and mixed with a touching theme that calls for a happy ending. The only sad thing is that Max dies ... He's probably spending his time now at the Elysian fields among all the other blessed.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","From the Writer/Director of District 9, comes Elysium, a futuristic tale that focuses on the inequality of wealth. Much like in his first film, Neill Blomkamp is examining a modern problem with a futuristic story, and once again, he isn't offering any solutions. As with District 9, Blomkamp is showing how an unsolved issue, left to it's own devices, will eventually cause chaos. In 2154, Earth is overpopulated and in ruins. The rich have built a utopian society on the largest space station ever conceived, and as you may have guessed, it's called Elysium. The story focuses on Max, an orphan and ex-con, who has always dreamed of living in paradise on Elysium. His plans to earn his way take a dramatic turn, when he is injured in an accident at work. Max knows he'll never survive on Earth and the only way to save his life is to get some of the advanced medical treatment available on Elysium. The two stories are very different, but the setting could have been exactly the same. The story itself was pretty good, there was a lot more action then in District 9, yet the similarities are unmistakable. Matt Damon stars and played the role he was asked to play. Max had a lot of potential to be an interesting character, perhaps one with an agenda, instead he was written as this dumb guy, who was anything but a savior to the people of Earth. Max was out to save himself and did what was necessary to survive, but he should have been more. The people all turned to Max to help solve a greater problem, but all he cared about was himself. Jodie Foster also stars, but has a surprisingly small role, that definitely did not fit her personality. Much like District 9 before it, the story of Elysium is used as a forum for the Writers agenda. The two stories are very different, but the technology, locations, and even several cast members are the same. The result is a slightly better movie than District 9, that will give you an eerie feeling of deja vu throughout."

","I had high hopes for this film because of the director's previous film and the star power associated with it. But it ended up feeling so predictable and uninteresting in the second half that I left the viewing disappointed. The action was OK but I just didn't feel any vested interest in the characters. Jodie Foster's character was severely underused in this film that I feel she could have been played by any other actor without affecting the film. Matt Damon did a good job, as he often does, but his motivation for getting to Elysium felt a bit weak. The main standout, as others have said, was Kruger (Sharlto Copley). He disappeared into his role and was so different from his previous roles that you could forget it was an actor when watching the movie."

","I watched the first half, if not the first two thirds of the movie with excitement. The rhythm and pace were near perfect, the story itself almost made sense and the internal logic, while shaky at times (why give him an exoskeleton and no one else?) was almost appropriate. Then it went downhill... It appears the filmmakers forgot to write an ending to the movie as the narrative suddenly and absolutely went all over the place, throwing logic and common sense out the window on their way to device a completely implausible happy ending (sans Damon) to suit an anti-conformist message for the movie. Don't get me wrong, I share the ""message"" but the ending unvalidated the meaning. The beginning of the end comes after the murder of John Carlyle (beautifully played by William Fitchner). Well the murder itself was the result of such a contrive course of events and complete coincidence that it was hard to digest, but let's say... Delacourt (Jodie Foster) wants anyone and everyone dead as the deadly secret lodged in Carlyle's brain is now within a computer hard drive somewhere (yeah...) In any events, let's say... it's OK. She reactivates her favorite killer, Kruger (an excellent Copley who shows an amazing range from one film to another) who finds Da Costa (Damon), loses him but figures out where he's been before (????), again contriving Da Costa's girlfriend kidnapping (along with her sick daughter)... Kruger reveals his sadistic side, brings the women to Elysium, has his face blown away, is restored but comes out more sadistic than ever, takes over the joint while Da Costa's friends fly to an undefended Elysium. The suspense is well done but so artificial you cannot possibly believe it. Now let's be clear: the last third of the film displays a rhythmic break, a complete divorce, from the rest of the narrative. His good for nothing ""ally"" (Spider) all of sudden risks his life for... I'm still not sure... I was a bit surprised that both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes' ratings were in the 60s (reflecting reviewers ratings, of course). If you rate this movie based on politics, so be it. If you review it on a technical and narrative level, unfortunately it is a failure."

","With a cast of Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, Sharlto Copley and Wagner Moura, directed by Neill Blomkamp, with a huge budget - what can go wrong? Apparently, a lot.<br/><br/>ELYSIUM is like OBLIVION (2013) (the sci-fi-disaster starring Cruise). It is visually really neat, cast and budget is as good as it gets and directors are considered some of the best right now.<br/><br/>But both have major problems. I won't go into Oblivion - that's a different story.<br/><br/>Elysium starts out with great visuals, which is its strength. It then goes on to try to describe the main character Max (Damon), but fails to deliver something interesting. It's a misch-masch of boring scenes where nothing really happens.<br/><br/>Introduction to other (major) characters, as Spider (Moura) is sloppy. Foster gets a lot of screen time, but her direction was obviously not great. Feels like she's reading cue-cards. She looks and feels extremely uncomfortable until her death scene - which seems to be a relief of finally being written out of this mess. That's also her best performance in this film, maybe just because of that.<br/><br/>Best of the actors, however, is the too little used character Frey, played by the excellent Alice Braga. She doesn't seem to have anything to prove, and because of this, she makes a small and pretty insignificant character believable and good.<br/><br/>Worst if the character Spider (though the always good Moura does what he can with the badly written part), who is presented as a bad-guy in the beginning, but turns good in the end - for no particular reason at all.<br/><br/>But it is the script that makes this a bland and uninteresting film. It simply doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Yes - SPOILERS ahead: If the ""med bays"" was so important to the story - why not introduce them a bit better and earlier? And why didn't we see that this is the reason why Elysium is fighting against the Earth population? As it is presented now, there seem to be an enormous amount of med-bays - and if that is the case, why not give the Earth population access to them (as they do in the end, which doesn't affect Elysium at all, by the way) and in one blow remove the will and reason for the Earth population to try to gain access to Elysium. Now sure, there are other reasons to go to Elysium, but the Elysium powers-at-be, would have a stronger power over the Planet's population.<br/><br/>All this is never addressed, and it's the main flaw in the whole script. Worse is: the whole story hangs on it. Which actually makes the whole movie completely illogical and totally useless. What's the point, really? I still give this movie a 5 out of 10. It deserves some points for visuals, cast and for some interesting scenes. I like the locations (most, except those that look like taken from ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK), props, costumes and vehicles.<br/><br/>Music is bland, gore and violence is extremely uneven (very gory at a few points, and nothing at most other instances), script is terrible and direction is lacking.<br/><br/>It's disappointing to see such a promising director as Bloomkamp not being successful here. I can only assume it has something to do with the high budget. With this high budget, the producers and investors get way too much power - both over storyline as over final edit. Maybe Bloomkamp can, in the future, go back and re-edit something better out of this. It kind of deserves it."

He was the next big thing and here we stand with his SF big budget Elysium.<br/><br/>You still can spot some District elements but Elysium will never become a classic because it does not add anything to the genre.

","Written by: Neill Blomkamp Directed by: Neill Blomkamp Starring: Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley Running time: 109 min. Country: USA<br/><br/>Elysium (2013, the new film by Neil Blomkamp , known for his success with the movie District 9, shows the extreme separation of social classes that the human being can endure.<br/><br/>The film is set in the year 2159, when Earth suffers from being depleted of natural resources, destroyed by technology and overpopulated. It is the planet where only the poor and decaying humans live to serve as labor for the rich who live in Elysium, a space station designed to be the perfect environment where all citizens have the right to use a machine, this exclusive world, healing any kind of disease or infirmity. <br/><br/>The action begins when Max (Matt Damon) suffers an accident and is infected by radiation. His boss, a citizen of Elysium, does not care about his situation and he will have only five more days to live. The only way to survive he would go to Elysium to use the cure machine. For this he asks Spider for help, the character played by Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, who was handpicked by the director after seeing his performance in ""Tropa de Elite"" 1 and 2 movies. <br/><br/>Spider is working illegally trying to send sick people from Earth to be cured in Elysium. He accepts to send Max to one of their trips if he helps him to reconfigure the system of Elysium,transforming all Earth citizens in official citizens of Elysium, giving everyone equal rights. Clearly the leaders of the space station did not like this plan, starting a hunt for communists that gives a special touch to the film. <br/><br/>And talking about special touch, again Alice Braga makes all the difference in an American cast. The Brazilian plays Frey Santiago, a childhood friend of Max's, who he is in love with. Frey has a daughter with leukemia, and fights alongside Max to save them both.<br/><br/>Merging science fiction, social criticism, sustainability and romance, Elysium is a great movie for those who like a lot of action and a well tied plot at the same time. Not to mention the special effects and the technological equipment that give the characters futuristic and painful elements, such as the steel exoskeleton that is deployed to the body of the protagonist for him to fight with police robots that would be lethal to any unprepared human."

","When I first saw this movie I was stuck with the idea that I was not going to like it. I'm sorry but I don't like Matt Damon and there he was though, in a futuristic science fiction movie! So, yep, I began to watch the movie with low standards and no expectations... But then I was surprised by the simple but somehow efficient story, by the fact that Matt Damon was good in his role and by the amazing way the special effects were implanted in the real environment. I really really enjoyed the special effects which were worked at a perfectionist level. Not in a ""Prometheus way"" but in a realistic way. The special effects we ""don't see"" in a movie are for me the best. This movie is a pretty good example of what special effects should be... The story wasn't really surprising though but sufficient. As I said earlier I was only surprised by the fact that I gently entered into the scenario without finding it boring or totally uninteresting. It could have been better but I thought it could have been worst! Then, it was not that bad and in fact, a good surprise!"

","For its creator, it's hard to surpass District 9. That mind-blowing, action packed, original debut couldn't possible compete with a movie starring Matt Damon. <br/><br/>That said, Elysium has certain visual similarities reminiscing District 9 that will surely become a good trademark for its director. It also has the star of District 9 now in the role of evil and crazy psycho, which I find nice and funny. I found hilarious the way he used some dutch words in District 9 and, in Elysium, his repertoire expanded! Don't know how this will fit with people who don't have a clue of Nerderlands. For those fortunate enough to understand it, even the basic, it might be funny, like in my case.<br/><br/>Apart from that, this movie repeats the little mistake -in my opinion- that other scifi flicks make: set a year. Why say ""In the year 2154"" or whatever? I always then to find that not knowing what year the film is supposed to be set in gives a certain sense of mystery and, perhaps, even reality (they used to set old film in the year 2000 and have flying cars and robots around... I still have to see any of those in the real world).<br/><br/>The creator once again focuses on the issue of immigration and how the government (mis)treat these people (or aliens, in the case of District 9). <br/><br/>Alas, fun enough to watch once.

","""Elysium"" is the second feature film from South African writer/director Neill Blomkamp, whose 2009's ""District 9"" was one of the few recent Sci-fi/Fantasy films that rightfully deserves the title of visionary. Here, Blomkamp delivers a less astounding effort, but an entertaining and appealing socially conscious bit of futurism made on a much larger scale than its $30 million predecessor. However, unlike ""District 9,"" the story of ""Elysium"" gets lost in battle once the weapons open fire without an exit plan in its mesmerizing futuristic landscape.<br/><br/>In 2154, the earthly population is split into two camps. The rich live in the luxurious space station Elysium, where the atmosphere is so pure that diseases are nonexistent. All those who cannot afford to reside in Elysium, must continue to existence on the contaminated soil of Earth. One of its inhabitants is Max (Matt Damon), a former criminal, who now works a routine job at a factory that produces security robots for Elysium. One day at work, Max absorbs a lethal amount of radiation, and he is given a bottle of pills from his employer to ease his pain for the few days he has left to live. With his life on the line, Max agrees to take on a daunting mission that if successful, will not only save his life, but could bring equality to these polarized worlds.<br/><br/>Max and his team attempt to kidnap and download financial information from the brain of John Carlyle (William Fichtner), the CEO of Max's former employer. Instead, they download evidence of a coup being planned by Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster), a cold-hearted official in the Elysium government who will do anything to protect Elysium from the unwelcome masses.<br/><br/>At a compact 109 minutes, ""Elysium"" is great-looking entertainment that might have reached its lofty expectations with a longer cut that would allow characters the space needed to develop back stories and expand. Damon's performance manages to humanize Max to a certain degree, but ""Elysium"" suffers from some hammy performances, most notably Copley as the video game like villain Kruger. Instead of devoting time to character development and the juxtaposition of the two populations involving associated conflicts, Blomkamp decides to take the action route. The second half of the movie resorts to adrenaline-driven action which grows increasingly tedious with the use of a shaky cam that only leads to a sense of nausea.<br/><br/>As in ""District 9,"" Blomkamp shows a wizardly eye who gets the most out of the visual effects, making sure CG images have the proper movement and texture to blend seamlessly with live-action and practical elements. The CGI effects however, while highly impressive, only take us so far, and offer only diminishing returns. Blomkamp's universe is a fascinating place containing interesting ideas, but there's far too much here to satisfactorily explore in its brief run time. Despite falling short as a social commentary and suffering from tonal severity, ""Elysium"" is most certainly visually stimulating."
"michelb-83-46554","6","0","0","10 December 2013"," good action flick, not a significant movie.
","I'm a little disappointed by Elysium because I thought Blomkamp had more to say, coming from District 9. I imagined it would have been repetitive but still interesting if he kept exploring the segregation and racism theme in a sci-fi movie. Instead Elysium follows the blockbuster road with a plot already seen in many, many action movies. I won't reveal anything but you'll easily recognize similarities. Kind of a shame given the talent of Blomkamp. Not much to say on the acting, Matt Damon and Jodie Foster were flawless as usual and everyone else was fine too, but there wasn't any space for characters development, so no Oscars here.<br/><br/>However, when you make peace with the fact that this is just an action movie you're actually in for a treat. The camera work is outstanding, there are a couple of new ideas very well implemented that really gets you excited about the fight scenes even if you're slammed on the sofa eating cookies like I was. The android technology shown and created for this future era is also brilliant and it's where Blomkamp always shines.<br/><br/>So I advise to watch it because it's quite entertaining, but don't expect anything else then a couple of hours of Matt Damon fighting in a prosthetic android skeleton."

","District 9 was a brilliant film and so a tough act to follow up. Elysium is visually and stylistically very similar to D9, but with a different story. The plot strongly reminded me of Battle Angel with influences from other scifi pop culture like Terminator, Mass Effect etc. The VFX are incredibly well done and very believable. The cinematography is mainly hand-held which gives you more the feeling that you're there and makes it feel more dynamic. Casting Matt Damon as the lead seems a bit odd, and although he doesn't do a bad job he feels a bit out of place. They also asked Eminem for the lead part but that would definitely have been worse. Jodie Foster plays the heavy but she has a British-like accent and she does seem to overact a little bit. Sharlto Copley on the other hand was well cast as the lunatic merc. So to round up, I found it a very enjoyable film and it was about what I expected but the plot could have been fleshed out a bit better, the characters seems a bit flat and the film lacks heart for lack of a better term. His next film 'Chappie' will be a scifi comedy with a robot in the lead and will be loosely based on his 2003 short Tetra Vaal. Jackman, Weaver, Copley and Dev Patel have already been confirmed as cast so this should be interesting :)"

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","0","30 September 2013"," A more mainstream Blomkamp and an ever dependable Damon
","Word has long been out that ""District 9"" South African director Niell Blokamp, lured to Hollywood expectedly by big budget, has conformed to a degree to its mainstream filmmaking. Flashes of brilliance are still there although the allegory has become less subtle and the general presentation less innovative and risk taking. The grounds of this epic sci-fi are all familiar, a fatally wounded Earth, not by apocalyptic events like nuclear war or natural disasters like comet hit, but through human stupidity that escalated population growth, poverty and disease in exponential proportions.<br/><br/>The key message, the social disease of polarization of wealth and poverty, is driven home in no uncertain terms, not by something as ingenious as in ""In time"", but explicitly through visual image of the titular object, which gives a literal ring to the familiar idiom of ""pie in the sky"". A most illustrious critic describes it as a Mercedes-Benz logo, which is not wrong but missing the point, failing to mention the key aspect of the wheel-shape space paradise – physics lessons that grade school kids may already know. The spinning wheel is to create center of gravity. Those who have seen Stanley Kubrick's all-time classic ""2001"" would remember the protagonist jogging along the inside circle, which would be up-side-down from the POV of the center of the wheel. Elysium is pretty much the same, but unimaginably bigger, with the inside strip populated by plush mansions, gardens, parks, even small lakes.<br/><br/>The plot is straightforward, and not particularly smart, surrounding a pod-like device on Elysium into which you can place a very ill and-or injured individual, close the lid, press a button and in two seconds, he or she comes out whole. Among the horde of people wishing to go to Elysium are the protagonist, an earthy (this word acquiring an added, literal meaning here) factory worker (Matt Damon) who just got exposed to radioactivity during work and has 5 days to live and his love interest's (Alice Braga) little daughter with leukemia. Not wanting them, or anyone else from ghetto Earth for that matter, to pollute this paradise is its absolutely ruthless defense secretary (Jodie Foster). The rest, even when there is a lot, are bells and whistles – nothing you have not seen before in a Hollywood sci-fi.<br/><br/>Despite the weak plot which basically parades our protagonist through all kinds of pain, physical and emotional – the classic suffering hero personified – this movie is quite watchable. Blomkamp delivers in the visual department, as expected of him. Acting is good too, led by Damon who has grown to inhabit this kind of character with his likability in such a way they Hollywood would always turn to him as the first choice. Alice Braga, after ""I am legend"" (2007), Predators (2010) and now this may be on her way to become some sort of Queen of Sci-fi and I suspect a majority of sec-fi audiences would like it. To be perfectly honest, the poor script doesn't give much to Foster to do other than to look terrible. Foster doing just that is certainly an asset to this movie."

In just a few scenes they are able to get you attached to a girl dying of leukemia and make you feel connected to her when her and her single mom are kidnapped just for knowing the main character, who is being tracked down by a secret group within the government.

"KoreanPenguin","7","0","0","17 September 2013"," This is Not District 9, but it sure is Fun
","Since my first viewing of ""District 9"" from 2009, I have anxiously awaited director Neill Blomkamp's science fiction follow-up. ""Elysium"" was announced at some point last year or so, and I was practically leaping for joy with anticipation. As the release date grew ever closer, more information came pouring out on ""Elysium"" and it soon became evident that this was indeed not a sequel to the very successful ""District 9″. Let me assure you now that if you expect this to be any kind of successor to ""District 9″, you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Elysium"" is not a terrible movie by any means. It stars not only Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, but also the lead role from ""District 9″, Sharlto Copley.<br/><br/>In this dystopian tale however, we are dropped into a very gritty post-apocalyptia, as most futuristic visions are and should be. It's a brutal life for those left on earth. Overpopulation and disease has spread rampantly, leaving many living in favelas, or at least we can only assume. We don't see much of earth outside of the village of sorts that Max (Matt Damon) lives in. As our poor as dirt (literally) humans scrap for food and work, there does indeed exist a space station hovering in space called Elysium. This of course is where the wealthy live. A huge plus to inhabiting Elysium is the ability to lay down in an updated version of a tanning bed, and with an ID printed on your wrist, you can instantly become healed of injury, anything from diabetes to having half your head blown off. I think it's a nifty invention, and so do those on earth who pack together on a space shuttle and attempt to crash-land on Elysium to get a chance at a new life.<br/><br/>The two societies clash with the wealthy employing absolutely brutal robot police on earth, ready to strike down anyone who does not comply with their orders. Max is a lowly factory worker who runs his mouth a bit much. Within time, his arm is broke, and while I won't spoil too much more here, suffice to say it becomes necessary for him to visit Elysium. This isn't much more information than you are given by the film's trailers of course.<br/><br/>Alice Braga plays Max's love interest, and we are told they actually used to be quite close as children through flash backs. Apparently Max used to be catholic or something, and now he's an exceptionally hardened man, dependent on survival, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>Damon is quite good here, and seems to pull off a bald head quite well. While we may not be completely in the know on why he acts the way he does, we are convinced that he is determined to finish his goals. Foster plays a very android-like defense coordinator of Elysium, named Delacourt. She has some kind of ridiculous plot to take control of the space station, but her purpose seems to lose its way and reason within time. She's ice-cold, and Jodie Foster is quite good at that.<br/><br/>The point where ""Elysium"" loses its metallic luster is when we realize that Blomkamp is practically spoon-feeding us. ""District 9″ was obvious in many ways, but as we pulled for Copley's character, we may not be entirely sure what Max actually stands for. It's very clear that there is a lot of social commentary here about the rate at which our real world economies are being flushed down the toilet. The rich only get more wealthy, and the poor are forced to immeasurably more desperate means of survival. However, as we wonder about the future implications of a U.S. president that many claim is a socialist in disguise, Blomkamp's discussion on the economy begins turning astray. If he's not talking about that, then what is he talking about anyway? Maybe he never really was spoon-feeding us after all.<br/><br/>I hate to continue comparing ""Elysium"" to ""District 9″, but where the grittiness and brutality worked in the latter, it seems not to push the thematic as well here. There is a scene involving some surgery, and while it's no brain operation from the ""Saw"" franchise, it feels unnecessary. A woman is slapped hard across the face, and evil mercenaries are exploded into countless pieces. We sit on the edge of our seats, not so much for the adrenaline we are given, but perhaps only for the uncomfortable feeling in the pit of our stomachs, hoping to God that the next death may not be so brutal. That being said, Sharlto Copley plays an absolutely ruthless villain, named Kruger. It's really something to see. His dialogue is pretty weak, but every time he's on-screen, we cringe.<br/><br/>I felt as if I have been a bit harsh towards ""Elysium"" but as I have encouraged in previous reviews I have written, please do not take my word for it. I hope only that what I write helps you to discover details in films and entertainment that perhaps you may have missed on your first viewing. I am not a film critic by any means, but ""Elysium"" unfortunately misses the mark in some areas, and those are the areas that I think matter most. I want to care for Max, but the filmmaker's don't truly give us the capacity to do so. This being said, take time to digest the films that you watch, and take the time to discuss them. Ingesting entertainment without discretion will not only brutalize your discernment, but will destroy your ability to willfully comprehend whatever you just watched."

It wants to be 3 genres, but it doesn't work so well. 1. Sci-fi 2. Action 3. Drama<br/><br/>The sci-fi part doesn't have no problems. But, the action and drama parts are working separately, but not together.<br/><br/>I think, it's because its running time is very little for this, only 109 minutes.<br/><br/>Blomkamp should've taken out one of them.<br/><br/>In, first case, without the action part, they should've taken out some shooting and fighting scene (or make them shorter by editing), and take in it more things about Fray and her daughter, so the audience may love them, and more scenes to Damon can be more bounded to them.<br/><br/>In, second case, without the drama part, they should've taken more shooting and fighting, and make the story-telling less, and do the happy-ending.<br/><br/>The thing what makes the movie very good (for me), is the incredibly excellent CGI, and the fast, cool action scenes.<br/><br/>The actors aren't bad, or very good, just simply good, they bring the expected level.<br/><br/>All things considered, they should've taken out one genre, or let them, but make the movie longer, because we don't have enough time to bound to Fray and her daughter.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I see so many reviews around here saying this movie is a waste and its just bad. I still insist on watching the film on theater though, what amazes me is how the film delivered its uplifting story we tend to mislead our standards with this film because it is not just an action pack adventure sci-fi theme it have its lesson to tell and not just that it needs to rebuild our thinking of whats with the future ahead.<br/><br/>I am deeply amaze that today we can now conceptualize our future which holds a machine that cures every disease. The movie expresses its role to uplift and motivate each one of us that we have a purpose to fulfill and in-order to make it happen we should not forget what inspires us. Many movies contain an eye opening message about our future but this is one of those which is kinda realistic for me, because as our resources reach its scarcity our world will tend to die itself, even sustaining a healthy life. So we seek ways in order to live better."

","Although, initially, the film bored me, it became more entertaining mid- movie. <br/><br/>I think the screenplay was below par, as the plot felt a little rushed to begin with (like a quick back story to get us up to date), purely to set up for the more exciting climax of the film. However, once that was over, the storyline suddenly peaked my interest. <br/><br/>The motivation behind Max's actions were clear, and although in the end it becomes a bog standard boy-meets-girl subplot, the whole idea of the story is a redeeming factor. The villains were convincing enough, but I felt the motivation behind Delacourt's actions (other than the standard 'she was evil') were a tad foggy. <br/><br/>Overall, the film was not my favourite, but the whole idea of the story was a good one. The acting was good, the fight scenes okay, but the screenplay could have been improved."
"synthonic","6","0","0","12 September 2013"," Great potential, but full of holes.
","Well, not quite as awful as Oblivion, but not great. It was another Prometheus - astounding potential, great cast, good story, stunning visuals, but in the end just too many plot holes. I can forgive one or two, but there were many. Another example of a universe designed to serve a story, but which outgrew the story itself and ended up hindering the plot, making the whole thing feel contrived. <br/><br/>Also suffered from tech misalignment, something I'm seeing more and more of recently. For example, bio beds which can heal anything in seconds, even a grenade obliterated face, yet they're still using bullets, growing food, propelling ships with jets, have keyboards and 2d screens on their computers, power their exo suits with hydraulics, etc. The tech needed to build such bio beds, not to mention a vast self sufficient space station, would render everything else obsolete, including the class struggle the whole film is based on. I really wanted to like it too!<br/><br/>Those kinds of problems really are everywhere nowadays. Why would Spock (Star Trek - Into Darkness) need to hand deliver a device into a volcano? Why!? And why would scientists, exobiologists at that (Prometheus), take their helmets off in an alien environment which turns out to contain precisely the kind of pathogen their instruments cannot detect? Why!? The plot didn't even require them to remove their helmets, the aliens got through them anyway! Throws hands up in utter despair This is precisely the kind of slap-dash, badly thought-out nonsense you'll find in abundance in 'Elysium'. Sadly."
"wen77","5","0","0","9 September 2013"," Paradise lost..or simply never found?
","This is a very well made film. Neill Blomkamp shows, as he did in District 9, his visual effects origins, building a realistic and gritty dystopian landscape. The Taurus ring that is Elysium hangs like a chalky oversized moon in the smog, an aspiration to the young Max as elusive and irresistible as the stars.<br/><br/>The acting is faultlessly underplayed, pretty much as you'd expect from Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Sharlto Copley is terrifyingly absurd, showing on the back of his everyman in District 9 he has a reach and distinctiveness that could put him up there with the likes of Geoffrey Rush and Alan Rickman, especially when it comes to tortured villains.<br/><br/>The violence is graphic and specific, stomach churningly so in some places, yet the director never lingers too long, thus underpinning the casual, everyday nature of it.<br/><br/>In short it has everything that a serious Hollywood Blockbuster should have.<br/><br/>And yet.. I cannot recommend this film.<br/><br/>I've seen poorly made films I would recommend, because despite their inadequacies I enjoyed them. I didn't enjoy this. I didn't hate it either. I didn't really feel anything at all. I couldn't even engage with it. The landscape, the people involved, everything told me this should work and I wanted to get stuck in. But trying to engage with this was like trying to get a grip on a smooth surface. I just kept sliding right back out.<br/><br/>The story was thin, though that in itself is not unusual for this kind of film. District 9, which this will inevitably be compared with, was a simple story. However there was in that a compelling human element, brought to life by the central character of Wikus, a bureaucratic little man, who should have lived a little life, thrust into being more than he wanted to be, fighting against everyone and everything, society, law, even his own body, unable to accept that the lines were being increasingly blurred and he could not re draw them.<br/><br/>Here we have Matt Damon doing Jason Bourne once again. He does it exceptionally well, a quiet unstated yet deeply felt angst, but it gives us our first sense of something being missing. This emptiness pervades the entire film. The scene is set, beautifully, but by the end we are still waiting for the play to begin.<br/><br/>The story sets up twists, subtle, believable ones, and never fully explained, because bad guys don't stop to explain their evil plans in real life, yet none come off as such, failing to break the linear, plodding feel of the narrative. And while I am not left with any questions or confusion, there is no depth or texture to what transpired.<br/><br/>This is a film by numbers. It ticked all the boxes, it delivered every expected feature, followed the rules, shot straight to the top of the class. But class isn't real life. And it certainly isn't the commercial world. Everything given I could have predicted within the first few minutes. The art-house childhood memories set up the relationship which materialises later, but sadly we are never invested in them as a couple. The same could be said for every character and relationship, emphasis on the latter. The human element has been removed, ironically in an attempt to be as cool and as realistic as possible. But in trying to avoid those established tropes, now derided as cheesy, Blomkamp has ended up avoiding everything. If you take something out, you have to put something back in.<br/><br/>You can't make a movie with only your brain. I know how that sounds. But this is not a intellectual pursuit. It is an emotional one. I'd rather cheesy special effects with heart and humour than this dry serious posturing, I'd rather rules were torn up and boundaries were pushed, I'd rather you risked being a laughing stock, the next Ed Wood rather than settle for being the next Ed Who? To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the only thing worse than being laughed at, is being forgotten. This is one I will forget."
"robearbarrett","7","0","0","8 September 2013"," Great Visually With Little to Inspire
","Elysium always promised to be a 'popcorn' movie and with the direction from Neill Blomkamp it would be expected to deliver a similar punch to previous efforts like District 9. Naturally it's easy to see the similarities and the inclusion of Sharlto Copley is a treat as his character Kruger provides a large part of the entertainment.<br/><br/>Like other reviews I also agree that the visual effects are crucial to the entertainment of the film particularly in the slow motion dismemberment shots which are thoroughly enjoyable in a macabre way. The gritty atmosphere is created by Blomkamp by use of the locations a futuristic vision of Los Angeles riddled with disease and poverty on one end of the spectrum and the plush, luxury of the idealistic Elysium on the other.<br/><br/>Yes the storyline is predictable and to be fair it has been attempted on multiple occasions before so the task was always going to be a tough one, but the difference is that this film is truly entertaining, it's got all the elements of action you need, a great attention to detail visually and a motive. In no way will this be a classic and will be forgotten a lot sooner than District 9 but it's a solid effort.<br/><br/>To conclude Elysium is an entertaining 'popcorn' movie using the limited resources of a tired modern sci-fi idea."
"frizzlemonkeys","5","0","0","6 September 2013"," Ronseal the film
","The only way i can sum up this film is that it is in fact a film, it seems obvious enough but films like these all tend to follow the same format with the same structure which pans out exactly the same.<br/><br/>the film does exactly what it says a film does, hence the reason i called it ronseal. the film has a beginning, then there's a bit of character development, then there's the action packed middle, a hardship which the main actor must overcome then the obligatory fight scene then it has a nice rounded off ending. i know the format has worked for as long as performance has begun but with this film there is nothing special it's just kind of there being a film that exists. i mean it wasn't the worst thing i ever watched but i knew exactly what was going to happen about 5 minutes into the film. It feels like the director had a checklist of all the things a generic movie should have and just ticked them off one by one.<br/><br/>some people may say ""Oh it speaks about dominance within society or something along those lines but i don't think so this is one of those films that's on TV after you finish work and think i haven't seen it i guess il give it a watch.<br/><br/>so yea it's a film that does exactly what it says on the tin"
"chole1952","6","0","0","3 September 2013"," A pleasant surprise
","I chose to watch this film after not really knowing what it was about. I had a glance at the trailer and thought it looked slightly similar to After Earth so i wasn't expecting much more than a typical sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by how much i actually enjoyed this film. The beginning was a little generic with emphasis on poverty which i can only assume had taken over all earth. In my opinion the film really begins about 20 minutes in with some of the scenes before being near enough pointless.<br/><br/>After this however the film comes to life with the introduction of Kruger played by Sharlto Copley. Matt Damon makes a brilliant hero but Sharlto Copley makes an even better villain - stealing the attention from every scene hes in. Even if you don't find the film memorable, you will certainly remember Kruger! The action/fight scenes weren't anything too special but they were good for a Sci-fi.<br/><br/>I was happy that there wasn't any crammed in romances and i think the friendship between Max and Frey was lovely as well as the friendship between Max and Julio.<br/><br/>Unlike many other films the ending wasn't at all rushed and it rounded up all loose ends and left me feeling glad that i had watched it.<br/><br/>I guess if you really wanted to you could pick faults with the science of Elysium like how it was built so quickly or how residents there could even breathe. But in all honesty i think you could pick minor faults in any sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>For a film that i new barely anything about i was pleasantly surprised by how good it was and i would definitely recommend it to others!"

I liked it.<br/><br/>The only negative thing to be said is that being a South African myself, and Neil Blomkamp being a South African... why would he get South Africans to fake a South African accent? That was the worse and at times so funny (when it wasn't supposed to be) that the whole South African audience would end up giggling at the stupidity of it.<br/><br/>Overall, I still liked the movie though.

"sunshinebeachcinema","6","0","0","31 August 2013"," The answer to the question ""What if yuppies colonised Halo?"" Elysium exists as a slightly superior summer blockbuster.
","Elysium answers the question ""What if yuppies colonised Halo?"" The residents of the eponymous space station are portrayed as a caricature of the American elite, swanning about their marble mansions and swimming pools in polo shirts and sports coats like they've gone for a weekend on Long Island. They are juxtaposed with citizens of Earth who live in overpopulated, arid slums, working and dying in their droves with no access to the health care and lifestyle enjoyed by the wealthy.<br/><br/>Elysium seems the latest in a string of post-apocalyptic/science-fiction blockbusters starring A- list actors. Tom Cruise had Oblivion, Will Smith had After Earth, Brad Pitt had World War Z. This time, Matt Damon is the hero. Elysium comes at a difficult time to stand out from the crowd, but this is the sophomore feature of director Neill Blomkamp, who wowed audiences four years ago with District 9.<br/><br/>The film is arguably derivative of District 9. Both are consistent in design; Blomkamp worked with many of the same production team, including editor, cinematographer, and production designer. The spaceships are aesthetically similar, Matt Damon's exoskeleton recalls Wikus van de Merwe's mech suit, and the design of various robots is strangely reminiscent of the alien ""prawns"".<br/><br/>The theme again is apartheid like social divide, extrapolated to a scale to reflect the same occurrences in the present day. On one level, this is how citizens of wealthy countries go about their daily lives, often with utter indifference to the suffering of those in poorer parts of the world. This is dystopian fiction in its purest and earliest form. But then perhaps Elysium is not saying anything new.<br/><br/>More intimately, this is the relationship between classes within less economically developed cities, where the wealthy live in gated communities, guarded by private security firms against the poverty and volatility of the city slums. This is the case in Mexico City, where the LA scenes were filmed, and in Blomkamp's native Johannesburg. Even the wealthy citizens of present day LA are to be found in the gated communities of Beverly Hills, far from the low income urban sprawl.<br/><br/>Though the divide is of wealth, the classes are represented racially and culturally. Elysium residents are mostly, but not exclusively Caucasian. Their president, Patel, is played by the Pakistani-American Faran Tahir. Yet when they are not speaking English, their language is French, characterising the Elysium citizens by drawing on the perceived high culture of France, which once influenced the elite of the antebellum South.<br/><br/>On Earth, the dominant cultural identity is Hispanic, a future imagined as a result of unrestricted immigration from Latin America. Society has failed Max Da Costa, played by the capable Matt Damon. He has grown up an orphan, and spent time in prison, and now works in a factory building the police robots that abuse him in the streets.<br/><br/>The crux of the matter as far as the plot is concerned seems to revolve around access to the nigh on magical properties of the Elysium medical bays, which appear to be located in the homes of every citizen. Whilst this clearly represents an uneven spread of medical resources, it seems that living and working in the slums of Earth would become infinitely more tolerable if the most extreme of ailments, from Leukaemia to radiation sickness, and presumably, the health problems associated with a lifetime of breathing Earth's polluted air, could be cured immediately, and automatically, at the drop of a hat. The device even offers total, instantaneous facial reconstruction, yet these features are largely wasted on the already healthy Elysium population, who treat these resources as glorified tanning beds. <br/><br/>Elysium takes its name from the ancient Greek afterlife, or at least the part of it traditionally reserved for the righteous and heroic. The citizens of Elysium are anything but. Most of the residents are happy to live their lives without sparing a thought for the Earth-bound masses, but some take it a step further. With no borders on Earth, illegal immigration becomes the desperate struggle for access to Elysium. Secretary of Defence Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is cold and calculated, and doesn't bat an eyelid when she orders the destruction of two illegal refugee ships, and immediate deportation of the occupants of a third. Whilst she acts outside of protocol, this goes to show what lengths some citizens are capable of going to in the defence of their borders. Soon, she plans to stage a coup against the more moderate President Patel.<br/><br/>For all Delacourt's coldness, she pales in comparison to the true antagonist; the vicious, psychotic mercenary Kruger, who starts out working as an agent for Elysium. Kruger is played by Blomkamp's collaborator, South African Sharlto Copley, who played the leading man in District 9. Kruger is the polar opposite of bumbling bureaucrat Wikus van der Merwe. Due to his extremity, Kruger is dismissed from employment at the start of the film, but is quickly tasked with hunting Da Costa down on Delacourt's behalf.<br/><br/>The film does not shy away from the graphic depiction of violence and brutality. The futuristic weapons are more likely to explode their victims than anything else, and this happens more than once. Along with the dirty, dusty streets of LA, this gritty realism contrasts with the futuristic veneer of Elysium, and sets the film apart from other sleek, sci-fi thrillers. Both Blomkamp and Damon have urged film-goers to take the entertainment value of the film above the deeper message. As such, Elysium exists as a slightly superior summer blockbuster."

","The film was well put together, and yes, I enjoyed it... But if you are going to rip off Battle Angel Alita then why not just make a Battle Angel Alita movie (or Gunnm for the purists). Change Elysium to Tiphares, Mat Damon to a female android (Gally) and lack of medical care to illegal organ harvesting, and... oh look!!! its the Battle Angel Alita story..... As I said earlier, I did enjoy it and the film was well put together, Mr Damon was well suited to this role, the bad guys were suitably twisted and power hungry, the damsel in distress was, well, insipid and boring as hell actually! But there was plenty of flying body parts, explosions and all round action to make up for that. Not a film I would go out and buy on DVD but worth a look see at least once."
"reigntall","6","0","0","18 August 2013"," More action than sci-fi
","Neill Blomkamp's previous film, District 9, is one of the best sci-fi movies of the past decade. Unfortunately, his second effort, Elysium, is a sci-fi movie not suited for hardcore sci-fi fans, rather it is targeted more at the typical summer action movie fan.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is promising. The wealthy have left the diseased Earth to a space station utopia called Elysium. Max (Matt Damon) is a man with nothing to lose whose goal is to get there by any means necessary. However, the world that is created is filled with unanswered questions. What sort of government is left on Earth, as it seems that the same robots of Elysium keep order on Earth? How does the air stay on Elysium, since there is no sort of solid roof? Even Max's robot suit thing that is heavily featured in the trailers doesn't make much sense. He has the metal parts screwed into is flesh and bones. Any sort of serious blow on the metal parts should make the screws move and break his bones. There are several more questions that can be raised (which I won't at risk of spoilers), and they may seem nitpick-y, however the sci-fi genre is all about creating a believable futuristic world that follows the rules of science.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciate about the plot is that it isn't preachy. After seeing the trailer I worried it might talk waaaaaaaay too much about the whole 1% thing. Instead it seems to be more about race. It doesn't talk about it. It's just that most people shown on Earth are Hispanic while essentially everyone on Elysium is white, well except for president Patel. I thought Elysium was for the rich people of Earth. What, Oprah isn't rich enough? OK, so the plot is kind of shaky, but one part of District 9 which isn't lost is the interesting characters. Max is not quite the typical action star. He isn't out to save the world or restore order and justice. He is just out to save himself; he just doesn't want to die. The villains of the film, Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and Kruger (Sharlto Copley, the lead of District 9) are great. Jodie Foster may be a bit more of a cliché super power hungry evil person, but Kruger is fascinating. Unfortunately, I can't get into too much detail at risk of spoilers, but that man is crazy. And Spider (Wagner Moura) should also be mentioned. Blomkamp knows how to make interesting characters.<br/><br/>Another reason this feels like a generic action film just in a sci-fi setting, is the emphasis put on Max's love interest Frey (Alice Braga). She seems like an unnecessary character. She is there to provide him with more motivation and a character arc, but that role could've been filled by his friend Julio (Diego Luna) just as easily, without some necessary romance.<br/><br/>Looking at the film as an action film it works: great action sequences, cool futuristic weapons and plenty of explosions. Just don't look for a classic sci-fi film like District 9.<br/><br/>tl;dr more action than sci-fi, interesting characters, plot notsomuch"

The acting is solid on all fronts and especially well done on Sharlto's part, i would say that he stole the show as performances go as the menacing sociopath Kruger.

There isn't much to it beyond the ""get to the Elysium"" and that's about it.<br/><br/>I also felt like this movie was made to target Australian audience - and I was expecting people shouting ""TURN BACK THE BOAT!!"" When the refugee ships start getting blowing out of the sky during the early sequence. The whole issue of refugee boats / illegal immigrant that Australia now face is far more complex than what the movie is trying to infer - the message from the movie seems to be a simplistic one dimensional thinking like the popular political slogan some politicians were saying several years ago.<br/><br/>Acting is pretty bad all around too, none of the character had enough on screen presence strong enough to make any sort of impression for me. I couldn't care less if they die or not.<br/><br/>I also felt this movie is what director Neill Blomkamp was trying to do to repeat his success with District 9, there are a lot of similarity - the pacing and the plot point seems to be lift off directly from District 9, but due to bad direction - this definitely isn't as flesh out as District 9 - where District 9 had strong characterization - someone on screen that you can feel strongly for, Elysium simply lacks that connection with the viewer.<br/><br/>There is also some plagiarisation going on with this movie with a lot of plot line and ideas that seem to be copied straight from the Japanese manga ""Battle Angle Alita"", but in a much simplistic and dumb down tone.<br/><br/>Overall, A huge disappointment. 2/10."

Besides having holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck through, it's extremely predictable. You know within the first twenty minutes exactly what's going to happen.

When the lower half of a head is blown off, it's likely that the brain will be hurt too, and, again, that is some FANCY medical machinery.

Given how much it is bragged about the fact that the director have also been behind ""District 9″, which I did not like at all, on the poster I really did not have my hopes up very high though and I was not surprised.<br/><br/>The entire plot is rather ludicrous from the start and it is filled with social messages about wicked industrialists, oppressed poor, wasting of limited resources etc. etc. bla. bla. Add in the usual working class hero stuff, a heroin to care about and a sick kid for some additional ""compassion effects"" and that is it. These social ""them and us"", ""the elite and the rest"", type of movies have been done so many times and they are equally boring every time. I just do not like movies that try to force some message down the viewer's throat. I watch movies to be entertained.<br/><br/>Even if you try and ignore the social messages that you are force feed the rest of the movie is also just not very good. For example they have this big space station where the majority of the population is not allowed and still they seem to not have thought about any defences whatsoever. They have to shoot down advancing shuttles by hand-held rockets using ""sleeper agents"" on Earth. That is just nonsense. The entire concept that you can ""reboot"" the main computer system to take control and turn everyone into citizens of Elysium is also fairly ludicrous.<br/><br/>The ending where everyone indeed suddenly becomes citizens of Elysium is just plain dumb. They send down a couple of automated shuttles and they are supposed to heal and fix everyone? And what about the fact that Earth was supposed to be ruined in the first place? As I write, just dumb.<br/><br/>This is just another nonsense movie with a ""social message"" that got way too much money from Hollywood.

","So if you are a fan of District 9 and wonder ""Was Neill Blomkamp a fluke"" well here is your answer and it is a hell no thrown down with authority.<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning and like District 9 a less than subtle view on the world today. The wealth disparity has become so massive that the wealthy have moved to a massive space station called Elysium while the pour are on a broken earth building the massive cybernetic army that keeps them out when out hero is struck with a massive dose of radiation due to working at one of the factories that make them so he is off to Elysium.<br/><br/>This this a good reason the movie stay interesting and keep you engaged Blomcamp could have just said ""Yeah you know the guys on Earth are sick of being repressed so they rebel"" but no our hero is out to cure himself due to a sickness that is directly caused by the denizens of Elysium who make every effort to keep him out and so the is real tension and many of the tired tropes do not come of as boring. So yeah welcome a new Sci-if up and comer."
"tinovalkki","9","4","13","10 August 2013"," Best sci-fi movie this summer
","Without a doubt Elysium is the best sci-fi movie this summer (yet). It also works well as an action movie. Imaginative action scenes are partly quite brutal but it just emphasizes movies dystopia. Beautiful Elysium is pleasant to watch and it highlights it's difference to slummy Los Angeles. Gap between privileged citizens of Elysium and poor people of earth is breathtaking to watch. Clever social criticism is narrated very strongly and evocative story works beautifully together. With it length of less than two hours the story works great. Movie doesn't stop until the story is told. It would be perfect movie if action scenes were filmed with still cameras. Manual shooting is partly quite hard to follow. Matt Damon is great at Max but Jodie Fosters Delacourt stays little lame. Elysium is imperative to see for everyone who loves clever sci-fi movie. I will wait with great interest Neil Blomkamps next movie. Great summer entertainment."
"Dory_Darko","10","3","9","17 August 2013"," This is what the future might just look like...
","Wow... Where do I begin? I just got back from the cinema and I can still feel the adrenaline rushing through me. I was already a huge fan of director Neill Blomkamp's previous effort, District 9, so my expectations were running pretty high. And for once, I was not disappointed. No, I got even more than I could have hoped for.<br/><br/>Elysium is a terrific film. Plain and simple. The story is fairly simple, which I consider a good thing because the plot was easy to follow and so it wasn't overly complex and trying to be too intelligent and contrived. It is the year 2154, and planet Earth is one hot mess. The rich reside on a space station called Elysium while the poor remain on Earth, basically grabbing at every straw just to get by. The story we follow is that of Max, who, after a terrible accident at work, is in dire need of medical help, which is only available at Elysium. In order to get there, he must go to extreme measures. I won't tell you anything else, because that would just spoil the fun.<br/><br/>Max is played by Matt Damon, and he is very good in this role. He truly carries the film, start to finish. It always pleases me to see an actor who is just as good at tackling the character elements as well as the action parts of his role. When you think about it, that doesn't actually happen that often. Matt Damon can do both perfectly, and he is convincing in every aspect. Jodie Foster plays the role of senator Delacourt, a rich bitch who thinks she can get away with anything just because she calls the shots on Elysium. Well, somebody's about to prove her wrong... I absolutely love Jodie Foster, so it's hard not to gush, but she is a delight to watch. Her character is cold, calculating and without a sliver of conscience. And Jodie is so convincing you just want to slap her. It was great, and the fact that her accent is a little weird and distracting at times, is easily forgiven. William Fichtner also appears in a relatively small, but crucial role.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise for me, however, was Sharlto Copley. Remember him from District 9? He played Wikus, a dorky and kind of sissy character... Well, not in this one. His character Kruger, is the meanest, most vile bastard you can imagine. A card-carrying sadistic psycho. It really was a great opportunity for Copley to prove his versatility as an actor, and he used it to the fullest. Also, somehow his South-African twang made his character even more menacing, so I'm really glad he didn't drop it in favour of a – perhaps more crowd-pleasing – American accent.<br/><br/>My biggest compliment goes to the special effects department. As was the case with District 9, the SFX are so convincing, it's actually hard to realise that you're watching something that was probably 96% computer animated. Unlike D9, the visuals were even better here, if you can believe that. Usually, when a director's first film is a success and they up his budget for the next one, they go completely overboard and essentially ruin the aesthetics that made the first film so successful *cough*Matrix*cough*. In this case, all and everything was a major improvement. The action scenes are incredibly solid, the spacecrafts were eye-poppingly gorgeous (without being all flashy and futuristic – adding to the reality factor) and Elysium was a true sight to behold. 109 minutes of pure eye candy.<br/><br/>There were only two things that slightly bothered me. One, the somewhat stereotypical characterization of the Rich vs. The Poor. Simply put, rich = evil and poor = good, no exceptions. Especially with the rich Elysium folk I found it a little bothersome that there wasn't a single person who seemed to have a heart, they were almost mechanical and so the polarisation was pretty black-and-white. Two, the lack of emotional involvement. I didn't really feel much for any of the characters, except Max. There is a plot line with a woman he has feelings for, whose daughter is very ill, and that's a sad thing but the film failed at really convincing me why I'm supposed to care. Could be personal, but that's the way I experienced it. <br/><br/>However, these two minor plot points are not sufficient enough to deter me from giving this film any less than 10 stars. What I think is most thrilling about Elysium is the fact that it actually paints a frighteningly plausible picture of what our future might just look like. It is, in any case, much more realistic than pretty much every other post-apocalyptic film I've ever seen. Don't write this concept off too easily, this might very well be the world we live in one day.<br/><br/>In the end, Elysium is a terrifically made film. It's gritty, it's gnarly and highly realistic. And, to the zero-attention-span MTV kids out there, it's also an incredibly entertaining, action-packed thrill ride. Tiny side note: the violence is quite graphic at times, so some amount of parental guidance is definitely advised. <br/><br/>That leaves me with nothing else to say but: go watch this film. You won't regret it."
"davidwcash","7","3","9","14 August 2013"," Elysium, surprised me, glad I watched it.
","Honestly, this wasn't a movie I was planning on watching this summer, and maybe not even on DVD or BLU-Ray. Going in to the movie with my semi-negative feeling about it, I was glad I watch it. If you do go and watch this movie, two things you should at least appreciate, Matt Damon's acting and the visual effects. Without Matt Damon, this movie might have been stuck in the mud, and 15 minutes in, you might lose interest. But, with what he delivers in the movie with his talent and passion, his character Max truly comes to life and you're drawn in to follow his story. Also, the visual graphics in this movie are seamless. Many parts of the movie where you know there are visual effects, you barely notice that there are any. That's when you know they have done a good job in the visual effects department.<br/><br/>Overall, the story of Elysium does a great job illustrating a futurist story and molding it to relevant story impacting people today. It should be a story many can relate to an enjoy watching.<br/><br/>I'd recommend, if you haven't seen it, and you don't think you'll like, at least go in with an open mind, and watch it. You may be surprised."

It takes place in the year 2154, where Earth is over populated and diseased, at least 99% of the population, anyway. The 1%, who just happen to be rich, live on an orbiting space station called Elysium, where diseases can be cured instantly and they live in mansions. Jodie is the Defense Secretary of Elysium, second in control after the President. Matt, who lives on Earth with all the other poor people who can't afford good health insurance-Hey, that sounds like it could be straight out of the headlines of what is going on right now-gets hurt on his job and only has five days to live. His only chance is to get up to Elysium and get a cure but Jodie has a habit of shooting down any unauthorized ships-she doesn't seem to like the poor illegals that are only trying to get their share of the pie. Alice is a childhood girlfriend of Matt's that also has a reason to get to Elysium and Sharlto plays an off the books enforcer for Jodie; you know, doing all the dirty clean up jobs that Jodie doesn't want the President to find out about. It's rated ""R"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. I did not like the ending, but I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD."

","Matt Damon and Jodie Foster are tremendously talented. Neill Blomkamp matches their talent from the director's chair, and the special effects and action scenes are on par with any good sci-fi action thriller.<br/><br/>What makes this film stink to the high heavens is the obvious political and social messages being sent. At least Star Trek was subtle about the political and social agendas being promoted. This film throws off the subtlety gloves and goes bare-knuckled to embrace the entire Occupy movement during which the film was produced.<br/><br/>You have the one-percenters living in a dream world of comfort and luxury, with the rest of the louts living in crime, disease and poverty. Up comes an aggrieved protagonist and baby, it's ON!<br/><br/>Oh, please.<br/><br/>Now, if those were aliens up there on Elysium, enslaving the human race and exploiting them so ruthlessly, you have an interesting storyline for this film.<br/><br/>Both Damon and Blomkamp deny that there is a political message in this story. I'm not buying their denials. It's too obvious and too plain for any but the most naive. Hollywood, except on the rarest of occasions, needs to keep its nose out of the political tent. Entertain me. Don't try to educate or indoctrinate me.<br/><br/>I didn't click the ""spoiler"" button because honestly, I don't know how this ends. I didn't finish it and ejected the disc in utter disgust."

","Although Jodie Foster and Matt Damon and the rest of the cast give it their all, the story is absurd, bordering on comical.

One wonders if Damon and Foster read the script before signing on--or if they just assumed it would make millions and, hey, who can't use more money. Just like the people on Elysium. As a metaphor against poverty and classism, the script is so tendentious it cannot be taken seriously. Too bad; this could have been a good movie. Instead, it serves as a fine example of what happens when you throw money and more money into film but lack a well written story."

","Being a die hard sci-fi fan and having read very positive reviews of this title I was very optimistic about the movie. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed to the extent that I was actually waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>There are several flaws with the movie. First of all, there is no plot or whatsoever. Yes, there is a series of events that create a story, but by no means can this be treated as a plot. Scene to scene, event to event there is no coherence nor suspense. The movie fails dramatically at making you care about the story. Also, there are terrible plot holes - most of most important events in the movie don't make sense at all or are totally implausible.<br/><br/>There are also things in the movie which are simply really stupid. don't get me wrong - I love sci-fi and I'm perfectly fine with lasers, teleportation and/or time travel. However seeing an orbital station with no roof and ""atmosphere"" which is, say, 50m thick, with no shield or so I just get annoyed for being treated like an idiot by director.<br/><br/>Secondly there are terrible ""romantic"" and ""emotional"" scenes which, honestly, were so bad and pretentious that it hurt. Bad acting, shallow and stiff dialogs made every attempt of director to make you emotional unsuccessful if not annoying.<br/><br/>Thirdly the acting is poor. Matt Damon is emotionless and resembles one of the droids he's fighting, Jodie Foster's character is extremely campy (so is Krueger) and cliché. What's more - the characters are not well constructed, remaining one dimensional and shallow making it virtually impossible to care for what's happening with them.<br/><br/>This altogether makes the movie really boring. I was impatiently waiting for the plot to finally become complicated and the master plan revealed. When I realised that this is not going to happen I should have left the cinema.<br/><br/>There is one good side of the movie - the visual effects. Unfortunately it's not enough to save that movie.<br/><br/>This was one of the biggest time wasters I've lately watched - definitely the movie is hugely overrated summer blockbuster.Don't watch, unless You really, really have nothing better to do with your time."

Also, just to add to issues on Elysium, if they know that the unwashed on earth can launch spaceships that can reach them, are you seriously telling me they would have no way of shooting them down or repelling them apart from by firing missiles from Earth that miss the odd one now and again. <br/><br/>In retrospect, it is not short of ideas but they either ran out of budget (unlikely), or ran out of motivation (more likely) to put it together into something thought provoking and watchable.<br/><br/>Consequently this is the worst film I have seen for a long while, I honestly would not bother to watch it again if it popped up on TV on a slow Sunday night !"

","Neil Blomkamp's tremendous success with District 9 made him one of the most exciting prospects to emerge from the science-fiction genre in recent years. His original approach to the genre was both refreshing and ingenious, earning the film four nominations from the Academy, including Best Picture and Best Adopted Screenplay. Naturally enough, this sort of success created much anticipation for Elysium, his second feature, which would star both Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Sadly Elysium produced one of the greatest disappointments of the year so far.<br/><br/>The premise of Elysium is actually quite good. Set at the end of the twenty-first century, the world has become overpopulated, infected with disease and reduced to a global slum. Therefore another world was created, Elysium, to treat the over-populated earth. This creates an obvious class system, literally worlds apart, where the wealthy reside on Elysium and the working class roam the dilapidated earth. In this two-tier universe the wealthy, who reside on Elysium, are portrayed as heartless snobs who have no regard for those left behind, making them immediately dislikeable. However the working-class residents of earth aren't exactly endearing either. Of course they garner some sympathy for their neglect from Elysium, but other than that there's little reason to be rooting for them.<br/><br/>The story moves at a frantically rapid pace. As a result the characters are underdeveloped and disinteresting whilst the plot is rushed. Matt Damon who usually embodies such affable, intriguing characters, is given a lead character so empty and underdeveloped that most will do well to remember his name along the ride. Only his fatal circumstances earn him some sympathy, but this is soon flattened by the rushed, action-packed second half of the film.<br/><br/>The plot advances in a truly illogical and convenient fashion. Little detail is given on how Max (Matt Damon) and his gang will go about their mission, they simply just go and do it. Any obstacles or faults in the script are dressed up in action sequences or desperate cut-a-ways to the endangered love interest. Also Elysium delivers the a ridiculous metaphor, spoken by the young daughter of Max's ex-lover. <br/><br/>Not only are the characters hollow but some of the acting performances are particularly poor also. Sharlto Copley's portrayal of the villainous Kruger is laughable at best. Between taunting Max and teasing Frey (A.K.A generic love interest) he allows a lot of unintentional comedy to surface. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster also gives an unnecessarily over-acted performance as Delacourt. In case some people were unsure that her character was a wealthy, ruthless elitist her overtly pompous display will certainly confirm it. <br/><br/>Elysium lost almost everything that was so great about District 9, even its brilliant performance from Sharlto Copley. Blomkamp has certainly proved that he's a talented and capable writer/director, yet so did M. Night Shyamalan. Let's hope that Blomkamp doesn't follow a similar path."
"farrukh_sharon_bhatti","5","2","5","14 August 2013"," Living Out One's Call
","Elysium is a true depiction regarding people living in the third world and the Western world. The movie characterizes two types of people. First those who are on Earth, poor and helpless. The second are those who are residing outside of the planet Earth in a self-made paradise, called Elysium. A Roman Catholic nun appears raising up young Max who is orphan and poor. He had a dream to go to Elysium. The role of the nun seems to be similar to the Christian churches throughout the word, which through their ministries in the developing world are engaged in ministering to people like Max. Furthermore, like the sister, these churches are also channels of hope to the hopeless. They are means of grace to the oppressed and suffering humans in making them realize that they are loved and a day will come when justice, peace and stability will rule the creation. The movie reveals the privileges of the people of Elysium who have gained prestige by the sheer hard work of people like Max. Many sociological and economical analysts argue that numerous wealthy countries enjoy exuberant luxuries at the expense of human capital of progressing world. Several Western businesses have their production projects in the developing countries. People of poor countries prepare products for the appetite and luxury of the consumers living in the wealthy countries at very low cost. These corporations, they work for, do not care for their employees as they would have cared for them in their own countries. Most of the times these laborers reflect Max who got affected by being exposed to a lethal level of radiation at his job that led him to die in five days. Although Max had limited time, he with the help of the computer genius, Spider, showed up as a messiah for the people of Earth. He liberated them from the bondage of oppressions and sufferings and made them equal citizens of Elysium. In order to save the people, Max had to fight against the systematic evil of Jessica Delacourt, a high ranking official and a member of the governmental council. She had her undercover agents in the field, whose job was to keep an eye on the uprising movements of people of Earth and if required, subdue and confront them at any cost. Kruger was the nemesis among her evil force. In my opinion, the role of Kruger and his force is pretty similar to the function of intelligence agencies and their agents in the world especially in the developing countries who work for the dominance of their countries by keeping people of the progressing world suppressed. The plot discloses Frey, who by profession is a medical nurse and a childhood friend of Max. Frey has a little daughter Matilda, who is dying of leukemia. She needs a medical treatment that is not available on Earth. As a child, the nun discerned Max's call and told him that one day he will do something great. When Max's time came, Matilda became a reason for him to live out his call, encouraging him to go to Elysium to fight against imperialism. On the other hand, Kruger kills his boss Jessica and takes over the charge of Elysium. Max fights Kruger and overcomes all his power by providing freedom and equal privileges to all people of Earth. Although Max dies while redeeming poor and underprivileged people, it provided them with salvation from their oppression, struggles and sufferings of various kinds. The movie is a reminder about such people who are suffering and are in need of a Max, who had a heart for justice and equal privileges for all humankind. The nun who raised Max taught him that he had a special call on his life that will one day influence and save many. Furthermore, he must not become weary in answering his call and carrying out his vocation, because the view to Elysium looks good from Earth, but the view from Elysium to Earth looks even better. In my view, she wanted Max to have faith in himself so being a resident of Earth he must not have an inferiority complex. The movie is a good reminder about one's call and vocation. Today, the question is how many of us answer our call and live it out. How many care for the equal rights and privileges of the humankind? How many oppose the wrong distribution of power, wealth and opportunities? How many are like Max and Spider and not like Jessica and Kruger!"

"tomassparups","7","2","5","10 August 2013"," It's no ""District 9"", but...
","""District 9″ was one of the most ambitious and dare I say most creative films in recent memory. The film's director, Neil Blomkamp showcased his directorial talent not only with the stylistic aspects of the film, but with the overall pacing and story. With that in mind, I would be lying if I were to say that the film did not have it's fair share of problems. ""District 9″ was laced with inconsistencies and plot holes, but it's gripping story and meticulous attention to the production design forced me to ignore these nitpicks. Blomkamp's newest film ""Elysium"" is yet another sci-fi thriller. It stars Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley and is set in the distant-ish future. Basically, earth has become a poverty stricken, overpopulated wasteland due to mass amounts of pollution. The upper echelon of society has built a large space station in which the wealthy population can live. The space station is known as ""Elysium"", any virus disease or injury can be cured there with the help of the station's state of the art medical technology. Elysium's tight security is helmed by Secretary Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster who has a crazed thirst for power. The story mainly revolves around the character of Max, played by Matt Damon. Max is an engineer working at a large factory, building droids. After serving his time in prison for various crimes, Max has decided to turn his life around. Unfortunately, after a fatal accident at the factory, Max is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation and has only got five days left to live. His only hope is to get to Elysium and cure his disease. To infiltrate the stations wide array of security, Max is forced to risk his own life.<br/><br/>This is a pretty over the top film, especially Jodie Foster's performance. Foster plays the cliché sophisticated villain that is always bearing a snobbish grin. She speaks in a very strange accent that is sort of a mix between British and..middle eastern or south African and to top it off, she exaggerates all of her lines to the point of laughter. Not a good performance on the part of Foster. Matt Damon gives an alright performance, I would have liked for his character to have more depth and development. Otherwise, he was alright. On an entertainment level, Sharlto Copley shines bright, his character, although over the top provides for some great entertainment. He is both psychotic and likable. The production design is just wow, it is beautiful. Neil Blomkamp seems to love to indulge in the look of his films. In the case of ""Elysium"" we see two different worlds, both equally impressive. We see the sleek and sterile Elysium and the ruined, dingy Earth. It is fair to say that the stylistic aspects of the film are a win on behalf of Neil Blomkamp. Like ""District 9″, ""Elysium"" has a fair amount of political and social commentaries. This time regarding healthcare and immigration. I'm not going to go into great depths in regard to the film's underlying themes, because i'm just not up for it.<br/><br/>Here is a film that is incredibly over the top and at times ludicrous, even for a science fiction film, but it still holds up as an entertaining watch. It relies on it's stunning production design and overall style as well as the well played out action sequences. Jodie Foster did not live up to the expectations set by her previous films and at times was even laughable. Matt Damon delivered an alright performance and Sharlto Copley was as entertaining as ever. ""Elysium"" is no ""District 9″, but it still holds it's own in the large spectrum of science fiction cinema."

There is nothing redeeming about this movie. Writing, direction, acting, even the graphics are lame. I was looking at my watch 30 minutes in. It felt like I was waiting for 2154 to arrive during the 109 minute run time. All I can in closing is that I have no idea who is financing this trash but they are going to take a bath.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","6","22 August 2013"," Entertaining Sci-Fi That's Certainly Underrated
","Elysium (2013)<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The setting is 2154 and Earth is pretty much a dumping ground for the sick and the poor while Elysium, a space station built by the rich, contains the perfect lifestyle. When he finds himself dying and needing to get to the planet, Max (Matt Damon) decides to take it on himself to try and combine the two worlds. I guess I'm going to be in the minority because I found director Neil Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 to be good but quite overrated whereas I found ELYSIUM to be incredibly entertaining, rather smart and full of terrific action so in many ways I think it's rather underrated by the majority of the people out there. Yes, I will admit that the story isn't the strongest in the world and yes I will admit that the ending doesn't quite pack the punch everyone was hoping for but there's still no question that this is a highly entertaining gem. I think the strongest thing is obviously the special effects, which are quite flawless for the majority of the film. I really thought the director did a brilliant job at building up this futuristic world by giving it a terrific look but he also made you believe the setting, the conditions of the people in it and he managed to do this on the rich space craft as well. Another major plus are the action scenes, which are beautifully filmed with the director putting the 2.35:1 cinematography to perfect use. Yet another strong point are the performances with Damon leading the way as the hero. I thought the actor was extremely believable in the part and while this role isn't going to land him an Oscar, seeing such a strong actor in the role does make it much better. Jodie Foster is good in the role of the villain but I will admit her accent was strange to say the least. Sharito Copley, Diego Luna, Wagner Moura and William Fichtner are all very good in their supporting roles. The film certainly contains some political elements, which are thankfully never too preachy but at the same time it leads up to an ending that really doesn't work. ELYSIUM seems to be getting attacked by some because ""it's not as good as DISTRICT 9"" but this here is somewhat unfair. When viewed on its own I think the film perfectly lives up to the director's strong vision making it a must see."
"Critomaton","5","2","6","11 August 2013"," ""Good Will Hunting"" meets ""Johnny Mnemonic"" meets ""Sicko""
","Alternate title... ""How I learned to Stop Worrying and Wait for Matt Damon to Send Down the Obamacare-Bots from Space"".<br/><br/>In ""Elysium"", Neill Blomkamp unleashes a bold, shocking vision of a world, 150 years in the future, where most of Los Angeles speaks Spanish, the world's snootiest people speak French, and alarm clocks jolt the working class awake with annoying, poorly synthesized voices...<br/><br/>Actually, the most shocking thing in this movie is that the future still contains GMC pickups (presumably after 14 more government bailouts). <br/><br/>OK, so M. Night Shyamalan's directorial gimmick was the surprise ending, featuring clues brought to you by the color red, in a movie where almost nothing else happens. Apparently Mr. Blomkamp's signature style consists of thinly veiled social commentary pummeled into your (sub)conscious mind by lots of really bad-ass explosions. But even M. Night didn't squander the goodwill generated by a strong feature film debut this quickly.<br/><br/>But since enough has already been written - or surely will be - about Elysium's not-so-hidden agenda, I'll just focus on what a truly derivative, grade-C science fiction movie it is.<br/><br/>But first a question. Why did the native South Africans in Johannesburg have subtitles for their English in ""District 9"" but Sharlto Copley didn't have subtitles for his English in ""Elysium""?!? The guy was totally indecipherable. Don't make me say the R-word! OK, I'll say it: Ripoff! Yeah, that's right, Bane was first to make it cool to be a mushmouthed uber-villain, and he did it better. At least I could tell that Bane had something interesting to say, even if I still don't know to this day what it was. <br/><br/>Here are some random musings about ""Elysium"": <br/><br/><ul><li>I enjoyed the melodramatic overacting by the hacker king, though he could have used subtitles also. It was fun to see him determine that Matt Damon's head contained the secrets to rigging the presidency, not to mention unleashing universal health care, just by looking at a hexadecimal code dump for all of 5 seconds. I totally didn't expect that. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I felt bad for Matt Damon's character (I forgot his name already, as I will the rest of the movie in a few more hours) when he got exposed to an accidental overdose of gamma radiation. But at least he didn't walk around pantsless the rest of the movie like Dr. Manhattan in ""Watchmen"" (just shirtless). </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Did they ever explain why the robots were exposed to lethal doses of radiation during manufacturing? It certainly didn't make them any better as marksmen. They couldn't even keep William Fichtner's sweet Bugatti from getting jacked.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I laughed at the scene where Matt got turned into a cyborg. It was straight out of MTV's new reality show, ""Pimp My Exoskeleton"". With street-smart docs like that, who needs the magic MRIs on Elysium? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Oh, I remember Matt's character's name now: it's Max. They only screamed it about two hundred times in one hour and forty minutes. Sorry, that's a gross exaggeration, just like everything else in this movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why would the ultra-elite of the future want to confine themselves to an orbiting space station that has less square footage than Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, Steve Jobs' iYacht, and Mitt Romney's car-rooftop dog carrier combined? Don't they know that one out of every three ""undocumented"" shuttles gets past Elysium's land-based defense grid, which consists primarily of a mentally unstable epic beard man with a van full of space-Stingers? Then again, that success rate does make Elysium more secure than the U.S. border. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Yes, the robot and rocket-ship effects look very realistic, but the flying vehicles are kind of boring to look at, like the shuttles in ""Star Trek"". If the director wanted to do futuristic military aircraft right, he should have gone back 27 years and looked at the drop ship in Jim Cameron's ""Aliens"". That thing really looked like a futuristic Apache/Harrier hybrid, not just some boxcar with thrusters bolted on the corners.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wait, so one minute you can have your head totally reconstructed, beard and all, after taking a grenade to the face, but the next minute you can't be cured from having your brainwaves downloaded to a USB thumb drive? I guess the data in Matt Damon's head was considered a pre-existing condition. </li></ul><br/><br/>In the end, I think Elysium fails just because it is so clichéd, unoriginal, and inconsistent with its own vision, not because of its blatant socio-political message. It's also a huge letdown after ""District 9"". <br/><br/>By the way, I have nothing against speaking Spanish - lots of my favorite people do it, and most of them speak my language better than I speak theirs (Shakira, por ejemplo). I wish I had more time to study Spanish but I'm too busy writing this review. In fact, the only level on which Elysium succeeds is as a nice introduction to the Spanish language, which is why I'm giving it two extra stars. At around $10 a ticket, it's a lot cheaper than Rosetta Stone."

","Due to the hype, I was put off seeing this movie as they seemed to intent on bombarding you with it that it seemed that they knew there was something wrong with it and were desperate to want people to see it. Well, I eventually went and saw it. First off it is a good movie and if you liked District 9 you'll like this. The political overtones are missing but if you were looking for a commentary on today's society you could well read into the movie shades of capitalism, class war, unfair and, even in the end, shades of Obama care. Then again a B feature like 2012 could boost the same except for the Obama health care plan. On the face of it, the movie is a good old-fashioned space yarn but with a dose of violence thrown in. What was really off-putting was the fight sequences which were rather hard to follow as the camera was all over the place.

","Best thing about this movie--Jodie Foster's calves.<br/><br/>No real explanation of how we humans messed up Earth so royally--guess we are just supposed to assume it's the result of our evil ways of life in 2013.<br/><br/>Whether it was me, or the sound system in the theater, or the movie itself--and I suspect the latter--I found much of the dialogue difficult to understand. There were subtitles for some non-English conversations, but others were just too muffled/mumbled/spoken to fast/too much background noise/whatever. It didn't really matter as the plot line was very predictable, but still suspenseful.<br/><br/>I had to come to this site to see who played ""Young Max""--was surprised to see he is NOT related to Matt Damon. Great physical match-up. That part of the story reminded me of ""Slum Dog Millionaire."" Special effects were good, shooting and fight scenes predictably unrealistic.

","This movie has delivered on many aspects, but also falls short on others. The CGI and other set pieces are absolutely amazing. The story is good, although not great. The action sequences are great, except for one (we'll get to that in a moment). One of the few problems that I had is that while the characters were good, non of them really grabbed my attention and made me care about them. There weren't any horrible plot holes. The one everyone throws out is that Matt Damon's character, Max, dies, and can't be brought back, but Sharlto's character, Kruger, gets to recover from a grenade to the face. It explains this kind of in the movie. As long as the brain is good, you're good. Max's brain was damaged, so he couldn't be brought back. Anyway, another problem that I saw was a particular fight scene that I couldn't even tell who was who because the shaky cam was going rampant. But despite a few negative aspects, the positive ones shine through, and make this movie worth a watch. Although, if you don't like gore, I would be wary of this film."

Blomkamp's technical abilities, stunning and seamless VFX and Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley's dedicated performances all serve to elevate what is essentially a eurotrashy scifi B-movie.

I think it was honest and true. That's what I witness in the Netherlands and everywhere else. But hey, why find a parallel? I mean, the US, right? They pay taxes, have to get healthcare insurance anyway, that they pay for, but as soon as they get sick insurance kicks them out. Insurance is only there for those that don't need it.

","This movie must have managed to annoy almost everyone. I'm surprised that it got any good reviews at all, because don't you all belong to at least one of the groups I'll try and describe in the following lines? First, the SF fans will be annoyed that the makers obviously don't take SF seriously. Whether you have a broken leg or suffer from leukemia - one touch with a ray of light and you're healed by the magical medical device on Elysium. There is not even a weak attempt to convince us a machine like that may exist. Even several centuries later on star ship Enterprise, a cure needed some time. Need more examples? How about the Exo-skeleton, some pieces of plastic glued on a guy's T shirt? This looked terribly cheap for a 100+ million dollar production. And it sometimes provides him with additional power, but sometimes not, depending on how long the fight scene should last. Or the ships that can fly to Elysium in a straight line with continuous speed, no matter whether they fly through the atmosphere at high gravity or empty space with no gravity. They have a year or two to prepare such a movie and don't research some basic physics? <br/><br/>Second, the right wing audience is obviously annoyed (see some other reviews below) that a social message is shoved down their throats. Evil rich Americans in space versus nice poor Mexicans on Earth - the social painting in black and white is such a shame that the makers tried to hush it up at least a bit, letting Jodie Foster speak French in one scene for no reason, a PC kind of apology meaning: we didn't say they are all Americans. Still the message is so clumsy and plain that no-one missed it.<br/><br/>Third, the left wing audience will be upset that the economic idea how everything will improve is ridiculous. Why should the supplies for a couple of thousand people on Elysium - every resource is hard to keep or produce in space - be sent to Earth for distribution among billions of people? That's one blade of grass for each person at best. And to heal every sickness with the magical device will take a million years, imagine the queue. Practically, you'd have to select again and pick some privileged people to get treatment and food... Back to start.<br/><br/>Fourth, movie fans will remember many better movies on similar subjects, from 'Terminator' to 'Silent Running', and dismiss 'Elysium' as a mediocre attempt. In Hollywood blockbuster style, action won over the contents. The leading mercenary wears a samurai sword on his back although he normally doesn't need it; he prefers to shoot with rockets from long distance. He must have thought a sword looks cool. And that's what the movie achieved, it certainly looks cool with that huge space station and the many fights with explosive ammunition. But if you look for intelligent SF with some food for thought, better look elsewhere."

There, Max must use his skills and experience to try and change the situation although he greatly suffers along the way. It looks well, it has a good baseline and some great actors. Unfortunately, due to his condition (in the movie), Matt Damon isn't able to make full use of his action acting, playing sick most of the time and therefore, reducing the awesomeness a bit. It is a bit tense, it creates a bit of suspense but nothing out of the ordinary being pretty linear and predictable. Although it could have had some change of events, it ultimately resorted to melee fighting, man to man which isn't bad, but not great either.

Also who in their right mind would automate their command/administrative control of their core system to such a degree that it overrides human administration...violently, not to mention what a catastrophic threat malicious software like viruses/RATs/worms would be to such a system.<br/><br/>I found the resolution most perplexing and infantile/naive of all: The premise told us that Earth was massively overpopulated -a major (arguably the primary) reason why things are so bad, yet the film's 'good' outcome has now resulted in immortality for all of Earth. If overpopulation was bad before -what is it going to be like when the sick, elderly and injured don't die. It defiantly lacks any nuanced or well throughout point -something that I prefer my sci-fi to have.<br/><br/>Anyways: the visuals and technology is cool, everything else is 'meh' at best. Decent soft-scifi B movie."
"callanvass","5","1","2","19 February 2015"," I thought it was depressing and boring!
","I was really indifferent towards this movie when I saw the trailers for it. I wasn't a big fan of District 9, and this movie didn't seem to be up my alley. I still held out hope that having Matt Damon and Jodie Foster in the movie would mean it would be good. Sadly, this was far from the case. I'm picky on futuristic films! They have a habit of making me disinterested. This movie falls under that category in a big way. I had reasonable expectations for it, and it didn't come close to meeting that. This movie is void of tension for the most part despite trying to make you think otherwise. It tries to be a thinking man's action film, but fails miserably. This movie is nowhere near as deep as it wants you to believe. As a matter of fact, it feels something concocted by Hollywood, and that's not a good thing. It felt glossy and phony from start to finish. Elysium tries to be an effective social commentary. We get the ""rich get richer and the poor stay poor"" storyline. I'm getting really tired of the ""The earth is damaged"" route that futuristic movies have a tendency to go as well. it was a good idea at first, but now it's overdone. I'll admit that it was impressively bleak, but kinda hollow. Those that love action will be pretty disappointed. I was pretty bored by everything going on, and I can't recall one action scene that stood out. The only thing semi-entertaining was the fight scene in the finale between Copley & Damon. The acting is above average. Matt Damon is good, don't get me wrong. I felt he became boring when he put on all the machinery. Jodie Foster is terrible here. That breaks my heart to say, because I'm a huge fan of hers. Her accent is awful, and she seems very disinterested. I can't say as I blame her, though. Her part is a throwaway one. Sharlto Copley annoyed the crap out of me. His OTT antics grated my nerves on more than one occasion. He yells too much as well. Alice Braga is pretty, but a bland love interest. Rest of the cast are OK. <br/><br/>Poorly developed characters, lack of interest, and pretentiousness really sink this one. This is a really dull experience and I don't understand how this movie has such a respectable rating. I wouldn't call it horrible, but it's a below average film that doesn't offer much.<br/><br/>5.3/10"

","After the greatness of District 9, I was anticipated for the next project by Writer/Director Neill Blomkamp. Years later came Elysium and was somewhat amazed and disappointed at the same time. The movie is set in the year 2154 where Earth is overpopulated and all the wealthy elite have fled to a space station called Elysium. It's essentially a ring-world that harbors a natural habitat filled with grassy fields, reservoirs and beautiful mansions. Unfortunately for the folks down on Earth, Elysium is hard to get to let alone live there unless you were born in a rich family. The story focuses on former criminal Max DaCosta (Matt Damon) whom is destined to make it to Elysium one day. After getting in a radiation accident at work, he is forced to undergo surgery by a ragtag group of thugs that give him an exo-suit to wear. The plot eventually follows a data heist which will get them to Elysium.<br/><br/>The best parts of Elysium has been the cinematography, special effects and the action. The not so best parts is the writing of the story. There's not a lot of character development, the plot is too quick and thin, and some of the acting by Actress Jodi Foster isn't too good. My real problem with the movie is it's heavy-handed political message that's it's trying to force audiences to submit to. Elysium wants to be relevant. It wants to explore immigration and healthcare issues that America is facing currently. The execution of the socio-political commentary is done so poorly. It's explained through stereotypes. There's a good guy/bad guy. No gray areas. Throw in some action and you get the message by the end of the film. It failed to explore those issues in a complex manner. Another poor execution in Elysium was it's worldbuilding. It's set in the year 2154 yet feels very much like 2013-2014 with a few technological advancements. We see highly advanced guns, robots and some vehicles. Not to mention, Elysium itself but that is really it. Everything else felt too contemporary from the clothing of the characters to the overall atmosphere and the setting.<br/><br/>In the end, Elysium is a a Science Fiction film that really could have been better. it had so much potential. The final product isn't bad, it just didn't meet up with Blomkamp's first feature, District 9."
"amsby17","7","1","2","7 September 2014"," Classism and Science Fiction - Excellent!
","Neil Blomkamp is a brilliant director made for the modern era - his films Elysium and District 9 unveil a realistic, anti-utopian vision of the future that suggests that modern day problems will most likely have only evolved, not disappeared. Specifically, his films touch on sensitive topics like wealth distribution, health care, prejudice and the degraded environment. Likable and familiar actors Jodi Foster and Matt Damon portray both villain and hero in nontraditional and unique ways. The superb writing and casting in Elysium offers a freshness to the science-fiction genre rarely seen in today's blur of industry films.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2154, Blomkamp's vision of the future is brutal and unkind. The world our hero (Max- played by Matt Damon) lives in is dry and dirty, ruthless and over-populated. As Max attempts to re-assimilate back into regular life after prison - viewers get a fascinating glimpse into how the world has excelled (advanced robotics, weaponry and flight) and regressed (public infrastructure and health care) all at the same time. The earth has become over-run with the struggling poor - which has motivated the richest individuals to build a space station isolated and protected from the masses - it's a utopian mecca called Elysium. Elysium is beautiful, clean and houses the most advanced healthcare technology only regular citizens can dream about.<br/><br/>It's in this setting that viewers get to meet mercenary Kruger (Sharlto Copley) - begrudgingly hired by Elysium controllers to do their dirty work down on earth. Sharlto Copley steals the show as a psychotic murderer who wields a samurai sword while unleashing brilliant one-liners. It's this sadistic sense of humor combined with an intense drive to kill that ensures Kruger a permanent place on the list of greatest villains of all time. His best line (after forcibly stabbing Max): ""Did I get ya?! Better get that looked at."" Throughout the well-filmed action sequences and flawless CGI - Blomkamp continues to surprise. Elysium has many twists and turns while still maintaining its originality and beauty. This director has a masterful eye for detail and story-arc all exhibited in Elysium. Keep an eye on this filmmaker - his next works are sure to be great too."

But what the movie fails to explain is, why would anyone choose the lethal option when once it kills you, they can still download the information & save everyone? So really the protection is completely bloody useless other than creating a dramatic ending.<br/><br/>While the movie isn't the worst dystopia movie I've watched, I found it very hard to have any form of bond or connection with the characters, and multiple plot holes made it hard to really enjoy it."

Yes, it was all hidden propaganda, and the aliens were really the poor in disguise, but it was boring, and it still is after repeated viewings.<br/><br/>So the synopsis of this didn't really inspire me, because when you read between the lines it's essentially the same story, but with the narrative tweaked here and there.<br/><br/>How surprised it is then, not just to find a ruddy good science fiction movie, but one of the better movies released in the summer of 2013, easily the poorest year for summer movies.<br/><br/>It's just great to see a big release be so daring, and not rely on effects alone. Damon is brilliant as Max, and it's such an Un-Damon character, that you will soon stop saying 'Matter Damon' like they did in Team America.<br/><br/>But Copley is the best thing in this, and he's terrifying as the bounty hunter.

","In 2154 Earth has all been used up, resources are scarce and those people that remain, scratch out a hard-scrabble existence in a apocalyptic type world. All the while they gaze enviously at ""Elysium"", the utopia built in space above their heads.<br/><br/>Eylsium is the flip-side of Earth, everything is plentiful, order reigns and the rich get to live out their fantasies. They also have access to medical treatment, able to cure any illness after a quick scan in a tanning bed type device.<br/><br/>Back on Earth, ""Max"" (Matt Damon) is a low level assembly line worker, tasked with helping to create robot policemen or peace keepers. Following an industrial accident, his options shrink further and his long standing desire to move to Elysium becomes a necessity. How he achieves this and the help he receives, is the subject of the story line. Ultimately he becomes an enhanced warrior, ""Robocop"" lite without the police badge.<br/><br/>As can be imagined, the queue of people wanting to escape to this rotating dream in the sky, is long and varied. Meanwhile Elysium's ambitious Defence secretary ""Delacourt"" (Jodie Foster) main task is to try to ensure that dream is not shattered by untidy, dirty immigrants destroying the idyllic setting. Instead of ""boat people"" think ""shuttle people"". Delacourt is zealous in this task, taking steps outside of her remit, angering the more liberal president President Patel (Faran Tahir).<br/><br/>Of course no story like this would be complete without a greedy corporate arms conglomerate. On this occasion run by John Carlyle (William Fitchner) in his Bugatti Veyron badged shuttle craft. Carlyle worries more about contracts and performance targets than employees getting irradiated, after all there are plenty more to replace Max in this much sought after position.<br/><br/>Added to the mix is a rather bizarre bounty hunter ""Kruger"" (Sharlto Copley) who completes the ""wet work"" that is occasionally required when the Elysium President is too squeamish to deal with issues. Complete with his default South African accent, Copley cuts a swath and delights in gruesome deaths as he completes Delacourt's bidding.<br/><br/>Director Neill Blomkamp, famous for his relatively low budget but innovative and impressive ""District 9"", has a much starrier cast and a bigger budget to play with this time round. His earlier breakout film had obvious parallels with apartheid, this film tackles even larger themes, rich and poor and entitlement to health care.<br/><br/>Where District 9 had humour and a clear sense of right and wrong, this story is more confused. Effectively attempting to explore the complex area of immigration via a big budget sc-fi film is a risk and on this occasion, one he has not pulled off.<br/><br/>The plot is simple yet manages to be confusing, the motivations of the characters, especially Copleys ""Kruger"" is difficult to understand. His character takes centre stage and turns the action into yet another ""mano et mano"" slugfest, something this story was never about.<br/><br/>Damon is as effective as ever but he appears exposed in his exoskeleteon on occasion. With Foster getting little screen time, we are left with a poor mish mash of ideas, which do not come together in a cohesive whole. Unfortunately, blame must lie with Director and writer Blomkamp and represents an opportunity missed. Lets hope he is more on track with his next venture, ""Chappie"".<br/><br/>The effects are good without being state of the art but the story continually gets in the way. If the director wished to explore these themes, a much more thoughtful less action packed film would have proved more suitable. The film is also quite gratuitously violent, whereas in District 9 this was played for laughs, here much of the gore appears sadistic and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A disappointing film from a director many had high hopes for, following his excellent calling card ""District 9"".<br/><br/>Certainly watchable and on occasion interesting but more for what the film might have been,rather than what is actually on the screen."

"khemass","8","1","2","29 December 2013"," Well-paced, entertaining, good cast, but no depth
","Since my mom easily fell asleep when she watches slow movie, I rented this one for her and I wasn't disappointed. The movie is well-made and entertaining as an action film and you can keep on watching till the end. I like the way they set up prop, characters, music, and the quick pace of the story. However, there is nothing you can learn from it. No significant theme, just the plain ""the poor will one day fight, if the rich beat them down too much."" and ""you are born for something"" but the latter wasn't well supported by the movie although it tried. I didn't feel touched or moved by the connection between the main character's childhood, his relationship with his childhood sweetheart and his carer, and his triumph at the ending. The script is not that good. And there is much violence in the film as well, sometimes unnecessary, in my opinion. (but which actions movies don't have much violence these days, very rare (sigh!)) In conclusion, watch it if you want to enjoy a fun ride. But expect nothing precious or thoughtful."
"Bogie27","5","1","2","26 December 2013"," Will be lauded by some and Egregious to others
","After finishing this movie I felt relieved in a couple of ways: One I didn't waste time at the theater or lay down hard earned cash for the Blu-ray. The fact that I only spent a buck sixty at Red Box left me with a better feeling than the end of this film. The special effects and cinematography were excellent but the story stank it up, all the way to Elysium and the characters were laughingly stereotypical or stoically inhuman.<br/><br/>Loosely, the plot is a caricature of America today but set in a futuristic world where the greedy rich and evil corporations grind the life out of the lowly every-man portrayed by Matt Damon. In this futuristic world the rich have deserted the planet for a Florida sized space station called Elysium and left all their troubles far behind. The victims of this film (which I'm guessing are the poor) are stuck on the burnt-out planet with no way to leave.<br/><br/>Looking quite fit, Jodie Foster personified the uncaring rich bitch with control of government anti-immigration efforts. A lack of depth in her character lingers throughout the film as we never know much about her, other than she has knockout legs and is mean as a snake.<br/><br/>William Fichtner plays the ruthless businessman John Carlyle, which was symbolically a dead ringer for the mythical American corporation that makes tons of money yet never pays taxes. Here again we're at a loss to explain this calculating and laconic character as he has maybe three lines in the film before his ultimate demise.<br/><br/>Added perhaps for a little comic relief was the talented Faran Tahir that played the president Patel of Elysium. He's undoubtedly from India and notably pacifistic in comparison to Foster. This left me wondering if Patel is an archetypal symbol of how the writers delight in seeing our own government leaders.<br/><br/>Ah, the writers. After finishing the film, I would have bet a droid to a doughnut that the screen writers of were indeed a bunch of freshmen English majors working on their first part-time job. After a little reflection upon the morning after, I came upon two conclusions: One, the screenplay is a little deeper than I first thought or two, the screenplay was indeed so bad that the incompetency added a new and much deeper dimension.<br/><br/>On the other side of this equation is the poor downtrodden. Once again, the writers fail to provide a back-story to explain why the greedy rich moved to a space station and why the poor can't seem to turn things around. The poor have inherited the earth but can't do anything with it. They can't look inward to themselves but instead turn scheming eyes to big-brother Elysium. The answer to all this seems to be medical equipment. Yep, strange as it seems, the evil corporation who doesn't mind wasting a few lives, will not waste dollars on elaborate and powerful medical equipment needed to save the life of protagonist Matt Damon (can't remember his character). Matt who was a victim of a careless supervisor (aren't we all?) unwittingly goes into a high-radiation area to avoid delays in production. This would anger Mister evil corporation who is always watching pie and bar charts to monitor plant productivity.<br/><br/>The most technically gifted of the poor downtrodden are pretty much devoted to a life of crime. And the crime is sending illegals to Elysium with false DNA IDs aboard fast moving shuttle craft. Finally the criminally downtrodden manage to steal the brain contents of Mister evil corporation and download the knowledge into Matt Damon's noggin. None of these guys have a job so they're excellent hackers. Because of radiation exposure, Matt has five days to live and desperately seeks a way to get to the medical equipment on Elysium or perish. Now this is where the movie gets comical. The list of people that need the medical equipment on Earth keep getting bigger and bigger. To bring this boring mess to an end, the criminally inclined hackers manage to download the data from Matt Damon. This turns out to be a sacrifice and poor Matt becomes another victim. The upside to this mess occurs when the hackers pull an ingenious switch and make all the poor downtrodden of Earth into citizens of Elysium. <br/><br/>The last scene in the film has the Elysium shuttle craft (much nicer than earth shuttle craft) picking up it's new citizens for a ride to the Elysium medical facilities. Hope they didn't have to go through a website to arrange this.<br/><br/>I generally avoid scathing reviews, but when people spend this much money in the film industry to make a heavy social or political comment, I have to take notice. But it's completely up to the viewer whether this film merits credit, or whether it's a two hour waste of time built with twisted logic and trendy misinformation."

"tomgillespie2002","6","1","2","19 December 2013"," A film that achieves as many hits as it does misses
","Back in 2009, the film-viewing world began raving about a curious new sci-fi actioner named District 9. Boasting a satirical commentary on racial segregation and a funny-accented producer-turned-lead star Sharlto Copley, it signalled the arrival of a potentially explosive new director, Neill Blomkamp. Personally, the film embraced genre clichés a little to willingly for my taste, but it was an exciting little film with some interesting things to say. Four years later, Blomkamp is on similar grounds with Elysium, but this time the target is the social elite.<br/><br/>In 2154, Earth has been abandoned by the super rich, who have all packed up and headed to a space station named Elysium. There they live a care- free life in their mansions and all talk French, seemingly sipping wine all day by the pool. The biggest benefit is a healthcare machine that can diagnose a patient and heal them almost instantly. Back on Earth, things are tough. Robots police the dusty streets, and ex-con Max da Costa (Matt Damon) is repeatedly beaten down by the man when he's just trying to get to work. When an industrial accident exposes Max to a heavy dose of radiation, he is given 5 days to live. He must get up to Elysium at all costs with the help of his criminal friends Julio (Diego Luna) and Spider (Wagner Moura) in order to heal himself.<br/><br/>Like District 9, the social observations are sharp, with obvious parallels to be made with the American health system, where the rich can enjoy top-class treatment from the best doctors, while the poor are forced to choose which of their fingers they want sown back on. Not to say the satire is subtle - this is the cinematic equivalent of posting dog s**t through an enemy's letter-box - Jodie Foster's evil Delacourt hires her psychopathic 'man on the ground' Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to shoot down any illegal immigrants attempting to land on Elysium to get some better healthcare. The rich here have no dimensions - faceless suits who wouldn't p**s on you if you were on fire. But the anger in Elysium makes the film all the more absorbing.<br/><br/>Sadly (and, again, like in District 9), this comes at the expense of the story. Max is a faceless 'good' guy, but is given some humanity by the effortlessly likable Matt Damon. His love interest is in his childhood flame Frey (Alice Braga), who has a child riddled with leukaemia, causing Max to question his priorities. It's all too predictable and overly familiar, riddled with distracting plot-holes and silly plot devices. Blomkamp's tech-fetish surfaces again as Max is given an exoskeleton that somehow makes him stronger, making him look a bit like Bane from The Dark Knight Rises (2012).<br/><br/>In a performance a world away from his ethically-challenged, bureaucratic weed in District 9, Sharlto Copley damn near steals the entire film. Bulked up and bearded, Kruger is a terrifying (albeit rather one-dimensional) psychopath, apparently capable of any horrific act. I could listen to his voice all day, which is the complete opposite of Jodie Foster, who delivers a strangely tuned-out performance with the strangest accent I've ever heard. She is simply terrible. But that's Elysium, a film that achieves as many hits as it does misses, neglecting the story for some cutting satire, boasting some astonishing CGI but delivering some sub-standard set-pieces, but overall, a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"mgruebel","6","1","2","18 December 2013"," A solid ""save the world""
","As in many Hollywood ""save the world"" sci-fi action movies, the hero dies just as he saves his loved ones, the new world is not for him. The sappy ending is in stark contrast to the director's penchant for blowing up bodies, faces, you name it, in slow bone and face-tearing sequences.<br/><br/>The premise is standard: a world divided into have-nots and haves, the latter secluded in a paradise. This ground was treaded more expertly in the Sean Connery vehicle Zardoz (and you cannot beat Beethoven's 7th as a sound track), but Elysium still does a solid job. Of course, a space station is an unlikely Elysium for the rich, what with all the transportation and supply problems, vulnerability and so forth. A subtropical island chain would have been more realistic, but the writer (who also directs) can be forgiven fully because Elysium is not needlessly blown to pieces at the end. It just makes a neater-looking destination than any old island.<br/><br/>I was worried for a bit after the bad would-be military dictator (played tight-lipped by Jodie Foster) died, and it looked like a typical cheap showdown between hero and the exoskeleton-powered hired hand of said dictator was going to be the finale. But then that one gets dispatched quickly also, and a more gentle but nefarious 'good bad guy' is up next. In fact, the way Foster's character dies is genius scriptwriting in hindsight: when she realizes that the new world order is not her style (with all those poor Spanish-speaking people living happily ever after), she stays a nurse's hand and rather bleeds to death instead.<br/><br/>The ending is sappy (compare that to the infamous 'aging' scene at the end of Zardoz), but the movie is well-intentioned, the action keeps coming in good doses, the characters are drawn just enough so one can slightly care for them. All in all not a bad way to waste an hour and fifty minutes."

With only 5-days to live, Max will do whatever it takes to get to Elysium in order to save his life.<br/><br/>Writer/director Neill Blomkamp re-teams with Sharlto Copley after their 2009 break-out hit, District 9. It's hard not to compare Elysium to District 9. When you do, you can't help but be disappointed with Elysium, as it isn't anywhere near as groundbreaking or original. It looks and feels just like a sequel but isn't. We want to like Elysium because it's Neill Blomkamp but really, it's not anything special. If it wasn't directed by Blomkamp, we would have passed it off as a wannabe District 9. Really it's just another mediocre and predictable sci-fi action thriller.<br/><br/>While Matt Damon is miscast or just way too nice of a guy to be playing an ex-con, Sharlto Copley's villain keeps things interesting but in the end, there's just not enough of him.

"tecnogaming","4","1","2","2 December 2013"," A colossal mess
","Elysium is one of those movies that starts great and ends in disaster.<br/><br/>If you want a short review here it is:<br/><br/>Starts almost at 9/10, struggles to be in the 6/10 in the middle and ends in an awful 4/10.<br/><br/>Elysium tries very hard for us to like the characters, hate the villain and mostly, it do it's job in the first act, since we see how the people on earth suffer compared to Elysium.<br/><br/>Our main character displays a very good and humble predisposition to work and do the right thing for this ""world""... <br/><br/>This all go downhill from the moment he suffers the accident and decides to go Rambo.<br/><br/>The problem with Elysium is that the characters are not likable at all past the first act, you begin to hate them and the director seems to confuse it's stuff since you begin to wonder what the heck they are trying to do all the time.<br/><br/>The villain is so bad that it becomes basically a jerk by the end. Jodie Foster is just a wasted talent on this movie and the rest of the cast, they feel like they don't know what to do or what are their intentions at all.<br/><br/>By the time the movie reaches it's climax it's a complete mess, it tries so hard to be an action flick and it fails, tries hard to give a compelling argument that it fails and in the end, it's just a mess.<br/><br/>If you like random movies with random characters, lots of violence for no reason and nice CGI, this one is for you.<br/><br/>If, on the contrary, like me, you like a nice thinking sci-fi movie with a good plot, this one is definitely not for you.<br/><br/>It's sad because it's started well, but it just don't know how to handle the world or it's characters at all and this is clearly the director's fault. It should had stayed with district 9 but this is what happens with someone talented starts to work for Hollywood."
"pcrprimer","5","1","2","1 December 2013"," Overrated movie, with a heavy-handed message and too many plot holes
","To start, I was a big fan of the originality of District 9 and thought that Elysium would be another cool original Sci Fi movie. After watching it, I couldn't help but think of the countless plot holes and nonsensical aspects. Off the top of my head: the robots are hit with radiation for no reason, Elysium doesn't have a defence system other than a person firing RPGs from Earth, the robocop guards of one of the richest men in the world have none of the cool weapons we see in the armory later. Also, the whole idea of providing medpods to masses doesn't solve problems of overpopulation and crime that still would plague Earth.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this movie a passing grade is the wonderful performance by Sharlto Copley. I would describe it as an almost psychotic T-1000. Absolutely loved his South African accent and slang (Boykie!)."
"zircosil","4","1","2","1 December 2013"," OK, but only just
","As an ordinary film fan I was really looking forward to this movie - the idea of the story about an Earth that was cactus and an orbiting utopia seemed really appealing, and that's largely where it stayed.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's character was ill-conceived and her accent (whatever it was supposed to be) was very detracting from her performance. Surely someone must of realized in the first few scenes that it was a shocker and would have been better just to have canned it.<br/><br/>Overall I found the movie to be quite disjointed with story-lines either glossed over, thrown in, or dumped completely. Maybe if the movie had been longer than a lot of the story could have been fleshed out some more. The CGI was impressive and there were a couple of humorous scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>This movie is one worth watching when there is nothing else to do, but its unlikely that you'll watch it again."
"jljacobi","6","1","2","27 November 2013"," Looks great, liked Damon, too many stereotypes, wrong focus
","I liked District 9, it had a quirkiness that's lacking in this film. Elysium's visuals are stunning, and well thought out, but the concept is rife with South African sensitivities. The elite are shallow or downright evil, the military types are brutish, and the only people with any spark of goodness are the downtrodden.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the premise that earth is massively over-populated, shows it, then veers immediately into a simplistic poor versus rich theme. At no time is any thought given to the basic issue of overpopulation or what it did to the planet and what could be done about it, it's just somehow the wealthy and powerful's fault.<br/><br/>And I don't know how it works in South Africa, but there's a rich history of philanthropy in the U.S. At any rate, the director needs to pull his head out of wherever it's stuck and balance the equation. At least if he wants interesting movies. <br/><br/>Matt Damon was very good, as were most of the actors given a chance to be. There was little to no development of the Elysium-side characters so it was hard to care one way or the other about them. In the end that made it difficult to care one way or the other about the movie."
"thenationalzero","6","1","2","23 November 2013"," There's a good movie in here, somewhere
","After District 9, I was really excited to see what this director would do next. More gritty dystopia? Damon and Foster are on board? Something about a bone saw? Count me in!<br/><br/>However, Elysium was a major, *major* disappointment. The plot is formulaic, often non-sequitur, and riddled with plot-holes. There are no characters, only caricatures. The script is terribly unimaginative, though I'm sure the actors did the best they could with the material they were given (except maybe Copley - I thought he was out of his league). And don't get me started on the editing.<br/><br/>Such squandered potential. Maybe there would be hope in an extended director's cut."
"Watcher120","5","1","2","18 November 2013"," Not as bad as I expected
","I was reluctant to see the film as I had been warned that it was brainless liberal propaganda for Obamacare. Nah. <br/><br/>It, yes, was brainless but in a harmless sort of way. Whatever liberal propaganda was there got overwhelmed by the horrid picture of Los Angeles overrun by criminal Hispanics. Not a pretty picture of immigration and would certainly be making the case for better immigration control. <br/><br/>The main piece of brainlessness was the focus on health care. Seems to me that the world of 2154 had more serious problems than access to high-tech health care. The whole society had come apart and I don't think you can, as the film does, blame it all on unequal distribution of health care. That made no sense. So once (spoiler) the rich agree, at gunpoint, to distribute free health care, everything is solved? Nah. <br/><br/>The action was good. The acting was adequate for this sort of film. The production values were solid with some very good special effects and a very dreary looking LA. <br/><br/>Don't look for a political message. If one was intended it is so murky as to be unseen. I could, however, see some Hispanic groups getting very upset over the portrayal of Hispanics in the movie."
"WeathermanTom","7","1","2","18 November 2013"," Slightly let down
","Although I had been waiting to watch this movie ever since a friend showed me the trailer, after we had watched District 9, I felt that it was not exactly what I had hoped it to be. There are some plot holes, and the whole ""leaving Earth and arriving in space within a matter of minutes"" was -to my eyes- tackled a bit naively. All this is not disturbing in watching the film, the effects are great throughout, but the characters are somewhat poorly developed. Seemingly bad guys turning into likable characters within seconds of an unconvincing dialogue. Jodie Foster gives a good performance, albeit not her best, Matt Damon is who he is, the bad guys are very bad, and the good are too good. In a nutshell, I would recommend watching this film, because it is a good idea, but do not expect stuff you have not seen before. If I had to compare it to District 9, well... I just can't."

","After having seen the film I found that Mr. Blomkamp has re-found certain themes from Metropolis (1927) (not so much in the details) but in the spirit of his film. The feel of his Earth scenes had that sense of reality where an overpopulated and depleted earth ""below"" serves a workshop for the ""prodigously rich"" who live in a ""ideal"" environment ""above"". Humanity has certainly had such societies in the past (the Third Reich or more recently white South Africa) and we well may have them in the future.<br/><br/>Both films try to describe a world where revolt is constantly simmering and violence and repression are both open and extreme.<br/><br/>The themes of ""overworld"" (rich) and ""underworld"" (poor) are linked with the use of one man's life story but the resolution of both films lacks the reality of what the ""real"" resolution of such conflict would be like within the context of both this film and Metropolis (that is not peaceful sharing but violent destruction as for the Third Reich).<br/><br/>There are no doubt also echos of the origins of Mr. Blomkamp (South Africa) in the choice of ""everyone becomes a citizen"" as a resolution to such a conflict.<br/><br/>I find his telling of this version of societies based on one group's exploitation of another very well made and I vote 8 out of 10."

"natlee-1","4","1","2","25 September 2013"," This movie tries to be everything and fails
","This movie had the potential, but I think it tried to be too many things at once and fails at all of them. <br/><br/>Visual - with the development of the 'new world' in the sky, there was potential to develop something breathtakingly beautiful. However, any shot of the environment was just milliseconds long (ok, exaggerating), not enough to appreciate it. It did not explore the environment enough to give you a sense of how it was like in the new world. <br/><br/>Drama - any drama or relationship in the movie felt forced and mostly very cliché. You kinda get the sense of how it will end. It also felt very rushed, nothing lingers long enough for you to understand their motivations and does not make you relate to any of the characters. <br/><br/>Character development - with the various characters and the diversity seen in the film, one would expect something good. With excellent actors thrown into it, especially Jodie Foster, it was a let down. You get a sense of the possibilities there, but walk out of the theater feeling unfulfilled. Characters were simplified and presented from just one angle, there wasn't enough time to explore deeper each character. The diversity was a good one and not really seen in other movies, but the accents they did was more of a distraction. I was quite focused on how Foster (and various other characters) was pronouncing words rather than focusing on the subject itself. <br/><br/>Action - this is the only thing that fared fairly well in this movie. You have the hero and the villain, and the battles between them. Although the characters may be cliché, some of the weapons and tactics were somewhat unexpected, so this can fulfill the audience's need for some action. Matt Damon was good for his action skills, predictable. <br/><br/>Overall, you can give this movie a miss. It was overly ambitious but likely done with limited budget. The big names did not add any weight to this movie, in fact, felt like a waste of their talents. It became cliché and predictable throughout the movie. The CGI and action in this movie was alright, but might not necessarily be enough to recommend it."

","First of all: I love science-fiction, specifically if it has post-apocalyptic, dystopian and/or socio-critical aspects. Elysium offers a bit of all of those, combined with an interesting and believable setting and a great atmosphere. Even though the basis of the story is quite promising, its ending is very predictable and cheesy and many parts of the movie are based on clichés. Additionally, the second half of the movie consists primarily of action scenes with a gruesome and excessive amount of graphical violence. If you however like current first-person-shooters not despite of, but specifically because of the displayed violence, you just might like Elysium (in this case it is very likely that you are a male teenager). If you prefer ""classic"" sci-fi movies that are more focused on story than on shaky cameras and endless combinations of fights and shootouts, than this movie is probably not for you. Concluding, I like the background story and atmosphere of the movie, however I would have enjoyed the movie way more without the unnecessary amount of action and violence. When I left the movie I was physically stressed, but maybe I'm just old school and that's what people nowadays want when going to the movies."

In Elysium, director Bloomkamp once again chooses the way of the social message, masking it with a very entertaining and visually impressive action drama. Nothing to blame there. The directing is fine, we have many great actors, a thrilling plot, a true blockbuster. The thing is that in terms of model, this is exactly the same movie as District 9, sharing most of its ideas, only adding a bigger budget and a better cast, losing like that all the originality effect that District 9 was so praised about, even if it was a bit overrated at times.

Writer/director Neill Blomkamp hit a home-run with his first endeavor into the Sci-Fi realm and made quite a smart move when casting not-so well-known Sharlto Copley as the lead in District 9.

"billygoat1071","6","1","2","5 September 2013"," Exploding Commentary
","By first glance at the very first still, I already believed that Elysium will be the best blockbuster of the year; the story isn't based on anything, the concept looks rich, and the character design of Max looks like a potential of a new cinematic icon. With the name Neill Blomkamp, you will know that this is more than a simple high concept. Just like District 9, the story builds a social allegory. Now this one talks about the economy, illegal immigrations, and healthcare. It would have been intriguing, but the film is shaky in its message and somehow more satisfied on being cool, which ends up being a straightforward action movie that has only little development. The rest of it is still quite gripping and stunning, with a vision that is more breathtaking than any blockbuster out there. Elysium is fine for its big ideas, but the context needs more to work out.<br/><br/>The setting is definitely built for satires, though unlike District 9, this one takes them seriously, as in not much humorous. Its cynicism is everywhere, but it depicts both rich and poor in a typical way. Elysium is run by a selfish, corrupt government and its citizens are too naive and pleasured to be concern about what's going on, while Earth is mostly inhabited by good people because they get all the suffering. It's fascinating how they have to realistically contrast between both class; the space torus world is more advanced than the third world, but no matter how they tried to make it look close to reality, the political wars still feel campy and contrived. The plan of the ""heroes"" also seems amazingly absurd. It's Sci-Fi, sure, but again it's an allegory to a real life problem. Their solution for the healthcare crisis is quite otherworldly. I guess this is for the sake to fit for an action movie plot, but that also results to a less impressive delivery of its subtext. In other subject, the film doesn't provide enough detail beneath the corruption of the Elysium government, neither the devastation of Earth which makes an underwhelming commentary.<br/><br/>The storytelling is terribly straightforward, though straightforward is not actually a problem. You can develop a character by studying their personalities even without any back stories, but here even a single flashback and brief pathos won't bring much genuine connection to the audience. The actual energy relies more to the technical work and the performances. The characters may be somewhat bland, but the actors thankfully filled something in their marvelously designed roles. Matt Damon gives all of Max's weakness and redemption, which makes him an endearing protagonist. Sharlto Copley's unhinged villainous turn is endlessly enjoyable. Wagner Moura and Diego Luna manage to be likable in their small roles, while Jodie Foster and William Fichtner brought some appropriate antagonism.<br/><br/>The film is best when it focuses on the cool stuff. Every image of the film is undeniably breathtaking to look at. The production is awesome with rust and dirt all over it. The special effects are simply magnificent compared to Hollywood's most recent summer blockbusters. The action is of course has the joy of blowing up flesh into pieces, palpable trademark of the director. Neill Blomkamp pours the best of his technical filmmaking skills.<br/><br/>Personally, Elysium is a disappointment. The world it created is so brilliant, it would have been a powerful blockbuster that would outweigh all the remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels, adaptations, and other unoriginal projects Hollywood provides nowadays. It's still pretty innovative and very entertaining, but the story had something to say and it troubles to that point. I still think Neill Blomkamp is a magnificent storyteller. I just wish he can use more of the human side of his stories. Matt Damon ends up achieving that, but it wasn't enough unfortunately, though it's getting there. Maybe more exploration would help to make it all compelling. If you have no interest in its sociopolitical content, then feast your eyes by one of the most eye popping visuals and exciting set pieces ever presented this year."

"haosstoposto","6","1","2","29 August 2013"," Basically an action movie
","I didn't have big expectations from this movie when I went to see it. First of all I don't understand so much hype about movie directors last movie District 9. In my opinion, it was a simple and illogical action movie. But this is now, we have new movie with plot holes. The plot for this movie is simple enough and reminds of a cyberpunk movie Johhny Mnemonic"" with Keanu Reaves. We have some classical dystopian setting which could have been explained better. Basically, Earth is overpopulated and it appears that national governments have failed, but we don't know how or why. All the rich people live on a clean space station/habitat called Elysium orbiting Earth and of course sometimes the poor try to reach this promised country with some illegal shuttles, which reminds of the boat-people who try to reach today's Europe from Africa or USA from Cuba. These shuttles are being routinely shot down from Earth by Elysium assassins. The protagonist of the movie is Matt Damon (as Max de Costa) who is lucky to have a job in a economically struggling robot factory in L.A. These robots are very sophisticated and put to use as police and soldiers and it is not clear why is necessary to have human workers assemble these robots. The owner of the factory complains about dropping productivity and he never tried full production-automatisation. But that is just the beginning. Matts character gets irradiated in the factory (it is never explained why the robots he assembles need a radiation treatment) and he will die in 5 days unless he is treated in some medical bay on Elysium which can cure every disease. As an act of a desperate man he agrees to kidnap factory owner (who is a citizen of Elysium)and steal access codes for his accounts and everything else from his cerebral implants. For this he is equipped with some cyber-exoskeleton and then the movie forgets that he is irradiated and that anybody who touches him will get some radiation from him. The heist goes awry and he is hunted by some south-African mercenaries who work as agents/hit squad for Elysium (it is never explained how is this possible in L.A. – USA). Max does not know that the information he downloaded in the heist which he keeps in his head is an access code for the entire Elysium. Then there is Jodie Fosters character who wants this code for herself so she can rule on the space station. We then have Max's childhood friend Frey and her ill daughter who are accidentally in the middle of the struggle. There was a possibility for some love story strand of the plot but it was probably dropped and instead we have some shooting and killing and shaky camera movement, typical for a modern action movie. And there are some other plot holes. For example, we see in the movie that Elysium is capable to create no-fly zones wherever they want, if so why they allow those illegal shuttles to reach them? Later in the movie we see that some shuttles can come through the defenses of the station without problems. At the beginning of the movie we see a mercenary use a shoulder launched missile on Earth to shoot down a shuttle in space which is thousands of Kilometers away which is very unrealistic, modern technology or not. At some point Jodie Fosters character is wounded and she didn't want Frey who is a doctor to help her, who knows why. Anyway we have some predictable ending of the movie and the humanity lived happily ever after. Redeeming point of the movie is that it never gets really boring. And it is not too long."
"piracyistheft","6","1","2","24 August 2013"," What happened?
","Watching this movie, I can only assume that the genius behind District 9's great storytelling lays in Terri Tatchell's talent as a screenwriter, not in Neil Blomkamp's.<br/><br/>This movie looks great, and has a good concept, but the script is terrible. All citizens of Elysium are ""moustache twirlers"", devoid of any subtlety whatsoever. The characters are beyond stupid and every single line of dialog is cringe-worthy. The logic and rules of this universe are poorly thought out and not explained, and the whole plot is non-nonsensical, with things clearly set up to move the plot along, with no regard to logic and character consistency.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you leave your brain at the front door, you will be entertained. This movie does look great and there are some visually impressive scenes, although there is some over-use of bad shaky-cam."

","I wanted to be impressed. I thought that the lessons learned from reading the reviews of District 9 would have inspired the director... but sadly no. I'm sure that when the script was storyboarded the concept must have sounded great. But when the script was completed it was just full of plot holes and ridiculous science blunders.<br/><br/>The writing of a good sci-fi script hinges on an ability of an audience to suspend their disbelief because the plot devices are at least plausible. The concept of utopia on Elysium and Hell on earth is so poorly executed owing to insufficient contrast between the two. Society on earth is supposedly impoverished due to over-population and lack of resources. Yet the slum city of LA still apparently has running water and no-one appears to be starving. Technological distribution and evolution also appears disjointed. You can be seemingly atomically rebuilt to eradicate disease and age on Elysium, but yet on Earth you are using Medical equipment etc. from the 1980s and 1990s. Earth appears to be dirty but sunny with clear blue skies, but we are led to believe it is polluted and harmful ""do you think I want to be down here breathing THIS air"" states our mega industrialist and then later demanding that a subordinate doesn't breathe on him (perhaps he's just Molysmophobic).<br/><br/>Why does a minister for defence of an elite housing space station have to rely on sleeper agents on Earth who have to use Earth-to-space missiles to destroy incoming shuttles. Don't they have missile batteries on board the station?? If incoming shuttles can land so easily on Elysium as their is no physical barrier between space and the Elysium 'atmosphere', surely the multi-billion dollar owners would have a much larger available defence force than 2 red droids and two security gunships. Of course not... because if they did then it would take more than 3 psychotic earth thugs to overwhelm the defence building and take over.<br/><br/>I concur with many fellow reviewers in a summarization of great visuals, poor storyline. There was such potential within this movie framework to actually dramatize some meaningful set pieces and explain some of the back history that leads to this dystopia. Characterisation scenes would have lent reinforcement to the audience having an investiture in caring even a little for the characters. Damon's character becomes completely selfish rather than selfless. What was the point of the whole scene with the writing on the hand undying loyalty and professing ""someday I'll take you there"", when within half an hour he's rushing out of her house saying he can do nothing for her or the little girl (he begged her for a coffee date not 15 minutes ago LOL).<br/><br/>Perhaps avoiding crucial explanatory dialogue scenes was the Director's plan. If they had injected scenes to explain things and provide characterization then it would have slowed the pace of the movie down just enough for the audience to actually think about all the holes in the plot.... and throw their popcorn at the screen! Overall I was left disappointed and a little angry. Why had the director/script writers not sat down and thought.. Ya know this would be so much better if we did this and explained that and gave Matt a real reason to care.. other than not wanting to die!"

","""Elysium"" is a visually stunning Science-Fiction parable that - halfway through the movie - loses its socially critical aspirations for the benefit of common action scenes with lots of shooting and fighting and projectiles exploding in slow motion. <br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp certainly had a strong vision; he created a dirty, overpopulated, ruined world ridden by poverty and violence, a world we can very well relate to since it too obviously resembles areas and spots we all - once in a while - happen to see on the news when there is again a report on the favelas in Brazil or townships of South Africa or any other slums or war areas for instance, and we feel relieved to have escaped such a hard fate just because we were luckily born in a rich industrial country. And such an idealized industrial country can be interpreted as the eponymous space station ""Elysium"" where the few rich ones are living like Greek gods in heaven looking down at the Earth in disgust for all the miserable people down there to whom they feel so much superior. There we have it: the metaphorical north-south divide!<br/><br/>All this would have been enough to make it a very profound and deep SiFi-Classic if Blomkamp had not wanted to combine it with the typical Hollywood summer blockbuster action booster pack including a more or less secondary love story plus an obligatory sadistic sociopath named Kruger thus losing track of his original path and - which is worse - giving away much of its suspense and substance because he very soon gets caught up in predictable Popcorn movie patterns. Very much like its more artistically innovative predecessor ""District 9"", ""Elysium"" seems not thought through down to the last detail, many questions are not answered, too many things are assumed or just not explained, there is no background story either, there are certain issues with logic, and we are not offered a sufficiently satisfying depiction of the futuristic political and economical conditions.<br/><br/>So we have to take the world's premise for granted in which the main character Max (Matt Damon), a common worker and former thief, somewhat clumsily (he is not trained after all) struggles to find a way up to ""Elysium"", like so many terrestrials before him, where he wants to use one of the local Med-Pods that miraculously can cure any illness and injury in order to save his own life thus teaming up with a bunch of outlaws who enforce him with a strength-enhancing exoskeleton which for some reason no one else wanted to wear. Unfortunately, he has very powerful enemies, above all the Secretary of Defense D. Rhodes whose zero-tolerance immigration policy threatens to foil his plans. Jodie Foster plays Rhodes with such an eccentric, cold-hearted charm that it's really a pity that Blomkamp's script also lost focus on her amidst all the beamy and bulky action intervals.<br/><br/>While ""District 9"" worked better as a classical SiFi-parable in spite of its many logical flaws, Blomkamp's latest contribution to the genre, may be a bit too simplistic and underdeveloped to have a lasting impact on the audience, however, it is nevertheless an impressive eye candy for any real SiFi-fan."
"badmullah","7","1","2","20 August 2013"," Some good idea and some ancient ones
","Must admit it was a good film exploring the possibility that sooner or later capitalists trashed the earth like the morning after a hard-core party. In an era that machines can hook up with your nervous system I can see that the movie thinks in 130 years from today we still use the peripherals like Keyboard and laptops ;))) NOT so .Steve Jobs should have been hired as an adviser to come up with ideas on this. The manager (William Fichtner :John Carlyle ) behind the glass was going through some Assembly code (base machine code) which to an average Joe may seem like a mumbo jumbo geeky things but it is definitely not something at his level would use. Attempt of desperate people trying to get on ships and cross the border and get themselves into a better place is pretty much close to what we already have with Australia and refugees from troublesome nations who want a better life and risk their life trying to pursue that. The kidnapping of Mr (William Fichtner :John Carlyle ) was done well however the man to man combat of the south African dude with (Matt Damon:Max) the hero of the film was lengthy and boring. Interesting enough Mr Patel seemed to be of an Indian descent but I saw a few Chinese and Indian or a few African in year 2013 based on UN's publications they should contain 50 % of the Earth population."
"mfthopesch","7","1","2","20 August 2013"," a bit disappointed
","...after watching D9. Still gets a good rating since it is very enjoyable, nevertheless think lornloxor wrote a very precise review. Good action flic but storyline leaves you a bit cold. Additionally rather easy to avoid logical mistakes: why do they fire the rockets from earth, why can the rebels (whatever you call them) land so easily while before there were all these warning systems active shooting down the shuttles, why does the defense minister not want to live on? Since the people on Elysium are de facto immortal, what happens to the growing population. The kids will have kids again and then. Build a second Elysium a third...where to get the quality engineering and resources from?<br/><br/>Blomkamp loves to develop stories about conflicts in/between societies, this is also well-done here. At the end major question is: what now, nothing against an open ending but finally it is even not one, even it looks like: now that anybody is a Bürger of Elysium, everybody is allowed to go there...wait let us say you get 10 million per year up there, means all the then 10bn population of earth in 30 years. And then what for? For a two weeks holiday? Of course nobody wants to leave and everybody wants to go there. In the end Elysium will be destroyed, everybody will try to get his her buddy up there and that is it. Nobody wants to work in the factories and so production will collapse and in the end everybody will be worse off. I do not know if BK wanted to give it this socialist twist, if yes would be truly disappointing."
"davidcoverman","7","1","2","20 August 2013"," To have and (make sure) to have not or my review of Elysium ****
","Elysium is awell, is a great movie. I hesitated there only because I was going to say ""is a great science fiction movie"" and while this is most definitely a science fiction movie, I think Neill Blomkamp had too many balls in the air for me to champion this movie as classic science fiction. From the heavy emphasis on action mixed in with all the commentary on poverty, pollution, and health care etc he had chainsaws, bowling balls and bowling pins in the air for this juggling act But don't get me wrong this is about as good as it gets with film making and story telling. Personally I thought the heavy emphasis on the action made it loose some of the overall effectiveness on all the other social commentary it had going for it. To me, by definition, great social commentary is something that all great science fiction has. And while I think Neil had great aspirations for doing just that, he also had an eye on the box-office potential of super-hero level box-office potential.<br/><br/>What's interesting is I saw this with a conservative friend who also likes science fiction but in hindsight it's something I should have asked them about because liking science fiction HAS to be at odds with much of their regular day to day thinking .<br/><br/>Most of the best science fiction rally against corporations out of control, or rally the against the repression of freedom of thought and expression, fighting the corruption of power and money, human rights over misguided self righteous morals etc all those things his political party usually stands for. And while they were typically busy with counting the number of ""F-bombs"" rather than counting the number of crimes against humanity, all the action I think helped mask the extremes of the 'haves' against the 'have nots' and it's ""class warfare"" message. This way it did not seem to offend their senses the way the director's previous attempt at the allegories of apartheid and all 'the good things it had to offer', that were so well played out in his District 9. And speaking of that movie... considering the relatively tiny budget he worked with on that one, it was very interesting to see him balance the ""brain and brawn"" with the slick and fantastic look of this film with it's much bigger budget.<br/><br/>But aside of all the ""action versus message"" in this film what I really liked was some of the turns this film took. Every time this movie started to head in a predictable direction Neil would throw in a curve ball, literally crashing things to the ground like when they were delivering the prisoners to the orbiting space station Elysium. Now there may have been a few stretches of believably in the plot where Matt Damon's character Max just happens to get a lethal dose of radiation that sends him on his suicidal mission, at the exact same time Jodie Foster's character Delacourt, the security leader of the one-precenters on Elysium is planning a coup, but these complaints are minor when dealing the humanity Matt Damon's character builds up as Max trying to save all those on Earth in particular his childhood friend Frey(Alice Braga) and her sick daughter that needing to get to the instant healing only available on Elysium.<br/><br/>Now, Richard Roeper called Jodie Foster's acting something like the worst performance in the history of film, or something like that, while Peter Travers said she was ""killing it, as a Dick Cheney in heels."" I was probably somewhere in the middle. And while I would be hard pressed to particularly defend the locked jawed grit she was grinding out, the Cheney comment is laughably accurate. In particular, I liked the fact she was not 'chewing the scenery' as is often the case with great actors in villainous roles.<br/><br/>So the idea of how rich people really don't care if poor people have access to medical care is scarily reflective of today's world just look yet another vote by old rich white dudes against health care for the poor is in today's headlines and taking the idea of unregulated corporations polluting the world to climate changing levels wrapped up around several cool gun battles, and fight scenes between a exoskeleton enhanced Matt Damon and psycho villain Kruger(Sharlto Copley) can seem a bit flippant, or incongruous, still...I walked away from this film extremely entertained and yes even intellectually challenged, so having said everything I just said, it really is a great 'science fiction movie' ""f-bomb"" ? ""Was there? 'spose so and how many tattoos did they have?"""

","Elysium: scifi socialism wrapped in contemporary issues Matt Damon reached for the stars in his new scifi flick Elysium. Instead he fell to Earth, with a loud thud, as the story line was revealed. Set in the year 2154, with a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles as its backdrop, Damon must fight his way through two worlds for his own survival and the rest of humanity. Wealthy elites live on a gigantic space platform named Elysium, while the rest of Earth's population lives in the ruins below. Twenty-second century Los Angeles is populated with millions of Hispanic individuals who have reclaimed a city once under their auspices. Very little work is available except for a few giant corporate structures managed by the Elysium hierarchy. Damon's female interest has a child who is in her last days of life. With our hero facing his own demise from an industrial accident, the clock is ticking for both to get to Elysium where cures are available. Numerous obstacles are placed in the path of the protagonist Damon before he can achieve passage for himself and others to the elites floating abode. Jodi Foster is engaging as the Defense Secretary in Elysium. Contemporary social themes overburden this film's futuristic settings begging the question, did the White House edit this film. A war between the rich and poor is continually emphasized. Climate change is creatively worked into some of the scenes. Yet, the most provocative theme is sophisticated medical services are only ordained for the rich, sound familiar. Director Neill Blomkamp, denies in numerous interviews, that Elysium was intended to showcase America's current problems. Any other interpretation would be antithetical to the evidence before the audience. Damon's performance is flat, as though he was forced to perform in a venue out of his league. Half-hearted direction makes the interplay between the actors lame and uninteresting. As an avid fan of scifi, I would wait until this one comes to cable. It has very little future.

"kgprophet","5","1","2","18 August 2013"," The Wailing Woman Cliché is Getting Old
","It has become such a cliché, that it is heavily featured in parody movies. The switch to slow motion as the tragedy unfolds and the soundtrack falls silent except for a single old woman wailing a sad song as if at a funeral. I'm not sure who started this phenomena, perhaps Ridley Scott. But it has been such a staple for action soundtracks in the last 20 years or so, to use it more than once during the course of the movie is to draw ridicule.<br/><br/>I had a lot of problems with the sound design and the sound mix of this film. They tried to stuff every beat in the film with some unnecessary sound or line of dialogue that would have been better left unsaid. While I can appreciate the film not wasting our time and keeping the pace and energy going (take that, Wolverine), it was almost afraid to catch it's breath. To have one of these blockbusters actually star a talented actor in Matt Damon, they should have let him breath between action scenes a little, get inside his head a little more. Visit with his ex-girlfriend a little longer. A little more character development in that area would have helped the large gulps of story that we chase through on our way to the big space station.<br/><br/>I was rooting for both the intelligence of Damon, who knows how to put some necessary humour into his character at the right time (take that, Pacific Rim). And my compliments to the producers for letting the film be a soft 'R' rated release, without a doubt lending better to realism amidst the dystopian future world (take that, World War Z). I think Sharlto Copley displayed far more depth and capability in being a dominating villain than the thin character that was drawn for him in this movie. He shows no consistent behaviour while deciding whether to kill Damon or not. But the delivery of his lines is so engaging, it is a delight to watch him do bad guy stuff.<br/><br/>It is a less appealing story that normal Sci-Fi fantasies intentionally avoid, but Elysium tries to feel like a documentary about a third world country. You will probably hear some hoots in response to the over-pronounced delivery Jodie Foster gives, making her villainous character more annoying than interesting. As I tried to keep remembering I wasn't watching ""Oblivion"", I was feeling satisfied in the attempt by the filmmakers to meet the audience's expectations. Other blockbusters recently having been lacking a soul as they rush through the by-the-numbers script clichés.<br/><br/>I wish it was released before ""Oblivion"", and perhaps this well made sci-fi action film might have felt a bit more fresh, and had not wasted my intelligence like that Tom Cruise vehicle did. On the other hand, would I have been invigorated by the exo-skeleton - fulfilling that ""Terminator"" quotient? Or would the fatal injury of Damon's character fulfill that ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" quotient?<br/><br/>-major spoiler ahead<br/><br/>Or would I have been satisfied with the magic computer code saving the day - fulfilling that ""Independence Day"" quotient? <br/><br/>-major spoiler finished <br/><br/>In the end I was thankful that the busy pacing got us through to the resolution in a 1 hour 49 minute runtime. It's just too bad that the theme of dystopian sci-fi has cluttered the 2013 movie calendar. It is hard to tell how this film would have stood out, especially with less of fulfilling Hollywood cliché quotas and less of that wailing woman."

","What will happen to the Earth if we are unable or unwilling to stop environmental mismanagement, overpopulation, massive illegal immigration, and the erosion of the middle class? Things would just get worse and worse until, in about 150 years or so, we would have a seriously contaminated, overpopulated and borderless planet. Society would be divided into the very poor and the very rich, and the poor would live in vast urban slums. Imagine a Los Angeles that looks like the slums of Jakarta or Cairo. It's not so unimaginable.<br/><br/>But of course the very rich would escape. They would use their billions and their advanced technology to create the ultimate gated community, perhaps even a massive space station from which they could continue to run their exploitative enterprises, and yet live in comfort away from the squalor. <br/><br/>They would develop the medical technology to cure any illness and prolong life, but this could not be shared with the teeming masses. (In America at least.) <br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp (District 9) shows us this dystopic future in ""Elysium"", a science-fiction action film. The story revolves around a lowly worker (played by Matt Damon) who, after suffering an deadly accident, stumbles across a way of changing his situation -- and the world's. He's a tough and determined ex-con with a good heart. Will he succeed? <br/><br/>I enjoyed this highly visual movie, although its bleak portrayal of the future was at times a little depressing and frustrating. Blomkamp, a promising young filmmaker, has succeeded admirably in bringing his grand vision to the screen. The special effects are excellent.<br/><br/>At times I found the film unexpectedly moving.<br/><br/>Some of the basic premises underlying the vision seemed not to have been properly thought out (or at least are not explained in the movie). I kept asking myself questions. Also, some of the characters were over the top. I'm not sure what was wrong here, but the writing may have been a little weak.<br/><br/>Viewers who are quick to suspend disbelief will enjoy this movie the most. Science fiction fans and future technology junkies will enjoy it immensely. Judging by the reviews here on IMDb, if you're a right-wing American actively fighting in the culture wars, you won't enjoy this film. So save yourself the heartache, and save us the post-movie rant: don't go."
"ottokeaton","5","1","2","18 August 2013"," Half-assed effort from a great director.
","After District 9, I don't think my expectations were too high.The second film entry from South African director Neil Blomkap fell short in so many ways that it will be difficult to list them all here.<br/><br/>First of all, to give credit where credit is due, Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley really carry this movie. Their performance becomes even more admirable when you consider the lackluster script they had to work with. Damon's performance in and of itself may have been impressive, but his character was so poorly designed that it couldn't have been executed well by Daniel-Day Lewis. For instance, near the beginning of the film there's an exchange between Damon and a robotic police officer, during which Damon is sarcastic with the robot. It's within the first 30 minutes of the movie, so his behavior is supposed to give us exposition as to how his character acts. For the rest of the movie, we see NONE of that from him. Granted, he plays every angle of his character well, but from an outside standpoint it's just unbelievable and poorly designed. <br/><br/>Sharlto Copley's character was the strongest by far, and he was menacing and threatening at times, but there's not much you can do with ""is that the best you've got?!"", and ""COME ON"". Jodie Foster delivered some of the worst acting from an academy award winning person I've ever seen. Overdone and entirely unbelievable, saying things you'd expect from your 10 year old daughter playing princess and bossing her subjects around or having a tea party with her stuffed animals. Although this could be accredited to the over the top simplistic writing style, (take for example William Fichtner's ""ew, don't touch me. Don't breathe on me"" line), Jodie Foster could have put more heart into it, or at least acted like an adult. She was more annoying than dislike-able, and I found myself wishing she would just go away somehow. That goes for everyone in this movie. Blomkap tried so hard to strike a nerve with the audience, but to do that you have to have memorable characters who you can sympathize with and whose pain you can feel. When at the end of the movie Damon's character died, I just didn't care. The little girl could have died before she made it to the healing bed, I still wouldn't have cared. This movie is essential liberal propaganda, and it's not hard to see the message the director is trying to portray. Although I agree with the directors opinions, I feel he'd be better suited to be a politician after watching this half-assed attempt.This was a wasted opportunity and a disappointment, but at least I'll be ready for a letdown next time a Blomkap movie hits theaters."

Certain areas of the movie were dumb and didn't make sense (I don't want to list which parts to prevent any spoilers). The Trailer was also misleading as it made me believe that Matt Damon's Character had more action in him but in the movie it fluctuates. In the end it's the main message of the movie that stands out.

Although this was a Sy-fy, and enjoy them, there were many loopholes in the story that annoyed me. For example, Max is dying from radiation but with the exoskeleton he becomes mega-strong, really? Secondly, Max denying the plea of help from dying Matilda was not believable. Lastly, no one attempted to blow up other shuttles leaving Earth to go to Elysium was attempted before the CEO left in the movie, really? Lame.<br/><br/>Watching this movie on IMAX was unreal. The special effects were fantastic and watching it on a 6-story screen in an IMAX theater made it extra-special! On a regular screen, this would not be nearly as good. The sound editing was phenomenal and again IMAX made it wonderful.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's ridiculous accent in the movie made me laugh. No one thought to over ride the security system to Elysium before Max's attempt before?

I would give this movie a rating of 6 if I saw on a regular movie theater."

","I went into this movie with high hopes. I am a fan of Matt Damon and Jodie Foster (who I consider one of the true stars of our generation) and I liked District 9. I was severely let down. I found Damon's portrayal flat and his character's change of heart at the end of the movie unlikely, given the way he is portrayed during the movie. I assume we were supposed to see him change over time from being totally self- centered to someone willing to sacrifice himself for others, and maybe there was footage that would have shown this, but was cut to make room for unnecessary gore, such as his surgery to install the data chip and exoskeleton. <br/><br/>Even more disappointing for me was Ms. Foster's performance. I find myself agreeing with a movie critic (a very rare occurrence) that as a compassionate liberal, she found it hard to play a cold, reactionary whose only concern was keeping her world perfect and clean. Her character came across to me as a stereotype caricature of an uncaring, ultra-conservative warmonger. <br/><br/>In the end, I wish I had not spent the money to see this movie in the theater, and recommend that people wait for this to come out on the small screen to see it."
"jadepietro","6","1","2","14 August 2013"," Paradise Lost
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>Elysium, the latest sci-fi thriller, purports yet another fatalistic view of our future. It's an intelligent but unexciting movie that showcases all of the elements of sci-fi genre with an undercurrent of social relevance. The film deals with more complex political issues, a subject very close to its director's mindset. Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has directed this fantasy action film with enough flash and strong imagery to disguise his overt messages about class warfare, injustice, immigration, and prejudice. It's still drips of deeper themes like apartheid, inequality, and discrimination, although the racial implications have been slightly altered to conform more to socio-economic issues. <br/><br/>The year is 2054 and it's still them versus us, as the film depicts two different worlds and class structure. There's the luxurious resort space station called Elysium where the rich can cavort in the extravagant lifestyle with which they are accustomed and only the wealthy are the welcome 1%. In sharp contrast, there's Earth, a slum-ridden hellhole for the mere common folk.<br/><br/>Up on Elysium, everything is running quite smoothly, with Jessica Delacourt, a high-ranking governmental official, in charge. Played by Jody Foster, Dalacourt is all evil and greed. It's a one-note role, but Foster does put a spin on this stereotype every now and then.<br/><br/>Down on Earth, everything is a mess, with Max DeCosta, an ex-con and laborer, trying to survive. Played by Matt Damon, DeCosta is all good and courageous. It's a one note role, but Damon does put a spin on this stereotype every now and then too.<br/><br/>Of course, both will clash as Max attempts to land on Elysium to try to make matters right, (I will not go into the details of the complex plotting, the illogical circumstances that bring Max to meet his fate, or spoil any surprises except to say that Damon looks good as the anti-hero, with or without his exoskeleton attached.)<br/><br/>Blomkamp keeps all the action and CGI in motion, although his tendency to overuse hand- held camera-work ruins much of the physical fight sequences. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, has a strong visual point of view that elevates the melodramatic moments, of which there are many. The turn of events lack genuine suspense and the final outcome is very predictable, more the fault of the screenplay than the direction.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's casting of the supporting characters brings mixed results, although those secondary characters are far more interesting and developed than the two lead roles. Alice Braga, Wagner Moura, and Diego Luna are fine in their roles. However, there is a major misstep in casting with Sharlo Copley as Kruger, a mercenary who tends to kill the English language more eagerly than his intended targets. The actor's overwrought performance with his thick accent and poor diction undercuts most of the menace needed for this pivotal role. As for the leads, Foster, who looks fabulous, seems to be channeling Tilda Swinton with her ice princess imitation and Damon plays Max with a minimum of success.<br/><br/>Elysium effectively shows us a grave new world and while Bromkamp's film is a thought- provoking fantasy, the film ultimately made me think about nirvana and other more heavenly travel destinations, like exiting the theater.

"intelliplay","8","3","12","9 August 2013"," A great second effort but could have been much better
","After his refreshing debut, ""District 9"", it was only a matter of time before Neill Blomkamp helmed another great story. ""Elysium"" is original and well-crafted. Keep it up young auteur. Now some highly-needed criticisms:<br/><br/>1) Lose that {uckin shaky camera business! It jars the audience from the excellent world which you have obviously laboriously created. If a member of your audience somehow is crazy enough to feel inclined to have the screen shake, let him bob his own head askance, in juxtaposition to that canvas on which the story unfolds. The rest of us can peacefully enjoy the visual feast without any distractions. Why all these modern directors feel they must shake their cameras so kinetically is beyond me. It probably illustrates how humans are merely good at being copycats even when what they are copying has no merit at all. I call it the 'silly but mammoth momentum of societal-pressure'.<br/><br/>2) Consider an alternative means of confrontation besides the perennial 'ear-roaring fight or car chase' between your protagonist and antagonist in the final act. It seems like most of these Hollywood movies are being made to some formula: no matter the story, the final act must have that 'ear-roaring fight or car chase'. It is so boring! Not to mention so foolish! Here is an idea: make it more realistic and have your protagonist use his brains to outwit his foe. In real life, if his existence were really that threatened, that is what he would invariably do. For unlike a video game, you do not get a second life in real life after you have been killed. Naturally, this has the sensible effect of making all humans hesitant, careful and conservative about engaging their foes. So make it realistic, or barring that, at least plausible, by having the protagonist outwit using more of his brains than attempting to subdue with mere brawn. And do so without breaking the cardinal rule of story-telling. For the cardinal rule of story- telling is, ""tell the story with such verisimilitude and such steadiness of hand that your audience is completely immersed; no longer are they then just listening to a story but rather living those chain of events themselves."" We are story- telling creatures whom themselves are constituted of stories after all. Remember that!<br/><br/>3) Focus more on your characters, their motivations, etc. In other words, more characterizations, and dramatizations and less, 'let's just pile on the action!'. It is the well-presented character that would organically lead to 'action' if his or her situation demands it. And let the camera linger, dammit! The audience is a voyeur. Or have you forgotten that one too?<br/><br/>For an example of how a master director after creating a world, is comfortable enough with his craft to let the camera slowly linger in it, all the more to immerse his audience, even as the plot builds and heightens to 'action', check out ""Sanjuro"" directed by Akira Kurosawa, 1962."

","Elysium could have been a great movie, but it doesn't have an ounce of sense to it.<br/><br/>The effects were very good. The robots looked real, Elysium itself was pretty to look at. Overall, nothing bad at all.<br/><br/>The acting was uniformly good. Even Copely. I really don't know why he gets crap over his performance here. The only one that falters in any way is Jodie Foster with that accent that she can't seem to nail down properly.<br/><br/>The big problem with Elysium is just the incredible stupidity of the story. I won't go into great detail as it's already been done in other posts and reviews, but there are so many unanswered questions and plot holes. Why is the healing bed only available on Elysium? We're never given any reason or purpose for withholding that technology from those on earth. Even if the mega-rich did obtain that tech and segregated themselves into an orbital gated community, we're supposed to believe that they would not allow the poor on earth access to that tech as well, just because? What purpose is there to keeping the poor on earth poor? The rich have their Eden and it's near completely inaccessible to those on earth. Why would they care what goes on down there? The only industry shown was involved in military hardware, so Elysium is obviously not dependent on the poor on earth for its survival. The only reason for the military hardware it sounded like was to keep the poor in line. But why? If the poor had better lives, they wouldn't keep trying to get into Elysium and Elysium wouldn't need the military hardware. It just doesn't make any sense. Also, they have robots capable of mimicking humans. Why wouldn't robots be doing most of the jobs? Why was it needed for Damon to do that job and then get irradiated? THERE ARE ROBOTS! Robots are expensive, yes. But robots could build robots. Robots could mine and create the materials for more robots. As more robots are built for menial or physical labor, costs would plummet because robots don't need a paycheck! Those are just two of many issues (including race/immigration politics) that seem like they were conceptualized by five-year-olds.<br/><br/>With all the story problems, it's evident that this film's purpose is simply to promote class and race warfare. It's so ill thought through that it was either written by idiots or it's that they think their viewers are idiots. I suspect it's a little of both, actually. Blomkamp's District 9 politics, while still obvious, were much less in-your-face and therefore didn't detract much from the entertainment value. It seems he at least had some understanding that others might not agree with him and so kept it relatively toned down. But it must have gone to his head with this one and he conflates success with agreement and so is unrestrained. Matt Damon on the other hand is a leftist tool and has demonstrated an incapacity to think through the idiocy he spouts to its logical conclusion.<br/><br/>Blomkamp is 1 and 1. I'm willing to give him a third try. Matt Damon is a lost cause and I won't pay theater money to see a movie with him as the star. Elysium has some nice images and a couple decent action scenes. The story is irredeemably asinine and childish."

","I'm so terribly sorry-or should I say angry?-to go to watch a supposed sci-fi or whatever movie and end up with this!Why? Because it cries out:I have a meaning to deliver.Because it does so in the most simplistic possible way and doesn't even care for some script plausibility that seems rather too much to ask for(many great movies of the genre lack seriousness in the plot and the dialogues but they turn this weakness into appeal).Because it thinks it is clever when it is melodramatic and silly, boring, and follows the rules of blockbustering with no visual charm(apart from the city-from-above-pictures) and with no directional authenticity(I 'm sick of watching movies directed in exactly the same way).I wonder why the director has chosen this genre(it's his second movie,as far as I know), instead of being honest about it and go for the Ken Loach themes.Anyway, to wipe out the effects of the film, I went home and watched on DVD Mad Max II, which I had seen many years ago.

"nokkenbuer","7","2","7","10 August 2013"," A Potentially Controversial Science-Fiction Movie
","The film was generally fantastic and intriguing with an original plot and adequate acting. If you're interested in more information on these aspects of the film, I recommend reading the other reviews. This review will be addressing some of the underlying concepts and implications I noticed:<br/><br/>Early into the film, I noticed multiple implications within the film that could easily be interpreted as controversial. For example, there seemed to have been some potentially race-based implications within the film. Although this may simply be due to the fact that the setting on Earth was Los Angeles, CA, the vast majority of people represented as living in poverty on Earth were of Hispanic or Latino origin. Moreover, those living on Elysium and the rich on Earth were almost exclusively white or Caucasian. While I do not say this is necessarily inaccurate or problematic, this could definitely be considered offensive to some or racially-suggestive to those who focus on or discriminate against race and/or ethnicity.<br/><br/>Secondly and along this line of thought, I noticed how the majority of people on Earth were, like I said, of Hispanic or Latino origin. I am curious as to what the director and writers intended with this. Some people may find this to be suggestive of immigration problems, or that the writers meant to portray how ethnic and racial demographics may be if the estimates about ethnic-based population statistics are true.<br/><br/>Whether the director and writers meant to be as accurate as they can be with their portrayal of an impoverished, futuristic Earth, or if they intended to make this film politically charged, I cannot say. I can say, however, that this film was interesting and that there are undoubtedly some politically controversial issues implied within the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the film and would watch it again if it came on television. The graphics were great and the plot was amazing. If you want to watch an awesome movie, watch Elysium."
"loryjeanbaptiste","9","3","13","9 August 2013"," Sci-fi action with a soul
","A lot of reviewers complain that this movie's message is heavy-handed. Yet they still miss the message. The message of this movie is more about the plight of illegal aliens. The security agency on Elysium is even called Homeland Security. You have poor people desperately trying to sneak into Elysium with fake citizenship. The message of the movie is that we living in American and Europe live in Elysium and we don't give a damn about the people starving and dying in the third world. We're more concerned with keeping them out.<br/><br/>That's the message and it comes in an amazingly well done sci-fi action movie package. No one can claim that this movie is preachy because IT's AN ACTION MOVIE. The action pacing is non-stop. It has no pauses or lulls. It's extremely difficult to make a movie that is so well paced.

"jaguiar313","7","3","13","9 August 2013"," Flawed but entertaining new film from District 9's Neil Blomkamp.
","As a huge fan of writer/ director Neil Blomkamp's District 9, I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Now after a 4 year wait, his sophomore flick Elysium has arrived. I liked Elysium. I was certainly entertained but, it does have some problems that keep it from reaching the standard set by District 9 such as, a bit of an overloaded story and some surprising overacting by a few principles. Elysium tells the story of the future Earth of 2154. The planet is overpopulated and ravaged and the rich and powerful have moved off planet to the enormous space station of Elysium where they have every convenience and luxury, while the rest are left to labor and wallow in the mess. Enter ex-con Max, (Matt Damon) a man trying to work hard and stay out of trouble and prison, while dreaming of reconnecting with childhood sweetheart, Frey (Alice Braga). An accident at work leaves Max fatally poisoned with radiation and with 5 days left to live, Max needs to get to the only place where he can be cured, Elysium which is off limits to the poor inhabitants of Earth. Max turns to crime-lord and hacker, Spider (Wagner Moura). Spider will get Max on Elysium if he helps steal the information about all it's access codes stored in the brain of one, John Carlyle (William Fichtner) who, unknown to Max and Spider, is working with Elysium Secretary Of Defense, Delacourt (a surprisingly miscast Jodie Foster) to overthrow Elysium's president (Faran Tahir). Still with me? Needless to say Max now has information that Delacourt will kill to get and is being hunted by her henchman, Kruger (Sharlto Copley) all the while trying to find his way to Elysium to heal himself. Throw in strength enhancing exo-skeletons, Frey's sick daughter and we have a Sci-Fi action soup with a lot of ingredients. Elysium does have a bit of an overcomplicated story and while it is not hard to follow, it just has a lot of elements to it as, once again, Blomkamp tackles the theme of 'the haves and the have-nots, as he did in District 9. We get the contrast of the over populated slum Earth has become to the spotless and perfect living conditions the wealthy enjoy in Elysium which, floats above in Earth's orbit as a constant reminder of how little we all are to them and how they are so above us. The message is not subtle but, Blomkamp skillfully keeps it from overwhelming things with so much else going on. There is a lot of fast paced action and with a complex story as we have, the director keeps things moving very quickly. The excess of plot doesn't slow things down though one feels it might have served the film if things were streamlined a little bit and there weren't quite so many players in the game. And as for the players, Damon and Braga are strong though Braga's Frey really doesn't get that much screen time till the last act so we don't identify with her as much even though we do get treated to flashbacks of she and Max as kids in an orphanage. Damon proves once again he can be an action star yet with some nice depth, giving Max some layers that enhances his character much like his surgically attached exo-skeleton enhances his strength and agility. Sadly it's veteran actress Foster who seems to be miscast here. She never quite strays into camp but, plays Delacourt like one half stereotypical bureaucratic douche and the other half Roger Moore era Bond villain complete with unidentifiable accent. It sticks out awkwardly in what is a serious Sci-Fi flick as does District 9 star Sharlto Copley, who is completely over the top as Kruger. Which is disappointing consider how good he was in D9. A calmer demeanor would have made him more threatening. Neither characterization seems to fit in with the more grounded performances of the leads and more serious tone of the film. Joining them is Wagner Moura who is just weak and tries to compensate by over doing it as Spider. An actor with a bit stronger presence who doesn't need to try as hard would have worked better. But, there is still plenty to like about this film. It's story may be complicated but, there is a lot of action to move it along and some delightfully gruesome moments splattered here and there as this future's weapons do make a mess. The last act especially is quite thrilling and has a nice emotional impact to go with all the explosions, gunfire and mechanically enhanced hand to hand combat. The SPFX are flawless, the design is breathtaking and the film could easily take place in District 9′s world. The score by Ryan Amon suits the film well, though reminded me of Dark Knight Rises a bit, but, that's not necessarily a bad thing. So, all in all I liked Elysium and recommend it especially if you enjoyed District 9. It's a bit meatier then most summer fair so, those who are tired of moody superheroes might like being given a bit more to chew on. Just be prepared that there is a complex story to digest along with the action and that a few of the veteran cast members just don't seem right for their roles. Entertaining despite it's flaws and another strong role from the versatile Damon."

","I can already see reactions to Elysium breaking down along predictable lines. Movie reviewers who don't like sci-fi anyway are calling it the worst movie of the year, and so on.<br/><br/>Well, here is my measured defense of Elysium. I certainly don't think it's the best movie of the year. Far from it. It was at times marred by what I think was too much gore, when it could have been deeper, more meaningfully dramatic violence. The dialogue was too hard to understand at key moments. I don't think it will have mass appeal, although by good word of mouth it could still get a decent box office draw. If it had had some of the improvements that someone like Ridley Scott might have given it, it would have been closer to a latter-day Blade Runner, and a top movie of the year all around.<br/><br/>However, what I very much liked about this film is that it led with its idea, and the idea is a very valuable one for modern moviegoers.<br/><br/>In a world increasingly filled with films that try to be too clever by half, Elysium has a somewhat clumsy delivery but a powerful message. It seems hokey at first only in the way that seeing the way the founding fathers dressed and spoke seems a little hokey when you visit Washington DC. But when you probe a little further, you see that the story of Max Da Costa is one that is already here in a lot of ways. The illegal immigration struggle, the prison complex, the government both corrupt and seemingly impervious to the old-time checks and balances. Sure, the ending has to be tidy for this action movie to work, but for people who are willing to watch it with an open mind, it has a lot to say. And I'm sure you can spare two hours for it if you're only going to watch the Kardashians or Real Housewives or UFC anyway that night. Ask yourself honestly if the world of Elysium is different in kind, or only in degree."
"Desertman84","9","2","9","12 August 2013"," A Parable Of the Have Vs. Have Nots
","Elysium is science fiction that takes place on both a ravaged Earth and a luxurious space habitat called Elysium. It explores political and sociological themes such as immigration, health care and class issues. It stars Matt Damon and Jodie Foster; and it was written, co-produced and directed by Neill Blomkamp.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the mid-22nd century particularly in 2154. An overpopulated, polluted Earth has been abandoned by its wealthiest citizens for Elysium, a Stanford torus space station paradise. Those who remain on the planet are manual laborers, criminals, and those struggling to make a living while looking up in the sky with envy where advanced medical care is available for all, the lawns are immaculately groomed, and there's no crime whatsoever. Its opening moments dramatize this with a series of captivating visuals contrasting the cramped, grimy environment of Los Angeles which does not compared the beauty of Elysium. <br/><br/>Max DeCosta is an ex-car thief who has gone straight. On parole, he has left behind his old life and gotten a regular job. After a workplace accident, Max finds himself having a terminal illness. He has five days to live unless he discovers a way to get to Elysium and gain access to its advanced medical facilities. Under normal circumstances, this would doable but Secretary of Defense Delacourt is organizing a coup with the help of billionaire John Carlyle.It potentially destabilizes the political system and putting Elysium in a state of high alert. Plus, Max doesn't have the money necessary to buy passage on an illegal shuttle so he is forced to agree to go on a dangerous mission which it to kidnap the billionaire. The task is made more challenging by the arrival of Delacourt's unbalanced ""operative,"" Kruger.<br/><br/>Elysium is a parable between the Haves vs. Have Nots. Also,it is a visual spectacle which is a testament to Blomkamp's extraordinary skill as a visual filmmaker. Inspite of its opening interesting premise,the story becomes somewhat clichéd and predictable as it comes into the conclusion.Also,it goes overboard with loud, jerky, repetitive action sequences.Also,the inevitable climactic square off between Max and Kruger as slips into the Hollywood generic.This film had a great potential to become a great film but unfortunately with the stated reasons above it just manages to be entertaining and satisfying. But nevertheless,this summer movie sci-fi is easily the best thing out there right now for it is thrilling and exciting."

","Brilliant and awful all at once. Some of the most beautiful and inspiring visuals in a movie and some of the most crass character arcs ever. Abusive exploitation of the kiddie factor... any child in the movie was predictably imperilled and miraculously healed, incidentally along with the whole of the planet, but not for one moment did anyone appear to be having a tough time on the way to the miracle.
The whole movie is targetted so viscerally it numbs.. a kind of cinematic chemo-therapy. The volence is ultra-violent, the poverty is ubiquitously third world and the wealth is the ultimate gated community chic.
It is the middle that gives perspective... the middle ground that shows whether life is good or bad, flipping from extreme to extreme leaves an empty centre that makes what could have been a poignant, hard hitting message look like scrawled handwriting on an empty golden envelope.
Unsatisfying though it is i still enjoyed it on other levels... mostly looking for the cracks in the veneer and the peeling paint of the gloss. The actors all do well, but you can't save a poor script with good acting."

Although the acting is pretty good and the casting is very well put together the script is weak & the writers really struggled on telling a story here, which is unfortunate because it is actually a great concept, I think this could've been the next big blockbuster if only they have had better writers.

","Neil Blomkamp's follow up to District 9 is another science fiction/action hybrid that contains social commentary aplenty. District 9 was praised (or condemned by the right wing) as being a statement against Apartheid-like policies still being practiced in the world by countries like Israel. Elysium rattled the cages of the right wing media when it came out (Limbaugh ordered his listeners to boycott the movie and Matt Damon). The science ""eventuality"" in this movie must have hit too close to home. A not-so-distant Earth, basically destroyed by nuclear  and global warming, where the lower 98% lives and works in jobs that serve the top 2%? This is not an unlikely scenario in a nation where we have greedy narcissistic failed businessmen and Evangelical science-denying crazies controlling the Government.
The top 2% have evacuated the planet to live in a deluxe space station that looks upon a dying planet. Again, not hard to believe - especially given the recent news about the elite planning to colonize both the moon and Mars.
The action in the film concerns the plight of the disenfranchised to get to Elysium in order to use their high tech medical device that cures all types of cancer (a device only for the top 2%, of course). A psychopathic agent of the space station on Earth is called into action to stop them, especially the radiation-infected former worker played by Damon who leads the group.
Sharlto Copley plays the deranged Earth-based protector of Elysium and it is a truly frightening performance. He is all-out insane and provided with all weaponry needed to stop the heroes. Copley also played the hero of District 9 and his transformation into a Van Demme-esque physical presence with no morals and a psychotic urge to not only eliminate Damon and co., but also take over Elysium with this goons, creates one of the best action film villains of the decade.
Great entertainment, whether you watch it for action escapism, its social commentary, or both."

They have the means to cure everyone but randomly choose not to, although I suppose the world is described as being overpopulated in the initial screen shots do maybe that's why. They clearly do still have power and technology and the means to cope so again not really the apocalypse. I thought the acting was poor and find Damon is really hot and miss.

","Elysium is a decent movie, but it could have been much better. Elysium is directed by Neill Blomkamp, the same person who directed District 9. I personally thought that Elysium was a bit of a step down from District 9. It has great effects, good action, and a great main villain. However, the characters besides the villain I thought were a bit bland and the acting felt phoned in sometimes. Plus I did not find the film very enjoyable, at least until the final act.<br/><br/>The effects for the film are great. The effects here are on par with District 9. The film has a very similar look to it as District 9, which is not surprising since it is the same director. I like all the technology employed here. The action scenes are good particularly the fight between Matt Damon's character and the villain played by Sharlto Copley. The score was decent as well.
The villain, Kruger, is a great villain. Sharlto Copley proves that he has great range as an actor. He seemed like one of the only characters that had any energy or passion. He is definitely the best part of the film.<br/><br/>However, the film has many issues. The main characters, sad to say, were not very memorable. Matt Damon is okay in the role. However, the problem is that he is just okay. There is nothing that stands out in his performance, and there is no energy to it a lot of the time. I think that anybody could have played Damon's role. His character is more realistic and I did buy his plight, but I just did not find him very engaging. Alice Braga and the little girl were quite bland as well.<br/><br/>Jody Foster plays the secondary villain of the movie. Foster does fin performance wise but I found her character very one-dimensional. She is not even a very fun villain like Copley is in this. William Fichtner is also in the film. However, he really has a nothing role and his character gets killed halfway through the film. He is basically just a plot device. Any actor could have that role.<br/><br/>Another big issue I have with the film is the obvious message. This film tries to hammer home the message of ""don't pollute the environment."" It is a good but, like with Avatar, we have seen this message being conveyed in tons of other movies. I do not mind films having big messages, but I'd wish they would find a new way of telling it. I've seen the same message conveyed better in films like Wall-E, which is very similar to Elysium.<br/><br/>On top of all that the film is not that enjoyable to watch, in my opinion. It is not a bad film. It is actually a pretty decent movie. However, it is not a film I would re-watch. I have the same problem with District 9. District 9 is a good movie, but it is not something I would watch again. I think it mostly has to do with the look of the look of both films. Both movies have a very bleak and dirty look to them. The world that is depicted in these two films is not very fun to look at. I understand that that was the point, but I still do not care for the look of these films. It is too depressing for my taste.<br/><br/>Overall, Elysium is a decent film and is worth at least one viewing. I also think it is worth seeing in theatres if you have the chance, but I would see at matinee price."

Once I could see that the story was not in good hands, I lost interest. <br/><br/>The characters were annoying by and large, particularly Kruger. Matt Damon brought a good performance as always, but I am disappointed that he chose to attach himself to a script this bad. But his talent was wasted along with that of all of the well-known actors here. Even worse, there was very inconsistent conflict between them. The whole subplot of Carlyle's power struggle against Delacourt probably should have been left out because it bogged the plot down and didn't need to be there. I found that the movie was better to watch when nobody was talking. There was even a scene where Max was debating with his friends about how to get to Elysium where one of his friends urges Max to go to Elysium, and then a few seconds later is telling him not to because it will never work.<br/><br/>On top of that, the dystopian world that had been created felt like the most basic textbook dystopian society ever and was very forced. The way that the citizens of Elysium treated those on earth with disdain felt too extreme to be real and took me out of the movie whenever it came up. This mostly came up with Willam Fichtner's character John Carlyle. The revolution that ends up taking place at the end of the movie also didn't make that much sense. Yes, I understand that all of the people living on earth want those on Elysium to share their wealth, but the fashion in which they did this would probably just result in chaos instead of equality. I think it might have been better if the story had stuck more with Max helping Matilda and Frey get to Elysium. <br/><br/>The good action choreography made it tolerable to watch, but I didn't find that it was of a quality that sufficiently accounts for the cult following around Neil Blomkamp. I will admit that he has a talent for explosive action and cool set designs, but it was not enough to save the extremely lacking story of this movie. The action is good enough that I would recommend this to people who like explosive and futuristic action set pieces. To anyone else, I would advise that you find something else to watch. Overall Rating: 4.6/10."

","Whenever a film has obvious political overtones, the plot suffers because the writers and actors develop a kind of emotional and creative rigor mortis. Spoiler alert: I must summarize the plot to explain my position. The draft written up is this: Evil white male elites are so separated from humanity, they must live in a space station. Everyone there is white and evil except for an Indian president. The hero, Matt Damon though, is white (of course) because Hollywood leftists, also white, don't want to view themselves as entirely bad and this film won't sell to ignorant action movie audiences if the hero isn't white. This is probably what was said over the initial screenplay writing table.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster needs to be believable as an evil white woman security director but she can't humanize the role (since she has no empathy with it) so it falls flat. Bad acting. She should have taken lessons from Sir Anthony Hopkins who humanized Hannibal. Other apartheid villains are also stereotypical due to limited emotional ability for the actors or writers to see past their ideological blinders. The droids seemed to have more emotion than the bad guys who just couldn't read their horrible lines (as they saw them.) Compare and contrast to Archie Bunker who was portrayed by a leftist. Carol O'Conner humanized a working class bigot into a national icon.<br/><br/>It's hilarious that the film is so PC, that the evil guys have to stop ""undocumented"" flights from entering their airspace. Why not say ""unauthorized?"" They want to make the point: The evil future world is run by Republicans who use leftist terminology! <br/><br/>Others have pointed out the numerous plot holes and logical inconsistencies that just don't work. Like a computer program determining whose ""citizens"" (sort of Logan's Run there) and also, storing stuff in people's brains? Ever hear of Johnny Mnemonic?<br/><br/>(Side observations: The cybernetic implants for Damon and others went over their clothes including bolted in. How do these guys change their underwear? Do they have to painfully bolt out of these outfits?)<br/><br/>The actors and writers didn't consider that this future revealed the nihilism of their own politics: After a world becomes overpopulated and the USA's borders are wide open, instead of Swedish paradise for all, the white elite would just go up into space (with an Indian president, of course) and continue to oppress everyone. There is no end to white privilege. Ever. How long would Elysium last as a Malibu paradise after a million shuttles land and make it into East L.A.? Is Jodie Foster opening up HER mansion doors to the great unwashed? (Funny google: I looked it up and she does have an actual mansion and values her ""privacy"". I guess she'll probably reserve her slot on Elysium in advance!)<br/><br/>For that reason, and that reason alone, I give this 6 stars. Savor the limousine liberal hypocrisy like a fine wine."

","Elysium, as pointed out by the majority of previous reviewers, has pretty good CGI, but that's about the only thing going for it.

I still hated it, though.<br/><br/>Elysium is clearly intended to feel like a high-budget Hollywood blockbuster, and it does. But all the CGI cannot distract one from the paper-thin plot, one-dimensional characters, and totally unrealistic story-line... and, of course, the abundance of plot holes.<br/><br/>You'd think that, with such a star-studded cast, the movie couldn't go wrong. Well, the acting was really below average. Jodie Foster was awful.

Do I have to explain why? That would mean spending far more time than intended on this review, which is not something I'm interested in doing.<br/><br/>The bottom line: I didn't like it. Will *you*?

","I thought that it would be impossible to make a sci-fi movie worse than Event Horizon, but was sadly mistaken. The movie works on the most far fetched premise, that somehow in the midst of gross overpopulation and environmental destruction, an immense orbiting habitat was created for the rich and famous, while the rest of the planet's population lived in abject poverty and sought ways to escape to this orbiting Elysium. How all the world's rich and powerful were able to pull off this feat, somehow intimidating billions while getting their incredible habitat created is left to one's imagination. There is hardly an original idea here, as regards the age old tensions between rich and poor, just a politically correct mish-mash to titillate viewers looking for cheap thrills. The writer/director of this farce, Neill Blomkamp, stated after its completion "" I feel like I f----d it up, I feel like ultimately the story is not the right story."" Well, at least he got that right. Oh, and did I forget to mention, the residents of Elysium are overwhelmingly white and the ""illegals"" trying to get in overwhelmingly Hispanic? The astronomical economic rise of China and India are conveniently left out of the equation, as is the preponderance of enormous gaps between economic classes in Latin America. Check out Oblivion or Europa Report if in need of some recent, satisfying, original Sci-fi; you won't be disappointed."
"trevor-mcinsley","6","1","3","1 September 2014"," An alright film based around a totally illogical plot line
","The central theme around this film seems to be that the illegal immigrants from Earth are trying to get to Elysium not to live there but simply to get cured in one of their magical medical pods. Naturally the notion of them trying to live there would be absurd because they are all dressed in rags, covered in filth, have no home or money and wouldn't be recognised by any of the locals. The equivalent would be someone crossing the Mexican-American border and then heading straight to a gated community in Beverly Hills without so much as dusting down their jeans... they are going to stand out.<br/><br/>The people on Elysium would have to know this. Therefore it seems that they could cut down on the illegal influx and the crime that it creates 100% by simply not hogging all the magical medical machines. I mean if they said they were alien technology or required a one million dollar fission coil per use then it would make sense.<br/><br/>Instead they seem to be so commonplace and cheap to run that every single household has one. Just how many life threatening illnesses and injuries do the people of Elysium pick up every single day? Given that it cures you in less than a minute you think each town would just need one of the things. Maybe two in cold season. It vaguely mentions that people on Elysium do not age and so the assumption is that the pod keeps you young through daily use. Why then the entire business and political elite of Elysium are played by actors and actresses in their fifties is a mystery.<br/><br/>Ultimately it seems that if they just stuck a couple of these magical machines on Earth people would stop trying to get to Elysium in the first place and they would just keep to themselves. It would be in the best interests of the citizens to pay for them to be built on Earth. Instead everyone on Elysium seem to be the direct descendants of Nazis. I mean if the CEO of the robot building company just had one of the damn things in the factory to treat work related injuries (like lethal radiation exposure) it would increase productivity dramatically and there would be no more sick leave. Whatshisface wouldn't have needed to even go to the hospital for his broken arm then and would have been at work sooner. Yes the assumption is that labour is very cheap and inexhaustible but they must have skilled labourers which it would be easier to heal than replace and retrain. Then again why the workforce is even human to begin with when they have so many robots to hand is also a mystery.<br/><br/>There is no logical reason to withhold the technology other than for the purposes of evil. Wanting to live a luxury life with a clean atmosphere is fine but are they only happy so long as Earth is filled with untold suffering and misery? The really baffling bit occurs towards the end when they deploy three enormous medical ships with dozens of these magical medical machines down to Earth at the drop of a hat. Why would a space station in which the nearest medical pod is never going to be more than twenty foot away need a fleet of ships capable of treating a hundred people at a time? The only logical assumption is in case of emergency but just how many hundred car pile ups is this gated community expecting on a daily basis to justify that? A ship with one or two pods on like a rapid response paramedic sure but not something capable of responding to a daily Titanic disaster...<br/><br/>When they reprogram the space station at the end it isn't so that everyone from Earth can come live there but so they can all get access to this rapid cure. Of course if it did prolong your life and reverse aging then this would only be adding to the overpopulation issue but so be it. Oh and whilst we are on the subject of dying...<br/><br/>The medical pod can cure someone with half their head blown off ten minutes after they are dead but if someone gets their throat slit or gets shot in the chest then its game over? What is the point in having enormous medical aid ships and satellites monitoring your heart rate when you don't have a single poxy robot to come pick you up when you bleed out? Also I don't fully comprehend the point of a neurological encryption system that lets you copy the data completely but then kills you afterwards. Or indeed one that paralyses you. Surely it should do this before you attempt to access the data? You can buy a USB stick today which burns the memory chip with explosives if you type in the wrong password three times. It doesn't let you copy all the data and then explode...<br/><br/>The medical pods issue needed explaining better. If there was an expensive running cost after the initial purchase then you could understand them not sharing the tech however it seems to just use electricity. Hell an MRI is a pretty costly piece of machinery but every public hospital still has one. If there is an expensive running cost that uses a lot of power or resources of some kind then letting everyone in the world have a go in one just isn't going to be practical or possible.<br/><br/>Basically either everyone is a Nazi for electricity usage or there physically isn't enough power in the world to heal everyone. Either way it is weak and illogical.<br/><br/>Essentially in order to take this film seriously you basically have to completely ignore the main plot point... and a whole host of other things. That's never a good sign."

","Matt Damon lives in a society that is like a shanty town and jobs are hard to come by. You can tell this when Matt goes to work and he is rather proud of his employment status but he also has a criminal record so when in the opening scenes there is a spot check by the police at a bus stop, he does not comply but jokes about it resulting in a beating, a citation and injury which threatens him to lose his job.<br/><br/>The film very much lost me from that moment on. We then cut to the space station Elysium where people live in a lush lifestyle where the president seems to adhere to some sort of liberal values yet leaves the citizens of earth a wretched existence as the best health care is reserved for Elysium and Jodie Foster is plotting an overthrow. Again a half baked analysis of society, we have little ides what makes the people of Elysium tick. Why does the president care if Foster is merciless as to how she deals with illegal immigrants on rockets when he is responsible for the state of affairs on earth. In fact why will he not send these medical pods to earth yet funds doctors and nurse and hospitals on earth.<br/><br/>Back on earth where its clear this is a police state with a huge underclass and workers are glorified slaves with little health and safety protection, Damon having being exposed to life threatening injuries needs to get to Elysium and join forces with gangsters to get there. <br/><br/>The film had good visuals and set pieces but many expected better from the director of District 9.

","As someone who really enjoyed District 9 with its mix of social commentary and sci-fi, I was quite looking forward to this film but due to the so-so reviews from critics, decided to give it a while and watch it once the dust had settled. I did so recently and have to say that the critics that laid into this film were mostly right to do so because it is a surprisingly weak film across the board. The plot is about the haves (in space) and have-nots (on earth); it is a familiar scenario and of course the have-nots want what they don't have while the haves don't want anyone else to have what they have.<br/><br/>Speaking of haves, just to say what the film does have – it has a very big budget, a very big star and plenty of impressive special effects; so if these are the sole qualities that you are looking for then you'll find much to like here as it ticks these boxes. Unfortunately what the film doesn't have is a great deal of substance to back this up. OK there is stuff in here about immigration and artificial borders drawn in a map but it is really poorly handled with nothing smart to say but just big obvious gestures which really bring nothing (and I say this as a liberal myself). With the subtext mostly just a flapping rag hanging off the film, this should still mean that we get a solid sci-fi action movie but unfortunately this also falls flat. The film has terrible pacing, plot twists and turns that really make no sense at all and generally it doesn't engage.<br/><br/>The sci-fi action is technically impressive (despite feeling like we saw it before in District 9) but with nothing to really engage the viewer it just starts to feel like noise and spectacle for the sake of it – which it kinda is. Damon seems earnest throughout and is OK but he is not as light-footed with this material and it shows. Indeed the whole film shares his rather plodding feel. Foster is wasted, Copley's is a good presence but seems out of step with the rest of the film, Braga is stunning as ever but doesn't have too much else to work with and so it goes on.<br/><br/>It has a lot of things at its resources in terms of star names, special effects and money to spend on both, but unfortunately the plot is leaden, the pacing off, events unconvincing and unengaging and the subtext is really akin to something scribbled on paper with crayons and a smiling sun in the background.

Jodie is one of the ones in charge up there. That's pretty special in itself. The poor, mostly criminal citizens of earth all seem to believe that if they could get to the bicycle wheel things would be fine again, forgetting that the earth is the way it is mostly because of creeps like them, not because of the people who have made things like the bicycle wheel possible.<br/><br/>The script is wooden and trite. Certainly the worst role and acting I've ever seen out of Jodie Foster. (I've mostly liked her in the past. In this she's beyond terrible.)<br/><br/>Matt Damon does as well as can be expected given what he has to do, but this is not the kind of thing I like to see him in. Matt Damon is a brilliant guy. Why do this? He reminds me of Nicholas Cage, a fine actor whose career went down the drain when he started doing junk material. I haven't seen a good movie of his in twenty years.<br/><br/>In this age, computers still speak in subordinate clauses through tinny, echoy speakers to everyone in a 200-yard radius. ""Preparing for departure"" ""Terminating procedure"" ""Initiating B-29 protocol."" ""Warning -- unidentified incoming vehicle"".<br/><br/>Bad guys still can't shoot straight, even the robots who seem to be smarter than humans, but a lot meaner. People still say things like ""Roger, copy that"" into hand-held microphones.<br/><br/>Every sci-fi movie has to have some way of ""overriding"" some invincible technology -- usually by finding a password that someone guesses on only two tries, which displays in plaintext in two-inch letters on a computer screen.<br/><br/>Everyone still swears the same 150 years from now: lots, real loud, and using the same customary words. And if someone doesn't respond to something they say the first time, they say it a lot louder, with a lot more swear words inserted. You'd think in 150 years they'd think of a few new meaningless words.<br/><br/>The fight and action scenes were endlessly protracted. They usually are in movies of this type.<br/><br/>When they download a bunch of valuable information that happens to be stored in Matt Damon's head, they get 50 exabytes of data. Are there 50 exabytes of disk storage in the world right now? Maybe. There sure isn't that much data about anything you'd want to know about. Certainly not stored in Matt Damon's head. Oh, and they're able to download that information in about thirty seconds. Which is good, because in the end Matt Damon's character doesn't need it any more.<br/><br/>In the end, much of the struggle is about getting medical help for a little girl, the daughter of a girl Matt Damon's character grew up with. Then they decided to be close forever, but somehow when we first meet them as adults, that hadn't happened, although they are by no means enemies. As for the little girl, she's certainly medium to not really so adorable, and has no lines, and does nothing but lie down and be sick -- while smiling for the camera. There is no particular reason to care about her any more than any other adorable little sick girl, certainly not enough to risk the future of planet earth to get her medical help.<br/><br/>Minor spoiler follows.<br/><br/>In the end she gets it. Was that really a spoiler? I don't think so. Does earth survive? I'll let you guess about that one.<br/><br/>They can do pretty much anything with CGI now. Problem is not everything is worth doing or seeing.<br/><br/>Somehow I *did* manage to stay awake.<br/><br/>Note that my rating system centers on 7 for starters, and movies have to earn or lose points."
"cookyman11","4","1","3","19 January 2014"," Not that good
","I watched this movie last night and was pretty disappointed. Overall it's a depressing movie, not only in story but also overall execution. Matt Damon is a parolee who is clinging to the only job he can get after a life of being one of the worlds most legendary car thieves. He doesn't seem to have morals until very end of the movie, yet the transformation from a person who only cares about themselves (who tells a little girl with cancer that you can't help?) to someone who is willing to die for humanity, only because he's going to die anyway. There really wasn't much sympathy for his character and I really could've cared less if Kruger got the best of him. Off to Kruger, a pretty enjoyable villain, very creepy and seemed to play the role well. The story overall was pretty ridiculous, from Damon entering a radiation chamber to cling to a horrible job instead of just going back to crime (it's not like there was hope on earth anyway), to Jodie Foster convincing someone smarter than her to make her president in exchange for a military contract, when he could've just made himself president. The one thing I did enjoy was the very well done gore, which was over the top at times but they did a great job with the effects, especially when installing the exosuit and when Krugers face got blown off. Overall, it's nowhere close to as good as District 9. The story and political message the movie sends is odd. It's basically tellin us we should open up our borders and let everyone else on the planet into the United States. That just isn't possible."

","Man, that Jodi Foster is one mean villain! My previous contender was Star Trek into Darkness - also great fun to watch, but I have to give the edge to Elysium. The effects are truly beautiful, and the class exploitation line very satisfying: the protagonist is reminded that he's easily replaced if he screws up, the same line is used to get him to put his life on the line at his job. Issues like immigration and access to health care come up as major plot devices, which I found refreshing. As in District 9, the violence and inhumanity is constant, but it's done differently. In Elysium, heartless acts are perpetrated by humans but also by machines which in fact have no hearts. The screen writers take advantage of this to deliver some juicy black comedy. The 2 movies share the morphing of humans into something new and potentially dangerous, which leaves a lot to the imagination (cripes, can he fly?). What I most enjoyed was Elysium's departure from over-used Hollywood plot devices. First, it's nice to see a genuine coup, in which there's little regard for the good of society. How tiresome the writers might have made the takeover - what if we had been treated to a decision among Elysium residents to opt for authoritarian rule to keep them safe? Or made to watch in disgust as they abdicate their civic duties and let the government run amok so they can keep on their hedonistic lifestyle? Happily, the whole insurrection happens like it should; motive, means and opportunity all line up and the villain just takes charge. The plot holes are numerous (robot hardware can offset the effects of radiation poisoning? Data downloading kills you how, exactly?)... but with such incredible effects and bad bad bad-guys, my disbelief was easy to suspend. I did cringe when Matt Damon spoke Spanish, but oh well, that's modern casting for ya."

","Liked the action and special effects. However, due to the enormous plot and story flaws pulls these movie down the trenches. It would have been more plausible if let's say Elysium was actually the middle America and Southeastern States e.g. bordering from North Dakota, Wisconsin, parts of Indiana, Michigan (excluding Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, and northeastern states like NY, Boston) Iowa, Kansas, Coloroda, Arizona (excluding Texas, coz they have their own Texium, lol) down to most of Missouri (excluding New Orleans), Alabama, Florida, SC, NC, Virginia, etc... All the others will be the ghetto third-world states. Now this should be more plausible I suppose. Then there is Elysium Europe which includes most of Germany and the Scandinavian States, parts of France, and all the others like UK, Italy, Spain etc are the ghetto third-world Areas. There also could be Elysium Russia (Russia proper with the Balkan states, Poland to be the ghetto third-world areas), Elysium China (Central China to include Mongolia), Elysium SE Asia (Singapore, Malaysia, all others Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines are ghetto third-world SEAsian countries which most of them are right now, I guess), Elysium Middle East (Most of Saudi Arabia only, Israel Iraq, Iran are all ghetto third-world and that includes the whole of India, lol) etc... The Future Reichstags. All these Elysiums will be surround ed by great walls and super high tech security, whatever with a centralized satellite in space that serves as the command an control like in the movie. Or maybe more radical would be an artificial land mass created in the middle of the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans to serve as the Elysium. I believe this would provide with more substance to the story plot. Just saying..."
"thinker1691","8","1","3","3 January 2014"," "" Do not be troubled, For you are in Elysium and you're already Dead ""
","Neil Blomkamp wrote and directed this incredible movie called "" Elysium "". The title of the film refers to the Mythical Island of the Greeks. As referenced by Maximus Decimus Meridias in the Movie 'Gladiator', who says, "" If you find yourself riding in green fields, with the Sun on your face. Do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium and you're already Dead. "" Thus it is in this film our hero, Max (Matt Damon), who daily labors in an industrial factory, accidentally is exposed to a lethal dose of Radiation and is informed he has five days to live. It is Earth in the 22nd century and it's population, like now, has been divided between the Very rich and the very poor. Max is poor. Indeed, like the rest of the impoverished, he has one chance to survive, get to the orbiting satellite called Elysium where a medical machine can perform miracles and will cure everything. Unfortunately a powerful and ruthless governor named Delacourt (Jodie Foster) has no tolerance for undesirables like Max. In addition to Delacourt, there are others who can stop Max. There is for instance Kruger (Sharlto Copley) the powerful Mercenary who is hired and assigned to protect Elysium from illegal immigrants. It is a dark film but one which in incredibly exciting. Action is everywhere from the ground up. The movie is filled with tremendous explosive scenes, aerial combat and superb physical confrontations. A cohesive script allows the cast to play well against each other. Alice Braga, Diego Luna, Wagner Moura and William Fichtner as John Carlyle are excellent. It's equally interesting to see Jodie Foster playing a heavy for once. As such, I definitely recommend this movie to all. ****"

We've destroyed the world, once again and for the millionth time, in the future and the privileged rest comfortably in a space station above the Earth. In a shocking twist – not really, but for those who've seen maybe 2 movies in their life – there's a power struggle up there and the poor want in, regardless.<br/><br/>One thing I definitely appreciate about Director/Writer Neill Blomkamp of District 9 fame, is his love of the antihero up front. In this case, it's Matt Daaaay-mon's Max. He does have an additional level of depth to his character and he's right there with Julio with some specs of characters to watch in an overly blah story.<br/><br/>Sure, okay, the special effects are somewhat good, not great, nor spectacular. In fact, I expected more from what I was shown in District 9. But, they were good, nonetheless.<br/><br/>I can see why this movie bombed. I cannot believe for a second that Blomkamp thought this was something new. None of it is. There's not a fresh aspect of this entire movie. It's a wasted effort from an obviously talented man. Sadly, for a no-name (so far,) he's gotta do a lot better than this to make him a real-name.<br/><br/>* * * Final thoughts: Despite all I wrote above, still, it's worth a Saturday-in night at the movies. It's not a complete waste and fun when you do, in fact, leave your brain at the door and forget the countless other movies just like this."

","Tackling the 1-percent crowd with the same kind of subtlety he showed third-world racial relations in District 9, young auteur Neill Blomkamp presents a narrow, but thoughtful, glimpse into the not-so-distant future. As with his first feature-length showing, Blomkamp's vision and attention to detail are instant hooks, but the director carelessly chooses to cut bait before reeling in his big catch. This film's knack for the little things is easily its most striking feature: the robust, believable appearance of the world's widespread future tech, a melting pot of different languages amongst the commoners, a photographer's eye when fitting the upper class's orbiting space station into shots of the horizon.<br/><br/>Those intricacies at play, plus the dead-simple premise, make the first hour a real joy to behold. It's when the plot tries to get up and go in the second act, sadly, that it falls apart at the seams. There's just nothing to it; an immodest collection of bad action movie gimmicks and one-dimensional characters, it seems to lose track of the core message at twenty paces. It's constantly contradictive and routinely under-explains key concepts, not for added dramatic tension, but because nobody seems to have thought that far ahead. The frequent fight scenes are a hand-held buffet, herking and jerking the screen right to the point of nausea and beyond. The list goes on. At the end of the day, even poor Matt Damon's redemptive character arc, a simple affair in which a selfish man finally makes a sacrifice to the betterment of his peers, is rendered pointless by a glaring, significant series of plot holes.<br/><br/>As a showcase of imagination, this is great stuff. It's the visual medium at its very best, a not-so-perfect postcard of a vivid, bustling future Earth that lives, breathes and kicks. As a sci-fi space drama, however, it's terribly, tragically flawed. Frankly, I couldn't wait for it to be over."

The action was intense and their were some great characters. The main character from the first movie returns in a totally different role and I thought he kicked ass. I don't usually like Jodie Foster so her being the antagonist made it alright. Matt Damon did a good job and the mechanic suit he wears gave the movie some very memorable action scenes. I also liked the story a lot about the elite deserting earth for a haven in space, keeping their advanced health care for themselves and leaving the poor too die.

","Elysium is director Neil Blomkamp's most recent foray into sci fi. The movie Mr. Blomkamp is really known for is District 9 another very gritty real feeling scifi movie. So Elysium is not too much off course for Blomkamp. But that is not a negative because if Blomkamp is good at one thing it is making gritty very real feeling sci fi stories that seem to almost have been ripped from an alternate dimension. Matt Damon is Blomkamps leading man in Elysium as Max, a likable orphan who has had a spotty past with crime but is now living the straight life. The movie picks up with Max being an adult working a factory job earth is a wasteland ruled by gangs and corporate robots. The corporate robots are controlled by the exceedingly rich who live in Elysium a space station utopia where everyone looks young and beautiful. The residents of Elysium never have any health problems because their superior technology. Which leads a lot of the poor people on earth with serious diseases to seek out the cartels that will try to smuggle them to Elysium so they can use the first aid machines to fix their problems. I do not want to give any spoilers so from here on out I will rate the action, story, visuals, and acting.<br/><br/>As far as action goes it doesn't get much better there is plenty max fights robots and mercenary's using a wide variety of guns as well as his Exosuit. So if action is your bag this movie has it in spades. The story is also a good it is simple but effective and can double as a commentary on our own growing chasm between classes. It is an exceedingly interesting idea that we would use up earth so the extremely wealthy would build a utopia in space so I very much enjoyed the story line. Visual wise Blomkamp always does a great job the visuals are incredible super realistic which just lends it self to the believability of the story and world. Finally the acting I found the acting incredibly enjoyable Matt Damon had a strong performance as max who starts out slightly selfish but comes around to be the poor man with the heart of gold. Then Jodie Foster did a great job as a political viper trying to maneuver and wriggle her way to the top of Elysium's social and political food chain. But my favorite was Sharlto Copley as Kruger an ex Special Forces man contracted to the higher ups in Elysium to take care of problems or issues on earth. He really pulls off the Special Forces type as well as this crazy creepiness underneath the whole performance overall he was incredible as the bad guy very menacing. Overall if you enjoy dystopian future movies this is for you. Action 4 out of 5 stars Story 3 out of 5 stars Visuals 5 out of 5 stars Acting 5 out of 5 stars"
"paul_haakonsen","5","1","3","25 November 2013"," Well, that wasn't really much of a blast...
","I had been told by friends not to watch this movie, but still I decided to sit down to watch it out of sheer boredom. I must admit that I get the meaning of their words now that I have seen the movie.<br/><br/>Story-wise, then ""Elysium"" was a shallow and hollow replica of a movie. The story was oozing with predictability and it wasn't really based on a solid foundation. Which ultimately led this movie to become another of those mindless drone movies that are run by CGI special effects and bright lights. But once the dust settles, then there isn't much meat on the bone, so to speak.<br/><br/>The story is about Earth in the future, a planet destroyed and in ruins. While those with money and the ability have established a new life of luxury and without care on Elysium, an orbiting space station watching over Earth. Struggling through a harsh life, Max (played by Matt Damon) becomes a victim of circumstance and an accident and have to reach Elysium in order to save himself, keep a promise to his childhood girlfriend and save the Earth in the process.<br/><br/>Right, and we all know just exactly how the movie will end based on that storyline. And guess what, it did. Director Neill Blomkamp has managed to add every storyline cliché into this movie and make it so predictable that it is physically painful to bear witness to.<br/><br/>You would think that with all that advanced technology, robotics and weaponry that the orbiting Elysium station would have some better defenses aside from a single rogue agent with a orbital rocket launcher on Earth? It was just downright idiotic.<br/><br/>And while on the topic of idiotic things, then why did they mount the exoskeleton outside the clothing on Max's body, when they had to drill into his nerves and such. Wouldn't the clothing get in the way? <br/><br/>I can't claim to be a fan of Matt Damon's work, and he was by no indication the reason for me sitting down to watch the movie. However, it should be said that he was actually doing a good enough job in this movie, despite having a very, very weak script to work with. It was also nice to see Jodie Foster and William Fichtner in the movie. William Fichtner actually had the most interesting of all characters throughout the entire story. Sharlto Copley was great in ""District 9"", but he wasn't really set to use the full scope of his talents in this movie.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" is mindless entertainment. It does provide good enough entertainment, just don't expect to be dazzled or left with something to think about once the movie ends. Adequate acting, good effects, bad storyline, overall a so-so experience.<br/><br/>Thus I am rating ""Elysium"" a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars rating."
"joaodantas","3","1","3","25 November 2013"," Looks like a trailer
","The film has a good premise and could have worked better at it. But he's just a quick-action movie where scenes have a lot of fights, explosions, guns, jump and almost no talking. The characters are not well worked out and have little personality, I could not identify with any, all seemed very generic. The film looks like a trailer, to choose good action scenes and everything is thrown in the face of the viewer so, at times, disjointed. But of course he has a beautiful production, great scenery and all that apparatus of Hollywood. There are those who adore this kind of film, but for me it's just another among a million others."

This film is exactly what the ""elite"" want for the rest of us. In reality their paradise will be in the giant cities beneath the surface of the earth with the organic seed vaults they've been stockpiling in the arctic and elsewhere while more and more Fukushima type ""natural"" disasters continue to make the surface of the earth more and more unlivable.<br/><br/>What an unbelievably prophetic film, well deserving of the 10/10 rating. What the elite don't know is that they will not survive their mass depopulation/enslavement program as the EMVs (discovered by Dr. Norman Bergrum) and first discussed in his groundbreaking scientific book ""The Ringmakers of Saturn"" that surround the sun (You can see them in SOHO satellite images) will simply leave allowing the sun to solar flare the earth to smithereens.<br/><br/>Unless we can overthrow the corporate tyranny that is coming. Just look how every single thing is linked together now you can sign into any of the ""big"" websites with any other account. They want us all chipped/catalogued and our digital footprints analyzed to create a personality matrix (It's all in Schmidt's book, these monsters openly talk about what they want to do) and if you visit websites that are deemed in opposition of government policies then no more paycheck/medical care/access to the information/electronic grid for you! I hope this film wakes up the drugged/sleeping public. Ask yourself why the hell haven't we en mass developed fusion reactors powered by seawater. They've had the technology for years.

"ssvikas","3","1","3","30 September 2013"," Stupid film with one-dimensional characters
","Going by the standard Neill Blomkamp set in the Academy Award nominated 'District 9', his new offering 'Elysium' is a massive let down. While the earlier film had the powerful undercurrent of racism in South Africa, Elysium's attempt to take on the rich-poor divide comes across as flawed and executed without much thought.<br/><br/>Since, I really don't predict many people watching this after reading this, I thought of using some liberty to include spoilers in the review. Here it goes:<br/><br/>In the year 2154 (incidentally the same year that 'Avatar' is set in), Earth has become overpopulated, polluted and disease ridden. The elite have since escaped to a space-station style colony leaving the poor in a state of appalling health-care and sanitation standards while they dream of illegal immigration to 'Elysium'.<br/><br/>The protagonist of the story is Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), ex-convict on parole works for a company that makes robots and dreams of saving up to buy a ticket to Elysium. Things get rough after he is exposed to radiation while at work and has only five days to live. He then urges Spider, someone who arranges illegal ships to get him there, in exchange of one last con job, that turns out to be the keys to the kingdom.<br/><br/>Meanwhile on Elysium, Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) rules with an iron hand, much to the disapproval of the rest of the administration. That includes using illegal agents to shoot down spacecraft intruding into Elysium air-space. She then urges a corporate honcho Carlyle to build an illegal program that will install her as President. It is this very program that Max unwittingly ends up stealing from Carlyle.<br/><br/>The film tells us very little about the people in Elysium except that they are on a perpetual holiday. The film makes it appear as if anyone having access to the main program running the system, runs the Elysium and concordantly, all human population. Preposterous! And does it take only a computer program to bring down an administration? So, you see, the audience wouldn't care a damn about Elysium folks.<br/><br/>What about earthlings then? That too, hardly evokes sympathy! In Max's neighborhood, he seems to be the only who cares about working in a proper job. So, what were the others doing? Busy enhancing the population? The view from space shows that the land surface of the planet had lost its greenery. So, how were the people still alive? Didn't the climate change affect the weather or crops?<br/><br/>Sometimes, the portrayal of earth, with the burgeoning population and issues like crumbling health-care & sanitation shown in the film, in some way would remind you of how India could look like within a few years if the population kept growing at the current rate and with the rich-poor divide continuing to widen. Shocking nonetheless!<br/><br/>The film is so poorly written that one hardly feels for any of its characters or care about what they seek to represent. Our hero's only motivation to reach Elysium is to fulfill his dream and the urgency comes because he is about to die. And what was Alice Braga's silly role in it? One can remember her equally pointless role in the futuristic 'Repo Men'. And Max's conversation with Braga's kid seems forced.<br/><br/>There are numerous other inconsistencies, like how Max recovers from his injuries, and then the exoskeleton being bolted to his body using big screws and then being stabbed by a knife during fights. He seemed more like Terminator rather than a real human. And he carries the program in chip attached to his head. Duh!<br/><br/>Joining Foster & Damon in the wasted actors list is Sharlto Copley who played the lead actor in 'District 9'. He plays the mercenary, Kruger. His character seems to have a sudden transition from an illegal, later disavowed mercenary to a President hopeful. What a sudden transition! Surely, this bit could have done with some improvement.<br/><br/>The only thing a movie like this can brag about is special effects and some cool gadgets. The car-like space shuttles are so quick, compact and convenient, powerful weapons that are exceedingly compact. But this is hardly adequate to save the film.<br/><br/>And lastly, let's talk about the ending: The reprogrammed code now considers all Earthlings as citizens and the system dispatches them medical facilities so that they too can live forever, and that too disease free! And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the film ends! Seriously, that's their hare-brained plot. What a waste of time and money!!<br/><br/>Verdict: Elysium may have bagged good ratings; but, please don't get carried away by it. Even if you are in the mood to leave your brain back home in the refrigerator, this film can still irritate you and make you feel like walking out in between. Avoidable!"
"Rat_27","6","1","3","26 September 2013"," Bad. Just bad.
","I REALLY wanted this movie to be better. I got suckered in by the previews, and that always irks me. I really like some of the visions Blomkamp has. His exoskeleton suit was awesome, but I really don't think they bothered to explain why it made him faster, stronger, etc. I have seen more than my fair share of sci-fi, so I didn't need much explanation, but my date didn't get it at ALL. The Kalashnikov was cool too, but I'd rather just see a movie of all of these things in action, the whole time. The back story was ... bad. And some of the important technical aspects of the sci-fi seem to have been overlooked. How did the people on Elysium breathe? There didn't seem to be anything keeping the atmosphere in the ring. Even with the weapon advancements I saw, I don't expect a shoulder fired missile to be able to take down a target almost 20 miles away. If that existed, why aren't people just taking pot shots AT Elysium whenever they are having a really bad day? How did she establish a no-fly zone? Did she just tell everyone to stop flying, and they said ... OK? If her daughter hadn't been sick, would that have meant he wasn't inspired to go to Elysium? I could go on and on, but it seems like it was just poorly written, and the '4' I rated it indicates my feeling on it.<br/><br/>I would love to see Cameron and Blomkamp work together. I really like some of the vision they bring to the screen, but Blomkamp needs to step back and quit trying to tell us about poverty in South Africa. We get it. And you suck at story-telling. And as much as I liked him in D9, it was really hard not to find Kruger almost like an unwelcome houseguest.<br/><br/>Not a good date movie, because the movie was just bad. We both left the theater with an odd look on our faces. ... I wish we'd gone to see Pacific Rim, instead."
"oli-784-697035","7","1","3","6 September 2013"," Elysium - another hit in same mold as District 9
","Firstly I would like to point out this is a film for entertainment purposes, not an accurate portal of life in 2154 like some reviewers seem to think. The film did not hold back on the amazing visuals that I was expecting - I just regret not traveling the distance to see it on imax. The story is quite basic but is held up by the strong undercurrent of morals that the director likes to put across, as in his previous film District 9, however idealistic these may be - it doesn't really matter after all we are talking sci-fi here ie. Access to all citizens to Elysium probably would not end well and access to such amazing health care would, I presume end in a pretty bad population boom on Earth. Other reviewers mention problems with the radiation dosing that Max receives at his factory - lethal doses are used to clean and dose samples in labs today and, yes, the technicians are able to walk into the machine and retrieve their sample with no problems - not all radiation hangs around like nuclear waste radiation! So this is not a flaw! I also found it refreshing that the love interest was not that interested - makes it more believable I think. Yes the memory flashbacks were chokingly sentimental but it didn't detract too much. Another reviewer also said it would be better for the little girl to have been Max's daughter - again this is such a typical path for a Hollywood film - I think it was far better that she wasn't. Overall not quite as good as District 9 but a brilliant sci-fi. I will be buying the blurry when it is released!"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","1 September 2013"," Blomkamp doesn't hit the high bar of 'District 9,' but 'Elysium' is all kinds of imaginative and entertaining
","Eagerly we have awaited Neill Blomkamp's follow-up to ""District 9,"" which gave audiences an almost unrivaled combination of entertainment, mystery, emotion and intelligence. The bar was understandably high for ""Elysium,"" an even glossier film with bigger stars and a higher concept with higher stakes.<br/><br/>Matt Damon stars as Max, an Earthbound factory worker who has dreamed of going to the space habitat Elysium his entire life. All the poor live on a pollution-ravaged Earth, while the rich all bolted for Elysium, where they've developed the ability to cure all illness. Understandably, Earth is full of people desperate to break into Elysium and steal back both life and hope. Max becomes among the most desperate when a factory accident leaves him with five days to live.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" and ""District 9"" have a lot in common and warrant a comparison. Foremost, Blomkamp proves beyond a doubt with this film that his imagination when it comes to science fiction, especially high-tech weapons, has no rival in Hollywood. What he and his creative team have dreamt up in this film, from the exoskeleton armor to the countless guns, will make any geek squeal with joy.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of futuristic imagery with dirty, crusty, rugged imagery is another trait Blomkamp's two films share. He's clearly fascinated with the war of the classes, which is the main theme of ""Elysium"" in particular. The wealthy characters in power, such as Elysium's defense secretary (Jodie Foster) and the tech mogul who supplies Elysium and Earth with all its robotic law enforcement (William Fichtner), are portrayed as downright despicable, greedy and malicious. Interestingly, Max isn't inherently good. His past record isn't so clean, for one. Yet we're persuaded quite strongly to hate this dystopian world and want to see Max succeed.<br/><br/>The scope is much wider and stakes much higher in ""Elysium"" than in ""District 9,"" which already presents a challenge in terms of minimizing plot holes and becoming invested in the characters. Plus, the story follows a much more typical formula; there's little doubt as to how it will end, so the mystery element is not as strong. ""Elysium"" excels more in the realm of entertainment and creativity, with action sequences playing out like an awesome video game. Kruger (Sharlto Copley), for example, a sleeper agent being illegally utilized by Foster's character, plays a frightening badass of a villain, the kind that will make you a little nervous when you reach the boss level. <br/><br/>Damon makes for as good a lead as you could ask for in his most physical role outside the ""Bourne"" series. Desperation to survive guides Max, who to begin the film has the worst day ever, but he's remarkably poised, which helps balance the character out. And Blomkamp is careful to give him a soul through use of flashbacks and symbolism, even if that emotional hook only sinks so deep because he has to wedge it in there amidst the busy plot. ""Elysium"" is definitely more fun to look at than it is to think about, though the effort on the intellectual side was probably worth it to avoid the film from being too hollow. <br/><br/>Blomkamp shoots a bit too high with his second film, trying to stay true to the intelligent spirit of ""District 9"" while moving in the direction of a full-on blockbuster. Only Christopher Nolan has done that successfully to this point with ""Inception."" so it's not exactly easy territory. Thankfully, ""Elysium"" has plenty to dazzle audience with in the event that it wasn't as stimulating for other parts of the brain. <br/><br/>Blomkamp has the kind of vision that's on par with today's great directors and he might be the most detail-oriented of all of them. He will continue to make entertaining films because of it and occasionally write something or come across a script worthy of his imagination. ""Elysium"" is not a blemish on his slow-building resume, but when all is said and done, hopefully it can be considered a better-than-average learning moment in a fantastic career.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Elysium may not trip off the tongue but it is a film that deserves to be at the top of your list at moment. Avoiding the usual pitfalls of sci-fi and blockbuster movies of late we have here a cerebral movie that takes us on a journey through two worlds running in parallel, one is earth the dystopia and another is a super space station utopia.<br/><br/>Elysium is the man made super space station that is pure hedonism for the plutocracy, whilst the earth is a rotting corpse. Matt Damon is our man who finds himself with his life and death entwined in the whole mystery of the worlds, and has dreamt since a child to go there.<br/><br/>The film is in some ways a parallel story to 'District 9' if you have ever seen it. Produced by the same people, this film follows pretty much the same filming treatment. Cold and dark people run the world and our heroes are the every day people battling the elements.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is perfect as our eponymous hero and is ably supported by his fellow cast, with a very notable performance too from Jodie Foster. Sharlto Copley steals the film as a sadistic bounty hunter.<br/><br/>This film captures contemporary issues, covering public health services, politics, governance, equity and corruption. It's quite bold in that sense. It doesn't give an answer and admittedly has a partisan line on these issues but it will make you think.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that this state of affairs will happen as is depicted in the film, that's not its point. Like say 1984,it is a snapshot of a frame of some fictional world for us to test our ethics.<br/><br/>Whilst most other films concentrate on the big set piece action scenes, for a change this one put the story first. The settings are jaw dropping at times but all mould in with the storyline which is the crutch of the film.<br/><br/>For a good thought provoking film, give this a try. You will very much enjoy it."
"fawn_jane","5","1","3","25 August 2013"," They Did It Wrong
","(This review doesn't have any big spoilers but I'd put the warning just in case.)<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this movie. I was looking forward to a movie that was like ""In Time"", a movie where an oppressed regular man in a dystopian future would crash the rich people's party and explore the contrast in their way of life. But instead I was ""treated"" to a movie with an uncompelling central plot and mediocre direction.<br/><br/>Instead the movie revolves around the fact that the rich people in Elysium have these instant-healing devices, while the poor people on earth have only overcrowded hospitals with limited resources. The only value of this movie is that it captures the zeitgeist of America, where healthcare is a contentious issue, and the common people routinely have no access to care.<br/><br/>But the movie does a poor job of entertaining the audience. It doesn't explore any of the social issues, or do any of the things you would hope a movie like this would do. You don't really get to see how rich people on Elysium live besides a few short scenes in passing where you see them lounging around in mansions and swimming pools. Instead most of the movie takes place in the dreary setting of semi-post-apocalyptic earth.<br/><br/>So that's it... I won't spoil it, I'll just the say the hero spends the movie trying to get a sick character or two to one of those healing devices, and in the process accidentally stumbles upon a way to bring down the divide between the haves-and-the-have-nots. It's a completely unbelievable way to bring down the divide, which in real life would be undone in minutes. The movie meanders through some mind-numbing action sequences that drag on and on. Halfway through the movie I started wondering ""is it over yet""? And my friend was willing to just walk out.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was bad too. There's the character ""Spider"" who is always whispering. I guess it was supposed to make him sound cool and tough, but actually it makes him sound like he has a breathing problem. He is completely unconvincing as some powerful criminal type who supposedly gets things done. He seems like an actor more likely to be cast as a bumbling stoner henchman. Krueger, an Elysium henchman working on the Elysiumites side also has an annoying accent.<br/><br/>It had some sort-of cool robots and weapons, that was the only halfway memorable thing about this movie."
"WittyRobot","8","1","3","24 August 2013"," Elysium is an intelligent sci-fi film that mixes action with great acting for a terrific summer film.
","The movie Elysium is the second movie from Neill Blomkamp, the writer/director of the sleeper hit District 9 that caught everyone off guard in 2009. If you were a fan of that movie then you should know that these two movies share a similar spirit and choice of themes. District 9 was about segregation and humanity, but Elysium is about poverty, income inequality, elitism, illegal immigration, and also humanity.<br/><br/>The story starts off with our main character Max in 2154. He used to be a mid-level criminal who stole cars from his decrepit neighborhood in Los Angeles. But now he has found himself a good job working at a robotics factory. Something goes wrong at the factory and Max needs to find a way onto Elysium where the wealthy all have medical machines in their houses that can literally cure any illness within seconds. Elysium is a space station where the elite rich citizens of Earth have escaped to and are physically separated from the planet where only poor people live.<br/><br/>To be frank, District 9 starred a pretty unknown cast. This time around, Blomkamp has much harder hitters like Matt Damon as the main star Max and two-time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster as the ambitious Secretary of Defense on Elysium. Overall, Damon does a fairly good job at giving us an intense performance as Max. He is solid but nothing memorable because he just gives us the standard ""Matt Damon"" character that's a nice guy who can turn intensely violent on the drop of a pin. Foster is the one that steals the scene in every shot she's in. I found her acting to be absolutely delightful. She plays her role with such energy, confidence, and charisma that it's really a joy to see her walking around on screen. Having her side story really livened up the plot when things got a bit desperate and dark on Max's end. Although she has some weird and distracting dubbing issues when she re-recorded her lines to dub over herself. Her lips didn't quite match up and you can hear that she is in a sound studio rather than on set.<br/><br/>The visuals were stunning when we see the gorgeous, bright, and colorful Elysium followed by a scene from a dilapidated LA. By the way, the shots of future LA looking grim, dusty, dark, overcrowded, gang-infested, and ""Hispanic"" were confusing to me; I couldn't distinguish if it was future LA or shots taken last Tuesday without any CGI. But throughout the movie, expect dark interiors and grim looking streets that are effective in showing you just how desperate the ""normal"" people in that world are.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed the film. I think it is one of the best films of this year so far. If you're afraid that this film is overly preachy about their liberal themes, then don't worry. It walks a fine line between telling an engaging tried and true story of the ""hero of the working class people"" and making you aware of the huge income gap between the elite and the poor in the world we live in today. It never really spends an entire scene with two people having a conversation on how the rich should give all their money to the poor or other socialist ideals that this film preaches. I do have to mention that the last third of the film feels pretty rushed and you can't help but feel that some big shot Hollywood suits and ties got their hands on it. The last third feels very ""Hollywood"" and a bit dumbed down with more action than anyone cares to see.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 stars"
"davidgee","7","1","3","23 August 2013"," Movie with a mission-statement
","ELYSIUM's slimline plot springs few surprises. I liked the contrast between the space-station's cure-all tanning pods and Earth's still overstretched hospitals. It's clear that the $100,000,000 budget mostly went on CGI. The effects are great if not exactly fresh. The cast do the best they can with under-scripted characters. Matt Damon recycles Jason Bourne to good effect. Jodie Foster phones in her role as a Elysium's answer to Donald Romfeld. Sharlto Copley does a Johnny Depp panto turn as Jodie's arch henchman Kruger. <br/><br/>Pretending that a South African township is the San Diego of tomorrow doesn't entirely come off, and Elysium itself is somewhat insubstantial: I was reminded of the threatened enclave in TV's THE WALKING DEAD. But - hey - maybe this is where our great-grandchildren are headed. Like Blomkamp's 2009 sci-fi thriller DISTRICT 9, ELYSIUM is a movie with a heavy-handed mission statement: share your toys, boys and girls!"
"Naoum","5","1","3","22 August 2013"," Far West once again
","It is a great disappointment to watch an interesting story go down into a Far West movie where all is about shooting and killing... It seems that these keep us from finding some greater meaning in the story and what could be potentially a strength in the movie is flushed down the toilet. Sorry but I feel strongly about this - I see the potential for a great movie gone wrong with all the battles and video game action. I am greatly disappointed. On the bright side you get some good acting (of course) and some interesting script ideas. I think that I consider value for money something new - and this movie fails to deliver :(<br/><br/>A strength of the movie is the music which is carefully selected (or written). On the other hand, the technology of the future seems to be reminiscent of the past - forget wireless and wi-fi. You need that cord to connect... Yeah, right. Somehow, it seems that this was a few years late in production. <br/><br/>The emotions contained in the movie are also kind of thin. You can see some pity and some victimization, as well as a lot of dehumanizing but I could really see something of greater emotional depth. The relations that were investigates seemed one of the same. Could be different. Didn't enjoy :("
"sweetever13","8","1","3","22 August 2013"," A Must See!
","After seeing District 9 I was a bit wary of Neil Blomkaps new sci-fi film Elysuim with its vision of a utopian world far from our time. It has been a long time since I have watched a film that completely enthralled me but with Elysuim I was totally hooked within the first five minutes. I wanted to know more about this wondrous place called Elysuim and wow if only such a place did exist, well one can dream I guess. A world in which the poor and the rich are not one but separate from each other on the basis of wealth creates social divide as the rich have accesses to human resources that makes them able to live a luxurious lifestyle whilst the poor struggle to survive makes for a gripping tale of a man that defys all odds to break free from oppression.. From the first moment we learn of Max played by Matt Damon, we can identify with him, with his dream, his aspiration. Correct me if I am wrong but don't we all long for this utopian lifestyle, to break free from the oppressions of everyday life, from those chains that restrict us from being who we long to be and this is the reason why Max is such a great character in my mind, he is the anti-hero but still he is cheered and applauded as he does what I believe we all wish to do and break from an oppressive society. However, what Neil Blomkaps cleverly does is give the film ever greater substance by not making this simply your typical action movie where its all about a powerful, heroic hero fighting against the bad guy but by showing Max's compassionate and honest nature with the on-going accompanying tale of two people finding companionship in one another at a young age and creating a bond that still remains as strong as it was then once they are reunited as adults. This is where the film pulls on the heart strings and no more than at its conclusion but of course I will leave this for you to decide, as I do not wish to spoil what I believe is to be a cleverly and well thought out ending that leaves no stone unturned. <br/><br/>This a well casted film with the likes of Jodie Foster but it is Matt Damon's performance that stands out. He not only presents a character that is believable in his compassionate and honest nature but one that is also lovable for his quick-wittedness. Although, you would think of this as a overly serious film, Neil Blomkaps still allows us to have a little giggle and be entertained by Max's cynical humor. I really cannot credit this film enough, it has a clear beginning, middle and end and I never found myself bored because nothing was prolonged, everything was just right. Before I finish one thing I will say is I'd be careful of who's watching this as things were a bit gorier than expected but boy did this allow you to appreciate how brilliant the special effects were. I would definitely say this is a film to be seen on the big screen and not the standard television, so what are you waiting for? You too can see the utopian world you dream of with Elysuim."
"Rolling_Pain","8","1","3","22 August 2013"," Enjoyable flick, regardless of whether u think about District 9 or not when you see this
","Just from things I hear about the film as well as my own opinion.<br/><br/>Visuals: Awesome, same as district 9 when looking at the slums. They did great in creating what looks like a crappy place to live lol. On Elyisum where it looks like paradise, it's typical futuristic sci-fi look, which is always a pleasure to see.<br/><br/>Story: Matt Damon's character gets sick, only choice is to go to Elysium (where the super duper rich ppl live) and get healed cuz they have the technology there. Not much more you can ask of a sci-fi story set-up. Damon's sickness is the incident which gives his character urgency to do something, otherwise the movie could've been just focusing on people trying to get to Elysium to escape the decaying Earth environment (which is featured in one scene, and you can't help but think about its representation of real life with illegal Mexican immigrants trying to get into the U.S.).<br/><br/>Characters: Matt Damon was great as usual. But I felt the cool-looking exo-skeleton that gets put on his character wasn't used as much and wasn't needed except for one piece of the plot (So they could have done it differently, the plot piece I'm saying). It gives him strength to help him through his sickness, so that explains a big reason for putting it on. I don't know, maybe they could've given Damon some time to himself to test it out and deal with any issues cuz it looks cool but he uses his super strength only a couple of times (which is related to the amount of action in this movie) and therefore felt like the skeleton wasn't even needed in the first place.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster's character I thought was satisfactory. I hear a lot of gripe about her accent and the confusion of what it is. But at least I could understand her. So I didn't have a problem with her(I love Sharlto Copley but I didn't understand his words a few times, as well as the character Spider).<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley: Like I said, there were a few times I couldn't understand what he said. Aside from that, he was great. He's the villain that is tasked with finding Damon's character. Copley was evil, smart, aggressive and portrayed him, dare I say it, perfectly. With the beard, his attitude, his sword, they created him in the right way.<br/><br/>Action: This may be the shallow reason for judging a movie, but my reasoning is, you got a great cast, big budget for cool stuff, but sometimes it's lacking when a little more could've been enough. It's probably the biggest part of why I gave the movie an 8 where District 9 I would give it a 9.5-10. I thought District 9's action was spectacular and sufficient. There's some recurrences of District 9, with people getting blown into bits. That was good, and weapons look cool. My gripe with the action in Elysium is there's not enough. Like not enough gun action (you see Damon use that slick-looking AK47 in the trailer or movie clip, he doesn't use it after that part of the movie. He gets another cool gun near the end. Overall, he doesn't get to kick a lot of ass with guns or his newfound enhanced strength.<br/><br/>There wasn't as much droids I thought there would be. If i remember correctly, he only fights droids in that scene with the AK47. Droids are only featured later on.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this 8.5 out of 10. Definitely worth seeing if you're into sci-fi action. I certainly couldn't help but think of District 9 at times, but no doubt District 9 was better."
"p-stepien","6","1","3","21 August 2013"," Striving for relevance
","Neill Blomkamp's sophomore feature serves more as a statement of intent, than a calling card for future reference. Within the confines of parochial script owing too much to Hollywood epic conclusiveness and too little to the restraint shown with the phenomenal debut of ""District 9"", Blomkampp struggles to imbue a sense of relevance to a heavily socially-aware storyline.<br/><br/>In the year 2154 with resources strained and class warfare restrained by corporational dictatorship, the rich of the world have shipped themselves off-planet to an idyllic resort called Elysium. Detached from earthly woes and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, seemingly extrapolating Wolverine's rapid healing gene, the wealthy live in a cocoon of self-glee, whilst still gaining dividends from Earth profits. With the accumulation of fortunes brought to an extreme, the rest of humanity is brought to a state of sustainable poverty in a fascist state policed by mechanised droids and system institutions running like clock-work through the use of robot figureheads. In a run-down Los Angeles ex-criminal Max (Matt Damon) tries to straighten out his life. Unfortunately for him a work accident leaves him radiated with but five days of life, needing powerful drugs to keep him functional. Left with few options Max attempts to break through to Elysium to use the almost magical medical capabilities available there. However en route he comes across valuable secrets, which make him the most wanted man in the Solar System....<br/><br/>On several levels ""Elysium"" is a riveting piece of sci-fi with what - in my opinion - is the best CGI effects ever to be registered on film. Unlike most generic computerised special effects Blomkampp brings some much needed refreshing fingerprint to his animated CGI with trademark Halo-inspired drones, robot, exo-skeletons all moving with such specific swagger, that Blomkampp has cemented his unique style and usurps the right to say that despite the onslaught of special effects this is a rare example of a movie, where the CGI actually functions for the story, not the other way around. Blomkampp's specificity is further underlined by the mixing of the decrepit atrophy of humanity (in the form of squalid slums) seamlessly intersecting with technology of the future, creating a captivatingly hideous world, which lingers in memory far longer than any other modern CGI-bursting picture. Aided with some memorable performances by the wickedly devious Jodie Foster (as Elysium's secretary of defence Delacourt) and the efficient madness of Sharlto Copley as the ruthless South African mercenary-spy Kruger, ""Elysium"" has multitudes of ingredients for the creation of a sci-fi classic, even to outdo ""District 9"".<br/><br/>This time however the script turns out to be the biggest let-down for writer-director Blomkampp, who fuses the world around a story, which lacks in creativity, instead making that up with blasts and a needless attempt to 'change the world'. With cumbersome, if morally sound, social messages heavy-handedly bringing attention to the plight of the poor, the increasingly widening wealth gap, the overreach of corporate power as well as to health systems geared towards money, the movie topples into familiar traps, overly relying on Hollywood sci-fi standards to push the message through (unlike for example ""Children of Men""). Nonetheless ""Elysium"" is visually powerful, even stunning, providing belief that a new profound voice for high-octane cinema has emerged. Now all he requires is some aid in delivering a story suitable for his virtuosic use of CGI magic."
"FrostyChud","6","1","3","16 August 2013"," Boss is going to be mad!
","Rather than writing a long review I just want to drop some bullet points on ELYSIUM.<br/><br/>1. Jodie Foster plays uptight and unlikable well but that accent was awful.<br/><br/>2. Did anyone else notice how much Earth in Elysium resembled the future in IDIOCRACY? The bar codes on the wrists, the overcrowded hospital, people shuffling around in dusty slums, the tattoos. <br/><br/>3. Politically, of course citizenship for everybody is great, but it solves none of the problems that created the situation in the first place: overcrowding and disease...<br/><br/>4. I thought the movie's best touch was having Kruger's face blown off and then reconstructed.<br/><br/>5. I think that on a less conscious level ELYSIUM is a meditation on the body. Matt Damon's body does nothing but receive pain. He is stabbed, irradiated, beat up, surgically upgraded...I think the boilerplate politics are just a screen for Blomkamp's more primordial (and more interesting) body fantasies.<br/><br/>This movie is OK."
"americanentertainmentrep","5","1","3","11 August 2013"," ""Elysium"" a strange trip to the future
","It was the big weekend movie, and I was attracted to the premise, so I ventured out to see ""Elysium."" In this one, we are transported to 2154, a time when the very wealthy live on a man-made space station in orbit high above an overpopulated, impoverished, disease-ridden, and polluted Earth. The planet is patrolled by robot cops who protect the interests of the wealthy overlords who emulate the Great Gatsby on the rotating tea cart in the sky. <br/><br/>This, of course, upsets the people on Earth, who know that there is a machine on Elysium that can cure all illness. When our hero, played by Matt Damon, gets a lethal dose of on-the-job radiation, he sets forth on a mission to equalize civilization. As luck would have it, the security lady on Elysium (Jody Foster) wants more power and launches a plot to take over the space station, but Matt and his pals intervene. Foster plays the heartless security woman it like she is Meredith Baxter Birney in a bad Lifetime made-for-TV movie.<br/><br/>There are other big flaws: A 2003 GMC Truck that still runs (I am still trying to figure out where they got gas for it), a metal contraption that is put on Damon to make him strong, but it doesn't seem to work (I hope he saved the receipt, so he can return it to Exo-skeletons R Us), not to mention incandescent incandescent light bulbs and computers that look like they were recently bought from Staples. This all does nothing to revive what is a tired plot.<br/><br/>In spite of all that, it is not a bad movie and will keep you entertained for a few hours with some decent special effects and some characters you will care about, so I will give this a two out of Fordyce. Place it in the category of another Summer 2013 lackluster, big-budget blockbuster wannabe.<br/><br/>Jim's Credit Check: There is no bonus scene at the end of the credits."
"alcan-707-351931","6","1","3","11 August 2013"," Did Damon save Earth?
","Probably only delayed things a bit I'd guess, but the have-nots got a nice little win. As our super hero, he received a very ample share of flesh wounds but he dug deep, swallowed the pills, and got the win. NO pain, NO gain man. I enjoyed watching the video game transporters, robot police, and the melancholy pristine Elysium scene. You may relate to this movie to current times, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Don't tell your sub-conscious, but the seeds have been planted to join the political movement now. Bottom line, another interesting guess of the future, where we ordered up a combo platter of I-Robot, Terminator, and Mad Max."
"dearbornvendetta","6","1","3","11 August 2013"," A worthy follow up to District 9, cant say much more though
","Elysium is a worth follow up to Neil Blomkamp's District 9. Its got thrilling action, awesome visuals and a couple of really good performances. However it doesn't quite reach the level of greatness that District 9 achieved. Is that a bad thing? That depends, they are 2 separate movies, but with Neil Blomkamp's premier movie being so amazing you really cant help but walk into this movie with very high expectations. If there's one thing that I didn't find overly compelling about this movie is that the story just didn't impress me. The concept is excellent and a very scary view of what our future could very well look like if the gap between the middle class and upper class continues to grow but the story that was wrapped around the concept for some reason didn't fascinate me. The film has a great message and is very entertaining but the overall feeling I had when I walked out was ""That was a movie."" This film defiantly deserves to be watched as its very entertaining and fans of Matt Damon are sure to enjoy this film. District 9's Shartlo Copley does an excellent job as the films villain. I'd say in my opinion you could be fine waiting to just rent this one."
"djbreen7","9","2","10","12 August 2013"," I feel like I have to defend from the bad reviews
","Pretty serious spoilers in here, FYI.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie way more than I expected. I didn't hear anything good about it going into it. Two of the girls that came with me were pretty sure that they were going to fall asleep and had both heard that the movie got only got 2 out of 5 stars. I told them they were probably right, but I had to see for myself. We were all on the edge of our seats about halfway through the movie and on.<br/><br/>Here's my thing though. Besides the really good story in District 9, my next favorite thing was the cool weapons. Elysium definitely has some cool weapons too. The action sequences really define this movie.<br/><br/>For people who hated the movie, this is what I keep hearing:<br/><br/>""Delacort's (Foster) accent is stupid and her character is useless"" That's actually valid, but the accent didn't bother me. I was going into this expecting Copley to be the main bad guy anyway.<br/><br/>""Kruger (Copley) dies and gets revived. Why can't the other characters?"" Half of Kruger's face gets blown off. You'd pretty much assume he died. If you're listening though, you can hear him wheezing when they put him in the healing chamber. His heart didn't stop beating.<br/><br/>""None of the characters develop/change in the movie."" There is a little bit of character development lacking, but one reviewer goes as far as to say that Max doesn't change from the beginning to end. I don't know what movie they were watching, but he literally goes from ""I'd rather save myself and let billions suffer"" to ""I'll die so that billions can be saved.""<br/><br/>""They don't develop the relationship between Max and Frey."" I liked that the movie didn't focus on their relationship. It basically shows that they were good friends who could have become lovers as kids, but Max gets friend-zoned from his screwups. When they're older, things are too complicated for Frey to pursue anything. And... let's be honest... when you've got less than 5 days to find a way to save your life, are you going to spend every minute trying to save your life, or are you going to chase tail?<br/><br/>I heard the same things when I saw District 9. People who like the cheesy comic book scifis hated it, and people who like the gritty movies loved it. Same concept with this."
"dmurilloroman","9","2","10","9 August 2013"," Neill Blomkamp's Reassurance of His Dominance
","Elysium, this summer's most awaited sci-fi flick proves to be a winner. Compared to District 9, this film focuses mildly less on story telling and more on it's action scenes which are high octane and will grab your attention simply with it's cinematographic appearance. Matt Damon shows that he has the chops to have a dramatic presence while containing all the proper traits of an action star, being likable but serious at the same time. The plot is less original and more simple than District 9 but there is still a fun experience to be had. Sharlto Copley represents his versatility by being a serious character in D9, a zany/charismatic one in the A-Team, and now a gruesome villain here. This futuristic story allows much ridiculousness and trust me there are many far fetched instances which it uses to it's advantages. Your eyes will be put in a trance with The film's ""iconic"" special effects and with a solid script blending with climactic action, this has a formula for a huge summer blockbuster. Now at times this film may fall victim to style over substance but never long enough to wreck the experience and it can be enjoyable dumb fun. There is an under-dog tone to this flick as well with Earth being under Elysium, this adds intensity and much more emotion which will easily give thrills. It's extremely fresh to see that whenever the film shows it's comedic side, there are no cheap laughs but it rarely is comical, it's pure action and far more brutal you would think. Neill Blomkamp reassures the public that he is a sci-fi force to be reckoned with."

They use exoskeletons and high energy plasma stuff and it's very cool in theory, except they're fighting for health care and that's just... not the coolest thing to make a movie about.<br/><br/>The bad guy starts off unhinged and ends up as a raving lunatic, but he's fun for the most part.

Rich people take advantage of poor people, illegal aliens are brutally treated, healthcare is only for the rich and so on. Funny thing is the only way these evil people are stopped is by arming citizens with fully automatic weapons. On top of that, Jodie fosters fake accent is hard to listen to."
"Aylmer","3","1","4","22 October 2019"," About as poorly thought-out as its obvious political message
","The biggest shock here for me was to see a film so completely righteously heavy-handed also stay incredibly and disappointingly simplistic. Blomkamp, much like in DISTRICT 9, does an excellent job setting up a world at the start where we're fascinated to see in which direction the story will go to expose the inner corruption of the system. Unfortunately we don't really get much more than a dumb action movie with a bunch of fight scenes coupled with some extremely blatant leftist propaganda.<br/><br/>So the Halo-like space station orbiting earth now houses all the best and the brightest while the unwashed and diseased masses team in mountains of garbage looking for their excuse to get up onto the space station as well. The film makes it a point to focus more on the medical side of things to show that the ""illegals"" just want access to the same health care as the rich, particularly for their terminally ill children. This just went a little too far in my opinion in trying to paint the earth people as saintly caretakers looking after their children. They are apparently not economic climbers eager to better their own quality of life by leaving the earth as opposed to cleaning things up and working toward a more just society where they are with what they have. Also, the rich people obviously must be evil for withholding low-cost in-home instantaneous miracle cures from the poor with no mention in the film as to what the real ramifications of such socialized medicine would be long-term.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster, usually a capable performer, turns in a shockingly awful performance about as credible as the sneering villain from TIME CHASERS, complete with a similarly artificial accent. Matt Damon does an okay job as the protagonist much better suited to the dramatic acting than he is to the punch-out action scenes later in the film. I'm still not entirely sure why he, a white person, would be raised in a hispanic slum in the first place, other than to hypocritically white-wash an otherwise heavily leftist film which depicts every other white person as a sociopath and/or rapist. The only person who seems to be enjoying himself here is Sharlto Copley as the shirtless and tatted-up evil gang leader, which I've come to see is a trope that Blomkamp loves to repeat, along with the robot designs which pop up again in CHAPPIE, a similarly underwhelming and frustrating film. The last 20 minutes of the film are easily the worst, as we watch characters go through the motions toward a sadly inevitable conclusion that doesn't explore any of the rich universe it worked so hard to build in the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>In the better, nonexistent sequel, we'd see that Elysium gets overrun by economic migrants with vast tent cities eating up all the resources, and the rich ruling class has to either build another, better protected space station, or just allows itself to be enveloped by the class it spent so much money escaping. A much more interesting film would have spent more effort developing both sides of the argument, but that wouldn't be seen as too politically correct. I would love to think Blomkamp was actually in on the joke the whole time and somehow thought he was subverting how short-sighted the politics of the film really are, but there's very little actual evidence to support that any real thought went into the script.<br/><br/>Good effects though."

","I like the beginning of this movie, the sequences editing, the camera plans are very good and the mix with the sound is great.<br/><br/>And the satellite orbiting around the earth, and that shows the localized society as if it was a mirror is very beautiful.<br/><br/>But this is the problem, for this film and other modern sci-fi. Underneath this amazing technical aspect, it is the same with the same plot and story seen so many times. Just to end up giving you a moral lesson and show great special effects.<br/><br/>In this case, the difference between rich and poor, poor live below, on the unclean planet, and rich in the upper world and full of opportunities. The world has become chaos because of overpopulation, and of course the corrupt and bad company is also here. That put the profit above the poor, for the rich to live well and with quality. Of course, these topics and themes already seen a million times don't help at all. Since the script is a mess. Who cares about creating a good story, if the filmmakers only want to create situations to show scenes that evolve the amazing special effects. Once again the special effects are in Film industry to help the storytelling, the special effects are not here to be the main attraction of the film or any film for that matter.<br/><br/>The main problem is not only the story be a huge chichÃ©, but the execution is also done poorly with way too cold characters at the mix. Besides that, I think the biggest problem with this movie is the script that does not let the actors shine. <br/><br/>But to tell you the truth, the actors don't even try hard, it seems they are in the movie, only to receive the paid check and nothing else. Matt Damon as tormented person, and no one is convinced. Jodie Foster is on autopilot for the entire movie. And William Fichtner is an annoyance to see, playing the traditional jerk of any movie of the this movie. The action scenes are passable and quickly forgotten. <br/><br/>A waste, that served only to show great technical quality (special effects, sound, etc). But for this, We do not need talent, but a great budget. To create a good movie and a good story requires talent, dedication, and hard work. And this movie has none of it. A waste of time."

","I mainly remembered hearing about this film because of the leading actor, including the poster where he is bald, and I knew it was something to do with space or the future, so I was looking forward to it, directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie). Basically set in 2154, the population has been divided into two social classes, the wealthy and the poor, while the poor have remained on Earth, the wealthy people live on Elysium, a gigantic space station and habitat with advanced technology, including the Med-Bay, machines that can cure all diseases, reverse ageing and regenerate body parts. Earth has become exhausted, due to overpopulation and pollution, there is starvation, and little technology and medical care, a long-running feud between the rich and poor citizens has been going on, the poor people want the Elysium technology to cure their medical ailments. Former car thief Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is on parole, he lives in the ruins of Los Angeles and works at an assembly line for Armadyne Corp, creating weaponry for Elysium, and robots that police Earth, the company is run by John Carlyle (William Fichtner), original designer if Elysium. One day Max has an industrial accident, when he is trapped in a chamber and hit by a lethal dose of radiation, he is rescued but told he only has five days left to live, desperate for a cure he needs a way to get to Elysium. At Elysium, three ships full of illegal immigrants from Earth approach and try to land, Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) orders sleeper agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to shoot them down, two are destroyed, killing all on-board, the third makes it, but all on-board are either killed or arrested and deported. Max and his friend Julio (Diego Luna) get help from smuggler Spider (Wagner Moura), he agrees to get him to Elysium, if he can steal financial information from Carlyle, Max is surgically attached to a powered exoskeleton. Max is able to shoot down Carlyle's ship, a firefight ensues between a team of Spider's men and security droids, Carlyle is fatally wounded, Max is able to download the program to his suit's neural implant, but it is unstable due to encryption. Delacourt is alerted of the data theft, she secretly reinstates Kruger to recover the program, in the shootout Julio is killed and Max is injured, he gets help from his childhood friend Frey Santiago (Alice Braga), she begs him to take her daughter Matilda (Emma Tremblay), who has leukaemia, with him to Elysium to be cured, but he refuses to protect them. After Max leaves, Frey is brutally interrogated by Kruger and two mercenaries Drake (Brandon Auret) and Crowe (Josh Blacker), Kruger realises Matilda is sick, she and Frey are taken prisoner aboard his ship, his drones hunt for Max, Delacourt buys time to recover Carlyle's program by ordering an airspace lockdown over Los Angeles. Spider discovers the program taken by Max can be used to make all Earth residents Elysian citizens, but the lockdown makes it impossible to leave Earth, Max makes a bargain with Kruger, unaware he has already found she assisted him, and has her and Matilda hostage, as the ship leaves, Spider and men also get aboard. A fight ensues and a grenade explodes, the ship crashes on Elysium, Frey runs with an unconscious Matilda to the nearest house to find and use a Med-Bay, but it can only used by Elysium citizens, at that moment Crowe subdues Frey. Max, Frey and Matilda are taken to Delacourt, who orders the download of the program, but it will kill Max, and she orders Frey and Matilda to be locked up, meanwhile Kruger is restored in a Med- Bay, he kills Delacourt for criticising his recklessness, then he orders Drake and Crowe to exterminate the Elysian political officers to take control. Meanwhile Max escapes confinement, and uses Carlyle's program to give everyone on Earth Elysian citizenship, Max then kills Crowe before he can kill or sexually assault Frey, he also kills Drake, Spider has one of his men escort Frey and Matilda to a Med-Bay. They are then ambushed by Kruger, equipped with a far superior military-grade exoskeleton to Max's, in the fight Max rips out Kruger's neural implant, rendering his suit immobile, Kruger arms a grenade intending to kill himself and Max, but Max releases him and hurls him over a cliff to his death. Spider realises in Elysium's computer core that Max will be killed when the program is activated, Max activates it himself, as he dies, Elysium's computer core reboots and every Earth resident is registered as an Elysian citizen, robots with President Patel (Faran Tahir) refuse to arrest Spider, now he is recognised as a citizen, Matilda is cured, and a huge fleet of medical ships are sent by the computer to treat people on Earth. Also starring Maxwell Perry Cotton as Young Max, Jose Pablo Cantillo as Sandro, Adrian Holmes as Manuel and Michael Shanks as CCB Agent. Damon is pumped up and will do whatever it takes to save himself from death, Foster has a dodgy accent (and you can tell has been dubbed in places) but is a good chilling malevolent villainess, and Blomkamp regular Copley is alright as the creepy ground agent. Blomkamp brings similar narratives like in District 9, about social inequality, with a higher budget the special effects and star names are bigger, there are a good amount of exciting sequences with explosions and advanced machines, and the imagery is cool, Elysium looks just like the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, it may be patchy in places, but overall it was an interesting science-fiction thriller. Worth watching!"
"atravelingman","6","1","4","21 August 2016"," Good visuals, bad writing
","Elysium had promise, it showed that right in the beginning. It could have been a grand movie, but the writing was way below par for what it was trying to achieve. It tried addressing different very serious topics, but failed. It wanted to portray the suffering of common man, but didn't. Too much was just passed by to keep the story arc within the movie runtime I believe.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp is a good director, with District 9 being a perfect example as well. And he did a great job with writing that movie as well, but not this one. I fail to understand why that is. It could be he was pressed for time, it could be that he just didn't care that much about the script this time, I don't know. Matt gives a solid performance as usual and as expected by him. I think Jodie Foster was not well used at all. With her brilliant acting talent, I believe even herself she might feel let down by this one. The buck stops with the director on this one as well. He should know how to use the resources he has, and there is no better and powerful resource than Jodie.<br/><br/>Also that Sharlto Copley accent, boy that had me wanting to give a 4. So cringe-worthy at times that it seems he is making fun of the viewer by deliberately talking that way. I understand that he is speaking Engligh in the Afrikaans accent, but boy was that way confusing and mixed up with so many other accents that it took away from the role instead of adding to it. I've always regarded him as a good actor but this performance really misses the mark.<br/><br/>Anyways, this should not keep you away from watching a visual masterclass. It is a good action flick, nothing more nothing less. You should give it a try and maybe you will like it more going into it with average expectations. I did not like it too much, personally I went into it expecting so much from it that my own expectations for it let me down.<br/><br/>I was thinking halfway through the movie that maybe it deserves a 7, but not quite. So a 6.5 from me, maybe, or maybe a solid 6."
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","4","6 November 2014"," Another superlative slice of sci-fi action
","When South African director Neill Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 came out, it blew me away. Never before had I seen an inventive and intricate storyline mixed with mind-blowingly realistic special effects work and some hard-hitting and heavyweight action scenes. It's still one of my favourite movies of all time, so I was understandably excited by the prospect of this follow-up.<br/><br/>And ELYSIUM doesn't disappoint. It's a straightforward action thriller in which both good guys and bad are clearly delineated; it lacks the novelty and scope of Blomkamp's previous movie but it more than makes up for that with its full-blooded action and overriding sense of energy. Once again, the sci-fi special effects are remarkable - this is CGI as it should be employed, as it's completely realistic and never lacking.<br/><br/>Matt Damon can handle the action stuff readily enough - anyone who's seen the Bourne trilogy can tell you that - and Blomkamp assembles a stellar supporting cast to back him up. William Fichtner is a delightfully weaselly bad guy and Jodie Foster an effective political foe, but it's Sharlto Copley who really shines as the OTT main villain, Kruger. It's a complete turnaround from his quiet, mild-mannered turn in DISTRICT 9, and both he and the viewer have a ball with it.<br/><br/>ELYSIUM builds up a real sense of excitement and palpable tension as the story progresses, and the script never lets you down either; once again, there's plenty of subtext to enjoy. This film could well be thought of as an advert for 'Obamacare'. The action sequences employ shaky-cam to good effect, and it's nice to see that Blomkamp hasn't toned the bloody violence down either. No, it's no DISTRICT 9, but it comes close and is one of the best sci-fi movies of recent years."
"suki_itami2010","9","1","4","13 August 2014"," Almost Perfect
","Before I initially rented this movie, I had heard that it's a waste of money. However, I sat down and watched it because I thought it sounded good regardless of what people said, and I'm glad I did. Elysium made it near to the top of my favorite movies list. Here's why you shouldn't believe the hate and at least give this movie a chance... Elysium takes place in a future where the richest people of Earth have built and evacuated to a floating habitat when the world became plagued with disease, crime, and severe overpopulation. To prove that they are far richer than anyone on Earth, the citizens of Elysium all have MedBays that can heal any and all ailments instantly, while the citizens of Earth live in a dystopia where people are lucky to survive the day. The main character, Matt Damon, is hard to like because you don't want to connect with a guy who is selfish, but you do because you think ""yeah, I'd be selfish too"". If there is one gripe I have about the movie, it is that Jodie Foster's character seems like she was just injected in there. The entire movie could've been written without her character even mentioned, and everything would've probably still happened the same. On the other hand, my personal favorite character, Sharlto Copley, is the one guy no one seems to like. He is not likable at all. He is a psychopath who loves to cause others pain and suffering, and he loves to kill people - in fact, that is his function in the movie - but he plays that man so well that it is terrifying. When we first meet Max (Matt Damon), it's made quite clear that he's a former criminal. Max is quickly assaulted by two police officers on the way to work for being sarcastic to them, and it sends him to the hospital, where he reunites with his childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), who is a nurse at this hospital. After Max is off of work, he's approached by his best friend, Julio (Diego Luna), about hijacking some cars, which Max declines. The next day, Max goes to work as usual, but gets locked in the kiln and he's exposed to a full dose of radiation that will kill him in five days. It is now that Max asks Julio to take him to see Spider (Wagner Moura) - introduced earlier in the movie as the man who sells tickets to people to be smuggled into Elysium - so he can get a ticket. Julio agrees and gets Max to Spider, but even after Julio gives him money, he does not have enough to buy a ticket, so Spider gives him a different option. Hack into the cerebral knowledge of a citizen of Elysium to access the data through them for new identities. Max agrees, but only under the condition that the man whose brain he hijacks be John Carlyle (William Fichtner), the CEO of Armadyne. As a bonus, Spider also equips Max with a exterior-skeleton to make up for the strength he's losing to radiation poisoning. During all of this, a woman named Delacorte (Jodie Foster) has been conspiring with Carlyle to write a program called Sabre to make her president of Elysium because she thinks the current president is too weak to ""properly"" deal with the illegals being smuggled in. Carlyle write the program and stores it in his brain to take to Elysium. However, on his way up, Max, Julio, and two others, shoot down Carlyle's shuttle and steal the information from him. The moment this occurs, Delacorte sends in Agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley), and he immediately goes about killing. This unfortunately includes Julio, who dies saving Max's life. Max is injured, but manages to avoid capture long enough to find Frey, who stitches his wound. It is now that Frey reveals that her daughter is suffering from the final stages of leukemia, and she begs him to take her daughter to Elysium to get healed. Max refuses and leaves to return to Spider to demand to know why he was being chased, and Spider explains that what is in Max's head can make everyone on Earth a citizen of Elysium, but they can't get to Elysium since Delacorte shut down the sky. So Max gives himself up to Kruger, finding out once he's on the shuttle that Kruger took Frey and her daughter hostage, and kept making very creepy passes at her. Once on Elysium, Max releases a grenade on the shuttle, blowing off Kruger's face. Max is instantly taken prisoner and sent to a lab to have the program removed from him, only to find out that it has a kill sequence once used or transferred, while Frey tries desperately to heal her daughter, but since she is not a citizen of Elysium, it can't work. Frey is then taken captive once again. Once Max escapes the lab - after the best conversation in the movie (Max) Where are they?! (Lab tech) The armory! (Max) ...Where the f-ck is that?! - he's reunited with Spider, who managed to sneak on amidst all the panic over a ship crashing into Elysium. Meanwhile, Kruger is healed and he stabs Delacorte in the neck in rage, before fitting himself with an exterior-skeleton and telling his men to do what they want with Frey. Max saves Frey from them and sends her back to the MedBay. Him and Spider the make their way to the core of Elysium to reboot it, but are stopped by Kruger until, after an epic fight, Kruger is killed at long last. Max, knowing that using the Sabre program will kill him, calls Frey to tell her how beautiful the Earth looks from where he is, before he runs the program and dies. The program reboots Elysium and makes everyone a citizen. The movie ends when shuttles of MedBays are deployed to heal the sick and wounded."

","I mildly enjoyed the movie until unfortunately the socialist ending left me a bit unsettled.<br/><br/>So somehow a space station population of maybe tens of thousands of people, having just had their computers reprogrammed is going to save literally hundreds of millions and maybe billions of people with some robots and technology??? Oh and once they are all healthy, they can then do what? Starve to death because they too can now live forever??? Ironically the ending that was supposed to be uplifting was just sad to me. I am all for an ending where the huddled masses are finally given a chance to raise themselves up. This ending to me however was a sick reflection on the future of our world, which is that we all need to be taken care of by robots and automatized governments. The ending thoroughly ruined the movie for me."
"rahmannoodles22","10","1","4","19 December 2013"," Elysium - Noodles Review
","I was really excited for Elysium since I absolutely adore writer/director Neil Blomkamp's first film District 9. It had a gritty, realistic feel to it; the character development and acting was great, as well as the action; and there were interesting themes of social commentary in it. Thankfully, Blomkamp has delivered that yet again with Elysium. This is one of those movies that you walk into not fully knowing what to expect. However, it all pays off since this is the best movie of the summer and possibly of the year. Elysium takes place about a century or two into the future and Earth is in a pretty bad, crumbling type, condition here. Don't expect the world of Back to the Future 2 because this Earth is overpopulated, polluted; it sucks. And in this film, there's essentially no middle class of society is really present. We have the poor class living on this tattered Earth. Then we have the rich class (politically ""the 1%"") living on this perfect habitat in a space station called Elysium. On Elysium, life is great: everything's clean, everything's high society, they listen to classical music and speak French. There's medical machines that can essentially fix anything (from fixing broken legs to curing cancer). Jodie Foster kind of runs the place. She's actually the secretary of defense, but you know she really runs things. We know she's a great actress, and she's good here. Some people may be bothered by the weird, almost unique, accent she gives her character but I kind of felt it added to her character. However, she's one of the antagonists of the film as she pretty much hates the poor people who illegally immigrate to Elysium.<br/><br/>On Earth, we have Matt Damon's character Max. He's a really likable guy and easy to root for. He cracks jokes and kicks ass, but is also really determined to reach his goals. Matt Damon delivers here with probably his best performance since The Departed. Through a number of events, he's gotta get to Elysium so he gets an awesome robotic suit bolted onto his body. It's pretty graphic when this happens too, the guys who do it don't exactly look like professionals, more so like thugs in the slums. Also on Earth is Agent Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley. I have to tell you right now that this guy completely steals the show. He's an actor with incredible range, playing an innocent fidgety guy who becomes a determined fighter in District 9, and then playing an all out psycho (who is awesome) in this movie. He works for the Elysium government but he still lives on the slums of Earth with his guys. The entirety of Earth is essentially the slums and the movie spends a lot of time on Earth, which I actually enjoyed. The location filming is fantastic and the setting is incredibly engrossing. You felt like you were in this world with them and caring about what would happen. The action sequences were so cool too. It's not tame though, there's very detailed blood and gore. And there's the robots, too, whom I can't even tell if they're actual set pieces or special effects. Whichever it is, they look so real.<br/><br/>Another real thing about this movie is the social commentary of it. Yeah, with District 9, Blomkamp gave us the themes of apartheid and racism, while wrapping them up in a really interesting and unique movie with aliens. In Elysium, we have the issues of immigration, healthcare, and class boundaries discussed in this movie. My dad would even point out how interesting they made it, like where a group of poor Earthlings take some illegal ships up to Elysium and Jodie Foster wants to deport them because they're technically illegal immigrants. It really makes you think about how society is in our world today. When a movie can do that, while still being an incredibly entertaining and engrossing sci-fi flick, you know it's gonna be awesome. And whether you agree with the societal themes or not, you have to admire how much passion Neil Blomkamp pours into this film. In 2013, it's pretty rare to see that and I really love it. Elysium is a fantastic sci-fi drama with some deep human elements, as well as some amazing action scenes and awesome sequences (there's a Bugatti spaceship... how is that not awesome?)"
"michaelgarykelley1994","7","1","4","19 December 2013"," One of the Most Important Films of Its Time
","With this film, I have had a revelation about how much I am truly learning to love and appreciate the science-fiction genre of film AND books. Even though this was an original screenplay, I was actually extremely motivated to go ahead and pick up Philip K. Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" (which became the very celebrated film, ""Bladerunner""). In doing so, I think I have already found a new author I will probably enjoy for the rest of my lifetime. To you, Neill Blomkamp, I send my regards.<br/><br/>Outside of the Earth, there is a spacestation built, called Elysium, where all of the wealthy of Earth relocate themselves to be away from the pollution and scum of the poor folk on the planet. Our protagonist, Max, runs into a mishap and must find a way to Elysium so that he can be healed in one of their miracle beds. These miracle beds allow the wealthy to live on and on, only to be killed by other humans, yet they are able to be immune to anything nature throws their way, to an extent.<br/><br/>When it comes to the acting in ""Elysium"", I must applaud every single actor. They have all given a fantastic performance, especially Matt Damon as Max. Not only is he layered, but I believe that many people who see ""Elysium"" will easily relate to him. He is a hard worker, much like the rest of the society in which we live. For a character not too focused upon, I must say that Matt Damon's old friend's daughter is well-casted with an excellent little girl. My heart cracked a little at the thought of her having cancer and dying slowly. Our two main villains, played by Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley are just extraordinary. They both suited their roles so very well, and I truly cannot see another person playing either. These were one-of-a-kind performances. The film is just perfectly casted, in all accounts.<br/><br/>The writing of this film is another one of Neill Blomkamp's exceeding accomplishments at writing political commentary in cinema. Not only is this a groundbreaking film, it is the type of film I would hold up to the likes of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""District 9"" (Blomkamp's past film). Neill simply manufactures brilliance within his storytelling, and his directing compliments what he writes for the screen. He knows exactly what to do with his ideas, how to execute them properly, and then he just goes along his merry way and crafts it into a subtle masterpiece. Excellent, EXCELLENT job, Blomkamp. You get less acknowledgments with the film academies than you deserve. This film also has some of the most jaw-dropping moments I've ever seen put to the silver screen.<br/><br/>With ""Elysium"" being a science-fiction action film, many people are probably wondering how the special effects were. I'll be frank: these designs for anything from ships to futuristic areas, to nonexistent laser weapons, to the stars in space is phenomenal. There are't many films with such great special effects, but it doesn't really shock me, being that this is a Blomkamp film.<br/><br/>The score, the familiar bass of ""Inception"", is definitely suitable. I wish this type of soundtrack would be used on more films nowadays. There is something truly intense about the note played in one solo cloud of thunder.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" is brilliant. There are no words in my vocabulary to describe how excellent the film really is. If you enjoy the genre, it is definitely a must-see for you. If you want a straightforward action film, it is for you. There is so much to enjoy about the film.<br/><br/>With all of that said, I'd be shocked if you hadn't already guessed what my fanboy self was going to rate the film with.<br/><br/>IMDb says that Blomkamp's next film, ""Chappie"" will not be released until 2015, so we've got a while to wait. But it will be well worth it, I'm sure. Check this out, readers.<br/><br/>Merry Christmas, and God bless!"

Taking humankind to the space era is always an interesting thought, but then the movie starts to introduces many technical flaws I lost counts well into the first 60 minutes of the movie. It seems the movie can't decide whether it's going to be a sci-fi, explosive action, love story, or something else entirely. In my personal view, it's a lame propaganda movie that got lost in the way.<br/><br/>The only shining jewel here is Jodie Foster, of course. She alone brings the 2 stars rating, even when the script forcing her character to be an inferior antagonist.<br/><br/>The plot is forcibly fed viewers with twisted idea of inequality in general, wealth disparity, and so conveniently ignoring and never explains the root cause of the problems.

","In a futuristic society, the poor live in squalor on a destroyed earth while the rich live on a beautiful space station called Elysium (hey, that's the title of the movie!). Max, a tough-as- nails but soft-at-heart felon turned worker, is exposed to radiation one day at the plant where he works and requires the treatment of a ""Med-Bed"" - the rich way to heal yourself and relax at the same time. So Max sets out to get healed with the help of a scruffy hacker named Spider and a childhood friend who has recently returned (from where?), but only if he can get past the nameless ruthless mercenary hired by evil bad Secretary of Defense Jodie Foster. <br/><br/>The one percent living on their own planet, and the poor banding together to exact revenge? Coming off the heels of Occupy Wall Street, this is just the movie the nation needs to heal itself and unite against the rich bad guys. But before the revolution begins, there are some questions we need to ask. How many rich people live on Elysium? The least someone can make annually to be part of the one percent is 300 grand. Lets round that up to 500 for the future...heck, let's round it up to a million. Say you have a couple hundred guys making a million, is that enough to build a giant spaceship capable of sustaining life for a hundred families? More so, how do you keep up with the costs up there? Surely it costs some hefty dough to keep those coal fires burning. Where does the money come from? <br/><br/>Jodie hates the bureaucracy of Elysium and aspires to be President, so she hires a sleazy businessman (William Fichtner) to rewrite the space ships code to install her as President. I'm sorry, what? By that logic, anyone could scrawl their name on the US Constitution and claim it to be divine proof they need to be President. Was she planning on all the bureaucrats of Elysium to just blindly accept her? Fichtner is so successful at rewriting this code (it's never explained in any future detail) that he installs it into his brain, only to - you guessed it! - get hijacked by a bionic Matt Damon, who steals said code. I know the movie hates rich people, but come on. Implanting stuff into your brain to safeguard information when someone can easily steal said information? <br/><br/>Max gets radiation poisoning. How? He works at ""the plant"". What does the plant create that radiates...radiation? It's never explained. He is told he has five days to live after he is infected. This plot line mysteriously disappears after he is turned bionic - did I forget to mention that? - by Spider. Does turning half your body into the Energizer Bunny save you from radiation poisoning? <br/><br/>Damon understandably jumped at the chance to make the evil rich look bad. Never mind the fact that a large part of this movie's $116,000,000 budget went to his bank account. But he gives up not even halfway through this movie. You can see it in his face, that slow realization an actor has that he is in a turkey of a movie. Apparently he was the director's second choice. His first? Rapper Eminem. Maybe it's understandable why he is so demoralized. But the worst part of the film is Jodie Foster. It's as if the audio designer forgot to record whenever she spoke, and decided the best fix would be to use a dubbed voice that sounded as far away from Foster as possible. She starts with a British accent, which turns somewhat French, and ends somewhere in Eastern Asia. <br/><br/>Some movies have a character or two that are unnecessary but there for an audience draw. They aren't needed to make the plot line progress. Here, it's as if every character matches that description. The only bright spot is Sharlto Copley, who seems to be the only one who cares about what's going on. <br/><br/>This isn't just a lousy movie. It's downright bad. This isn't even worth the price of a Redbox rental. Maybe if Elysium finds its way on to HBO, and you're tired of looking out the window, or you've run out of sleep aids, it'll be worth the drawn out hour and a half."

"MartijnVreugde","7","1","4","6 September 2013"," Worth the watch, especially for South Africans
","So I went to see the latest epic sci-fi film Elysium, the new movie by the South African born director Neill Blomkamp who brought us District 9. Remember the movie that made the word ""Prawns"" a swear word, yeah that one. As before the viewers from South Africa are privy to many of the insider jokes.<br/><br/>For those who don't know, District 9 was great, few movies in the Science fiction genre can really claim to be truly original, it could. It was dark, while still being humorous, satire mainly focusing on the treatment of an insect-like aliens confined to, in essence, concentration camps in South Africa.<br/><br/>Elysium actually shares many of the main themes of class, xenophobia, greed and totalitarianism, but this time round it's far more mainstream in it's conception. It is played out in a dystopian future, to say the world is a polluted mess is an understatement of colossal proportions, so naturally the rich have left it. The privileged have moved on to a space station called, you guessed it, Elysium. Naturally this station is nothing short of an utopia of living ease, many stunning gardens, people dressed in Armani for lunch and speak eloquent french while doing so. This all happens while those less fortunate below suffer a barbaric life of squalor. Matt Damon plays Max the protagonist a blue-collar ex- criminal trying to walk the straight and narrow in the world below, fighting in vain against the totalitarian system. Some comical times in how he talks to his mechanical superiors though. Then he gets a ""Full dose"" of radiation in an accident at his menial day job and thus has the required incentive to find a way to get up top for treatment. Oh, by the way, those on the station above have a medical table device straight out of the Stargate series (which Blomkamp was a 3D Animator for) that will heal you from anything, and I do mean anything well you'll see.<br/><br/>Now the cinematography and effects are phenomenal but the plot, well its not in the same league as what we came to expect. It's formulaic in its predictability but the formula is tried and tested and it's done so because it works, but still, disappointing. That being said I came out of the cinema entertained so can't really complain.<br/><br/>What I have to mention is that the performance that stole the movie for me (and the source of most of mine and fellow viewers laughs) was not that of Matt Damon nor of Jodie Foster, the nemesis, but that of Sharlto Copley (he was brilliant in District 9 as well) who plays the mercenary aptly named Kruger who is charged by Jodie's character to hunt down Max. I say aptly named because like Copley himself, Kruger is a South African 'Boet' through and through with an accent that is truly pushed to its limits. Seriously, he sings the whole of Jan Pierewiet, I swear! and the best is when he entices Max with this pearler ""Ja, Lekker and other Kak"". Even his helicopter has the South African flag on it which apparently is still the same in 2154.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, it's not winning any screenplay awards but it's worth the watch especially if you are from South Africa, then you won't be able to help yourself laugh at the awesome Saffa vernacular."

Only brainless idiots will enjoy this.<br/><br/>Really sad."
"cultfilmfan","5","1","4","27 August 2013"," Elysium
","Elysium wasn't particularly a movie that I wanted to see, but within the first while of the movie I thought it showed incredible promise. The premise and dealing with a subject that is very much a subject of discussion and debate today, the whole health care system, both in the United States and probably other parts of the world, is shown here in this story in what I perceived to be an imaginative and unique way of doing so. I was expecting the film to give me some food for thought and to give me something to think about and shed some light on what is a very controversial issue with a lot of people. While the film started strong and the premise looked like one that would deliver a satisfying, yet thought provoking film, was then thrown into the recycling bin and what we were left with was a gory, loud and unrealistic film full of lots of unbelievable action scenes, chases, explosions and good guy after bad guy more or less. The further Elysium, went on the more bored with it I got, and I checked my watch several times to see when it would eventually be over because once the action and the special effects started to take over and any shred of a story this film once had was totally gone, then I just stopped caring about the characters in the film, and the movie itself and I just wanted it to end. I just found that these long overblown action scenes were nothing new and just a display of special effects and action techniques that were neither interesting, or anything new to marvel at. I was a bit surprised by the end product, as I liked writer/director Neill Blomkamp's previous feature District 9, quite a bit. That was a film that was unique and with a good story that gave you a lot of food for thought and things to think about, but they also made it captivating and you cared for the characters and it was entertaining too. That is why I thought the first little bit of Elysium, showed such promise and I was hoping in a lot of ways that this would show and have a lot of the good merits of District 9, but they seem to have all been abandoned for action, explosions and blood and guts. The last half was almost a little too over the top in almost every was as well and some of it felt laughably bad. It's too bad this film didn't work because you had a very talented cast and crew who worked on it, but it seems all their efforts did not pay off. I think if Blomkamp had developed his screenplay better and abandoned all the action for a solid script that really had something interesting to say about the health care debate, but still have included the science fiction aspects and gave us something to reflect upon, then this could have been a great film. It just felt like Blomkamp got a bit lazy and instead of dazzling us with a great script, he chose to go the other way and supplemented the rest of the film with long, overblown and dumb action scenes. Elysium, was one of those films that I disliked so much, that I felt I had wasted not only my money, but my time as well by watching it. I hope that Blomkamp takes these words to heart and makes his next feature a lot more carefully because I really liked District 9 and this film showed some promise in the beginning, but overall did not work. I hope Blomkamp can make a good third film and I am confident that he will not just be a one hit wonder filmmaker with District 9, but he really has to apply himself for his third feature and overall abandon all the cheesy action for a good script, a task he is capable of and one I hope he achieves for his next feature."
"bobbobwhite","6","1","4","26 August 2013"," Began intelligently, ended stupidly
","Good story premise of an artificial planet, Elysium, where only the rich and otherwise privileged live in the mid-21th Century after earth has been ravaged by class warfare. The riff raff still suffer on Apocalyptic earth and live like criminals/animals. Effectively depicted was the ravaged look of a potentially human-destroyed earth(actually real life living conditions in today's District Federal in Mexico City...Ugggh). Matt Damon's character wants in the worst way to get up to Elysium to save his life. Of course, lots of obstacles to that come up. Duh.<br/><br/>The film broke down IMO when Damon's character got to Elysium and the explosions, bangs, gun play and other adventure film idiocy took over for the mostly intelligent beginning and the story resolved into a standard sci-fi adventure flick with way too many suspensions of logic and disbelief required to get through it. For one major flaw, where was the premium Elysium defense system when Damon's ship arrived to invade it? You would think the filthy rich would have a super-duper foolproof setup to foil any mongrel humans from getting in and soiling that fine nest. But, no. Thus, they got in. Dumb, but that's what allowed the downtrodden a very improbable win. Yea! for the downtrodden! IMO, an average sci-fi adventure flick overall, no more."
"chrysoberylz","6","1","4","26 August 2013"," Well, uh, Awful
","As this movie genre is Sci-Fi, I really expect something like, at least, awesome environment, robots, cyborgs, and everything hi-tech. And this movie's director is District 9's director. So I did have high expectation for this movie. But then when I saw the trailer I just frowned. The trailer is so awful and I do not see anything ""WOW!"" from this.<br/><br/>I still watched the movie. Same as the trailer, it is so awful. The first half of the movie can put me to sleep and at least the second half is better, although it is not really that ""better"". The only thing Sci-Fi is only that Elysium thing.. and the steel armor (whatever is that called, the armor attached to Max's body) and the weapons. I think the story is really ridiculous. To conclude Elysium's story in one sentence: everyone is just being egoistic. That's it. There is no better explanation than that.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are not so ""WOW"" or anything. Just plain characters. Plain and damaged characters. Matt Damon is not really good in this movie. I think he should just stay as Jason Bourne. Jodie Foster. Nah. Sharlto Copley is a great actor and I expect much from him. But he is just like a crazy killer with big weapons. Even his Murdock character (from The A-Team) is better than this.<br/><br/>The story has so many plot hole. Like, why Frey left Max when they were child? And then suddenly Frey showed up in a hospital where Max accidentally there? Ang then suddenly Frey had a daughter? And then Kruger kidnapped Frey and Matilda? Maybe some people think that it is just a normal story. No. It does not make sense at all.<br/><br/>So, I am really disappointed with this movie. It suggests nothing new. Well, I mean, Star Trek and Pacific Rim's idea is not new at all but they can execute all the things right in their places. This Elysium is just another ""failed"" Sci-Fi. Well, I think some of you who watched this Elysium may think in different way. Maybe you think that Elysium is good. Okay, I appreciate that. But personally I think this movie is bad. But if you still insist to watch it, okay, just watch it and have your own opinion."
"graves-michele","8","1","4","22 August 2013"," So, just how entertaining is global health care disparity?
","Gritty subvertainment. This movie pounds its message about global health disparity home. It's more dramatization than science fiction in its portrayal of a world in which some people have easy access to health care while others struggle to survive and are treated with shocking inhumanity. Elysium is to North America, Europe as Earth is to Africa, South America — it's barely far-fetched.<br/><br/>There are really few futuristic concepts, with the exception of the all too chillingly plausible idea that the rich will simply escape to outer space if the Earth gets too dirty and inconvenient. Today's space stations aren't quite so plush — yet.<br/><br/>Immigrants are treated cruelly, the luxuries of citizenship conferred arbitrarily. In one of the film's better scenes, the elite on their space station Elysium use a mercenary named Kruger to shoot down the illegal immigrants ship from Earth. Again, this just provides an illustration of the way things work — rich countries provide arms to do their dirty work indirectly. The movie hammered the point.<br/><br/>The world view is generally classic dystopia, basic ""Blade Runner"" (1982), and there are some annoying and tough-to-watch overused tropes including the rapist mercenary and a ""poignant"" child. Bleah. Meerkat?! There are also fast and furious, hard-to-follow, mano-a-mano fight scenes, cue the dub step, which seem to be standard fare of late. Rather exhausting.<br/><br/>Great casting, however, everyone was enjoyable to watch (Diego Luna! Wagner Moura!) although, unfortunately, some favorites are on screen as cannon fodder.<br/><br/>The film uses flashback moments to establish our protagonist's motivation, and again, there's not a lot new here for science fiction fans.<br/><br/>As an exception, the pocket watch symbol worked for me. It created a tug of emotion and a nice final moment. Appreciated that.<br/><br/>For a more entertaining version of global disparity/subvertainment, watch Andrew Nichol's ""In Time,"" (2011) with Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried."

","Such am amazing film, special effects are good, people blown up, and you see the body blown up good... And proper, which you don't see in these films often. Good acting, Jodie fosters voice though ... :/ that's the only bad point for me Max (played my matt Damon) try's to go the the Elysium so help himself from dying. It's not another annoying 'hero' trying to save some women, so that makes it great too. Simple but so every effective story line. From all the hate I gather that these people are those sad people who have no life and like to hate on most films, everyone in the cinema loved it, some cried, and many ""oohs"" and ahhhhs, because of the faces and legs being blown off. I tended to feel a lot of hate against many characters, which is great as it adds emotion.

","Synopsis: An ex-con working in a droid factory is accidentally exposed to radiation and is given only 5 days to live. His only hope is to make it to Elysium (space station for elites). However, things gets complicated when some extremely confidential data is downloaded in his brain.<br/><br/>Most of the attempts to infiltrate Elysium are shown in need of Health pod -- a device that can cure anything. Reserved only for the citizens of Elysium, health pods are not available to the residents of Earth. And this forms the basis of the movie.<br/><br/>The director has tried to weave in moral fibers within an out and out action movie and is largely successful in it. I also liked that he kept pace of the movie fast. While blending in elements of emotion, he made sure that it doesn't drag. Soundtrack is also nice and matches the overall mood of the story.<br/><br/>Matt Damon gives a good performance as an ex-con who is driven by his selfish motives. He doesn't care for the data stored in his brain and what good it could do to the Earth. All he wants is to save his own life by any means necessary. Another thing that I liked was that the director refrained from making protagonist a superhero. The exo-skeleton that was fixed on to him gave him subtle advantages. If this was any other movie, the exo-skeleton would probably have allowed him to become Hulk. <br/><br/>Jodie Foster as the iron lady leaves an impression. Though there is hardly any character development, it is shown that all her actions (particularly Immigration handling) are a result of her strong conviction and responsibility to save Elysium from the dystopic Earth.<br/><br/>Sharlto Copley as the sociopath Kruger deserves a special mention. His character gives this movie what it exactly needed. A strong and maniacal antagonist. <br/><br/>Though set in a dystopian future, this movie raises superb questions. Should special medical care be allowed only to the rich? Don't the life of poor mean anything? Can the Class divide be abolished in some way? It's great to see a movie with a real message behind it. Hope other directors take a hint and make movies with similar themes."
"luccewada","Null","1","4","14 August 2013"," Solid Sci-Fi Fare
","Although it is set 141 years from now, Neill Blomkamp's Elysium portrays a vision of Earth that would be more suited to a setting 1000 years ago. The citizens wealthy enough to afford a ticket have emigrated to the suburban environment of 'Elysium', where cancer can be cured in seconds and poverty is nonexistent. Everyone else is left breathing in toxic fumes and living in dire conditions on the planet we call home, wondering what they did to deserve this life. Andrew Niccol's In Time realized a similar world quite well, but unfortunately was highly ignored and proved financially and critically unsuccessful. Elysium, meanwhile, is getting far more attention both because it's director was Oscar-nominated for his last (and first) feature, District 9, and because it's star, Matt Damon, has a noticeably better reputation for making good films than In Time's lead, Justin Timberlake. Damon has been promoting this film by telling the press about it's ""political themes and messages"", which he apparently feels quite passionately about. However, any moral lessons from the film which Blomkamp and Damon are attempting to convey to the audience in relation to poverty and human rights are lost amongst the CGI landscapes and loud, violent battles displayed on screen.<br/><br/>Elysium begins with Damon's character, Max, on his way to work (on Earth), but being unfairly attacked by some robotic cops and beaten unconscious. This scene is a good indicator of what the rest of the film will be like- using regular sci-fi fixtures to tell a story which is all too realistic. Released from hospital, Max is immediately forced to enter a highly radiated chamber in order to keep his job, and becomes seriously ill as a result. He learns he has but 5 days left to live, and is hastily released onto the streets by the comically evil CEO of the company he works for, William Fichtner's Carlyle. Carlyle has all the film's funniest lines, such as ""Don't you dare breath on me! Cover your mouth!"" to a reasonably affluent Earth citizen. In fact, the film looks set to be quite funny for the first 15-20 minutes, as Max sits down with a robot parole officer to whom he must repeat words phonetically as we would to an automated phone operator. These traces of humor utterly disappear, however, after Max's accident, which sends the plot into a spiral of painful gore, intense shoot-outs and epic intergalactic explosions.<br/><br/>Damon has been on top form recently with his roles in Behind the Candelabra and Promised Land, and he carries much of the film on his newly thickened shoulders. That said, Sharlto Copley really is the standout, playing the single most hateful, terrifying character portrayed in a film of this scale in years. I will forever be going to lengths to avoid having to meet the man in person, as that would result in me scurrying away in fear. Jodie Foster's smaller-than- advertised 'role' (it's more of a cameo) is nothing to write home about, particularly since she hasn't given a good performance since Lambs.<br/><br/>If you enjoy watching spaceships land on dusty land (bringing back oh-so-fond memories of The Phantom Menace), you'll love this film. If you get your kicks from watching data rapidly transfer between hard drives (National Treasure-style), Elysium is for you! Using countless science-fiction clichés in an impressively subtle manner, Blomkamp has managed to make a film that is shockingly entertaining, considering it's dark roots, and outdoes such mediocre fare we've seen this year, like Oblivion, in everything from acting to visuals. It may not have the epic scale or sheer fun of Star Trek Into Darkness, but this is a nice break from the pure awfulness of some of the year's other sci-fi films."
"purrlgurrl","8","1","4","13 August 2013"," Terrific action film; failed allegory
","Much like Children of Men, the real subject of this film is the diaspora of émigrés from third world countries around the world who are unwelcome in the first world countries spanning the North Atlantic and Europe they are penetrating. <br/><br/>With his second major film, it's clear that political allegory (District 9's real subject is South Africa's apartheid) is the basis of Blomkamp's SciFi stories. Unlike District 9, this film stumbles in presenting its allegory coherently, therefore, some viewers during the screening I attended laughably seemed to think the story is all about Obamacare.<br/><br/>Blomkamp is a South African émigré living in Canada, which has had universal health care for 50 years, one of the magnets drawing immigrants to it from less developed countries. Canada also has very strict immigration and naturalization policies (more so than the US), which some in Canada have begun to question. But the situation depicted in the film could just as well be Europe, which also has a recent tradition of universal health care and feels itself under siege by third world immigrants. Meanwhile, the US continues to struggle unsuccessfully with its own issue of undocumented immigrants. These are the underpinnings of the film's story line, set in LA probably as a bow to US financing and to lend credibility to its American leads.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I found it wildly entertaining and was on the edge of my seat. I was also pleased to see Sharlto Copley on screen again. He was simply terrific in District 9. I keep expecting him to become a big international star once he gets to play a contemporary man in an A-list film."
"nloud127","7","1","4","13 August 2013"," The Best disappointment of the Summer
","Considering how many things it does right, ""Elysium"" is still a major disappointment. From the same director of the wildly original ""District 9"", Elysium similarly uses a futuristic syfy story to talk about issues that run rampant in the world today. The film follows the story of Max (played by Matt Damon), a down and out guy living in the year 2154, who aspires to eventually travel to Elysium, a luxurious artificial habitat made for the one percent of the overpopulated Earth to live on. Jodie Foster plays the role of a political figure on Elysium who seeks an opportunity to plot a coup, and Sharlto Copley gives a great performance as a mentally disturbed and extremely violent crony of Foster who is sent to kill Damon. The supporting cast though is not as charismatic. Every other character in the film is basically a Latino gangster who contributes to the struggling resistance group on Earth.<br/><br/>There is also another side to ""Elysium"", and that is being a summer blockbuster. While not tackling political issues, Elysium is a full on summer action flick; evil robots and all. The fighting sequences though sometimes approach a Quentin Tarantino level of bloody, and by the end of the movie I really just wanted the story to move along without any more stale fist fights.<br/><br/>Anyone hoping for a full fledged successor to ""District 9"" will be disappointed by ""Elysium"". Yet Neill Blomkamp has created a film that has enough appeal to attract the more educated Movie-goer and hormonal teenage boys to become a box office success. It may not be perfect, but ""Elysium"" is one of the better movies of 2013."
"tiffanyyongwt","7","1","4","13 August 2013"," My first conclusion ... If someone tells you that you are special and meant to do great things in future, there's a high chance you might...
","A quick disclaimer before I start writing my opinions about this movie. I will usually TRY not to watch any trailers or read up on the movies I am going to watch, so that I won't have any expectation or anticipation for the movie. However, I caught the trailer during one of my previous movie screenings and I will admit that this whole visual machine versus human kind of movie didn't really attract me.<br/><br/>My first conclusion after the movie was: If someone tells you that you are special and meant to do great things in future, there's a high chance you might have to sacrifice yourself for everyone. #sarcasmintended<br/><br/>The movie was good, but somehow, it felt bad in many different ways, My friend wanted to give the movie a 5/5 as he loved the visuals and flow of the story etc. But I beg to differ. There were a lot of jerky and messy fighting scenes, which I could see where the director was coming from, but it made me a little giddy trying to focus on their scenes. However, the Earth and Elysium scenes were beautiful and near perfect, and the technology doesn't make you feel like you are in 2154. I felt that it is more like a 2054.<br/><br/>Plot wise, it is pretty simple, the rich versus the poor and someone from the dumps try to get into the privileged society. Usually, it will be easy for me to relate to the storyline, but this time, I was hard for me to feel for any of the main characters. I think the two characters who managed to touch me were Julio, Max's friend and Matilda, Frey's cancer-ridden daughter.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: Julio sacrificed himself during their interception attack on Carlyle's spaceship, one of the few humane or emotional parts in the whole film. I had thought that Julio was just one of the few hooligans who made fun of Max and it was only at the scene where Max was fatally injured that I could see the depth of their friendship. A large part of the movie was about Frey's desperation to treat her daughter from leukemia. But I couldn't really feel that motherly love from her. It was Frey's (Emma Tremblay) little narration about the mouse and hippopotamus that moved me (you need watch till the end to know why).<br/><br/>For full review, visit: http://tiffanyyong.com/2013/08/13/elysium-movie- review/"
"Tehmeh","7","1","4","13 August 2013"," Well worth seeing.
","First things first: This is not the most intelligent Scifi movie some people were expecting it to be. Storytelling is not masterful here, many characters are just plot devices and shallow, there is little subtlety. It is very black and white and at times (you'll know when you see it) requires a little more suspension of disbelief than I originally thought.<br/><br/>That said, It's not a dumb movie at its core - it just keeps things simple. There is some obvious exposition, there is a message that's shoved in your face, and Elysium doesn't pretend to be anything else. Give it to me blunt anytime rather than Avatar-like pretentiousness. When you see it, expect a simple story with a simple message. <br/><br/>Some actors weren't doing their jobs as well as they could have, but Matt Damon surprised me. I'm not his biggest fan, but I've always liked him. He really surprised me. He carried this movie when it needed to be carried. The movie doesn't have time to develop his character to the fullest, but does it enough. Also, be prepared to watch your inner hipster cry, when child actor Emma Tremblay delivers a scene which you know is just cheap emotional manipulation, but she does it so well that you'll be moved nonetheless. I love when that happens.<br/><br/>The action is amazing. As we could tell from District 9, Blomkamp likes to make his action inventive. In Elysium, it's just that. Not only inventive but visually wonderful and often surprising too. Some people have said there's too much non-stop action. I failed to see that, I think there was just enough of it, and never non-stop. Elysium has also some very graphic violence which of course gets my thumbs up.<br/><br/>The music is playing with two simple emotions. Melancholy and Aggression. Sometimes the ambient-style howling might be too much, but still does its job. <br/><br/>What we have here is a simple story. Simple story, simple characters and simple emotions. Simple does not equal stupid or bad, just simple. People who are into hard SciFi will find plenty of things hard to swallow, and even though I'm not one, I had to suspend my disbelief a little too much at times. Anyway, effective story, very good performance from Damon, great-looking film with inventive action scenes. I'm glad I saw it. I was expecting a bad movie, but instead got a nice little effective film that has a heart."
"amitpaul75","7","1","4","12 August 2013"," Not much depth, but the surface looks nice
","Although competently made, Neil Blompkamp's sophomore effort comes as bit of a disappointment. A little more attention and effort toward the story and characters and Elysium could've reached the soaring heights of the first-rate thriller that was District 9. As it stands, Elysium turns out to be a solid sci-fi movie that features nice performances and a couple of well-constructed action sequences.<br/><br/>While District 9 chose to focus on race issues, Elysium decides to center class and immigration conflicts at the heart of its story. The story begins by basically explaining that, in 2154, the overpopulation of the Earth led to the construction of an outer-space utopia orbiting the planet. Those who can afford it may choose to live there, but those who can't are stuck in the hell-hole that is Earth, or specifically for the purposes of this story, L.A. Without trying to reveal too much, the protagonist Max De Costa (Matt Damon) is an ex-con on Earth. He has a singular goal of getting to Elysium someday, until things take a turn for the worse, and he must find a way to turn ""someday"" into ""very, very soon."" <br/><br/>From here on out it's pretty standard affair. The character development that gave the action in District 9 poignancy and heightened tension is not to be found here. Damon, Alice Braga, and Sharlto Copley all play their parts well, but just aren't given much to do besides look serious, scared, or scary, respectively. You want to care about the plights of the protagonists, and you want to find the villains menacing, but the scant attention to characters and dialogue make it hard to do so. Still, the visuals are striking and beautifully rendered, and the gun fights are well-choreographed (can't say the same for the shaky cam used on hand-to-hand combat sequences). What results is an entertaining, yet predictable sci-fi actioner. Elysium might contain big ideas and a fascinating world, but doesn't have anyone within the film to connect us to either."
"lionelchange","8","1","4","11 August 2013"," There are not many sci-fi movies that make you really reflect about humanity
","Let's first recall a little bit how District 9 became popular despite of its not-entertaining-enough visual effects. I would say it is the unique view angle that the director linked humanity to aliens (so you may only have watched few movies about human turning into aliens). OK, getting back to ""Elysium"", I would say such a link continues: people on earth struggle to fly to Elysium for a primary reason of healing their diseases. Around such a key contradiction, the plot progresses. <br/><br/>As others already pointed out, that is why this movie is ""smarter"" than many other Sci-Fi. You can imagine these are metaphors but the movie is fluent enough to make you focus on the story itself. Compared to District 9, the director now added something new and interesting in plot: droid, hacker, etc. That is where I love a lot. The director/writer put lots of thoughts in the hacker part of the story and I, as an IT professional in my real life, think it makes sense. <br/><br/>For a $100M-budget movie, the graphics part is just decent or probably not that satisfying. I consider it in a way that the director was making new attempts in visual effects but that's eventually not his strength so far. The final battle, where the director set it in a hallway with ""cherry-blossom""-like trees around, is more like the director's personal flavor in Japanese ninja style (but not really fascinating to me). The lack of love scene is also worth mentioning :-) Every time Max tried to make emotional communication with Frey, it didn't work out. Think about District 9 again, the dominating male actor is always the kind who puts deep emotion in his heart and appears somehow inhibited (is it a type of good man?) <br/><br/>Overall, I still have a high expectation for this young director, Neil Blomkamp's future movies, including an Elysium II. The good thing is I can always see new attempts but the movie would be cooler if the director is more all-round. For this movie, the scene on earth is the way very similar to District 9. Also, interestingly, as a South African- Canadian director, his District 9 was mainly filmed in South Africa while this one was in Vancouver, Canada (it should be the ""Elysium"" part, while the ""earth"" part is in Mexico). Therefore, I will be glad to see more fresh visual elements from this director for entertaining audiences better besides good stories and concepts."
"FilmMuscle","8","1","4","11 August 2013"," Another Solid High-Octane Sci-Fi Entry from Blomkamp
","Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's second entry in the Sci-fi genre, following the tremendous success of District 9, which I loved. Now, all the pressure was on Neill Blomkamp to follow up to such a ground- breaking Sci-fi film that'll likely go down as a classic in the near future. Anyways, I hope too many don't mind because I just might go off on a political rant during the review as the film, itself, encourages such discussion- criticism on our way of living and the way we deal with medical care as a whole- because a surprising amount of critics and average movie-goers are panning the film, and a lot of them are blasting its political message, being that our current state of affairs will lead to a world where the poor will be left with no medical coverage or security whilst the privileged (the rich) live on some distant technological land in space where they have instant medical services and, basically, all the resources and attention is focused on such people, which make up a very miniscule portion of the total population, proved by the relatively small size of Elysium (the land occupied by the wealthy) when compared to Earth. Now, I promise I won't be spoiling anything, but the ending has left countless individuals enraged by its implications- most of them being conservative. Actually, I'm pretty sure a lot of people were completely fine with the world and the handling of affairs in the film because they're selfish, ignorant, and simply uninformed. <br/><br/>Continuing on, one of the films greatest feats is its cinematography, ranging from the gritty and hopeless look of Earth to the beautiful and paradisiacal look of Elysium. In addition, the film's concept is fairly unfamiliar, and even if some people complain about it being familiar, oddly enough they rate films like The Avengers with a 92%. Elysium isn't all about explosions and pointless clichéd fights; it carries with it a weighty message that will leave concerned and informed individuals thinking about our functionality as a society. Those are the kind of films that should overcrowd the numerous superhero and zombie movies out there. And before someone approaches with the bullshit of it being my opinion, it's really not. It's more of a proper form of filmmaking- strong and memorable storytelling that isn't infested with Hollywood clichés. <br/><br/>On top of all that, the cast is great. Matt Damon (Max), as usual, delivers a fine performance as does Sharlto Copley as the film's twisted villain (Kruger). Now, again, if people want to read paragraphs of the premise for the film, then look elsewhere. I hate when stories are spoiled for me, and I don't understand the kind of people who're willing to view 5-minute trailers that explain every single twist and turn in a certain film. Sorry, if you want to hear more about the characters or story and spoil yourself, I'm not going to be doing that in my reviews. What I'll be doing is critiquing the film's overall quality without compromising anything you'd be much better off surprising yourself with. All I'll say is that Earth is facing overpopulation and lack of resources to support its inflammation. Thus, the wealthy relocate themselves up to an open ship (How is this possible? I never understood how.) in space while the rest of the population have no choice but to suffer back on Earth. There is no middle class- you're either rich or poor, and this concept does a great job of presenting us with the potential consequences of the ascending division between the social classes of today. <br/><br/>And so, with that being said, Elysium is able to provide the audience with a highly fascinating and believable concept all while presenting spectacular visuals from the futuristic guns and technological equipment to the impressing explosive action, and in that regard, the film does well to balance the drama and the action cleverly instead of overloading its watchers with non-stop, intense, and messy action that spans thirty to forty minutes. Neill Blomkamp trusts his viewers and hopes they possess the intelligence to enjoy such a story instead of desperately longing for setpiece after setpiece of invincible characters pummeling each other. <br/><br/>After all has been said and done, Elysium is a breath of fresh air, but it never matches District 9's rare quality. In my book, a masterpiece has to shock you with its superior quality and keep you in your seat from beginning to end, making sure your eyes don't leave the screen. I'm not sure if it was the pacing or my attention span, but Elysium couldn't hook me that way. So, I can't rate it a 5. I just can't. The film's final act transforms into a casual-audience-friendly conclusion after awing us with its enthralling first two acts. As I previously stated, it might feel slightly familiar (according to numerous critics), but it tries hard to stand out from the crowd. At the end of the day, I can say that Elysium is definitely one of the best films of the year so far, and moviegoers would be utterly insane to miss this experience."
"samanosuke19","7","1","4","11 August 2013"," Elysium: A gated community with one hell of a HOA
","Elysium was by no means what I had hoped for but was an enjoyable theater experience nonetheless for any SciFi nerd. The CG was superb and the set and design teams did an amazing job. Overall the acting was effective, primarily from Jodie Foster(Delacourt) and Sharlto Copley(Kruger), complimented by the rest of the cast who were fairly believable in their roles. <br/><br/>Where Elysium falls short is primarily in the story. There were so many plot holes that it actually began to hinder me from completely enjoying the film. Truth be told its a SciFi and plot holes are expected but in abundance can become overwhelming. *********SPOILERS BELOW*************<br/><br/>*********SPOILERS**********<br/><br/>My biggest grudge with the film was why the inhabitants of Elysium horded the machines that were capable of curing any physical ailment. You would think a machine of such capabilities would be hard to come by or cost some unforeseen toll for using it. Unfortunately, they appear in the film as a standard household appliance. Not only that, the machines work in mere seconds!! The film even contradicted itself having Med shuttles with over 30 machines in them. If every house already has one of these machines, it works instantly, there is no war on Elysium, and the main concern in keeping Elysium secure is keeping the inhabitants of earth out, why in gods name were these shuttles even created? Better yet, why weren't they already on earth healing people? Even the machines themselves contradicted the purpose of Elysium. Elysium was created because of overpopulation on earth, which inevitably leads to pollution. If you've created a machine that essentially is the fountain of youth, are you not setting yourself up for overpopulation on Elysium?<br/><br/>The idea of Elysium wasn't established to the audience. To me Elysium was nothing more than a gated community for the rich and famous. There were no signs of its actual independence or separation from earth aside from its obvious distance. In fact, it was Elysium that still needed earth. Only by standing on the shoulders of the many could these people reach such positions of power. The inhabitants of earth simply had to go on strike at the factories of these powerful people or boycott their products until their ethical and humane demands of being healed were met. Not only that, if history has taught anyone anything people are willing to go to war for less. Boston Tea Party much?<br/><br/>Another small but annoying plot hole was when Elysium was reset. In resetting itself the film clearly showed the entire place shutting down i.e. losing power, lights, etc. Remember we are living in space on a man made creation with artificial gravity and atmosphere and we've suddenly lost power? Lets just think about this a few seconds... <br/><br/>******END SPOILERS******<br/><br/>Don't let my critical nature prevent anyone from seeing this film in theaters. It really wasn't that bad of a movie. It wasn't as good as Pacific Rim, but the films more positive areas made it reasonably close.<br/><br/>What the film should have done was made living on Elysium itself the very cure to ailments. You have a beautiful man made world with an atmosphere and every other element controlled by humans. The world was essentially pure and could be maintained so, allowing such things as long life and health to be possible. Even faster regeneration from physical trauma could be feasible if explained by mixing certain elements into the atmosphere. To contrast the beautiful world, the entire population of Elysium would have to be ugly. By ugly I mean share similar personality traits like Delacourt and Kruger who abuse the people of earth for their personal gain. X leads to Y and Matt Damon goes to Elysium for whatever reason, but ends up destroying it. The way Elysium is destroyed happens in a way that it is totally disintegrated so it doesn't leave massive debris to be sucked into earths gravitational pull. Instead all that is left from Elysium is a glitter like haze which comes into our atmosphere. The SciFi twist would be the ashes of Elysium inadvertently begin to heal the people of earth."
"seansaddress","8","1","4","10 August 2013"," Elysium Review.
","Elysium is a good movie because of the special effects, an entertaining plot line, and Sharlto Copley's acting as character Kruger. This movie, like District 9 before it, has amazing and realistic special effects and direction for that matter. Neill Blomkamp has a style that is unmatched. His movies are futuristic, beautiful, and strikingly realistic looking. The plot line of Elysium my be interpreted as left leaning in that it is about equality and caring for everyone. I thought that the film to a story that should be told in a creative and action-packed method. Lastly, Sharlto Copley is the best there is. Maybe it's just my sick sense of humor, but there is no better villain than the character Kruger, played by Copley. He is convincingly evil while incredibly likable, which creates a great villain. In the end I am almost rooting for Kruger. His actions are totally unpredictable. He stole every scene. The movie is worth seeing for Copley's performance alone."
"movielover1913","7","1","4","9 August 2013"," Goes Down Swinging
","This movie is not a completely successful one on an artistic level. Imaginative, well-produced, gorgeous art direction, costumes, settings, but it fails on some key levels for me in terms of story. However, the real test of a good movie is the suspension of disbelief and the degree to which you are entertained. In this sense, the movie may ultimately fail but it goes down swinging.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's character never truly comes to life for me. He has been excellent in other action pieces, the Bourne Identity movies come to mind. But here he has almost nothing to play with. Flashbacks of his childhood with a young girl from the orphanage run throughout the movie to give us an emotional connection that just doesn't work. Still, Damon is nothing if not talented and he tries to deliver.<br/><br/>Arguably the brightest element of the movie is Jodie Foster, who plays a futuristic version of Christine Lagarde, only prettier and sexier, who holds the position of Defense Minister of Elysium. She gives a coolly elegant portrayal in her sumptuous, tight dress suits and cutting edge hairstyle. When she's not on screen the movie loses some of its spark.<br/><br/>An interesting note about future class distinctions; Earth is, of course, where all the poor people live; it is multi-cultural with an interesting mixture of Spanish speaking and English speaking population groups. Elysium is where the plutocracy lives. It, too, is multicultural in the sense that you have a diversity of colors, and both women and men in positions of influence, but it seems to be characterized by people who come from a French and English speaking background. In Elysium there are moments when people speak exclusively in French (with English subtitles), just like on Earth there are moments where people speak exclusively in Spanish (including Matt Damon's character). This is an interesting take on future class distinctions and it happens so frequently throughout the film that it is clearly intentional, and thought-provoking. It's as if the American East Coast elite and the British City of London financial power-players joined forces in a plutocratic melting pot with the Grande Ecole upper echelon officials and chief executives of the French Republic.<br/><br/>Worth seeing, but catch a matinée."
"merdiolu","7","2","14","9 August 2013"," Elysium : A Movie with certain sci-fi vision whatever you like it or not
","First of all I really missed Sharlto Copley's heavy South African accented f-bombs. It is great to hear them again.<br/><br/>That being said lets get on the review. You can point one constant fact about Neill Blomkamp so far. He does not mind about being politically correct , non -offensive , family friendly or child/studio/box office friendly , PG-rated work. In his productions he shares what he thinks with audience , sparing nothing about his vision of where we are or where we are heading , putting effective real life examples or analogies about main themes or subjects of his scripts. You might not agree about him. But he creates a controversy a discussion about issues we can not ignore. That is his strength and what makes his movies so fun , interesting. Not like Disney funded banal and boring comic book stuff which became shallow formulatic and predictable as hell just to make BO profit by trying to appeal everyone and we are forced to watch on screen every year. District 9 ( which was a great piece of work) was about racism , xenophobia and apartheid. It struck hard. Elysium is about massive illegal immigration , health care , social/income inequality we are forced to face more and more each passing day. Blomkamp basically says that we can not afford to ignore them anymore. Though the actions of main protagonist Max DeCosta we are faced with a desperate man driven to desperate means. In 150 years Earth became a gigantic slum , a Barrio from Mexico City. (most of the film was produced there so it is not surprising ) Pollution , over population , automation of certain services and extension of life created a hell on the planet. When Max played by an subdued Matt Damon has a fatal work accident in the plant he was working (did I mention that Work Safety Regulations , Employee Rights , Unions all vanished as well ) that will cause his demise in a few days he goes on a path that will either save him or kill him a few days earlier. Desperate people and their actions. Alice Braga as Frey Max's childhood crush and Wagner Moura as Spider tag along as well. <br/><br/>Then there is Elysium. A huge O'Neill class rotating space station in high orbit of Earth , an orbital habitat , a paradise for humans. A place where extreme pleasure , health care and life can be experienced through technology that was denied to masses. Jodie Foster who emphasizes her detachment from humanity by her fluent speaking French discussion in her first scene then orders shuttles full of immigrants approaching Elysium to be shot down coldly plays Defense Minister of Station Delacourt who oversees tight immigration procedures and makes no one who does not belong to a rich privileged class comes to station. She is OK with this character. But from antagonist types from the movie two other characters over shines her. First company CEO John Carlyle who is played by sharp cold uncompromising straight William Fichtner. The other is great Sharlto Copley who plays a sociopathic , unpredictable creepy South African mercenary / bounty hunter named Kruger. He is basically dealing with dirty work on Earth for Elysium administration.<br/><br/>CGI and other visual effects along with camera work is great in my opinion. Droids are cool and cold without any sense of empathy or emotion. Action is great but not over the top or oh look Green Screen overload type of thing. It is adequate.<br/><br/>What this movies missing I think is overall sharpness or much more uncompromising attitude of District 9. That movie dealt with our world and our society in a much more harsher , ""in your face"" way. Here Blomkamp seems to take a back step , made Elysium s little more audience friendly maybe probably due to studio pressure. Another disappointment is script's similarity to District 9. Characters , their motivations , sequence of events are all to similar. One might even say that Sharlto Copley called his workmate David James from District 9 and asked him how to act like a crazed mercenary. Still one hell of a movie definitely one to be watched in theater with big screen. 7,5 would be closer to my final rating."

","I saw this in the theaters. it was larger-than-life, with plenty of exciting action sequences, special effects, and dramatic scenes. But I left with a frown. A movie should be an overall pleasant experience for ten bucks.<br/><br/>I left with a frown because it just... I can't relate to any of this crap. No, I DON'T f***ing automatically identify tattooed ex-cons as the good guys, you presumptuous leftist nerds, I actually identify them as dangerous members of the underclass. So trying to prop them up as these unfairly marginalized angels misses my heart and splatters against the wall.<br/><br/>Whatever, what really annoyed me about Elysium is that it was dreadfully serious about ramming some kind of message down my throat, but that message (as far as I can tell) was that class warfare would be a GOOD THING. I think this was tailor-made to be swallowed by most people because it's currently fashionable to demonize the rich and not ask questions about why the poor are poor. <br/><br/>Economic inequality exists, but to just jump to the conclusion that diversity through force is a good thing without asking any questions as to why those two groups came to live in those circumstances in the first place? Retarded. Maybe the Earth deserves its squalor and overpopulation because stupid people are crapping out babies they can't or won't take care of. Or that there's no nuclear families. <br/><br/>Most reviews are focusing on the plot holes. These are a little annoying (he sure is dying a long and vigor-filled death by radiation poisoning), but these don't bother me nearly as much as the pro-class-war message this gleaming multi-million-dollar behemoth is pushing."
"michaelhirakida","9","1","5","14 August 2013"," A Masterpiece and One Of The Greatest Films of all time.
","When I went into Elysium, nothing happened at first. But, I noticed I was watching something else. A classic. Elysium is hands down the best film of the year so far and with good reason. Elysium is a new prediction of the future which takes place in the year 2154 where Max who works at a robot factory is accidentally one day gets a huge dose of radiation. He has five days left to live and must get to Elysium, a world like space station that is inhabited with the rich while being chased by Agent Kruger.<br/><br/>The film has heavy handed symbolism. Example: Fray's daughter tells Max a story about a Meerkat and a Hippo. The Meerkat represents Earth and The Hippo represents Elysium. The Hippo and Meerkat come together at the end. This means a lot for the story.<br/><br/>The performances are incredibly strong and frightening including Shalarto Copley as Kruger. He needs a nomination and a Oscar. NO. He needs a Oscar win. This is one of the best performances ever.<br/><br/>Blomkamp is the master of visuals. His gory and epic effects show a huge step up in the history of science fiction epics. This film also can be compared to science fiction epics such as Silent Running and Star Wars.<br/><br/>Elysium in years to come I think will be hailed as one of the greatest films of all time and will be studied in film schools. It is that important of a film.<br/><br/>99/100 A"
"jaiden","1","1","6","11 May 2014"," What a waste of time! LOTS OF SPOILERS!!!
","Okay, once again I wasted my time watching a crappy movie just so I could write an educated review based on personal knowledge and not second hand information. My summary: I want my 2 hours back.<br/><br/>What a piece of crap! This is a blatant anti-anti-immigration film that is nothing more than an esoteric blast at America. Think about it...<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!! DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO RUIN THE MOVIE FOR YOU - WHICH WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE A BAD THING, TRUST ME! Elysium (the word, not the movie) is defined as 1) Also called Elysian Fields. Classical Mythology . the abode of the blessed after death. 2) any similarly conceived abode or state of the dead. 3) any place or state of perfect happiness; paradise.<br/><br/>So the premise of the movie is that there is a gigantic space station orbiting the earth where there is nothing but happiness, bliss, and eternal life, care of machines that can even reconstruct your face if it is blown off by a grenade or completely cure you of leukemia. But, the ""problem"" with this station is that the only ones allowed there are the rich people who are only so because of their complete disregard of the deplorable working conditions of those on Earth supplying them with their riches. Those on Earth (which looks a lot like Mexico City where it was filmed - surprise, surprise...) are nothing more than cattle trying to eek out a living without access to proper medical care and who are treated like vermin by the robot police. To try and escape their plight, they board shuttles and try to illegally cross the border of space, land in paradise, break into anyone's home to use what doesn't belong to them, and then cry, complain, and moan when they are caught. Oh, and the one who succeeds in thievery are doing it for their child. How heartless we must be if we think this wrong... So, in a desperate attempt to save himself, the ""star"" allows himself to be turned into a cyborg to steal valuable information that will make every illegal legal so that they all have free access to what they didn't earn...and he valiantly sacrifices himself in the process.<br/><br/>Gee, really? Could this movie be anymore obvious? There are so many things wrong with this film, I don't know where to start or when to stop.<br/><br/>1) Why does everyone on the station speak French or with a French accent? More specifically, why does Jodi Foster even try? She sounds like she's chewing glass trying to get through until her merciful death.<br/><br/>2) Everyone on Slum-Earth speaks Spanish, English, or Spanglish.<br/><br/>3) The station's dwellings are pristine with marble steps up to immaculate mansions with clear crisp clean pools.<br/><br/>4) Earth is trashy, dusty, and just downright nasty.<br/><br/>5) The healing machines on the station never touch the patient. A magic want scans, diagnoses, and heals them in about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>6) The operation we are subjected to on Earth is the stuff of horror films, with power tools, rusty knives, and a tatted doctor wearing a butcher's apron. Oh, and blood everywhere.<br/><br/>Basically in a nutshell, don't waste your time. Elysium the film is nothing like the paradise it tries to emulate."

","Basically, writer & director Neill Blomkamp's futuristic ""Elysium"" amounts to a 21st century version of the Fritz Lang sci-fi classic ""Metropolis."" Two kinds of people live in the dystopian future. The wealthy are the hopelessly wealthy, while the woebegone are the dirt-poor people. Everybody who is nobody, like poor Matt Damon's messianic protagonist who lives on Earth in Los Angeles in the year 2154, constitutes the woebegone. Max is a car thief on parole who toils in a factory where he gets zapped accidently by enough radiation to die in five days. Amazingly enough, the wealthy reside in outer space on an elite, gated community called Elysium which is strictly off-limits for everybody but the financially well-to-do. These affluent people live with everything at their disposable. They have a booth, not unlike a tanning bed, that they can crawl into that enables them to heal themselves no matter how desperate their condition. Indeed, a deceased villain is healed and restored to life in one of these miraculous pods. Blomkamp contends with serious contemporary social issues such as immigration, health care, and corruption in this quasi-escapism. The action scenes are undeniably exciting as well as suspenseful. Blomkamp has managed to make a thinking man science fiction movie where the commentary doesn't get in the way of our hero and his heroics. He strikes a deal with a Hispanic hacker on Earth, Spider (Wagner Moura of ""Narcos""), to commit the ultimate crime. Spider promises him that he will send him up to Elysium where Max can heal himself. First, they give him fake citizenship. Second, Max needs to download everything in an elite factory so Spider can destabilize the economy. Max must commit a form of rear lobotomy on a high-ranking factory officer, so Spider can acquire the codes. Meantime, treacherous Secretary Delacourt (a gruff Jodie Foster of ""The Beaver"") is in cahoots with John Carlyle (William Fichtner of ""The Lone Ranger"") who has designed safeguard system that prevents the thugs on Earth from breaching Elysium. Earlier, she had ordered the destruction of multiple shuttles that penetrated Elysium's air-space, which President Patel (Faran Tahir of ""Iron Man""), had reprimanded her about. As it turns out, Patel is Delacourt's sworn enemy and opponent in the government. Delacourt legitimized her orders that the shuttles be destroyed because she was protected the asylum of Elysium from outsiders. Sharlto Copley, who starred in ""District 9,"" plays a sadomasochistic troubleshooter named Kruger who works for Dealcourt behind the scenes and revels in his bloodthirsty work. After Max and his minions ambush a shuttle heading for Elysium with Carlyle aboard, things get out of control. Copley really chews the scenery as the obnoxious antagonist. Earlier, Delacourt had been forced by a higher authority to deactivate Kruger, but now she requires his murderous talents. The information that resided in Carlyle's noggin has been downloaded into Max's skull. This ambitious sci-fi saga surpasses ""District 9."" The use of Spanish subtitles, since L.A. has degenerated into a place like the slums of Rio, helps audiences share in the third world atmosphere that Blomkamp wanted to generate. Critics have noted that ""Elysium"" resembles not only the plot of an original ""Star Trek"" episode ""The Cloud Minders,"" and later they would compare it with ""Alita: Battle Angel."" The unfortunate part of this action-packed adventure is that our hero must die to save others. Ultimately, the ending seems too far-sighted."

'Elysium' couples elements of Blomkamp's first success, with shiny new advances that arouse further expansion of the genre itself. The story, though somewhat linear, suffers from predictability, however, the roles of Damon, Foster, Fichtner and most irrevocably Copley, propel the story through almost seamlessly-intermixed with dazzling visual spectacles.<br/><br/>While some may mourn the departure of the 'Halo' movie, 'Elysium' aggressively ""mans the reins"" with fervor, passion, and dedication.

","This as a brutal disappointment after the very high bar set by Neill Blomkamp's darn well near perfect District 9. By and large it, like most movies I guess, boils down to the weakness of the script. District 9 was ingenius when it came to its three dimensional characters and how it worked them, especially the film's main character, into a brilliantly structured narrative. All aspects of this narrative, including depth of character, in Elysium feels thoroughly limited to the first dimension. But it was not all bad. Acting, visual effects, production design: everything except for writing and directing were firing on all cylindars. Returning to Elysium six years later (wow, time flies when you're watching mediocre movies) as well as Chappie (a few less year than that), makes me think about what Blomkamp was been up to since. What's it called? Oats Studios I think? Dude, and this mean to be constructive, as I am a major fan of your genius first feature: your problemo is not building online fanbasses to rallying behind short films concepts. What you need to do is invest in writing very good full length screenplays. Get object feedback on your drafts. Hire the best writer(s) if you're not getting the results on yoru own. Everything else is just a massive waste of time and money."
"uselessDM","5","0","1","24 March 2019"," Bloomkamp, for good and for bad
","This movie overall is good, it's well made and the action is fine, Matt Damon works in the title role, although it feels just like he is playing Jason Bourne again, but I'm not complaining about that.
The problems stem from the fact that first the world on earth doesn't work at all, since it is supposed to be 150 years in the future, but looks more like Nigeria today, with some future tech sprinkled in there, but it's clearly not enough to make it believable.
The other, more major problem in my eyes, is the fact that Blomkamp can only deal in very blunt topics that lack all subtlety, he is extremely placative and that really brings this movie and also District 9 for example, down. In District 9 it was how terrible we treat refugees and here it is how terrible the 1% are, get it? Get it? Really? Do you get it, or do you need me to make it more obvious for you? Is what Blomkamp is probably thinking during the filming of his movies and it really annoys me while watching said movies.
Also the ending is just action schlock that leads to a more or less happy ending, which might be necessary for a big poduction like this, but really doesn't help the movie."

Is it revolution (war), on the other hand, the only way possible to reach for such desired outcomes? Are these elysian worlds possible at all? Or are they rather the product of a tired, frustrated soul that has become unable to withstand the neverending, uneven randomness of this harsh, unfair world of ours, and so, cannot digest it anymore without first sweetening it up considerably, without softening it up here and there everytime it contemplates it and reflects on it, to the point where it has become irretrievably hooked on this anaesthetized, highly idealistic view of things? Has Hollywood become a victim of its own ""happy endings""?<br/><br/>After watching movies like Elysium, you can't help it but answering in the affirmative. An attrocious movie in so many respects, Blomkamp's embarrasing shallowness and corny sentimentality permeates the whole story in highly annoying fashion; the old, simplistic, pretty much childish, and ultimately corrupting ""All you need is love"" philosophy (love = solution to all problems; lack of love = selfishness (?) = the beginning of all that's evil), as the guiding principle throughout.

"stevenrotherforth","7","0","1","18 October 2018"," A movie that must be watched in Ultra High Definition
","Elysium<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp's science fiction actioner starring Matt Damon was a much more enjoyable experience second time around.
I remember watching this movie upon its home DVD release and not being overly impressed by his follow up film to the excellent District 9.
However a recent revisit has changed my view of this movie.
I streamed Elysium in UHD and I have to say this movie looks absolutely gorgeous.
If there's a film made to show off the merits of those extra pixels then this is it.<br/><br/>Set in 2154 where the very wealthy live on a paradise space station. Life is good for those who can afford it.
Technology has become so advanced that those who live on Elysium can even cure the most acute of illnesses.
Max played by Matt Damon needs to get up there to cure himself as he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation whilst working in a robot factory back on Earth.
Our planet is also dying. A baron waste land filled with poverty and disease.
Crime is rife and those stranded on the decaying planet will beg, cheat,
kill and steal to stay alive.
Blomkamp's film mirrors real life as the rich get richer whilst the poor get poorer.
With some stand out performances from both Damon and Blomkamp's go to man Sharlto Copley, Elysium is a fine film of the genre.
It is special effects and prop design that steal the show.
Neill Blomkamp's films have a distinctive look and those in the know can spot his work a mile off.
Futuristic machinery has a very worn industrial texture.
Almost reminiscent of Ridley Scott's work on the Alien movie.
I got instantly excited when I read that Blomkamp may reinvigorate that franchise.
Sadly this has never come to fruition.<br/><br/>In Elysium every piece of technology and environment looks believable.
For example the rich CEO guy's Bugatti space shuttle looks like something that Bugatti would actually make a hundred years or so from now.
CGI blends seamlessly with practical effects giving Elysium a very pleasing experience for the eyes to feast upon.
The crisp image quality in UHD format elevates the action and gives the movie a three dimensional feel even when viewed in 2D.
The Elysium space station looks magnificent as the camera approaches.
The effects are so believable that at no point does the brain question what is happening onscreen.
There are some stretches for the imagination though.
The medical bays that every home on Elysium have are a little far fetched.
They're basically a bed that scans for injury or illness and then magically remedies the ailment.
They can apparently cure anything. Even when Kruger (Sharlto Copley) has his face removed by an exploding grenade. The medical bay miraculously rebuilds his entire face and the front part of his skull in a matter of seconds.
Still the CGI used to demonstrate this is mighty impressive.<br/><br/>Support from Jodie Foster is welcome and it's refreshing to see her take a role like this but it's obvious to see why she took the part of Defence Secretary Delacourt. It's a role that Foster is able to have fun with. Also William Fitchner is perfect as the slick and slimy CEO John Carlyle.
Elysium offers a good mix of talent both in front and behind the camera.
It's a movie that won't go down in history as a classic of the Sci-Fi genre but like all Blomkamp's movies it's a film to be admired.
He's a director that makes movies with his own unique
look and style. For that he must be commended.
More good news arrives that Neill Blomkamp has announced he is to make a direct sequel to the original Robocop.
Now that's something to get truly excited about!"

","Why the low ratings? Because the masses dont like these kind of DEPRESSING stories and according to the Imdb ratings they dont. I loved it though!

But the violence isnt heroic or ""funny"" as in many other Hollywood action movies.<br/><br/>The violence is mean and there is no typical happy Hollywood ending either. The (popcorn) masses dont like that either. Foreigners in leading roles are probably another downer for many (popcorn) movie consumers, although I thought it was refreshing and true to life, to hear foreign people speak in their native tongue.<br/><br/>All the technical skills of this movie are beyond good, they are excellent. And the fighting spirit of this movie is to die for as well! You gotta give this a try if you are a true scifi fan (Alien, Blade Runner) and are into underdog movies. Matt Damon is sort of a modern scifi version of Robin Hood.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" is both a heinous and glorious struggle between the rich and the poor, in which Matt Damon is the chosen one to defend the rights of the poor people on earth. In Elysium, Matt Damon is like Superman on crack: a righteous fighting machine, battling a wicked dictatorship who oppresses all the poor people on earth.<br/><br/>Elysium is a very intense blend of raw gritty suffering and hightech scifi action. Next to classics like Aliens and Blade Runner it is the most dark and realistic form of scifi I have witnessed in decades. Terrific, realistic portrayal of hell on earth!<br/><br/>It is one hell of an intense roller coaster ride. No time for breathers. Photography and soundtrack are thunderous and excellent. The acting is right in your face and real. The characters are humbling and in a constant state of panic ridden pain.<br/><br/>Is a new scifi classic born with Elysium? Time will tell. The story is too depressing, realistic and dark to gain mass popularity. But it is certainly among my all time favorite scifi movies. Seen it over 10 times now and I will certainly enjoy more viewings! What a thrill!"

It's always amazing to see some intelligence surging through a sci-fi, because it holds the vital gift of teaching viewers as they watch guns blazing and desperate people trying to fit in an illegal cruiser to Elysium. Damon is a great Max De Costa, throwing in strong physique with amazing wit whether in or out of his rad exoskeleton. Copley, scarred and absolutely terrifying, has a good chance of giving you nightmares, whether weakening De Costa to the point of death or showing no mercy with others at gunpoint. Foster's name shouldn't be on the poster because all she is is a merciless trigger for certain plot points. Foster's Delacourt basically sends Kruger out to kill Max, strengthens security on Elysium, and orders the download of something that changes the course of the plot.

But all they have to do is steal this reality, flip it, make the hard working guy a white boy, and these Millennials – who know about as much about history as a wino knows about building a laser gun – won't know the difference. While working for corporate giant Armadyne, Max's boss forces him to repair a machine and Max gets caught in it and is exposed to a fatal dose of radiation (shades of Yaphet Kotto in ""Blue Collar,"" where he was intentionally locked in a paint room at a car factor and died). Of course the boss who assigned Max to ""fix it"" knew it was hazardous and as Max is carried out of the radiation filled chamber, the boss disappears. This is the way they treated black men during the 1940s in the foundries in Detroit when it would get so hot their work boots would literally melt. At any rate, Max doesn't die, but is told by the doctors that he has only five days to live. While he's at the hospital he runs across Frey, who has returned and is working as a nurse. They begin to rekindle what they once had. As both ""We're the Miller"" and ""2 Guns"" made clear, Latinos are the order of the day. ""Elysium is no exception. The part of the world they are in, America, is not predominantly Latino and I didn't see three blacks together throughout the entire movie. At any rate, Frey's young daughter has a physical disability. Now, we've established the relationship, we have to talk about context. ""Elysium,"" is what the white man's goal is in real life: more segregation, this time based on class, not just race. They get all the good stuff – space, land, good health care, clean air, luxury – and the vast majority of people don't get squat. Is this not the way it was during ""white flight"" in the 1960s when blacks move to the city and white folks immediately packed up, left and created ""the suburbs""? This movie featured Latinos because that is the trick that is being used on the Millenials. Just as ""World War Z"" had a global, somewhat ""third world"" flavor, and ""2 Guns"" had a Mexican flavor, ""Wolverine"" had a definitive Asian flavor, and ""Lone Ranger"" was Native American, so it is with ""Elysium"" and its thrust toward Latinos from top to bottom: love interest, bad guys, corporate brains and so on. This ""multicultural cast"" dupes young people into thinking that everybody's the same, while the racist message of these white boys coming out as winners in every single scenario, is ingrained in their minds and as such, the myth of white supremacy is maintained. Sure, it's a movie NOW, but the theme is so typical of him: he creates another world, basically a giant satellite revolving around polluted earth, where only the wealth can live. In other words, for whites only. Wasn't that the same way it was during the days of legal segregation and isn't that the way it still is with all these ""gated communities"" and ""upscale habitats""? And as it is in real life, Elysium is the place where there is fresh air (ala the suburbs) and where you can get top notch medical care, including cares for all diseases. Meanwhile, earthlings inhale polluted air, live in the midst of squalor and suffer from high population density in high crime. In other words, a re-creation of the ghetto and barrio."

Elysium is a space station whose inhabitants live safe lives in a beautiful environment; where every home includes a medical device that can cure all ailments something those on Earth will risk everything to access. Max is an ex-con working in a factory on Earth until an industrial accident leaves him with only five days to live thanks to radiation exposure. The equipment on Elysium could save him in seconds but it doesn't cross the mind of the factory's Elysium based owner to help him.<br/><br/>Max must get there illegally and to that end he agrees to help a criminal commit and audacious robbery; they will capture an Elysium citizen and hack his cyber implants to access his vast wealth. To this end Max is given various cyber implants and a robotic exoskeleton. Things don't go according to plan though; their chosen victim has other very important information in his brain; information that will give control of Elysium to whoever uses it. An operative is ordered to capture Max and return him to Elysium so the data can be used in a planned coup. Max's criminal contact has a better idea though; he wants to use the data to make everybody a citizen of Elysium so that nobody will go without the healthcare they need.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable sci-fi action thriller even though there are some flaws and plenty of clichés. The action is exciting and sometimes quite bloody. The cast do a solid enough job with Matt Damon being pretty good as Max, although not as good as he was in the 'Bourne Trilogy', Jodie Foster is suitable cold as the Elysium Defence Secretary who is planning a coup and Sharlto Copley is delightfully over the top as the villainous Kruger does anybody have a stronger South African accent than this man!? The film is clearly trying to make a comment about social inequality but here the inequality it is so great that is seems unbelievable those on Earth all appear to be slum dwellers while those on Elysium live in mansions. Equally the health care inequality makes little sense; why are people on Earth denied access to the healing technology when they are working for companies owned by the people of Elysium?  Surely a healthy workforce is a more efficient workforce. This is a fairly minor quibble though and anybody wanting a good action film is likely to enjoy this it isn't a great film but it is rather fun."
"tom-456","3","0","2","18 October 2015"," The editing is so chopped up that all I from it was a headache
","Well, this movie is showing on FX, and I watched. It is pretty much what should be expected from this kind of science fiction movie, but a great deal of it was action and effects, including a lot of hand-to-hand fighting. I don't have any problem with action/fighting as long as it is done well. But with this movie the director and the film editors have done something that I disdain. The actors go through choreography very slowly while the people carrying the small cameras move around excessively, and then during editing, they cut up the film into little short segments that don't even last a full second. They apparently believe that a lot of camera motion combined with this type of film editing adds up to an action sequence. I do not agree. The word that comes to mind is ""jerky"", and it all it does for me is to leave me with a headache. The film segments that are spliced together ought to last for several seconds at a minimum, and the camera should remain in one place for the duration of any one film segment that lasts for at least several seconds. The jerky effect that they produce is not the least bit watchable as far as I am concerned. It is simply garbage. If I had seen this in a theater where I had bought a ticket, I would have gotten up and gone to ask for a refund of the ticket. If a movie were perfect in every other way, this cheap way of creating action sequences would still ruin the movie. And this movie doesn't have very much going for it, except for good special effects that every once in a while they let you see for more than a couple of seconds. The special effects are good but not enough to make up for the headache. When I want to see action, I want to see action, and jerky cameras combined with sub-second film splicing does not equate to action. Neil Blomkamp is obviously an idiot. This movie belongs in the garbage can, and I will never again see another movie directed by Neil Blomkamp."

It was delivered in the same inane way that District 9 was done, with about the same result...which is to say it had none. At least no coherent story to speak of.

Sure, there is a story or two in there somewhere, but they are buried with so much useless dialog and a bit of CGI thrown in that it is near impossible to figure out what happened to the world.<br/><br/>I thought I was being generous by giving it a 4 rating..."
"joeravioli","4","0","2","18 October 2015"," Shaky in more ways than one
","To tell you the truth, I'm still unsure as to why Neill Blomkamp's 2009 film District 9 still haunts me to this day. Perhaps it is the tear-jerking ending, where an emotion so pure, so moving, so poignantly hopeful is expressed to the audience. Perhaps it is its far-reaching and deeply compelling thematic ambition. Or perhaps it is its gratuitous, borderline horrific violence that pounds mercilessly at the senses until the film becomes almost impossible to watch, melting from a thought-provoking premise into an unmitigated, gleeful gorefest. Whichever it is, District 9 is a film that will confuse me forever.<br/><br/>Elysium, Blomkamp's second film, is a significant regression from District 9. It is loud, messy, and disorienting, wasting its promising concept and compelling cast on little more than a vehicle for visual splendor and forgettable action scenes. Its characters are poorly created, unexplored, and impossible to sympathize with. Even Matt Damon, who is usually quite good at playing the hero, is given a role that he can't really pull off.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that Elysium is entirely horrible, however. The visual imagination that went into this film (while reminiscent of District 9) is often wonderful to behold. There are numerous shots that are stirring (although there are just as many that are repulsive) in their depictions of a strange apocalyptic world that is fraught with injustice, crime, and social division. The concept is interesting enough to entertain, and a few nice touches by the director save the film from being an abysmal mess. But despite this, Elysium is a very poor film.<br/><br/>Elysium conjures up a vision of Earth, about 150 years in the future, where the rich have left the planet on a space station called Elysium and party it up while the poor rot on the Earth below. Matt Damon, an ex-criminal, has a job at a factory on Earth where he is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation, and informed that he has five days to live. In desperation, he joins a group to pull of an elaborate ""brain-heist"", and steals a bit more than he bargains for. Battles ensue, mercenaries arrive, and Blomkamp's awful shaky-cam direction makes about half of the film impossible to watch.<br/><br/>My main issue with this film was cinematography. The action scenes were shot in an unneeded frantic manner that them entirely incoherent and dizzying. Much of the film feels like it was shot with a hand-held camera. I suppose that shaky-cam may appeal to some people, but I hate it. I prefer to actually be able to see the action than bodies flying in and out of the screen, occasionally locked in combat, occasionally bloody as hell. It is rather tiresome to be subjected to such a level of movement without coherence, and for such an extended period of time.<br/><br/>I don't understand, Mr. Blomkamp. You have all this money. Why the heck can't you make an action scene that doesn't rely on shaky cam? <br/><br/>Another huge issue with this film is its characters, who are either unsatisfying, repulsive, or boring. Matt Damon plays a selfish guy who wants to live at all costs (but is still in love with a childhood friend), who is willing to put all those he cares about at risk just to save his own skin. It's very hard to sympathize with him. The main villain, the sociopathic security chief of Elysium, lacks motivation (as well as the ability to act). Her hatred and wish to preserve the social division is never explored in a satisfying manner. The main mercenary, Kruger, undergoes a random character change for no reason whatsoever, which is very cloying. It's also impossible to understand what he's saying half the time. The other characters are either cannon fodder or there to open doors, making them all rather boring.<br/><br/>The story is poorly paced, with the action beginning about an hour into the film's duration (the film is less than two hours long), and stalling at promising points to show some ""very emotional"" slo-mo, which never serves any purpose.<br/><br/>Elysium is a nauseating disappointment, too serious to fall into the ""so bad its good"" territory, and too shaky to even be considered as a solid action film. The CGI is solid, though, and that's all I can really say."
"bryank-04844","3","0","2","23 August 2015"," 'Elysium' loses interest quickly and fails to be very fun or entertaining.
","With 'District 9', Neill Blomkamp quickly became one of my favorite directors. He not only created a realistic world infested with aliens, the film's acting, action and politically-conscious story were nothing short of excellent. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about his second feature, 'Elysium'. While the sci-fi flick has some good moments, it's mostly wasted on lackluster storytelling.<br/><br/>In the year 2154, Earth has become overpopulated. People live in filth, work for crime lords, and are desperate to find food or health-care. Meanwhile, just a stone's throw away is a giant space station called Elysium, where the wealthy live in huge mansions surrounded by golf courses and over sized pools. More importantly, in every home is a machine that can fix any health issue, including cancer, severed limbs, old age and even death. Yes, residents of Elysium can live forever. Of course, the poor people on Earth don't have access to these machines.<br/><br/>The story follows Max (Matt Damon), a factory worker hoping for a shot to go to Elysium some day. After an accident exposes him to deadly radiation, Max learns that he only has five days to live. Desperate to get to one of those healing machines on Elysium, he enlists the help of a crime boss, who outfits him with a mechanical exoskeleton that gives him super strength. Elsewhere, Delacourt (Jodie Foster), one of the executives running Elysium, is charged with keeping the people of Earth from entering the space station, even if that means killing children. She's even hired a sadistic killer (Sharlto Copley) on Earth to help her with this job. Now, it's up to Max to save himself as well as the people of Earth.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with 'Elysium' is its story structure. We don't spend enough time with Damon's character to really connect with him. He doesn't seem like a particularly great guy, and his full back story is never truly revealed. Instead, we're rushed into action scene after action scene. The third act falls apart with too many things going on at once, and wraps up with a half-assed ending that could have been much more powerful.<br/><br/>The visuals and design are of course top-notch. The futuristic cars, robotic police officers and Elysium itself look phenomenal. Damon does a decent job, but seems a bit one-note. Copley makes a great bad guy, even if his accent is hard to understand at times. But then there's Jodie Foster. Good grief. She deserves a Razzie Award for this performance. It's downright laughable and almost ruins the movie completely.<br/><br/>Other than a few decent fight scenes and some amazing visual effects, 'Elysium' loses interest quickly and fails to be very fun or entertaining. Yes, we get that Blomkamp wants to make a political message about free universal health-care and the wrongs of the class system, but there are better ways to tell that story."

","Dear movie makers, you suck, the majority of you suck and you know why, you and your movies have sucked for the longest time and your audiences know it too. Shaky cam ISN'T the reason your movies suck, your movies would still suck even if you didn't use shaky cam because you probably think it's a cute cool effect (hint: it's not). Shaky cam does suck though and when you use it, good or bad you aren't doing your movie any favors.<br/><br/>It's sad that after all these years these movie makers just cant seem to fathom exactly why shaky cam sucks but I'll try to explain. When I watch a movie and the shaky cam starts up I am distracted by it so much that I start to pick on all the other flaws the movie has that I otherwise would have ignored because the movie maker has manged to immerse me in the fictional world they created. Which brings me to Elysium.<br/><br/>Elysium could have been a good movie but shaky cam in addition to other flaws makes this yet another movie that sucks to add to the crap pile. We've seen all these elements before in Sci-fi movies and Elysium certainly doesn't do any of them better. The biggest problem (besides the shaky cam (I rly hate shaky cam)) is that the whole story goes down the crapper at the end. It made no sense. Although Kruger was already established as a psycho there was no reason to ""bring him back to life"" and then go on a rampage other than yet another excuse to use more shaky cam. He kills Delacourt which had been established as the ""Emperor Palpatine"" of the ""Not a Death Star but a Life Star"" but then the movie ham-fistedly‎ tries to position her as someone who has realised the error of her ways in the last few seconds before she dies. It makes no sense. It would have made more sense for Kruger to realise the error of his ways and then kill her and that could have been achieved if this character was a bit different to begin with, like if they made him a neutral mercenary rather than a psycho, which made no sense either... see, this is what I think about when a movie starts using shaky cam, thanks shaky cam!"
"MUFCOK","3","0","1","23 July 2015"," Nice Visuals, below par story.
","Like many modern Hollywood Blockbuster flicks, Elysium had spectacular visuals and a below par, uninteresting, lazy plot and script.<br/><br/>Earth is an apocalyptic waste land which is home to the poor and Elysium is a halo in space which is where all the wealthy people live. On Elysium there is no sickness or disease, no poverty and no conflict. They have the technology to cure terminal illness; the air is pure with no pollution and the wealthy live long, healthy lives. Nobody leaves Elysium and nobody enters.<br/><br/>I will start with the positives; the visuals are stunning. The contrasting settings between Earth and Elysium are breath- taking. The apocalyptic esc Earth wasteland is something that has been done many times before and in Elysium it looks extra gritty and rundown. Elysium is bright, colourful and magnificent; the living spaces are open and grand: It looks like perfection.<br/><br/>Elysium simply contains too many moments which are far too convenient or stupid. Characters do daft things with no explanation because the directors couldn't be bothered to think of plausible ways for story lines to unfold. There is one instance where somebody breaks into Elysium and immediately finds the machine which can cure her daughter and then immediately knows how to use it, very convenient to say the least..<br/><br/>The Storyline is predictable, clichéd and shallow. The early childhood romance flashbacks are forced and convenient. Matt Damon does an OK job with what he has been given, but ultimately the script Iets him down massively. The 'bad' characters are not interesting in the slightest, they are forcing the intimidating routine but fail miserably. Jodie Foster is horrific. Two dimensional with no character depth or explanation as to why her actions are as they are.<br/><br/>Matt Damon becomes terminally ill in the most ludicrous way and mopes around for a few days dying. Then he put on some sort of tech suit which gives him strength, shortly following this he heads to Elysium to Save Earth.<br/><br/>This review is boring me now, almost as much as Elysium did.. 3/10 – for the visuals alone."

","Despite all the various technical aspects of the film that I will not put an emphasis on, I think this movie however is probably the best illustration of a problem that modern societies face : immigration. I think it is represented in three main figures : the 99%, the 1% and the physical space that separate both groups.<br/><br/>The 99% is represented by the world -; filled with crime and poverty, sickness and sorrow controlled by a group of emotionless robots. While there's this representation, you have the 1% which have all the last technologies including the ones to actually heal the deadliest cancers, tumors or autoimmune sicknesses. You have luxuriant green nature, well groomed public spaces or even well- built houses that make their 'world' particularly entertaining. And then at last you have the space that separates both group.<br/><br/>Now this is quite similar to the society we're experiencing with Northern wealthy societies in comparison to the Southern ones that are generally poor and out of sort from an economical standpoint. Just like in the film, you also have a population - those possessing all the goods and those aspiring in their poverty to benefit from this wealth. That's where you have people who's objectives are to bring the latter to the former via 'clandestine boats' in the real world and spacecrafts in the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a good group of these people die in the process of trying to reach for a better life and I think these aspects are particularly well represented in the film.<br/><br/>Despite all this sociological interpretation, on the film itself, a lot is left to be desired.

In order to accomplish this, Matt agrees to hijack an executive and steal valuable information from him, thus earning his passage into the facility that can cure him. And that's pretty much the entire driving force behind this movie.<br/><br/>Of course, to make this plot acceptable to viewers, there have to be villains of the peace, who have no morals, against whom Matt struggles, and therefore can justify the ensuing violence. However, they are only there to make Matt's actions acceptable to viewers' moralities and sensibilities. Take away the mentally unstable characters in the film, and you're left with a bunch of minor crooks, focused around Matt Damon, out to get something they have no right to.<br/><br/>This film could have been an indictment of the ability to pay versus the humanitarian need of the sick, an indictment of personal greed versus the needs of society, an indictment of the pursuit of power against a balanced society where needs come first, rather than wants, but Americans wouldn't pay to see such socialist ideals and attitudes. Instead we get artificially created villains to justify the protagonist's actions. The result is a nonsensical mishmash of events.<br/><br/>If you accept that Matt Damon has a right to the medical treatment he can't afford then you can probably get through this film without throwing something at the screen.

On the positive note you'll see a lot of good non-US actors: Sharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Diego Luna and (my favorite in this cast) Wagner Moura.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fun movie to watch, but don't expect too much."

","(62%) On the contrary to the critics, and I suppose a lot of other people and film fans, I actually thought this was a better movie overall than ""District 9"". It's more cinematic, the plot is better told, and it doesn't try to convince you every waking moment that you're watching a documentary. The social politics are as abundant here as the ones in District 9 (just like a truck on an elephant), but there's still an interesting concept at this movie's heart. And despite the overuse of shaky cam during most of the action, this is still a solid, enjoyable sci-fi fantasy that I liked a lot more than I thought I was going to."
"KnightsofNi11","6","0","1","8 September 2014"," I wish Blomkamp would just make District 10
","In 2009 new director Neill Blomkamp started off his feature career with an astounding bang with the Peter Jackson backed District 9. This was one of the freshest and most original science fiction stories to be released in a long time so, naturally, big things were expected when Blomkamp got the opportunity to up his budget and fill his cast with A-listers like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster big things were expected. Unfortunately this was a lot of hype to live up to and Elysium falls just short of being another fantastic original sci-fi film.<br/><br/>Set in the year 2154, Elysium tells the story of a dystopian society where the wealth gap has become quite literal, with the rich elites of the world living lives of luxury on their space station Elysium which orbits a ravaged and overpopulated Earth and looks awfully similar to the Halo ring world from the video game franchise, something Blomkamp was at one time attached to for a film adaptation. Obviously he still wants to make that a reality. Anyways, Matt Damon plays Max, a factory worker on Earth who gets the opportunity to go to Elysium where he may be able to equalize the two polarizing societies. But along the way he runs into killer robots, katana wielding assassins, and a slew of crazy sci-fi action-packed obstacles.<br/><br/>Elysium has all of the ingredients to be another District 9 sci-fi revolution. It's got an interesting concept, albeit one that has become increasingly common, surrounding social and wealth inequality. This inequality is a little in your face and a little too obvious, but the contrast between Elysium and Earth definitely gets the point across. It's got the budget to carry the epic visuals and make Elysium look truly badass.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film with landscapes that are absolutely stunning. The designs of the two separate worlds are both gorgeous in their own ways. The designs of the characters, costumes, vehicles, and weapons are all reminiscent of the dirty rusty look of District 9. If nothing else Elysium is a major accomplishment on a visual level and I give major props to the filmmakers for building this fascinatingly original world.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed most of Elysium. The visual flare of the film never ceases to amaze, and it grows increasingly cooler as more and more elements get introduced to the story. The film's one big fault is that key word, ""story."" Where District 9 was a multi-layered story told in a unique and compelling pseudo-documentary style, Elysium is a traditional straight-forward narrative that doesn't go much deeper than Earth people wanting to be on Elysium and Elysians not wanting Earth people on their world for the obvious reasons. The characters are fun and exciting, but not particularly compelling. The storyline itself is similar as well. It's a lot of fun, but I think this film wants to be taken a lot more seriously than its tone and content merits.<br/><br/>Elysium is worth the watch for its beauty and glamour, and the onslaught of explosive sci-fi action. Overall it's a really underwhelming film though, and its melodramatic ending is worth nothing more than an eye roll. I like to think that the studio is to blame for the pitfalls of this movie, and that District 9 wasn't just luck, but I don't know for sure. I guess we'll just have to wait for Blomkamp's next flick, 2015's Chappie."

"tharnax","Null","0","1","24 August 2014"," Socialist allegory with a thin veil of Sci-fi...
","'Elysium' is a socialist allegory with a thin cover of sci-fi/action. Neil Blomkamp has created his own version of another left-wing sci-fi movie, namely James Cameron's'Avatar. I mention Cameron specifically because its clear that Mr. Blomkamp could learn a great deal about the creation and unfolding of action sequences and character development from the older sci-fi master. Matt Damon does a great job as the Christ-like Max; a former felon who lives in the Los Angeles of 2154. In this dystopic future, earth is overcrowded and polluted to the extreme and all of the wealthy folks have created a paradise on the titular space station. Jodie Foster's character runs Elysium with an iron fist and routinely has poor people blown up attempting to fly there and gain access to Elysium's life-saving medical technology. That's right: Universal health care is the biggest plot device in this film. There's an undeniable link to the recent uproar over the 1% and economic inequality in general, but Mr. Blomkamp ends up telling a cartoonish, one- sided story. This simplistic tale of greed and privilege ends up suffocating the development of all characters with the exception of Damon's. Mr. Blomkamp does create some good momentum as the action heats up but the fight sequences suffer from poor choreography and a flurry of bad camera work. The film does deliver on an emotional level at the end but we are left with a peculiar feeling that it could have been much better. Having said that, Neil Blomkamp showed enormous promise with 'District 9' and has a bright future ahead of him so long as he takes tips from his contemporaries and continues to grow as a film maker."
"TheMarwood","5","0","1","24 August 2014"," Blomkamp fumbles his first studio project
","After Neill Blomkamp's out of nowhere success with District 9, he gets a sizable budget increase and what feels like his financiers chipping away at his script, until there is no vision behind the final product, just a generic and accessible film. If you remove a couple of quick shots of blood and gore and a few bits of profanity, this would play out entirely the same and still feel like it's basically derivative kids stuff. The premise is intriguing, but the good ends there, as this is just a by the numbers bit of storytelling about the haves and haves not -- the rich who live in a giant habitat in space away from the hellish conditions on earth. Exploring this wonderful idea quickly gives way to silly action scenes, one dimensional characters and a waste of expensive vfx rendering the interesting Elysium. We never really see what life on Elysium is really like, just a few wide shots of a few people in a pool or a fancy gathering - it basically looks like a fancy resort and seems really boring. Our brief time on Elysium is spent with an awful character played by Jodie Foster who gives a crummy performance sporting an ear screeching accent. Another undeveloped subplot about Foster's character forming a pact with an underused William Fichtner to re-code Elysium so that she will be president just becomes a throwaway plot point that lazily gives Damon's character a reason to get to Elysium. It's this part of the film that ends up resembling Johnny Mnemonic, with Damon carrying important data in his head that everyone wants and cyberpunk visuals that feel like this is pillaging from other already derivative films. Sharlto Copley and his henchmen play pure evil characters, who aren't the the least bit interesting to watch and a standard take the girl and her daughter who is important to the main character hostage is even more forced and tired. Elysium is a film that presents grand ideas in the guise of a silly sci-fi actioner and has a narrative so full of holes and wasted potential, that it collapses under the weight of its own shoddy storytelling. As hard on the film as I sound, it's still watchable, it's just a step backwards for Blomkamp who didn't seem to navigate the minefield of studio filmmaking well at all."

"CMTiago","8","0","1","11 August 2014"," An entertaining summer movie that hides some of its plot flaws
","I realize that most of the people who watched Elysium felt a little bit disappointed with the end result as they, much like me, may have been expecting a poignant story by Neill Blomkamp. Personally I was thoroughly entertained by this movie and the fact is that perhaps the non-stop action was there to keep some more distracted viewers busy, while the more observant moviegoer caught some plot holes that may have hurt the experience all together. Sure I like to see a movie like this present itself in coherent a manner, yet I feel that the incredible action sequences, as well as some marvelous special effects swayed my opinion on the film. As far as plot goes, it's a fairly simple set up. In 2154, the functioning world is separated into two spaces. Earth is over populated by the poor and is pretty much a disorganized land. Then there is Elysium, a idealistic paradise for the wealthy. What sets the story in motion is one man's mission to change the current regime of things in order to save himself and other desperate earthlings.<br/><br/>Being released during the summer, I believe that this choice was valid as it definitely stacks up among the more entertaining crowd of movies in this season. What puts it over some of those is that it presents an interesting idea, if somewhat underdeveloped. So with good performances, stunning action and great effects, Elysium is definitely a movie worth watching. If you want to be entertained then I guess you will enjoy it. However if you seek more from the story than what is presented you may find yourself disappointed by it.<br/><br/>Rating: 8,5/10"

","I just finished watching this ""thing"" and in my opinion Matt Damon is a great actor who makes any character he plays great but the entire movie was full of plot holes, predictable, and had a very very very confusing casting choice. <br/><br/>First things first, the entirety of the movie is supposed to be occurring in two places; Earth, specifically America in LA and space. Sounds simple enough, but as I thought I was watching an English spoken movie it turned out to be something requiring subtitles for a considerable duration of the movie. No offence but I wasn't intending on watching a Spanish/French movie this evening. <br/><br/>That being said we can dive into the casting choices and the scenario of the movie. If the movie is set in LA then why is everyone speaking Spanish? even Matt Damon? I mean I can understand if all the rich people are living in space but are you implying that the poor people are those who speak Spanish? Also this movie has 5 charters with minimum lines Max (Matt Damon) his love interest, the female antagonist, and 2 male villains one of which is the sleeping agent who seems to have been breathing in helium for the entire movie which makes everything he says or does amazingly silly. <br/><br/>PLOT HOLES: so Kruger has a shield like technology that protects him from gun shots and other things HOWEVER Elysium doesn't seem to have the ability to use that SAME technology as a shield which makes it normal for unauthorized ships to fly in and out. 2. Kruger gets a grenade in the face... Brain remains intact, SURE. 3. Enemies enter Elysium... one would assume that they have an army of robotic soldiers... none however, are seen protecting oh only the most important building in the city which could basically resemble the pentagon in real life... 6 people took it down ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!! 7. Sure we don't need to know how presidents are chosen on Elysium but you make it seem like John Carlyle can pick or do whatever he wants because... well no one really knows why. 8. Finally and this's the ENDING OF THE MOVIE SPOILER: as the data in max's brain is downloaded and he dies a ""heroic"" death while speaking again in Spanish (which by the way I did not understand a word of, so the ending was ruined more than it had already been) all people on earth are now citizens of Elysium... So you mean the rich people would be just okay with it and everything is great now? how just how does that make any sense?! Also why didn't spider just make him self president BOOM all problems solved.<br/><br/>All in all I really regret the time I spent on this since it had some potential, should have watched Robo Cop instead and I hope that movie isn't terrible as well."

","At first, ""Elysium"" may seem very good. In fact, the concept is very unique; rich people leave Earth to go to a space habitat so they may continue to advance. Meanwhile, poor people and people who don't have enough to afford a ticket to the habitat (Elysium) yet are left to die on a ravaged Earth. One of the inhabitants, named ""Max,"" of Earth is exposed to extreme amounts of radiation that will be fatal unless he gets to a healing machine on Elysium. He is forced to do mercenary work for a man named ""Spider,"" to get a ticket to Elysium, which leads to an exoskeleton being installed onto him. It's also played by many award winning actors. However, they don't seem all too award winning in this movie and the actual movie just doesn't hit par with the story. Jodie Foster, who plays one of the main villains, seems to just not play her part right. The accents are much too over the top as well. Most of the emotional sequences are much too cheesy or jump into the point of them much too fast. Action sequences are good at times...until they use the forsaken ""shaky cam"" to try to make the fights seem more intense. Instead, they render said sequences unable to understand. Lots of flashbacks are inserted, which makes it hard to tell what's a flashback and what's actually happening. They attempt to make you bond with a leukemia-infected girl who Max eventually gives up his chance to be healed for. Some of the comedy is good though, which is one of its only redeeming factors. The plot throughout the movie becomes increasingly more cheesy and predictable as the whole thing spirals downward."

","I have to split up my review.<br/><br/>1. Scenery and CGI <br/><br/>The images are great the world is very powerful in its appearance, every single shot has remarkable impact on the viewer i liked the world more than avatar or any other sci-fi movie. Also the setting is pretty close to Battle Angel Alita which was a awesome animation series which makes me still happy when i think about it.<br/><br/>But thats it, thats all the good i can say about it.<br/><br/>2. Characters <br/><br/>The characters are not very likable, the criminals in this movie are all pretty messed up and fail to make impact on the viewer, the intentions are unclear and even shift much too fast to be believable. The people living on the good side on the other hand are just cold and boring they fail to make me fear the power they have or the importance they seem to have. They just appear as stupid boring people doing nothing but sunbathing and playing in the pool.<br/><br/>3. Plot Development<br/><br/>Every single scene feels so forced, lets talk about some examples here.<br/><br/>The scene were our main char are severely hurt and has to be rescued by our female main char is utterly unbelievable its not very likable that he is close enough to walk to her house without being spotted, but even worse when he leaves the house instantly there is this drone waiting for him but why and how did it know...<br/><br/>Its not that I'm searching for those plot holes, if its not that obvious i don't feel annoyed by it.<br/><br/>Next they travel back to Elysium. After they arrived and got caught they don't remove this mechanical body support even on the medical bench and this woman and kid are with him in the same room he is operated in. Obviously to share this 2 lines of text there, and then they put them in the ammunition room instead of the jail. <br/><br/>Also changing the status of citizen to legal by manipulating the computer system is utterly useless because it can just be undone. What needed to happen would be a shift in politics but thats not reached by any means even worse it feels like now they have a reason to not let anyone in.<br/><br/>The Characters are so terrible, really TERRIBLE!!! Each and every single one of them doesn't make sense and is boring. Just thinking about them make me angry, every single person in this movie is just a terrible human being. Also no one is clever, no one is doing anything specific i could exchange nearly all the characters and nearly nothing would change.<br/><br/>Well enough is enough i really hate this movie so very much. Its just disgusting that this reached the big screen.<br/><br/>How can people swallow this?"

The story never made much sense and begged the question of how Elysium could function just like earth in outer space. I knew the outcome of the film as soon as Max had met the little girl (daughter of Frey). You could never really connect with the main character (Damon) and I was well aware I was watching a movie the whole time, never really drew me in. I have rated it 3-10 on the basis of the CGI. Also Sharlto Copley was just dreadful!!! His voice was nearly enough to turn off 5 minutes into his introduction to the movie. He sounded like an American trying to put on an Australian accent and might I add FAILING miserably. I have never seen him in any other movies so I don't know if that's how he normally sounds but if it is my advice would be to stay behind the camera. So all in all the acting was bad, the story line was predictable and it made no scientific sense what so ever. But as I've mentioned before the visual effects were very impressive. If your a fan of other sci fi films such as avatar, oblivion or EVEN after earth I would give this one a wide birth because as you may have gathered reading this I was not impressed, but hey....

I had high hopes.<br/><br/>Not only was the movie itself a completely run-of-the-mill Hollywood action film with terrible writing -- the full length film had hardly any more narrative than the trailer. Completely unidimensional characters with no development. No nuance in the plot. And the wealth- inequality theme wasn't just heavy-handed, it was entirely a gimmick with no depth.<br/><br/>I give Elysium 3/10 only for the special effects team, and give 0/10 to Neill Blonkamp for his god-awful script."
"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","10 June 2014"," Unimaginative and boring
","The very premise and idea of Elysium is non-original and stale. It's your basic dystopian future where the rich have raised high walls using high-end technology to keep the poor out and it's up to a single brave soul to make the difference. We've seen this millions times before and unfortunately Elysium doesn't really offer us anything new or exciting to make up for its basic storyline.<br/><br/>The other problem are the actors. Jodie Foster is a great actress, but the script doesn't give her much to work with and her character comes of as stereotypical power hungry military politician. Sharlto Copley's Kruger is certainly a memorable character, helped along by his weird accent and general hamminess - easily the most enjoyable character in the movie. But alas, Matt Damon once again proves that he isn't all that well-suited for action hero roles. He does much better in thrillers - Bourne franchise springs to mind - where the main character can be more of a everyman with certain badass characteristics. A straight up scifi action film like Elysium needs someone like Stallone or Schwarzenegger to be truly enjoyable. Someone who screams badassery and danger. You don't get that with Damon, no matter how bald or ripped he makes himself to appear.<br/><br/>Still, none of the main actors are terrible or ruin the film by themselves. Ultimately it's the lackluster premise and predictable storyline that make this so boring to watch. And yet the technical aspects are up to par, I have no complaints about the action scenes and even the characters and the story are not bad, they're not just that interesting. If you're looking for a solid action scifi film, I've seen much worse."

The rape-victim movies she has starred in were not exactly full of good, decent men, either. Now, in ""Elysium,"" set 140 years in the future, the good people are all Latino. All of the poor, disadvantaged people still left on a hellish, polluted Earth are all Latino. I didn't spot any African-American or Asian faces, unless some extra was in the frame, 300 feet from the camera. If you're white, you are evil. Somehow, all the Caucasians are in the top 1 percent.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's lead character is bi-racial. You have to be part Latino and speak Spanish for us to know you're one of the good people. Not a subtle movie. And by the way, film-makers showing us how things will look in 140 years could be a little more imaginative. Will people still be dropping the same f-bombs they drop now?

The wealthy and powerful look down on Earth from the space station Elysium, which is rich with swimming pools and green lawns, and where diseases are cured within seconds. Ex-convict and working-stiff Matt Damon, exposed to radiation on the job (and with only five days left to live), strikes a deal with a low-rent space travel honcho to steal brain matter from one of Elysium's elite in exchange for unauthorized passage to the privileged worldunfortunately, they choose the wrong citizen, a spineless corporate suit in-cahoots with Elysium's secretary to the president, who is planning a political coup. Plot-heavy science-fiction adventure is, rather surprisingly, easy to follow and moves at a quick clip. Damon gives a solid performance (when he isn't being asked to scream or hobble around in agony), and the costly production looks terrific. Still, the picture does begin to flag after the first half, with character motivations becoming unclear, and everyone acting hysterically or irrationally. I'm also not sure of the purpose of Damon's fate, which seems to go against the central plot function the film is operating on. As the cold-hearted secretary, who thinks nothing of shooting impoverished citizens out of the sky, a miscast Jodie Foster struggles with an underwritten role; I haven't a clue as to who this villainess is, and I'm guessing Foster didn't, either (she's also encumbered by, what I suspect to be, post-production dubbing on her dialogue, which is heavy with a faux-decadent cadence that doesn't work at all).

"politehere","3","0","1","15 May 2014"," All the Things That are Wrong with Elysium
","There are quite a few things that take the joy away from Elysium. Let's start with earth. How is it that the only people on earth are Mexicans? They could have used people from many different nationalities. Given the fact that the U.S.A is a multinational nation, the depiction of Mexicans as the sole inhabitants is beyond stupid. Then we have the rich people. I'm surprised that the dominant rich people on Elysium are depicted as the French as if other nationalities didn't have rich people. Maybe that's why Elysium is an empty space paradise with no more than five residents? ""2012"" had done a much better job in this regard.<br/><br/>There is also a problem with the protagonist. He is not a hero in the true sense of the word, because the only reason he's trying to go up to Elysium is to save ""his own life"". This makes it really hard to sympathize with him and it means the movie is not engaging at all. Now if he were a revolutionary who had a clear goal from the beginning (that of helping the Earth people) we could have cared a bit more about what happens to him or about how he achieves his noble goal. Having his family members killed by Elysium's rich people to make him avenge their deaths would have also made the movie a lot more interesting. If you can't care about the main character, it is much harder to care about any other characters in a movie, which is exactly what is wrong with Elysium.<br/><br/>And what's up with the magical med beds? Such a thing can never exist. ""Face/Off"" had a much more plausible scenario than that! The ending of the movie is shallow, because it suggests that a tiny space station and a few ""aid shuttles"" dispatched can save the entire earth's population, or were the Mexicans in Los Angeles the only ""earth population""? This is clearly not the case, as it says right in the beginning of the movie that in the late 21st century, the earth was overpopulated. This, in effect, means that there is nothing dramatic about Max's achievement, as it can only save a few Mexicans on the U.S soil and ""not"" the ""earth's population"" as the movie suggests. Other people in other parts of the world may not even have access to space vehicles fast enough to get them to Elysium. In other words, this is a movie which is trying to send the message that Mexicans are illegal people who are always trespassing. Isn't this what Hollywood constantly does to people from many other nationalities? It's so offensive and unacceptable.<br/><br/>The only thing going for Elysium is the special effects, but even that is ruined by the shaky camera. Watching a bunch of dirty, ugly people in ragged clothes and a bunch of snobs in the space is really not all that enjoyable, and with all those magic med beds, they'd better name the movie Harry Potter or Narnia. No wait, such things don't even happen in Harry Potter's magical world! Did I forget to mention the fact that the characters in the movie are not even pleasant to look at? Calling them ""ugly"" doesn't quite put it. This is a bad movie with a boring story. I'm giving it a 3 but only for the special effects."

It had phenomenal effects and production design, creating a world in which aliens existed and lived confined in slums, suffering hatred at the hands of an untrusting mankind. The movie provided a solid social commentary while entertaining and amazing the audience, leaving many (including myself) excited for director Neill Blomkamp's next film. After four long years, Blomkamp returned with his sophomore effort, ELYSIUM. It contained many of the same elements as DISTRICT 9: social commentary, science fiction with a less than stellar future, special effects that feel embedded in the real world. But ELYSIUM isn't on the same level as DISTRICT 9. I wish I could say it had exceeded its predecessor, but no. It fell a bit short. The plot: in the year 2154, humans have divided into two separate societies. The Earth has fallen victim to disease, overpopulation, and pollution and it's driven the richest of our species to create an orbital space station. This utopia, named Elysium, is a perfect society where only the most wealthy are allowed to dwell. The rest of us, the lower class, are relegated to the Earth's surface to live in hovels and do the dirty jobs. Max (Matt Damon) is a former felon living in Los Angeles when he's injured in an industrial accident. He absorbs a lethal dose of radiation and he's told he has five days to live. He knows Elysium has advanced medical facilities that could cure him in minutes and agrees to join an information heist in exchange for a ticket on the next refugee ship to the station. The heist goes wrong and Max goes on the run with a world-changing computer program downloaded into his brain, while a psychotic commando gives chase on orders from a high-ranking Elysium official hoping to wrestle control of the station from the existing president with the contents of Max's mind.<br/><br/>First, the good. ELYSIUM is an entertaining movie. It's still got the fantastic production design that made DISTRICT 9 such an amazing world. The special effects in this film are on par, if not a little better, than Blomkamp's first, and there's a boatload more this time around. The orbital paradise of Elysium is a wicked sight. It's designed as a ring structure with the inhabitants living on the interior rim, using the station's rotation to create an artificial gravity. The people live in one giant super-rich neighborhood with giant mansions scattered across the landscape and robots doing anything resembling work. Earth (or at least Los Angeles, where a portion of the film is set) is a barren landscape with people living in hovels piled on hovels and fighting for what meager resources are available. The volatile population is kept in line with a series of robots used as brutal law enforcement. It's got a little MAD MAX vibe with familiar vehicles being outfitted with armor and weapons for the heist sequence. It's a dirty, miserable environment and the total opposite of what we see in Elysium. Overall, ELYSIUM is a beautiful movie. The CG is also used to give the violence in the movie some extra punch. If you remember the action in DISTRICT 9, there was some bloody violence in that film. Alien weapons would detonate their targets and leaving a bloody smear on the wall. It's no different here. ELYSIUM earns it's R-rating with some brutal violence (including one particularly awesome moment with a grenade and someone's face). Dishing out a good chunk of the violence is one of the film's other best elements: Sharlto Copley as Kruger, the force of violent insanity chasing our hero. I've enjoyed Copley in both DISTRICT 9 and THE A-TEAM but his turn as a villain is just plain cool. Copley can do crazy well and, as Kruger, he's at his craziest. He's a raging ball of murder, barely controlled by Jodie Foster's Delacourt.<br/><br/>And there's my first of two complaints about ELYSIUM. Jodie Foster isweirdin this movie. She's really phoning it in here. She grandstands through her role as the evil whatever she is. Seriously, I'm not quite sure what her role on Elysium is. Some sort of head of Homeland Security or something, I think, who's at odds with her superiors for using Kruger to blow up refugee spacecraft from Earth. And she's using some bizarre accent for her character. It's not quite European but I can't figure out what it's supposed to be. A minor misstep, but still a distraction. Finally, my biggest complaint with the movie is the social commentary. Yes, the same thing I was just praising DISTRICT 9 for is a complaint about ELYSIUM. Because this movie continually slaps you in the face with it. There's no subtlety here. It's all right there, shoved in your face. There's more than enough to reinforce the theme of the rich oppressing the poor, and there's plenty to compare the plight of the Earthbound humans trying to find a better life on Elysium to America's current immigration issues. ELYSIUM just feels a little too ""on-the-nose"" with it's social themes and I miss DISTRICT 9 where it's themes were a canvas on which the plot was painted as opposed to the entirety of the movie.<br/><br/>It's not enough to ruin the movie for me. I enjoyed ELYSIUM. It may not be all that memorable once it's over but it's a good time while you're watching it. Cool action, Copley's killer Kruger, fantastic production value, and a real basic story that doesn't require much thought. I would've like something a little more on par with DISTRICT 9 but I'm not about to rule Blomkamp out yet. The man's got vision and a love for science fiction, so I can't wait to see what he comes out with next."
"saytosandeep","7","0","1","28 April 2014"," MY REVIEW: Elysium is Worth Visiting Once!!
","Elysium. Director of cult District 9, an interesting idea, big actors like Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, great looking visuals and sci-fi gadgets, all these raise your expectations to sky high. Elysium fails to meet these high expectations because Jodie Foster is wasted completely and Matt Damon's character despite all his powers does not come across as big hero who saved your world. Technically, Elysium is class apart with very good use of new ideas on future weapons and machinery but when it comes to drama and thrills, movie somewhat lacks the sharpness needed for a serious science fiction. Sharlto Copley as menacing sleeper agent Kruger does well but his character is given a bad turn in last few reels. I am going with good 7 out of 10 for Elysium. Despite its many flaws, it makes a good watch any day because of its spectacle of high standards."
"bulldogg1066","2","0","3","27 April 2014"," Stupid
","The only reason I gave this film 2 stars is due to the CGI. This is one of the most stupid movies ever made. Ed Wood would never have put his name on this piece of trash. The Earth has been destroyed by - you guessed it: pollution. The poor people, mostly Mexicans, live in rubble on the ruined Earth while the rich people live a life of luxury on a space station named Elysium. Poor people are not allowed on Elysium because - well they are poor. Rich people live forever on Elysium due to magical medical machines that can fix every disease ever known to man and then some. Damon is so sick he can hardly move, but he puts on a magic suit and becomes superman. Of course the medical machines can't fix him even though they fixed a dead guy with his face blown off. He dies heroically and unselfishly of course. In the end, everyone becomes citizens of Elysium, so apparently the entire population of the Earth moves to the space station. WHAT? Typical Hollywood babel; all illegal Mexicans - I mean poor people, should be entitled to become citizens of the U.S. - I mean Elysium. I like Matt Damon but apparently he needed to make a payment on one of his properties on Elysium. If he continues appearing in movies as bad as this, he may end up living on Earth."
"SnoopyStyle","6","0","2","26 April 2014"," Neill Blomkamp recreates look of 'District 9' without the same success
","It's the year 2154. Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con living in a dystopic police-state earth and crumbling Los Angeles. He's trying to live the straight life working in a factory. The rich and powerful are now living in the space station Elysium. Everybody wants a ticket to the utopian world where advanced med bay can cure almost anything. During an industrial accident, Max is flooded with a lethal dose of radiation. He has 5 days to live and is desperate to go up to Elysium. Defense Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) is threatened by the president and is now orchestrating a coup. Max reunites with his old criminal boss Spider to try to steal some brain data. Except the data they stole is something more valuable than some bank accounts.<br/><br/>The look and feel of this is reminiscent of Neill Blomkamp's other and better sci-fi 'District 9'. The story is weighted down by a few questionable setups. There are a lot of recycled sci-fi ideas in this movie and one unexpected one from 'Johnny Mnemonic'. The movie has its moments. If you could overlook some of the simplistic setups, there is a fun little action movie. However the backstory is a little too simplistic. It's fine for a small campy movie like 'Johnny Mnemonic', but this movie wants to be taken seriously. And I just can't take its message too seriously."
"SimpleIdea","8","0","1","16 April 2014"," Visually groundbreaking
","This film is much more ambitious than District 9 and I loved it! Neil Blomkamp revolutionises the sci-fi genre with his second film painting a gritty and chaotic vision of the future while parodying current world issues such as poverty, healthcare, overpopulation and mainly immigration.<br/><br/>The ambition of the art alone makes this a great science fiction. It challenges many modern artistic influences such as today's videogames while making a believable and realistic universe parallelling with our world today. The influence of great designers such as Syd Mead really shows in how much attention to detail there is in the vehicles, droids and architecture. Visually this film is up there among Blade Runner, Alien and The Matrix.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's character is mainly used as a tool for the action, being the hero he doesn't do much to reflect the essence villain apart from his gear. Sharlto Copley's performance was excellent, his character was menacing and completely badass. He's definitely among my favourite villains. I think Matt Damon deserved to have as much to offer in the film.<br/><br/>You can see that I'm very obsessed with the film, it's hard to focus on its flaws and there are big flaws such as the choppy writing, and disappointing performances from Jodie Foster and William Fitchtner. It's a great film but not as good as District 9 though I'd love to see more of this intelligent type of science fiction, perhaps a similar third film from Neil Blomkamp."
"roedyg","5","0","1","7 April 2014"," A Disappointment
","Elysium came highly recommended. However I found it disappointing.<br/><br/>It is set in the future, but mirrors earth today. The ""Republicans"" live in a gated community, but in orbit. The rest of the population live in squalor similar to a Brazilian favella. The goal of every person on earth is to live in this golden community.<br/><br/>The people who live there have no compassion whatsoever. They remotely run the corporations on earth that have no regard for safety or working conditions, like Nike in Thailand. They use robocop like droids to keep the earthlings in check and drones like Obama. They happily kill any potential trespassers.<br/><br/>The Republican have astounding advanced technology for healing, but they won't share it with the earthlings, for much the same reason blacks were spat on.<br/><br/>There is not much subtlety in the parallels.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is hideous. They shaved off his hair, covered him in tattoos, a Borg suit (presumably to give him strength) burns and scars. I did not like seeing his beauty defiled that way.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster plays the icy leader of the Republicans. She plays the part perfectly, projecting complete composure and elegance.<br/><br/>However, most of the movie is watching mindless CGI of hovering vehicles, droids and explosions. It just goes on and on and on. It is boring!<br/><br/>There does not seem to be any point to most of the violence. The combatants have no motive. They just like fighting.<br/><br/>There are some extremely phony dramatic tension moments that just don't make any sense at all. The people don't interact much. Not even the villains have much interaction with their victims. On the other hand, that is the point of the movie. These people have no compassion for anyone."
"jb_campo","6","0","1","7 April 2014"," Matt Damon rescues somewhat contrived plot
","I rate this b-grade movie 6/10 only because of Matt Damon's excellent, powerful performance. Otherwise, the acting - nada, the plot - nada. This was terrible acting by Jodie Foster. What accent was she trying for anyway? French, Fringlish? And paper thin believability. Just disappointing for someone of her pedigree. Pure money grab. Sad.<br/><br/>This movie tried to combine too much. It references the Mad Max genre, even naming Matt's character - Max. It references Forest Gump with Frey and Max forming this bond when they were young, like Forest and Jenny. I could have lived with those links, but the plot had too many holes to keep this ship afloat.<br/><br/>People on earth have to stare up at this star-shaped Elysium floating above them, where everyone is happy and healthy and wealthy. Yes, they have medical pods that can cure every disease, but only the rich inhabitants of Elysium have access to them. Of course, bands of earthlings try to get up there, like the illegal immigrants trying to seek out a better life, and Jodie Foster shoots them down with no second thought. I get it, the rich kill the poor. The rich live the good life, the poor suffer in squalor. Boy does this movie hit you over the head repeatedly with that theme. By the time you leave the theater, I get the feeling the producers wanted you to feel guilty for even having enough money to pay for the tickets to see this mess.<br/><br/>When Max faces the evil bad guy Kruger at the end, wow, what a surprise, huh? Good wins over evil. And when Max makes the ultimate sacrifice to free the slaves of earth, everyone is supposed to cheer, a la Armageddon with Bruce Willis. Send down the medical pods.Cure all 10 billion people on earth...eh...wait, Elysium can't hold 10 billion people, oh well, you can vacation up here, then go back to your poverty and pollution. Yeah, earth rebels never thought through the consequences of liberating your planet.<br/><br/>Yeah, well, you instead should think of the consequence to your sanity of watching this mish mosh that tried to do too much. If you like Matt Damon, this will be worth your while for his effort. Otherwise, I'd suggest you beam me up Scotty, and get me out of here!"

","And it isn't that the film's bad - far from it, as it's very watchable.<br/><br/>But it always seems like something's lacking (if that's the best way to put it).<br/><br/>I think partly because some areas really are lacking..................the back story to Elysium, where the rich decided to leave and set up on an orbital space station.<br/><br/>Okay, the way things are going at times - it's believable. But what about any Government on Earth itself ? A bit more depth would have been useful.<br/><br/>And the same with Max's exo-skeleton. Very underused, considering it was meant to make him super strong. That strength didn't really come out until the last few scenes.<br/><br/>And Matt Damon did a great job acting Max - but it was fairly obvious he was going to sacrifice himself at the end (pretty much from the time of the nun flashblack).<br/><br/>And I think that's the frustrating thing about Elysium. With a slightly tighter script, it could have been a classic.<br/><br/>As it is, we're left with a very watchable film - but all too predictable."
"knightvamp","6","0","1","18 March 2014"," Elysium good but
","I really enjoyed the Elysium movie it self. Damon was down on his luck and having to work for life then the police harassing him for the past. His boss at the company not caring about what happened. Getting stuck in the blast should have killed instantly. However it did make for a better story line then an instant death. Having to figure a way to Elysium seemed to easy for the time frame. It could have been him looking for a way to get there to Elysium then having to do things to pay off passage. Instead him knowing someone to get him passage. it could have made for a better plot twist. However the ending I say should have tried to leave it open for more in the line of a sequel."
"strangeteacher","4","0","2","9 March 2014"," Disappointing. Great concept, but fizzled.
","I was excited to see this film, but what a letdown. I admire Matt Damon but his character was flat and unsympathetic. Keaunu Reeves could have done better. The same for Jody Foster, of whom I was a big time fan. From the start, with the girl and her sick daughter, the plot was predictable. And now many times do we have to watch the hero get his butt kicked over and over, until at the brink of defeat, he rallies back. His main antagonist was a stock character, hate-able in every which clichÃ©, down to the laughing every time he thought he was winning. Entire movie was nothing but a CGI, mixed martial arts, over the top slug fest. What's with these long over done fight scenes in movies lately? Save your money. You've seen this before."
"feyipuk","6","0","1","9 March 2014"," Another bloody documentary
","Given the director and various other members of the crew were involved in District 9, this could quite easily be the second in a series of social injustice films with guts (usually on the lens), but it doesn't hit the same stride as Blomkamps previous work. This time the action is in America; the poor speak Spanish and live in slums, the rich speak French and live in mansions, and the hired gun comes from South Africa and cooks on a BBQ. Between the South African flag and Spring Bok on the front of Krugers (Sharlto Copley) helicopter, to the Bugatti shuttle that John Carlyle, to the rose blossoms blowing around during a samurai battle, to the gang graffiti and tattoos, the details are pretty obvious for creating a strong sense of the communities each belongs to. All that's missing is Jodie Foster in a powdered wig to give her the full aristocratic stereotype. Sharlto Copley has a lot to live up to after District 9. There he was a nice guy who fell into madness. Here, he's a madman who has brief flashes of humanity, and he plays the madness well, with his clipped South African accent jarring against the overly softly speaking Foster and Braga, who plays the love interest here. They could have stuck to the mockumentry parts of District 9 - showing more about how the rich were stealing the wealth of Earth such that the 0.1% who live on Elysium could live like kings - but instead the focus is on Damon, and contrived plot were - just by chance - he ends up with the means to destroy the lives of all the super rich and save the planet. Again, the action is pretty graphic, the bad guys are pretty one dimensional (cartoon or computer game baddies come to mind) and the film has plenty of nice graphic shots (lingering shots of Elysium, robot guards, space ships). It could have been spun out with more detail - maybe something akin to the Hunger Games - yet what we have got seems to lack story detail, as if it's rushed, and stumbles as a result."
"contle","3","0","3","3 March 2014"," Sci-fi/Action without story? Pathetic...
","This is a sci-fi movie, so at the start, I just don't want to list all the problems, why this just cannot work from science point of view (pretty long list). This is just OK at a science fiction.<br/><br/>My real problem is with the story. The lack of story, actually. Classic fairy tales have more interesting ideas than this film has. Most of them; I just can't tell any exception for now.<br/><br/>The effects and action is pretty shiny, they took a lot attention on that point. But why? It doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>So this is about a separated ""island"" for the chosen, when the poor on Earth suffers from diseases and pollution. The characters are designed as a child would do, and they keep on this level until the very end, where it's not Bruce Willis, but Matt Damon to save the world this time.<br/><br/>Is there anybody, who read the idea (not the script, that have to be just a lot of work, maybe even 6-8 pages;) ) before making it? For me, this just seems pretty useless."
"jjohnson2400","2","0","3","2 March 2014"," Terrible writing
","It seems the more Hollywood depends on CGI, the worse the writing becomes. Graphics should enhance the viewers experience, not fool them into thinking that fancy graphics are going to excuse one implausiblity after another.<br/><br/>What is wrong with this movie? Where to start.<br/><br/>OK, I love Jodie Foster and have respected her work in the past but her performance in this movie was inexcusably bad. She was feigning some kind of accent but we were never sure quite what. Maybe it's Elysianin? Let's just say it made everything she said truly bizarre. Personally I felt like she just realized what a dog this script was just trying to hold down the vomit reflex. ""Hey. It's got cool graphics and I get to work with Damon too."" Now Damon is in an all out fight for his life and he's got this super-cool rail-gun rifle that's awesome. So he beats this guy down with it, sort of knocks him out or something so what does he do? He throws down his rifle and runs to mourn the loss of his buddy who's way dead.<br/><br/>How convenient for the plot that the guy he beat down isn't dead and there are other bad guys not 50 yards away from him! ""Hey. I don't need my only weapon anymore! I'll just throw it on the ground and go cry over this corpse over here!"" As ludicrous as that was, the idiot writer had him do the exact same thing in the climatic scene of the movie! He's got his cool rail-gun rifle and kicking butt. He blasts open a door and then for literally no reason whatsoever just throws the rifle on the floor and leaves without it. Let's just assume that people in the 150 year future have handled the ""Aw shucks. I'm out of ammunition"" problem.<br/><br/>The movie of course doesn't let you know that that is the problem. And if that's what this juvenile writer is going with all I have to say is: ""Really? Really? You don't think maybe some smart person will have solved that problem in 150 years? Really? Since only an idiot (of course this writer might qualify) would make that still the problem, we have to assume that the writer has made the hero an idiot, which pretty much makes the writer an idiot again.<br/><br/>But I digress. So the hero goes out on the platform where immediately he meets his nemesis where something like, you know, the rifle he just threw away would have come in really handy! Other ridiculous issues: 1) So they have this multi-trillion dollar space station yet they haven't figured out how to stop a few lightly armed transport ships from violating their space.<br/><br/>2) The relationship between our hero (Damon) and the woman is really bizarre. I think this is part of the problem with writers who rely on graphics to cover bad writing. They actually are incompetent writers and cannot figure out the nuances of real relationships. So they compensate with explosions and massive quantities of inane coolness.<br/><br/>Their relationship was supposed to be this huge childhood thing, yet when they met up years later, they were just cool if not cold towards each other. Strange."

","Wanting to watch this movie for a long time, and since Jodie foster is in my opinion one of the best and most loving female actors. I had quite high hopes for this sci-fi action flick.<br/><br/>The story of the film is not the highlight of the film, it's your usual old childhood friends who grew apart story. As usual they both still have feelings for each other. They live on a hopeless polluted earth where the middle-class and lower work for the higher-class who live in Elysium. A Space habitat that floats over earth. There are strict immigration laws in Elysium and the population of earth doesn't have access to it. In Elysium they have healing beds for the citizens of Elysium and that's basically what the population of earth need the most and what it's what the story is built around.<br/><br/>The main character is Max(Matt Damon) who is a middle-class man living on earth, he works for the higher class of Elysium in there robot building factory on earth. One day he gets a deadly dose of radiation in his body and only has about five days to live. He sets on a mission to Elysium to get healed. he meets his former child friend Frey(Alice Braga)and finds out her child is deadly sick too and needs treatment. Max needs a ship and gets help from some resistance who wants to rewrite the system and make all the people of earth a citizen of Elysium, so everyone can get medical treatment. The Antagonist of the film is Delacourt(Jodie Foster) the secretary of defense of Elysium. She wants to elect a new president of Elysium and make border control stricter. She puts in use her agent named Kruger(Sharlto Copley) on earth, who she commands to retrieve Max who has important data in his brain. The important data is coding that can reboot the system on Elysium and one can change any detail desired. In this case electing a new president or making everyone a legal citizen. Kruger later becomes an Obstacle for both parties when they get to Elysium. In the end Max dies making everyone on earth citizens of Elysium, and Frey's daughter is healed.<br/><br/>The Story is more or less O.K. It's highly predictable and you have seen it before. It lacks most of the tension these movies need, but besides that it had a good feel to it. It's good when the hero doesn't always live through to the end. The characters are likable with the exception of Frey, she was dull.<br/><br/>The Cinematic aspect of Elysium was the casual modern day slow-mo sequences and hand held camera-work. There were some weird shots in the ground fight where they shot down the red shuttle. And in the hand to hand combat scene in the end between Max and Kruger. I don't much like it when the camera kind of locks on to the characters and everything around gets blurred out. It's an awkward camera job.<br/><br/>The whole impression of the film is good. You have fun, the action is good and you feel with the characters. A weak 7/10."

","Neil Blomkamp's Elysium-set in the ambiguously defined '22nd century'-is a visually appealing mess of a film that serves more as a platform for political speech than a vehicle for entertainment. Unlike Blomkamp's previous attempt at science fiction (District 9), Elysium is disjointed, poorly acted and devoid of intrigue; the film stumbles though a simplistic 'us vs. them' narrative to deliver what could have been a respectable science fiction action piece, but instead falls victim to its own heavy handedness.<br/><br/>Upon opening, we are informed that in the late 21st century, human beings have ravaged the planet to such a degree as to make it uninhabitable. In response to the chaos on Earth, the wealthy elite of society have built themselves an orbiting utopia named 'Elysium', while those without means are left below in a post apocalyptic world marked by crime and hunger. The citizens of Elysium keep their society closed to the 'illegals' in order to maintain their standard of living, only occasionally returning to Earth to take on various administrative roles. Into the masses of those left below is born Max (Matt Damon), a former criminal attempting to save enough money to purchase his way up to Elysium by legitimate means. After an accident at work leaves him with mere days to live, he accepts a robbery job from the local crime boss in exchange for an Elysium citizenship that will allow him the medical care to save his life. During the course of the theft, Max gains access to computer code that the evil director of Elysium homeland security (Jodie Foster) is intending to use to reprogram the master computer systems to install her as the president. The remainder of the film consists of various action sequences, a token and unnecessary love interest, all leading to the predictable conclusion of the hero using the malicious data to instead instruct the computer to make everyone a citizen, presumably spreading the utopia far and wide.<br/><br/>From a visual perspective the film is actually quite impressive. Most notable are the shots of Elysium itself, a large space station made up of expansive parkland and palatial homes. Earth is presented as a typical post-apocalyptic wasteland in the style of 'Mad Max' or 'Escape from LA', and while not necessarily groundbreaking in its appearance, it fits the story well enough. A major drawback in the look of the film is the dichotomy between the haves and have nots is extreme to the point of distraction. Those on Elysium have access to medical bays that cure any injury or disease in seconds, while on earth people are driving present day GMC trucks and watching flat screen televisions. Obviously the intent was to reinforce the idea that those left behind on earth must survive with outdated and substandard equipment, but since the film identifies the point of societal divergence as the late 21st century, why would everybody on earth revert to today's technology 100 years from now? Ultimately it ends up looking cheap and lazy, as if the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to create a properly immersive world.<br/><br/>The story itself is incredibly pedestrian and any interesting plot points are absent. I am always disappointed when a science fiction film reverts to type, as even with a story that is generic in appearance the nature of the medium offers a wide range of possibilities.<br/><br/>Unfortunately what moves this film from being simply average down into the poor range is a maniacal and borderline fascist preoccupation with leftist politics. The wealthy elite on Elysium (exclusively white), do nothing to assist those in need on earth (exclusively not white, besides Matt Damon's character). It is never explained or explored why the citizens are uninterested in making the lives of others better, outside of the tacit implication that, well, rich people are evil and only care for themselves. Similarly, it is never demonstrated why those on earth are incapable of building an organized society; the rich people have taken everything and there is no benevolent government to distribute wealth is the implied conclusion. The protagonist's accident is due to an overzealous floor supervisor ignoring safety and demanding greater efficiency, for no other reason then, well, corporations are evil and care nothing for their workers. The control center where incoming ships of 'illegals' are callously shot down is a transparent representation of the death star, and even Jodie Foster's dialogue is strangely looped to make her seem more mechanical. Biased and blatant to the point of propaganda, I was expecting to see the University of California-Berkeley given a producer credit. The story lends itself to political allegory all on its own, making the added rhetoric not only unnecessary but extremely distracting.<br/><br/>Even with engaging visuals, the film itself is an overall miss. Lackluster story, average acting and a theme of 'Occupy Wall Street in space' combine for a below average film. Four out of ten."
"Low_Rent","5","0","1","26 February 2014"," A good movie that falls a little flat.
","Elysium is a decent movie with good special effects and great acting by most of the cast. This movie will seem familiar to you as it is a storyline that we have seen all too often. While there were a few minor surprises in the story one can guess the outcome. All in all a fun movie to watch just don't expect much from the story.<br/><br/>Jodi Foster's character, Delacourt, had a couple of aspects to her that I found odd. First, her accent. Was it supposed to be French? It was so weak that I couldn't quite place it and found it distracting that every time I heard her speak I tried to place the accent instead of paying attention to the character interaction. Second, her death didn't make much sense. When Frey tried to save her life she refused help and died. There was nothing that I can remember about her character that suggested that she would accept death. Just the opposite. She was aggressive in her job of protecting Elysium from the ""undesirables"" and seemed to be a strong intelligent person with a strong grip on her life. I saw nothing that suggested that she would accept death when it came, in fact, I thought she would fight until the very end.<br/><br/>Minor quibbles I guess. A decent movie if you don't expect much."

"Bruce722","4","0","2","15 February 2014"," People are crazy if they think this is a good movie.
","What a disappointing movie Elysium turned out to be. Let's start with the one positive. The concept for the film is fantastic. The idea for an elitist group of society to be separated like that isn't necessarily original but there's a lot of potential there. Matt Damon and the rest of the cast is also pretty solid (other than Jodie Foster who sucks at life). The special effects and CGI are also pretty top notch but that's about the end of the positives. All of the other features combine to create an almost suckfest of a movie. The most glaring is the identity crisis suffered throughout the almost 2 hours. There are certain technologies in the film that would make Avatar jealous and on the other hand, there are things that we have right now. There doesn't appear to be any sense or logic to it, it's just variable and irregular and it kills the suspension of disbelief, which let's face it, this movie hinges desperately on. The plot is also ridiculously predictable and none of the characters are developed well. Overall, should've and could've been better with a quality director."
"samstokes2000","3","0","1","7 February 2014"," May be worse movie with Matt Damon AND Jodie Foster
","This movie is overly violent and makes little sense. It seems as if Matt Damon was filmed in one movie and Jodie Foster was filmed in another. Jodie Foster, who looks great, seems to be asexual, but Hollywood didn't dare make a statement about Gays/Lesbians, by having Jodie have a female life partner. Matt Damon is just a confused mess. <br/><br/>The Elysium space station set is poorly designed and make little or no sense given the ability to do interesting things in space, but NO, the culture designs track houses on a rotating space station of large size.<br/><br/>Then the technology, oh my gosh, if you think about it, and of course if it was a well written movie you wouldn't notice it, but the screen writer is completely either on drugs or just writing propaganda for the administration (which is fine, but at least do a good job).<br/><br/>Here is the way I see it: 1. Somehow the world community is able to build a large space station that is so large that you can see it completely visible in the daylight. Really? Since it appears to be stationary, it must be in a 25,000 mile orbit. 2. This same world community is unable to fix problems that it faces. 3. People seem to work if they are a criminal and don't if they aren't on the Earth's surface. 4. Surgery can be done in non-sterile environments. 5. Workplace safety is so poor that normal ""lock out, tag out"" procedures are not followed for closed environments with high radiation doses, something that has been in the workplace for 100 years. 6. Aircraft can somehow get to 25,000 mile orbit in just a few minutes. 7. It is possible to fire a shoulder weapon at a super sonic vehicle and hit it. 8. The ambulance space ships at the end are NOT going to be able to support enough help for the Earth's population, how many could there be? <br/><br/>This is just a mess of a screen play. Watch it for the most excellent acting by Jodie Foster and she LOOKS great. I wish it was possible to edit the film to get rid of the Matt Damon part and just have Jodie foster.<br/><br/>It's a piece of junk, but looks good, sort of. If you need an overly violent movie then this one is for you."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","7","0","2","2 February 2014"," This was An interesting SCI-FI Film.
","I actually liked this film regardless of what some people said about it. I've seen the film two times now and after seeing it a second time i felt like reviewing it. This film has good visuals and good special effects. Even if some people didn't like the film there is one thing that can't be denied, Elysium is a very well made film and the director put allot of effort into making it. Neil BlomKamp seems like a nice guy and you can tell he's a very visual director he Invisions how he want's his films to look and then he works as hard as he can to make the film that way. <br/><br/>Now is this film as good as district 9? No its Not but i still thought Elysium was a good film. I thought Elysium had some cool Action Scenes and i thought Matt Damon was good in his role as Max and Jodie Foster was okay as one of the bad guys. I also thought Sharlto Copley was a good villain. I thought he was quite creepy and sinister at times and he's actually very good at playing a bad guy and you could tell he had fun playing a bad guy. The films story is about the rich and poor,the year is 2154 and the poor people live on earth and the rich live on a space station called Elysium and the people from earth need tickets in order to get up there. the world of Elysium is a beautiful luxurious lifestyle that the citizens of earth keep trying to get into.<br/><br/>Now i can understand why some people may find this Story shallow and get offended by it but what people need to bare in mind is that this is a (science fiction) film and if your not a fan of science fiction you shouldn't watch the movie because it probably wont be your cup of tea. Now its true that some parts of the story were shallow but there were other parts that were not.there were actually a few scenes on earth between Matt and Alice Braga that i thought were touching.There were also scenes between Matt and Frey's Daughter that were nice and emotional.some people say this film has no heart but i Disagree i thought the film had some heart in certain places and the lack of (heart) that people speak off is mainly from the rich people of Elysium. I agree you don't care about any of the rich people and there is also a lack of motivation as to why everyone can't live on Elysium. the film lacked in some Areas but it was good in others. The film did have some problems i can't deny that but i thought Matt Damon's good performance made up for it along with the cool Action scenes between Matt and Sharlto.<br/><br/>Matt's Character gets Sick and he'll die in five days unless he gets to Elysium because Elysium owns machines that can cure anyone and save lives, So Matt needs to get to Elysium to save his life and later in the film he tries to save everyone else too. The story of the movie isn't the greatest but i thought the director had some interesting ideas for his movie and i liked some of them.I thought the story was Okay. The movie also had a slow start which was a bit of a problem for me but after a while the film picked up a bit and things started to get more interesting when we meet the bad guy Kruger played by Sharlto Copley. I liked Sharlto as a bad guy,he plays an evil creepy villain well and you buy him in the role.<br/><br/>I liked the scenes on earth with the spaceships i thought they were exciting,the bits with Sharlto and his men coming after Matt and his men.the gun fight between the men was cool and quite exciting and Matt gets into a small fight with Sharlto. i also liked the gadgets that all the bad guys were using. they had all these weapons that did different things.Kruger had these explosive things that blew people up and he also had a cool Shield that protected him from bullets,it was like a forcefield that could block anything and i found that quite Amusing. Matt had some cool Badass moments in the film like when he beats up two of the bad guys.I thought some good fighting moves were used during the fights and it was entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>The only memorable bad guys in the film were Sharlto Copley and Jodie Foster i thought the others were all forgettable Lame bad guys. Sharlto was a lot of fun to watch in this film especially at the end of the film when him and Matt have one final Fight.Sharlto was entertaining to watch but i have to admit he did go WAY OVER THE TOP at the end of the film and i know some people did Not like that and i can't really blame them because he was extreme,however for some reason i actually LIKED that he was over the top and psycho.i thought it was quite funny actually,and at the end of the day his performance entertained me.So what if he was Shooting everything and yelling? i thought it was Fun to watch!. I liked the ending fight i thought it was intense! however the fight could have been better if there hadn't been any shaky camera,that was a small problem i had but Luckily that didn't happen all the time. I also liked that the director tried to give the movie an emotional core but at the same time still made it Fun and gave us some cool fight scenes to watch. All in all i thought Elysium was a cool Film and despite its flaws i still Liked it."
"schreiber-stephen","5","0","1","20 January 2014"," It's too bad Blomkamp didn't make the screenplay as strong as a droid
","Elysium is billed as a group of the earth's population overcoming a futuristic version of the caste system where the main characters on the low end of the totem pole attempt to stick it to the man. It is more than that but not much more. Max (Matt Damon) is a factory worker who works for a defense company that develops the very machines and droids that keep him and all of his peers under the thumb of the rich who live on a Halo-like contained space station which is called ""Elysium."" In a nutshell, Max is given a few days to live but would be fine if he was on Elysium as they have the technology to be able to heal him. This is the motivation needed to want to infiltrate Elysium. After speaking to a former ""employer"" who would like to steal from one of the rich on Elysium, Max is given a suit and told ""we hook this into your nervous system and it'll make you strong as a droid."" The movie progresses from this point. The visual effects are incredible. Neill Blomkamp does an incredible job directing films with a large amount of visual effects. He does a great job of using motion blur and shaky cameras to keep everything looking real and puts you into the action.<br/><br/>There are plenty of things that keep Elysium from being a great movie. The biggest problem with this movie is the character Kruger (Sharlto Copley). The character is a bit too goofy and Copley is okay but it almost seems as if Blomkamp gave him this part because of a friendship they have. I could see a number of actors that would have been better in this role and might have made the role a little less goofy. Copley is better in this role than the one he played in District 9 but not much better. He is an okay actor but probably needs to become a bit more polished before taking on another large role like this one or the one in District 9. Copley reacts to some events in a way that doesn't seem to make much sense to me and he doesn't seem as sinister as Blomkamp might have wanted that character to be. There were also some parts of Elysium that seemed to be too silly. The fact is that this is a movie about futuristic events so take that for what it is and just enjoy the movie because if you try to pick apart certain details it will just drive you crazy.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the visual effects were incredible. Elysium, the space station hovering around the earth, looked incredible. The droids were awesome. Everything looked about as real as it could get using the amount of visual effects Blomkamp did. Elysium was an okay movie because the writing and some of the acting was a bit weak. For example, I like William Fichtner quite a bit but I felt like his performance wasn't quite where I'm use to. Blomkamp might not get as much out of actors as he should as a director and I assume that has something to do with his desire to make everything look perfect. I was excited for this movie but unfortunately it let me down."
"Buddy-51","7","0","1","17 January 2014"," A futuristic allegory for the Occupy generation
","In the year 2154, the earth has become a veritable wasteland of poverty, pollution and overpopulation (what a surprise). The wealthy elite have long since fled to a paradisiacal spaceship named Elysium (after the section in the Greek underworld reserved exclusively for heroes and poets) permanently orbiting the planet, where they lead lives of pampered ease, leaving the great unwashed masses back home to fend for themselves. Some of those masses make occasional desperate stabs at reaching the ship, where they are captured and put into camps, if they're lucky, or blown to smithereens before being able to land if they're not. Matt Damon plays a Joe Blow schmuck who, after receiving a fatal dose of radiation on the job, agrees to get in with a pretty bad crowd in order to get to Elysium to get a cure (the wealthy have all the medicines while the poor are left on Earth to sicken and die).<br/><br/>A post-apocalyptic tale for the Occupy generation, this allegory of class division and illegal immigration is the brainchild of Neill Blomkamp, the South African writer/director who gave us the surprise critical and commercial hit ""District 9"" in 2009.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in a number of respects, ""Elysium"" doesn't quite rise to the level of that earlier film. Damon's Max de Costa is such a dull Everyman character that he goes from relatable to boring in no time flat. And the story, though promising at first, quickly stalls out, as Max spends an inordinate amount of the movie's running time just trying to get up to Elysium - though, once he gets there, things do pick up considerably.<br/><br/>Purse-lipped Jodi Foster hams it up as the cold-blooded defense secretary whose job it is to make sure that nothing or no one threatens the idyllic life in Elysium - a woman so evil and callous she makes Cruella Deville and the Wicked Witch of the West look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.<br/><br/>Shortcomings aside, however, ""Elysium"" uses first-rate art direction and production design to create a compelling vision of the future. Its sociopolitical subtext also lends it a gravitas that the story itself could never have achieved on its own. Add to that a genuinely touching ending and you have a movie that fails to fulfill the promise laid out by ""District 9"" but which has virtues of its own to recommend it."
"proterozoic","4","0","1","14 January 2014"," The difference between what you think you did and what you actually did.
","Elysium is the movie District 9 would have been if it had sucked.<br/><br/>Imagine the Tea Party's worst stereotype of a ""Hollywood liberal"": a phony, sanctimonious poverty tourist who gets his picture taken trying to teach Amazon tribesmen how to do yoga. Now, imagine the movie this person would make as penance for the fact that he doesn't get what it's like to be disadvantaged, doesn't care, and does nothing to help anyone. You'd get something like Elysium.<br/><br/>150 years in the future, the Earth is a wasted working-class barrio, the rich have decamped to a luxurious orbital station that's essentially Beverly Hills in space. No, really. The people that funded and starred in this movie cast themselves and their own lifestyles as the villains, and it's anyone's guess if they even knew that they did it.<br/><br/>In this future, there are Health Care Pods that can fix any disease, but the Space Rich are hogging them all for their own facelifts; during the setup we see shiploads of illegal aliens (illegal earthlings?) trying to dodge missiles in order to get to one of the pods and heal the proverbial Little Girl - the first of a bunch, since that's how you zap the sympathy circuit for cheap.<br/><br/>It's not like you can't make a powerful and authentic message movie about class or immigration - take ""El Norte"" from 1983, or ""Dirty Pretty Things,"" or hey, even ""Gran Torino."" But that takes a bit of patience and writing. In Elysium, they must have had an alarm go off on set when the camera stopped shaking for five seconds. It feels like a movie shot by people whose biggest fear was that they weren't making enough noise.<br/><br/>It's a shame, because it's a very nice-looking action movie. Neill Blomkamp is great at making futuristic action visually believable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the action leaves no room for anything like dialogue or plot, both of which come across like a school project where the student copies a textbook sample with his name switched in, and flat-out doesn't get why that's wrong.<br/><br/>The protagonist: boy like girl, dream space station, grow up steal car, work bad job. Get radiation, must heal in Pod. Run, punch, shoot gun. This is the entirety of Matt Damon's character.<br/><br/>The ""mini-boss"": played by William Fichtner, which is enough to prove he's evil. In case it's not, he's made to say the phrase: ""Is his skin going to fall off? Then get him off the sheets."" The audience groans before they can ask themselves why the owner of a Bugatti space shuttle is making decisions about sick-bay sheets.<br/><br/>The main antagonist: played by Jodie Foster; proves she's evil by having sharp hair and blowing up immigrant ships first thing on-screen. Gets involved in absurd coup plot against the president of the evil space station, which makes her... evil-squared? The mad-dog muscle bad guy: Sharlto Copley under a dozen layers of beard. Is evil because he always talks about how much he's going to enjoy killing Matt Damon.<br/><br/>Almost forgot: the Little Girl that Matt Damon liked as a kid grows up and has a Little Girl of her own (that's 3 distinct Little Girls so far, if anyone's counting); she's deathly ill and needs some space health care.<br/><br/>The gravest of this movie's crimes is the ham-fisted condescension. You can only be so blunt and manipulative before the viewer checks out, and Elysium contains a moment like this for every one of its characters. The bed-sheet episode for the Fichtner miniboss is as good an illustration as any. We meet him in an evil-boss glass office above the factory floor; he's wearing an evil power-suit, has slicked-back evil hair, is looking at evil capitalist charts on a screen; and, just in case you still don't get which stereotype he represents, comes down personally to the medical bay to have an injured worker thrown off the bed before he messes it up with his hurt-fluids.<br/><br/>He doesn't have flunkie shift supervisors to handle petty cruelty for him, such as the manager who put Matt Damon's life in jeopardy in the first place? How does it make sense for a millionaire to do hands-on bed sheet management? It does if you're trying to mark a check-box and can't spare the time to do it well.<br/><br/>Last year, Jezebel published a compilation of horrible boss tales; one memorable story told of an Applebee's manager who made one of his workers finish a shift while she was having a miscarriage, because it was ""too late anyway."" We live in a world where this sort of thing happens for real, and the makers of Elysium couldn't even pull off ""abusive workplace"" with any authenticity? They wouldn't need to go far to find the real thing - read up on Hollywood employment practices if you want to know how to sweat people.<br/><br/>If you want to do a major movie on class disparity and exploitation - go for it. Do one decent scene that shows me how the system perpetuates itself. Show me how money creates a power imbalance in employment. Show me how the working classes are recruited into their own oppression. Show me how management and labor are played against each other. Show me how a climate of unspoken expectations causes low-level managers to take initiative in mistreating workers without explicit orders from above. Show me false hopes of social mobility.<br/><br/>You don't have to be subtle or coy - just don't be so damn lazy."
"TxMike","Null","0","1","12 January 2014"," We were entertained, but the movie overall was a bit disjointed.
","OK, here's a story set in the mid-22nd century, a recurring theme in many modern movies, humanity has not been good stewards of the Earth's natural resources, buildings are crumbling, and now only the less fortunate remain living and working there.<br/><br/>The really wealthy live in Elysium, a giant ring-like space colony that appears to be in a synchronous Earth orbit, which would make it roughly 22,000 miles away. Traveling to such a space colony would be a bit more difficult, and take a lot longer, than is depicted here. <br/><br/>The very wealthy who control Elysium have rules, and a defense system to back up the rules, so that undesirables are not allowed to travel there. But a man has traveled to Earth, he has some sort of computer code in his brain, and if they can steal it maybe the Earthlings can gain access to Elysium.<br/><br/>All this of course reminds me of real world situations today, examples are Mexicans or Cubans trying to get into the USA however they can. Swim the Rio Grande. Float by small boat. Face capture and deportation. Was this movie, ""Elysium"", just made as a social commentary? Or is it just using that theme because it has been so true for all of recorded history? The ""haves"" wanting to keep the ""have-nots"" suppressed? Like we see in the ""Hunger Games."" <br/><br/>Matt Damon is the main character, Max, a lowly ex-criminal and now production worker on Earth. Resulting from a job incident, where he is accidentally exposed to debilitating radiation, and only has a week to live, he has great incentive to get to Elysium where modern medicine can cure him. Plus a few others.<br/><br/>So, if you take away the futuristic premise, the story just becomes another ""us against them"" battle, and there are lots of battles in the movie. In fact a bit too much hand-to-hand fighting instead of more interesting story-telling.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster has an interesting role, as basically bad Delacourt who doesn't mind killing a few people if it will keep the Earthlings out of Elysium. Very cute Alice Braga, about 30 but aging very well, is Frey who has a daughter who needs care.<br/><br/>We enjoyed it as a diversion, entertainment by Blu-Ray on a Saturday night after dinner. But other than the novelty of a dying Earth and a fancy space colony, there isn't too much of an interesting story here."
"troubledyouth66","6","0","2","6 January 2014"," Illysium is just...Elysium
","Ah, Illysium. A movie of which matt damon portrays his oddly coupled self as the tarnished actor of a quiet shy guy...well not exactly for this science fiction flick. Matt Damon is stuck on an dystopian world of which he befriends the outlanders and at the same time has a Christ complex doing it, however he is not the only one stuck. The plot too is stuck. Here is why. The actor while fighting a villain whom portrays an evil unrelenting and hard to understand figure throughout the film meets the Chuck Norrissy/ Boba Fett guy in the middle and in doing so tricks him. Interesting enough though, I could have done without the action parts in the beg. One needs not to interpret this plot point or gain trust from it so easily. The more interesting thing about all of this was that the special effects and models were done exceptionally well, given my tastes of a film with cgi in it, it was also being ruined (hence cgi is cgi). The models and actors to replace these parts were done exceptionally well. With a little of the unneeded road warrior scene, this is no blade runner yet it has its reasons for attraction, damon must get to Illysium or else he will die from drug poisoning. I lose interest in the plot, but at the same time become attached to the main character and his struggle for achievement. Elysium's satellite base seems like a rip off of the halo ring, where one does not care too much for the fact of impossibilities but will notice its odd likeness. The science fiction movie was imho ruined. It could have been a Lucas' THX 1138 in terms of innovation, brave new world or whatever. Because the elements are there. Boring civilian life in outer space with a dispossessed government and militarized economy. Conspiracies and third parties being involved. However it lacked in one thing. The qualities of having to cope with the system, except they even through that in there, lol. What appears to be the roman aqueducts upon an elite atlantean caste system. I give this a C- yet may be the best movie this actor has been portrayed in. In terms of action adventure its T2, Total Recall, yet mixed with some elements of Drama hence its there but not all there. Unlike movies like Tom Cruise's oblivion where the main villain is omnipotent, this film has a small chance of success however not a good one."

","Review: This film wasn't as bad as I thought that it would be, but it's not a classic. It's quite a average supernatural movie that the has a backdrop of the future, but it's not very rememberable. I found the ending quite abrupt and I was hoping for a little twist, which just doesn't happen. It comes from the makers of District 9, which was a much better movie, but thats not to say that this is totally bad. I found Jodie Fosters voice a bit strange, but she just doesn't seem to age. If it wasn't for the eccentric baddie, who makes the movie, I don't think that the film would have been half as good. Some of the action scenes were quite good and the director did made use of CGI pretty well. In all its a watchable movie but nothing to get excited about.<br/><br/>Round-Up: Matt Damon puts in an average performance and he just seems to be pretty moody throughout the movie. This film won't hurt his career, but he won't get remembered for it like the Bourne franchise. Jodie Foster doesn't really star in that many movies, so I'm surprised that she took this role. I think that it was the hugely respected District 9 that made all of the actors rush to work with the director. The baddie, Sharlto Copley, who also starred in District 9 and the the A-Team, was great and surprisingly better than Matt Damon, which was due to his character. It does look a lot like District 9, but you can see that the director is dealing with a much bigger budget. <br/><br/>Budget: $115million Worldwide Gross: $286million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there supernatural movies about the future and the divide between the rich and the poor. 6/10"
"jeremy-889-963010","9","0","2","5 January 2014"," Good film--unacceptable for racist USA
","Elysium is a film with an uncompromising message and to that extent it is surprising that it ever got made, but unsurprising that it has faced so much criticism.<br/><br/>The core message from the makers of Elysium is that it is immoral for one privileged population to exclude another population from the benefits of modern medicine and social care, The use of the Spanish language as an identifier of the underdogs makes the message very clear. This is an indictment of US policy towards Latinos. The underdogs who care for the children of the US middle class, who clean the schools, homes and and offices of the affluent in the USA should also benefit from the medical and social facilities enjoyed by US citizens.<br/><br/>Not surprising this film is not popular. Critics attack the lack of story, but what they are really unhappy about is fact that the story does not glorify ""American Values"" those being-- typically--the inviolable rights of Anglo-Saxon Americans to defend their privileges with overwhelming fire-power.<br/><br/>Actions thrillers have a duty to confirm that God is white, Anglo-Saxon and very heavily armed. Elysium makes this claim, but then subverts it by implying that the White Anglo- Saxon Armelite God might also serve Spanish-speaking refugees. So Elysium is unlikely to appeal to the knuckle-dragging Rambo Admiration Society because, while they would run a mile from any accusation of racism, they feel strongly that border protection is an important issue. Nor will it appeal to audiences who understand the irony of the previous sentence, because anyone who appreciates Almodovar would not normally be drawn to films that spend much time salivating around armories. <br/><br/>The US film-going audience is not sentimental. They are not even particularly tolerant. If a film-maker wishes to proselytise they had best do so on a modest budget."

","The writers of this movie owe a huge debt to Larry Niven who introduced the ring world and the autodoc to science fiction. Granted, Nivens concept of an artificial world was much grander of course, since it circled a star!<br/><br/>I agree with other posters that some of this film's events seriously strain credibility even for science fiction. I don't think an autodoc would ever have the capability to reconstruct a human head that had been blown apart by a bomb. Also, the exoskeletons that were used seemed strangely inconsistent. Soon after being fitted with the device, Matt was involved in some violent confrontations in which he didn't seem to dominate his attackers as he should have with the exoskeleton. But I enjoyed the film overall as a suspenseful action adventure and the CGI was spectacular.<br/><br/>Props to Sharlto Copely for creating one of the most sadistic, brutal and probably insane villains ever."

","This is a decent movie. The story is an old one, dating back to Metropolis and in the not- to-distant past on Star Trek. A group of ""haves"" have removed themselves from the ""have-nots"" to a castle in the air. It is a self sustaining place where the lucky are able to live picket fence existences with little conflict. Unfortunately for them, there are people down on earth who are quite aware of their presence and would like a piece of the action. Matt Damon is a malcontent with a whole host of problems who finds himself the chosen one, through a series of events, not all of his own choosing. The movie is striking in that the world created visually defies the imagination. Unfortunately, there are so many holes in the plot, so much suspension of disbelief, that things just go too easily. Jody Foster is quite good as a sort of iron maiden who devotes her life to the status quo at any cost. Unfortunately, the infrastructure proves to be pretty fragile, considering how much effort and expense has been put into it. It is remindful of Mr. Spock disabling an entire planet by shooting at a single computer console. Backups and fail-safe systems seem to be lacking. Still it's a fun ride and keeps the audience in suspense."

It was all black and white, cookie cutter. Except for Spider who suddenly, without any warning, goes from slimy, sadistic underworld boss to co-savior of humanity.

I think that one of the most amazing things about movies in the future like this, is the use of the space and all the futuristic inventions. In this one it looks like they didn't really want to show that. But for what? The plot is not really interesting, and is based on not original facts, like the classes-division of humans. Matt Damon is always a great actor, but this is definitely not a great movie. I liked some scenes though, especially the action ones, but I've not seen nothing really great. This is definitely a good movie to watch if you're bored and you have nothing to do, but if you want to see something great, skip over."

","Don't get me wrong. The movie was a decent scifi film. But I doubt it will become one of those ""My Top 10 SciFi Movie"" or the similar lists.<br/><br/>To begin this review, the shaky camera (which reminds me of Paul Greengrass) was sometimes too ""shaky"" for me to get what's going on in the scene. This is quite wrong since the movie is an action movie. Some 'action' scenes weren't shaky while the other ones are. Kinda inconsistent if you ask me.<br/><br/>Now for the story, the movie is definitely 'different' which is good. Mat Daemon's character simply wants to go to Elysium because he's dying and a machine in Elysium will save him. However, I just can't figure out why the people from Elysium wouldn't just bring these devices to earth. After all, I'm given the impression that this stuff is one of the major reason why a lot of people on earth wants to go to Elysium.<br/><br/>There were surprising twists (dunno if you can really call them that) which involves reviving a should-be-dead antagonist in the movie. I never saw that one coming. Then another antagonist dies so unexpectedly. The character's way of dying was just too undeserved; too quick, too easy, with no proper punishment.<br/><br/>As a whole, however, the movie delivers. The first three quarters of the movie really did get me waiting as to what's gonna happen next. But in the last part of the movie, starting when an antagonist dies or perhaps earlier, the movie just fell flat for me. I didn't even get emotionally attached to the Daemon's character which I believe is one of the goal of the director so maybe when the movie ends, we'll feel, you know, emotional to the character and leave us with all the 'wushy-wushy', I- wanna-cry-because-of-his-sacrifice thing (which by the way is cliché yet unexpected in the movie).<br/><br/>Then again, I'll repeat myself, the movie delivers. It was decent (and by decent, I mean severely watchable). Then again, the movie is highly forgettable thus its not gonna end, most probably, in a scifi lover's Top Movie list of 2013.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."
"dejahnsalter1","7","0","1","28 December 2013"," Its pretty good....(except for Jodie Foster; who has a Looney Tunes 'Back In Action' Level Performance...And she wasn't even in that movie!)
","For starters, Let me just begin by saying, Matt Damon gave an amazing acting performance in Elysium...easily, one of his best. This movie, directed by masterful director Neill Blomkamp, isn't perfect (in fact, it has some big flaws) but overall its an enjoyable and intense sci-fi thrill ride that will keep the audience engaged for a set time. The action is explosion heavy and beefy and the plot is tried and true but still maintains interest. As aforementioned, however, Matt Damon kind of holds this entire movie on his brawny shoulders....the villains, played by Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley, ultimately fail to deliver. Especially Jodie. I'm calling her out on this one..Her performance was very over-dramatic and clichéd; she ultimately failed to bring her true ""villain side"" out. Same goes for Sharlto, but even his performance wasn't nearly as bad as Foster's. And in that sense, there's Elysium. That's the movie. Its engaging and interesting throughout (some parts drag however) and the action is great, but the tried and true plot and melodramatic performances/sequences build up...In the end, its a good film. Its a really good film in fact. But it could have been better (even 10 worthy) if the villains were more creative/interesting and if the plot was less heavy-handed and over-dramatic. <br/><br/>PS. Come On, Jodie. You can definitely do better than that.<br/><br/>And seriously critics, stop comparing this to District 9; there are many similarities but they are two completely different films...jeez.<br/><br/>-Tsuwamono"

","So intriguing the first instances of the film I sat there anticipating one hell of a dystopian flick. Jodie Foster entered the scene and I knew how the film would turn out.<br/><br/>Starting off the depiction of a beautiful, futuristic planet-kinda place called Elysium, the plot speaks about a kid's dream to go and live there. As Earth is (evidently) running low on basic amenities & high on population & toxins & radiations, this new place is a refuge. The weapons, the instrument, the medical healer and the trans-human theme are so interesting I was gob-smacked at the pure charm of 'em. But, then an idiotic, self-destructive drama coils in which not only pops unanswered questions but also makes the whole setup look foolish.<br/><br/>Not speaking about plot holes, Elysium doesn't pay attention to its characters as the second part tries to act smart and dives into a confusing state of blunder. Faux pas in movies, that is what Elysium is.<br/><br/>Although, the concepts and the ideas are worth watching over a fine screenplay of 100 minutes. The action scenes are sumptuous. And there was no need to touch the whole shebang with romance, thereby creating unnecessary emotion.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for a one-time watch!"
"buxbe","7","0","1","23 December 2013"," Still an interesting film by both insightful director and lead
","OK, it doesn't compare to District 9, but Elysium still has insights worth noting:  Why are med bays exclusive when you would get more out of people by healing all of them  Why would the wealthy recreate such inept stupid lifestyles in an environment that are still so unhealthy?  Is all industry on earth and being transported up? Where the hell is the energy coming for this?  That money is a really stupid measure of what makes life valuable to live.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed that Matt is not the usual super-girtty hero whose main force is power over thinking, that his death is not melodramatic immolation like it is for Will Smith. And that Matt's heart of 'gold' is something he has learned, not just innate. Circumstances can change your heart, but you can decide in what direction this will take you.<br/><br/>I have to admit the wealth lifestyle was farcical at best. They are as much prisoners of their stupidity as those on earth who want to live in chains. No one really needs money to survive, they need to use their creativity; this is dependent only on and through people. The people on earth could have decided to give the rich folk the finger and do what they want too survive together, not live in far for the scraps of 'money' you think you all need.<br/><br/>Anyway, looking forward to District 10. and the real global changes to follow that will not just live in films."
"sreethered","6","0","1","23 December 2013"," High expectation gone in vain...
","A sci-fi movie from the well-acclaimed director of District 9, starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Surely, the scale of expectation was high above, and I myself counted Elysium as a strong contender this year. But, when it finally hit the theaters, sadly, everything gone in vain. Neill Blomkamp handled a subject that was repeated a lot of times before, but with a fresh environment, that is , in a distant future. What he planned to convey that whether we live in stone age, or a civilized one , the difference between rich and poor will remain till the end, and there will be some people who will risk their lives to overcome that difference.<br/><br/>Blomkamp presented Max De Costa as a common man, not as a freedom fighter. That was a good move, since Max doesn't had much obligations to follow. He fought for his survival, his own life, and we can accept that there are no super heroes in Elysium. Supporting casts like Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley are also presented as people who lives for their own cause. It shows how aloof will be the society in a crisis. Technically, Elysium has it's own standards, and by no means it is comparable to D9. Lots of us considered D9 as a benchmark, and unfortunately, they couldn't value the existence of Elysium because of that. <br/><br/>What went wrong with Elysium was that it never dealt with the actual problems of people which lives in a chaotic society. I mean, was they only needed medical assistance? The whole world is polluted, and why don't they demand any technology that will reduced the pollution, instead of the ticket to Elysium. Science is much advanced to filter out dead cells and recreate new ones, right. What about their food source, and many important stuffs like that. Elysium forgot to maintain a strong plot over the platform which was provided by the story. The rest was a consequence of that fault.<br/><br/>On the acting department, Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley done a convincing part as Max and Kruger. Alice Braga didn't had much to do, and Jodie Foster was an unnecessary addition to the cast. The action sequences and special effects are plausible. <br/><br/>As a final word, watch it without any hope of magic that we had in D9, and You may enjoy Elysium......"

","It's as powerful a movie as District 9 was. I was curious whether he'd be able to keep it together among Hollywood budgets and sycophants...And it appears he has. It's brilliant. Powerful. This man has a knack for giving the audience a front row seat to what Hell looks like. ...But then again, HE actually know's hell's face...He's from South Africa. I hope it gives Americans some idea why nearly a thousand people risk their life, limb, and freedom every day to come to THIS country. If you're from the USA, and watching this movie didn't make you feel the teeniest bit guilty about your good fortune, then you weren't paying attention. I also enjoyed the progression of Matt Damon's character. Rarely in cinema is the story-line of a 'common man' rising above his circumstances to become something more than he was, morally speaking. ...And now, Blumkamp has done it twice. Bravo! <br/><br/>All that being said, it was a little rough in it's pacing, and dialog...Though that may be because Neill had to pare it down to it's bone without losing it's message. Hopefully he'll be going back in soon and retrieving those bits left on the editors floor and give it that extra 20 minutes that would make it a fuller story once again."

","Elysium is the newest film from director Neill Blomkamp the director of one of my all time favourites District 9 and i got to see this film a few days before initial release and i was literally sitting in my seat and i was just thinking ""I Get to See Elysium Before Most People.....Awesome!"" But 2 hours later i left the theatre and my jaw was on the floor. <br/><br/>Elysium was one of my most anticipated films of 2013 and this film absolutely did not disappoint! Elysium is an absolute visual masterpiece. The director really knows how to make his visuals look realistic. The acting is also great. The performance that really stole the show was Sharlto Copely as Agent Kruger. The character feels just nasty and brutal. The performance i felt was the weakest was Jody Foster as that old lady who isn't very nice (i can't remember her name) she felt very shoehorned into the movie and i thought her character was just flat out boring. The film also has terrific action scenes that are very well filmed. I personally was a really big fan of this film and i went to see it 3 times in theatres. Elysium is a terrific sci-fi film with a amazing performance from Sharlto Copely and a brilliant story."

"bob-rutzel-1","7","0","2","18 December 2013"," Good Sci-Fi, but too many fight scenes
","It's 2154. The Haves live on Elysium, a space station above earth. The Have-Nots live on a ravished, diseased and over-populated Earth below. Max (Matt Damon) who lives on Earth catches a fatal dose of radiation and is told by a robot he has 5-days to live and is given some pills for the pain. There is a plan to have Max go to Elysium for a cure and also to download security information so the people on Earth could go to and enjoy Elysium too. Right now the people on Earth are considered non-citizens and it is illegal for them to go to Elysium. Max's arm is imprinted with a counterfeit stamp to show he is a citizen of Elysium. <br/><br/>Webster's says Elysium is "" a place or condition of ideal happiness."" <br/><br/>Well, as you would expect, things go wrong and most of the movie shows fight scenes with Max trying to get to Elysium and then many fight scenes when he is on Elysium. Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a hit-man for Secretary Delecourt (Jodi Foster) relishes in shooting down shuttles from Earth that try to go to Elysium. Kruger concentrates on Max, who now has all the Elysium security info implanted in his head and because of that Kruger cannot kill Max because Delecourt needs that info to change the current Elysium government she considers too soft. <br/><br/>We don't get to know too much about any of the characters except for Max. We see Delacourt as a real Biaaatch who has no compassion for anyone. Robot builder John Carlyle (William Fichtner) needs long term contracts with Elysium and agrees to help Delacourt change things. And, not exactly a love interest, we see Frey (Alice Braga) a longtime childhood friend of Max and she has a child who has Leukemia and needs to go to Elysium for the cure. Frey and child complicate Max's mission. <br/><br/>In the beginning we see amazing beautiful sets of Elysium and later on we see more very good, but darkened sets, and this time as background for all the fight scenes that dominate the movie. There were just too many fight scenes when we needed to take a breath. We would have liked to have seen more of other characters and of Elysium as everything seemed perfect there. We like to see perfect things. <br/><br/>Was surprised to see William Fichtner look like a 25-yr old. There is that technology now to make people look younger than they are. I don't have a problem with that but I almost didn't recognize him at first. I think Jodi Foster looked quite young too. Kudos. <br/><br/>The acting all around is very good, but sometimes we had a hard time understanding Kruger's dialogues. That is, except when he went on a foul language tirade, then we understood him pretty good. <br/><br/>I can see you have a question regarding Matt Damon and the answer is yes, the Jason Bourne character does come out of him but in this movie it takes more time to get the job done.

","Yeah, Good one..but can not be compared to the few of the best Sci-Fi movies like ""District 9"" or ""Avatar"". The movie is missing that excitement. District 9 was a landmark film when it came to weaving a really strong story line into a futuristic setting that was emotional and heart breaking at the same time. Elysium has shades of D9 but the canvass is much bigger than anything Blomkamp has attempted. So if larger than life is your thing, Elysium won't disappoint. Special effects though minimal impress in the right places. They aren't in your face or brought out every five minutes. Elysium is a decent movie with some dazzling visuals, exciting action sequences and some good acting but it's too ham-fisted in its themes and messages which blunts it's political stand. It's no 'District 9' but it's adequately entertaining."
"cvyost","4","0","1","1 December 2013"," Good, but ...
","This movie was thoroughly disappointing and left me with the feeling it could have been so much more. For example: I found the long, wide shots of the habitat to be stunning, but up close they took on a surreal, fake quality. I've certainly seen better CGI. The characters had a similar quality - all of them. Character development? All of Damon's character development seemed to happened when he was child and all at the same time sitting on a swing in the ghetto. Relationships? Other than a few flash-back scenes between Damon and Braga, and a snippet here and a comment there Elysium leaves you trying to figure them out for yourself. Back story? Oh, right ...we had a few sentences at the beginning of the movie explaining everything. Again and again, I was left wanting more, or asking ""Why?"" or worse, asking ""Did I just miss something?"" and reaching for the back button on the remote.<br/><br/>Damon and Foster certainly try, but even Foster's brilliance can't save this movie. The rest of the cast doesn't get the chance to try, although Moura's 'Spider' character certainly leaves an impression. And I don't think I've ever seen Fichtner (Carlyle) play a block of wood so well. <br/><br/>Watch Elysium if you need a refresher on stereotypical science fiction, extreme rich vs. poor, totally ruthless bureaucrats, completely evil spec-op soldiers, and the really, really, really downtrodden masses."

"AudioFileZ","6","0","1","30 November 2013"," New World Order Cesspool Without Redemption
","Taking a particularly bleak picture of a future-time new world order to a sci-fi extreme is interesting in itself. Elysium starts with that expansive premise yet fails on a level of character and story development. What it does excel at is the actual CGI creation of the two polar opposite worlds. The effects are the one outstanding character if you will.<br/><br/>Max, played extremely straightforward by Damon, is born into a cruel earth where the ""haves"" have all left for the artificial outer space habitat of Elysium. Those left on earth suffer under the rule of Elysium's android enforcers. Max was raised in a sort of religious orphanage and as a young adult turned to crime which resulted in his incarceration and subsequent release on a tight leach. We can not feel much of a connection with Max as everything feels rushed.<br/><br/>Through a chance meeting with Max's only childhood love/acquaintance a back story is clumsily thrust on the viewer. As Max struggles to keep out of prison, as well as to remain employed at the ""evil"" android factory, this connection with his long lost love/friend Frey gives Max the only hope for anything remotely resembling a shred of human emotion. Due to the fast pacing, and the resistance of Frey whose only mission is to find a cure for her mortally ailing daughter, the Max/Frey relationship doesn't get much traction. Strangely, the viewer is left without much of an investment in these characters we're suppose to feel, and root, for.<br/><br/>Max suffers a massive dose of radiation at work which is said to give him 5-days left to live. Max sets out on a ""failure-is-not-an-option"" mission to reach Elysium where any affliction can be miraculously healed. Of course, time is short thus the movie ramps up its already fast pace. It's action from here on out which showcases the dazzling CGI generated backdrop without apology to advancing the viewer's relationship with protagonist Max or others. When Max gets wounded in the process of honoring his deal made in order to assume a false identity and trip to Elysium with the resistance. Seeking his nurse friend Frey for medical attention he waits outside the hospital she works at. Again, Max is a wanted criminal thus Frey must attend to him at her home. At Frey's home Max learns her young daughter is stricken with leukemia and she, too, needs the healing only possible on Elysium. Max seems hard hearted here as Frey pleads for him to take her daughter saying even if he could take the child she'd be rejected because she has no I.D. on Elysium. Strangely, until Frey's daughter recites a tale involving an insect and a hippo a much needed investment in our characters finally occurs. This little story, as told by the child, connects us to the characters on a small scale and totally re-purposes Max as to save Frey's daughter.<br/><br/>Here, the story again veers toward seems clumsiness as the writers have chosen to use an implanted computer program in Max's head. It feels hurriedly concocted since it Max would have enough trouble getting to Elysium without it simply because there's battle between a resistance movement seeking freedom from Elysium's murderous/oppressive rule which the face of is Elysium's director of security played by Jodie Foster. Ms. Foster has never been more bland than in her character here. It isn't a character so much as a human android, even so Ms. Foster simply sleepwalks the part. More memorable is her head henchman. A mouthy white South African low-life, he adds some needed color if it's one dimensional. Capturing Max, Frey, and Frey's daughter the goon is being dispatched to Elysium where the program inside of Max;s brain can be downloaded (delivered) to Ms. Foster's character who can use it to ascend to leadership among the sharks she works under. Now, this story is by the numbers and without creative character development things feel predictable beyond reason. <br/><br/>Still, when you accept the ride the CGI effects and action keep pushing things along. What could have been brilliant sci-fi is sorely reduced to passable and sometimes good. This movie is worth seeing by those highly addicted to science fiction, not so much by others, however. Matt Damon does all he's asked for, but the usual high level of charisma he possesses is simply squashed. For lovers of science fiction it is still a safe bet, but for the mainstream who likes their sci-fi with a healthy dose of human interest Elysium largely fails. Therefore, Elysium will be largely panned by the public at large. I'd give it a 5 which simply must be raised to a six based on the CGI alone."
"hypersonic8999","8","0","1","26 November 2013"," Don't listen to all the bad hype, this film is quite worth watching
","Elysium is about a socioeconomic situation in the year 2154 (Babylon 5 anyone?) that puts all the rich ""nobility"" in a station orbiting the Earth that has everything, and the rest of humankind is left struggling with the scraps on Earth. The protagonist is an ex-con working in a droid-assembly factory who gets lethally irradiated and decides to go to a black marketeer who agrees to give him passage to Elysium in exchange for all the information contained in a billionaire's brain (because USB sticks are too insecure apparently).<br/><br/>Now, the sides shown in this plot are not what'd you call grey, with the exception of Spider (the black marketeer) who is portrayed as just a greedy criminal in the beginning but it's shown that he actually cares for people as the film goes on. The rich are pure evil, keeping every scrap of resources for themselves, hosting garden parties while not caring for the people left behind on Earth, while the poor are good people struggling by or forced to crime. Understandably, this is not enough for some film-lovers nowadays, but in my personal opinion, it ties great to the film, because it's an over-exaggerated metaphor of human society from the medieval ages till today. It portrays what's the worse that humanity can do with the social and economic ideologies it uses today, the rich get fatter and the poor can't even find a piece of string in their pockets. One could say that the leaders of Elysium are evil and greedy beyond logic (e.g. they keep heal-everything equipment in every house and they have a surplus stored in hundreds of ship, while people on Earth are left to deal with disease and injury the old fashioned ways), but really, take a look at today's society and tell me that if laws didn't exist to make everyone equal, we wouldn't be having the same situation. Just look at how Walmart treats its customer and then you can go bashing the film. Well, Elysium is a universe where such laws are not in place.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, and the CGI need to be commended. There's plenty of action for those who like it, but plot and character development doesn't lag behind. The hero is a strong suite in Elysium. Max is not the kind of hero who tries to do what's right because it's right. He is an antihero of sorts, because he does what he does for his own self-interest. He's not greedy or anything, he's just looking for the best way to survive. It's a quite realistic depiction for a character, one that you don't see very often, and *SPOILER* only towards the end, where he realizes that he can't do anything to save himself, he becomes selfless and decides to sacrifice himself for the good of others *END SPOILER*.<br/><br/>If you've seen District 9, then you'll recognize the equivalent story. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's something that bothered me a little, although I can see how it would be hard to write a very different story, considering that the film wants to touch certain issues. If you think about it, it's a re-imagination of District 9, where the aliens are replaced by humans, and the humans are replaced by rich humans.<br/><br/>The ending is awesome, and I'll leave it at that. For me the ending cleared up any shortcomings I could see, and I'll be honest, there wasn't a lot. I wished there was a bigger ending sequence however, maybe extended by a couple minutes, but hey, you can't have everything.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A solid film - 8/10 - Just off from being blown away."

The film was a bit confusing around 10-20 minutes in, but picked up quickly. I would consider this a movie to watch with friends, possibly parents or a date.<br/><br/>A few things caught my eye that really bothered me. The first being no beginning or end to the plot. For example, we receive no explanation as to why the upper echelon live on a giant ring in space. I also get this run-of-the-mill, totally evil, not dynamic in any way, feeling from Secretary Delacourt and Agent Kruger. I was hoping for a change of heart from one of them. The acting was good, the character dynamics not so much. The movie felt exactly like District 9, down to the powered exoskeleton. Even the ring looked and felt like Halo. The movie ended with me saying ""now what""?<br/><br/>It could have been more adventurous with the character development. A lot of questions went unanswered. If the economics of the upper and lower class had more storyline, I would have given it an 8. Had the cliché's of greedy, evil Capitalism been replaced with half their paychecks going to taxes (how it really is) I would have given it a 9. Finally, had Max not gone into the room like an idiot and get zapped, had Delacourt not have stood there and waited to get stabbed, had Frey defended herself instead of getting pushed around, I would've given it a 10.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, watch it."

In fact if the director had not used any famous actors, I dare say it would be so much better. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen district 9, then let me sum it all up in bullets:<br/><br/>*Pros: a poor excuse of a plot, bad acting (partly due to the script) <br/><br/>*Cons: really good setting, nice photography, good SFX<br/><br/>*a lot of hand-held camera work<br/><br/>*average action sequences<br/><br/>*about the political commentary: Elysium is an overtly anti- capitalist/anti-imperialist screamer, not in the classic Hollywood sense of good vs evil - it's not the antithesis between rich evil bastards and poor good people; as the writer highlights from start to finish, the cause of unhappiness is clearly to be found in the system itself. Really huge (full with blinking neon arrows) parallels are drawn with modern day exploitation of the third world by the west, of the worker and nature by the capital, and so on, and so on. The message is so blatantly thrown in the face of the viewer that many people are genuinely put off by it for purely ideological reasons. The same allusions were evident in district 9, but people took that film more like it was about racism, which is more universally accepted as a bad thing.<br/><br/>*overall: slightly above average flick"

","I watched this movie because of 3 names: Jodie Foster, Matt Damon and Neill Blomkamp. A strong actress, a good action actor and a promising director whose film (District 9) is quite a fresh take of sci-fi genre but somehow feels like a documentary, a bit flat. I was expecting this time, there wil be more emotion, more drama, more upz and downs like a roller coaster. But somehow, this was also feels the same like his previous movie.<br/><br/>Even the story is feel like just another version of District 9. Both about 2 separated colony. Then one colony wants to have a better future and invade the other and these movies have similar rhythm and tone. The difference is, the hero in District 9 is a cop protecting the invaded colony, this time our hero is 'the alien' invading the colony trying to save his life. I think the director has an obsession about 2 conflicting colony since he's from South Africa.<br/><br/>It's not the best act from Matt Damon and certainly Jodie Foster great talent in here is being wasted."

A visual, near-masterpiece, and most movies of this kind, should end there. Elysium, Minority Report, and the likes are primarily, solely if you like, VISUAL MOVIES. Foretelling, visually the future. The story is an added benefit. So, If you have this in your mind, you enjoy the movie, and rate it highly. If not, you will be all your life, discontent with movies of the Future! You cannot shove in Elysium acting and stories like 'In the Name of the Father' and 'Shaw Shank Redemption.' These movies are acting/story. Elysium/Minority are Visuals. Full stop!"

","OK, silly me. I thought I'd be watching an interesting science fiction movie. I had intentionally not learned much about the movie. I knew Matt Damon, there is a cool photo promo that looked ""space like"", and class warfare with the satellite being where the rich folks went to live. I've been associated with writing, reading, and critiquing science fiction since before there was an Asimov's Magazine. Having been that exposed to science fiction info and a speck more would completely ruin anything ""new"", or ""surprise"" for me. <br/><br/>I can probably tell you 30 movies you've seen with this plot, but it is often a little more interesting in a dystopia setting. I was looking forward to that. I pretty much continued with my plot assumptions through the twists and turns right to the end of the movie, never terribly surprised yet thinking the movie was OK except for the unusually slow start and a couple ""Reeeaaly?"" moments.<br/><br/>It was after the move a bit that I decided I really don't like it much. I'M ABOUT TO RUIN THE DAY. **SPOILERS AHEAD**<br/><br/>It is a hyper-political-agenda driven movie that shoots loose with ""science"" in the fiction. Now I again suggest anyone who doesn't like spoilers to shut it down and move along.<br/><br/>If you liked District 9, Hunger Games, The Postman, or more precisely, Johnny Mnemonic, etc., this one is up your road. If you are young and your experience in life is largely from our ""schools"", you'll not see much wrong with this movie. If you are a liberal, progressive, democrat, or thrive on the main stream media portrayal of current events, you should take your pom-poms with you.<br/><br/>If you want your booms, bangs, and CGI extravaganzas in a hurry and like to sit on the edge of your seat I would tell you to come rather late to the movie, except you would miss one vital little scene early on that is supposed to drive a lot of the motive you'd expect in this move.<br/><br/>More **SPOILER**: Another of the premises that drives the action is unbelievable if you're familiar with a fatal dose of radiation. The movie tries to compensate like that condition is a handicap that can be resolved with a superhuman exoskeleton. If you can suspend your disbelief around that adaptation you should still be OK: Until our protagonist gets fatally injured again and repaired with a bandage. Movies are only so long and you can't dwell on details like a dead protagonist when your protagonist needs to be as strong and determined as a terminator.<br/><br/>There's action, an evil villain, and that tick-tock suspension that is required to give you the feeling of urgency. So if you brought your pom-poms on my advice, you'll be ready to give this one a top rating. If you're like me and really want to know if a movie is a political agenda statement slightly and sacrilegiously veiled in a science fiction movie you can skip this one, read the Los Angeles Times and turn on MSNBC on any given day and you'll get the message."

"chi-cerca-trova","7","0","1","1 October 2013"," Spade review for ""Elysium""
","Overall: Elysium is a visually stunning science fiction melodrama set in a very well built and designed world that is ultimately held back by its weak characterization. Neil Blokamp has firmly established himself as the genre's most visually gifted directors and will hopefully continue challenging the vapid nature of modern, big budget sci-fi. 7/10<br/><br/>Detailed Review:<br/><br/>A) Story/Script: The story is relatively straight forward; characters are archetypes that say the lines demanded by their stereotypes. Yet, the story is effective. The plot is spun out well and is decently paced from set piece to set piece. A stronger, more nuanced script would have really elevated this film, especially with it backed by such strong production values. However, Neil Blokamp really excels at making this an international affair, with different dialects and accents naturally worked into the story. 6/10<br/><br/>B) Characters: Each character is an archetype: the ex-con with a heart of gold, the cold Defense Secretary, the psychopathic Mercenary, the childhood friend with a kid in peril. While they do serve their purposes amiably, it is disappointing after the nuanced and multifaceted characters seen in ""District 9"". However, they are played well by their respective actors, with a special mention going to Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley: both play against type very well, inhabiting roles that could have been pure stock characters is played by someone else. 6/10<br/><br/>C) Design: This is an absolutely visually stunning movie: the stark contrasts between Elysium and Earth are more than just shifts in color palettes. Both use gorgeous architectural designs that really tell a story of their own. While the idea of the ""used future"" is not original, here it is used with such effectiveness that others will be hard pressed to beat it. The vehicle and weapons design are absolutely brilliant, and they tie into the respective aesthetics excellently, which really emphasizes the history of this world. All together, the visual design of this film really lends credibility to a story that would have been sorely lacking otherwise. 9/10<br/><br/>D) Sound/Music: The sound design is as stunning as the visuals they compliment. Engines, saws, gun shots, everything has a punch to them, really pushing the drama on screen further and wringing every last ounce of weight out of these set pieces. The score is a typical, sci fi score, with requisite bombastic portions complimented by slower and quieter sections. It serves its purpose without overstepping its boundaries; a simple but effective score is always better than a loud one that detracts from the film. 9/10<br/><br/>E) Purpose/Misc: Elysium is pure sci-fi melodrama, yet it's hard to hold that against it too much; it's ultimately overshadowed by ""District 9"". We have seen Neil Blokamp do effective sci-fi drama while still giving us a challenging story and characters in ""District 9"", so to see this Avatar-esque story supported by such stunning visuals and creative direction is a bit disheartening. Having said that, Neil Blokamp is a director very distinctly in command of the style and nature of the films he creates and does an excellent job building them. When he inevitably matches the style of ""Elysium"" with the brains and heart of ""District 9"", it could potentially be genre defining. 8/10"
"estebangonzalez10","7","0","1","30 September 2013"," As long as you're not expecting another District 9 you'll be OK
","""I promise you, one day I'll take you to Elysium.""<br/><br/>Elysium is Neill Blomkamp's sophomore sci-fi film after his critically acclaimed debut with District 9. Expectations were high considering that film was a unique experience in that it blended some great sci-fi visuals with a social commentary about the apartheid movement in South Africa. District 9 worked as a modern day parable. Sadly Elysium doesn't live up to those high standards he set in his previous movie, but I still have to admit I had a fun time with this film. I think people would've enjoyed this film a little more if they didn't know it was directed by the same person who brought us the groundbreaking District 9. Elysium is far from being a great film because it is very predictable and generic. There were no twists or surprises here, but I enjoyed the CGI and the performances from some of the cast members (sorry Jodie Foster, I can't include you here). Elysium works as a blockbuster as long as you don't think too much about the plot. Unlike in District 9, the social commentary doesn't work too well here because the characterizations were extremely over the top (Jodie Foster could've toned it down a bit). Blomkamp was trying to criticize the immigration issue and the difference in privileges between the rich and poor. However, I felt that as an action sci-fi film it kept me entertained despite the predictability so I still had a good time with Elysium.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 2154 where the planet has suffered from overpopulation and the wealthy have decided to live off in a space station called Elysium. The wealthy have access to a very comfortable life and state of the art equipment such as these medical capsules that heal you in a matter of seconds. Max (Matt Damon) has been dreaming of living in Elysium but his social condition doesn't allow it. He's committed several crimes in the past, but now he's decided to clean up his act and work at a local armor factory. After an incident with some droids, he runs into his childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), who's working as a nurse. Max isn't the only one who dreams of being able to go to Elysium. Several thousands of people have searched for a way to get a ticket (especially the sick who want to get healed in those capsules), but Officer Delacourt Rhodes (Jodie Foster) enforces the anti-immigration laws with a stern hand and will stop at nothing to ensure the safety of the wealthy class. When illegal crafts try to enter Elysium she doesn't hesitate in using force to stop them. One of her best agents is Kruger (Sharlto Copley) who happens to be psychotic as well and loves to use violence. When Max suffers an accident at work he is forced to find a way to Elysium and will stop at nothing to get there. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Matt Damon's lead performance here and it was good to see Copley teaming up with Blomkamp again. The face off between these two characters was probably my favorite scene in this film. Elysium isn't the best sci-fi film of the year, but it still is an enjoyable flick if you go into it with low expectations. The action is pretty fast paced and at times the slow motion action scenes look like a video game. Blomkamp is a young and talented writer/director who will probably continue having success in the genre. Again I think the main weakness of the film was its overselling of the social commentary, but the premise and the action scenes lift this film from other formulaic sci-fi action films. I guess that the wealthy habitants of Elysium would've been better off if they simply offered their employees a better health care system. The lovely Alice Braga should also go over her roles a little as to try not to come up with a same ending again because the closure was almost identical to I Am Legend."
"damata-dg","7","0","1","30 September 2013"," Great movie, but not quite there yet
","***spoilers below***<br/><br/>My high grade for this movie comes from the immense heart it has. Different from a regular sci-fi blockbuster like Oblivion, Blomkamp's works show a strong belief in what is being said, about the social commentary and future scenarios always grounded with real, current issues. Of course, the movie works more like a metaphor than a likely scenario. Just like District 9 (a superior film in every way) deals with economic and ethnic differences and showed an ironic moral play against prejudice, Elysium plays with the notion of economic powers X third world, and it works as a beautiful and powerful situation that is disturbingly familiar (at least for me, a Brazilian, the movie's universe felt very very real). The visuals are amazing as usual, and the movie only disappoints in the third act when it gets too Hollywood-esque (the nemesis fight looked too much Iron Man-y, over-the-top for the movie's intentions), and the big final dramatic twist (Max's sacrifice) didn't do the job since Max didn't have enough psychological set-up and strong characterization for the public to feel a strong enough empathy with him (unlike District 9, which was brilliant at that). So, the final scenes felt cliché and flat. Anyway, Elysium tried to be a new District 9, but it couldn't (few can). Nonetheless, what the movie accomplished still is much better and much deeper than your regular action sci-fi."

Or does it just help the moneyed few, and grow the gulf further between the haves and the have nots? Already there are signs of the latter- however the spin doctors may be spinning their numbers, the poor in the world are increasingly getting poorer, and the rich are getting richer. At the same time, global resources are exponentially decreasing- in this kind of a scenario, we might not have to wait till 150 for an Elysium to be created, and it being over-run.<br/><br/>The year is 2154, and nothing else highlights the prevalent social and economic inequalities than Elysium-a pristine, man made space station with magical medical facilities, where the wealthy have retired to, while the poor continue to live in servitude in a devastated earth. All it takes though is one small opening to break the boundaries, and Matt Damon as Max Costa is the catalyst for this revolution, as almost single-handedly and improbably so, he brings equality to the system, battling scheming politicians, and blood-thirsty mercenaries.<br/><br/>Neill Blomkamp is way down from his stratospheric 2009 debut, District 9 here, but there is no doubting his vision, and mastery over action, thrills and visual effects. But the script is not half as good, the characters not interesting enough, and the acting is ho hum too. Matt Damon is almost trans-humanly serene, Jodie Foster looked disinterested, and Sharlto Copley might do the crazed act passably well enough, but has a unintelligible accent and is utterly predictable. Elysium reminded me so much of Oblivion, similar strengths, similar flaws. In fact, utterly predictable is something you could say for the entire movie, and that is never a good thing to say when it comes to sci-fi flicks. <br/><br/>To sum up, Elysium tries to marry social commentary with sci-fi. The aim was honest, the execution, could have been better.

"sarah-heyer2013","7","0","1","22 September 2013"," A bad wannabe Sci-Fi movie.
","The first 10 to 20 minutes of the movie draws you in; showing scenes of a dirty, bare, probably war-torn Earth and a pristine, luxurious, perfect Elysium. The movie is promising as it is visually engaging with an intriguing concept, making you want to learn more about the world of Elysium. Unfortunately, the CGI is the only notable part of the film. Elysium is a let down once you realize that the acting, characterization, and plot are no good. In the year 2154, the people of Earth live amongst filth and desert, the whole world has become vastly overpopulated and polluted. The 1% of the upper-class escape the poverty and devastation by living on a wheel- shaped space station in Earth's orbit, just outside of the atmosphere. These places seem so real and Elysium feels so unattainable. The movie does lack an individual identity, the gritty futuristic world is comparable to Blomkamp's District 9.The CGI is so amazing, one could feel as though Elysium is an actual place and that earth is actually a ghetto at a global scale. The artfully crafted space shuttles move you smoothly from scene to scene in this broken world. Anyone who sees this movie will notice that the CGI is completely convincing. Jodi Foster's acting as Secretary Delacour in this film is absolutely atrocious. It seems as though she isn't quite sure about her character's motivation, or what country she's from. Whatever accent she is trying to duplicate, it doesn't exist. Matt Damon's performance as Max was better, but for me he seemed a little devoid of emotion. Although his performance disappointed me I did enjoy his use of sarcasm towards the robots he encounters throughout the film. I am also confused with his motivation to reach Elysium. At first he wants to get there to save himself, then to save his childhood friend's daughter, then the whole world. As if healing all the people on Earth would solve the much bigger more permanent problems, such as overpopulation and pollution. The concept of the movie was good, a political satire of the haves and the have-not. I was expecting to get to see more into the world of the impoverished, and the extremely wealthy. It seems as though the majority of the movie is too long bloody fight scenes, explosions, and chase scenes. None of that can substitute for a bad plot. The characters in the film are also lackluster. I found myself not caring about Matt Damon, although he's supposed to be the hero. The movie tried to add some depth to the character, but showing the same scene over and over again of young Max running through the dusty city streets of Mexico is hardly readable. Krugar, plays as another one of Max's enemies, he protects Elysium from Earth. His character could have easily been placed in any sci-fi action movie without question. No emotional connections can be made with any of the characters because of the lack of back story, making it hard to want to root for or against them. Overall the movie was okay to watch if you like action movies with a lot of punching and things that blow up, there is not much more to look into it than that. I thought I liked it at first but left the theater confused, and feeling like I hadn't gotten to see enough."

","In the year 2154, two classes of people exist: the very wealthy, who live on a pristine man-made space station called Elysium, and the rest, who live on an overpopulated, ruined Earth. The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max (Matt Damon), an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well. (Sony). The film is visually stunning, as in one of the best looking movies of the year. It is truly a joy for the eyes. And the action scenes are really, really good. Matt Damon gives a good performance,as does Sharlto Copley as Kruger and so does most of the cast. And the pacing is fast and makes sure you never get bored. The script is sort of a mixed bag however: While not bad, it is filled with an abundance of cliché's and the overall political message is constantly thrown at the viewer to the point of becoming flat out annoying. Also note to Mr. Neill Blomkamp: If you are going to try to deliver a heavy political message, make sure you chose a movie that isn't a dumb summer blockbuster action flick. Also the villains in the movie I found to be incredibly one-dimensional. Also the third-act leaves much to be desired. At the end of the day, Elysium is a dumb but really fun summer blockbuster, nothing more, nothing less."

","Jodie Foster was absolutely RIVETING in this. About 180 degrees away from her performance in Silence of the Lambs. In ""Silence"", she had a certain vulnerability, but there's not a trace of that in this. After her first scene, I spent the rest of the movie just waiting for her to come back on screen. She effectively steals the movie from Matt Damon completely. The cinematography in the fight scenes is so jumpy, most of the time you can't tell which combatant you're watching. Very distracting and totally frustrating. Can't imagine what they were thinking....<br/><br/>The scenes on Elysium are reminiscent of Beverly Hills (which, I'm sure, was intentional) and the scenes on Earth were right out of District 9.<br/><br/>The points made by other reviewers about the technical sci-fi aspects are generally well-taken, but none of that bothered me. We thought we were seeing it in 3-D, only to find out (after we had paid $18 per ticket at the SENIOR rate!) that it was only filmed in IMAX, not 3-D. Very disappointing. Since when does a movie NOT in 3-D cost $18 a ticket?!?"
"emilmarty","8","0","1","15 September 2013"," The same but different!
","There have recently been so many films with the same plot: post- apocalyptic earth. However, unlike it's disappointing predecessors, Elysium doesn't pull you in that way. Such recent films as After Earth and Oblivion think they can entertain simply through their ""original"" setting and forget that there needs to be real characters and decent story lines. Elysium instead grips the audience with its edgy characters and action scenes. It uses the post-apocalyptic earth setting as a basis for tackling issues such as politics, capitalism and equality; and rather than handing it to you on a plate, Elysium lets this sizzle on the side for audiences to ponder. People have said it's a worn out District 9, and I can't argue since I haven't seen it. So, from the point of view of a Blomkamp virgin, I loved it. For Blomkamp fans, you may feel like you've seen it all before (so I hear). <br/><br/>Verdict: Where it lacks for in originality, it makes up for in edgy character, stunning cinematography and great action scenes."

"PyroSikTh","8","0","1","27 August 2013"," Very enjoyable, but not perfect.
","The plot is...actually fairly simplistic. The rich live on a space station with super-technology that enables them to live 100% healthy lives for hundreds of years, while the poor live on a diseased and polluted Earth struggling daily to get by. Max suffers a serious injury that will leave him dead in under a week unless he can get to the super medical facilities on Elysium so he makes a deal with a gangster, and ends up holding the key to re-addressing balance to humanity. There's a couple of sub-plots here and there, including Max's childhood friend and the Elysium secretary of defense attempting to stage a coup, but by the halfway mark all the threads have merged together into a simple action movie; get to Elysium, kill the bad guy, heal humanity. It's not particularly taxing, but it's an engaging and interesting storyline that'll have you hooked from beginning to end, with a few unpredictable turns here and there.<br/><br/>Naturally Blomkamp has injected a fair dose of politics into the movie, highlighting the gulf of disconnect between the rich and the poor. He also has a stab at the state of healthcare in some countries (of course I can't say it's that bad in every country as the UK has pretty good healthcare) by pointing out the elitism of Elysium's healthcare beds that can heal any and all ills a human being might have by simply re-atomising them. All-in-all though, while the messages are there, they're not as strong or focal as they were in District 9, and really most the themes are exactly the same. A simple case of 'been there, done that'.<br/><br/>The acting quality was a bit all over the place I have to admit. Matt Damon, Alice Braga and William Fichtner all played their parts well, but were maybe a bit too hampered by being under- developed. Literally the only solid development any of the characters get is a couple of flashbacks to Max and Frey as children, and a nun giving Max a locket with a picture of the Earth inside. They're not just cardboard cut-outs either. While they're underdeveloped, there's still enough in them to make them engaging enough. I just feel a little more could've been done. Jodie Foster was unfortunately a huge disappointment. This is a far cry from her Oscar- nominated performances. She just looked awkward and like she was trying too hard, and she had a weird accent. I think she was trying to sound French, but she just failed and it became really distracting. Sharlto Copley on the other hand was unsurprisingly brilliant. He really seemed to tap into the mindset of such a disturbed sociopath and he ate up every scene with his creepiness. He was also a badass with a beard, a katana, and some sort of energy shield. The villain-of-the-year award goes to Copley's Kruger!<br/><br/>The CGI was absolutely amazing, which again is hardly surprising coming from Blomkamp. There's a huge attention to detail paid to the shuttles and Elysium itself, both visually and thematically. One example being how Elysium is completely open to space, it's own atmosphere maintained by it's inherent gravitational pull from it's spin. It's a really great concept that probably isn't as unfeasible as you might think. Another thing I noticed was how the shuttle of John Carlyle, an Elysium citizen, is meant to be a Bugati. It had the sleek lines and curves of the Veyron, and had the standard red and black colour scheme, and even had a Bugati badge on the back. Being a Bugati Veyron fan, I liked that touch.<br/><br/>The movie is also remarkably gory. I did not expect that all. It's not filled with gore, but what little of it there is really milks everything it can. One of the weapons Kruger uses literally blows people apart on the spot, so you get body parts flying all over the place, and there's one scene where a guy gets his face blown apart by a grenade, and then has it reconstructed in all it's gory detail via the super healthcare beds on Elysium. It's gruesome stuff. Oh, and of course Max's surgery to have the exoskeleton attached is not for the faint of heart. Elysium doesn't like you to imagine anything, it would rather show you.<br/><br/>It's not all perfect though. The second half, and the climax in particular, lost it's way. I know Kruger is meant to be an unhinged guy, but his snap once on Elysium just came out of nowhere without any real explanation. To make it worse the inhabitants of Elysium just seem to bend- over and take it; a rogue special agent going crazy as well as a group of illegal's trying to muscle in. Where's the Elysium enforcer's in all of this? Why don't they get involved? The first half seems to make a big thing of the robot police force, but by the second half they're almost completely forgotten.<br/><br/>I feel I could compare Elysium to Dark Knight Rises, where the first two-thirds of the movie are fantastic, the big climax is a real letdown full of plot holes, and the closing scenes go back to brilliance to close everything up with an emotional edge. And it really is an emotional edge from Elysium. I actually started to well up, not only at how sad it was, but how happy it was too. It was a somewhat predictable ending, but yes, I was almost brought to happy-tears. While Elysium wasn't perfect, I can't say it was a disappointment as I definitely enjoyed myself. I give it a very good 8/10, but only just."
"alan-chan-158-451491","8","0","1","8 September 2013"," Not another District 9 BUT confirms Blomkamp as a young James Cameron
","If District 9 was a political parable about racism so Elysium is a social commentary on rich and poor, healthcare, pollution, overcrowding, immigration and class war: the big themes of today but set in a dystopian future - 2154. <br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Max Da Costa, an ex-car thief and parolee living in Los Angeles who is trying to earn an honest living in a robotics factory, despite attempts to prise him away back to a life of crime. A terrible industrial accident leaves him with only five days to live and desperate to survive, Max seeks an illegal flight to Elysium, a space station that is a luxurious haven for the wealthy from a ruined and wasted Earth, so that he can be cured by a miraculous medical device called a Med-Pod found in every home and which keeps the citizens of Elysium free from disease. To earn his transport Max is commissioned by Spider (Wagner Moura), a local smuggler and hacker, to kidnap an important citizen from Elysium and download information from his brain. To maintain his life in order to complete the mission, Max is fitted with a powered exoskeleton that gives him the strength of the androids that protect the titular space station and some cool weapons. The mission goes awry and Max receives far more than he bargained for. The Elysian Secretary of Defence, Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster), orders a vicious killer and sleeper agent on Earth, Kruger (Sharlto Copley), to hunt down Max and retrieve the information from his brain that he has downloaded. Cue action, high speed chases and all round mayhem.<br/><br/>Elysium is a good film but does not contain the visceral excitement of District 9. All the leads are good and Jodie Foster plays a deliciously conniving villain. Sharlto Copley is a revelation as the mercenary killer, basing his portrayal on the South African Defence Force (SADF) Special Forces Units that fought the border war with Angola between 1966 and 1989, and eats up the screen with his charismatic dementedness. Copley looks badass and test audiences in America were apparently rooting for him – you can see why. Damon is good as the everyman hero and the emotional heart of the film is his nuanced journey from selfish ex-con to self sacrificing hero. Wagner Moura provides good support as the criminal kingpin but it is a world away from his alpha male depiction of Captain Nascimento of Elite Squad fame. The music is good but sounds too much like Inception in parts. <br/><br/>The fact that the film does disappoint is high praise indeed after the high watermark of District 9. There are three main problems with the film. The first is Damon's character. You just don't care enough about him in the way that you did for Wikus van der Merwe, who was transformed into an alien in District 9. The second is the logic behind some of the effects, brilliant that they are. I am unable to fathom how a spaceship is able to land on Elysium when it is supposed to have a (presumably contained) artificial atmosphere. Wouldn't any artificial atmosphere just leak away if it wasn't wholly contained? Moreover, the Med-Pods are too good to be true. One scene involving Kruger will have you shaking your head in disbelief and disappointment. Yes, its science fiction but Blomkamp's films have a veracity that you can believe in 50, 100 or 150 years from now. Third but not least is Copley's character. Kruger is underwritten and does not have enough screen time because when he is on, he is very entertaining indeed. <br/><br/>Although he has only made two films, Neil Blomkamp has cornered the market in muscular, industrial science fiction such is the deftness of his vision. These are not the bright gleaming fantastical worlds of Star Wars, but a gritty, grimy and ravaged look at the near future. An adaption of Judge Dredd or Strontium Dog would be perfect vehicles for him. I suspect Elysium may please and disappoint film goers in equal measure after the ecstatic heights of District 9, but what it has confirmed is Peter Jackson's faith in him as a new filmmaker of extraordinary talent. He is not so much Jackson's protégé as he is the new James Cameron.<br/><br/>Blomkamp's next film, Chappie, about a robot with artificial intelligence who is kidnapped to commit various crimes, has been confirmed and I dearly hope after that, District 10 beckons with the much vaunted Halo trilogy following soon after. Alternatively, I would love to see him adapt Mass Effect to the big screen and even a Warhammer film cannot be too far away with their built in fan boy audiences and global multi-million dollar sales."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.5/5 stars<br/><br/>Is it as good as ""District 9″? No. But it's still a gripping sci-fi effort from director Neill Blomkamp. Anyways, ""District 9″ was a masterpiece that's probably hard to replicate, and it's simply unfair to judge a Director's subsequent works to his best films. Comparison are inevitable and understandable, but a film should ultimately be judged on its own merits, and with that note, ""Elysium is a thoroughly enjoyable futuristic vision, that's only gets derailed at certain remotely sporadic junctures, due to a degree of over indulgence in plot contrivances.<br/><br/>The film is still worth the price of an admission ticket, because of its scope, taut narration, and Jodie Foster's deviously sinister act (seriously, the lady can effortlessly just breeze through any role). Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley are as reliable as ever."
"lasttimeisaw","7","0","1","8 September 2013"," Elysium is yet to come for Blomkamp
","Watched this Blomkamp's sophomore feature film in theater, to some extent I was underwhelmed by his universally-acclaimed debut DISTRICT 9 (2009, 7/10), it seems that his novelistic intention overrides his implementation, notably his screenplay (this time he is the sole writer for ELYSIUM), the premise is always rosy and aspiring, but in the Sci-Fi territory, if the writer cannot justify the surrealistic world he creates with a certain holistic perspective to cover obtrusive plot-holes which are unavoidable byproducts out of the limitation of one's imagination, very likely bathos will be the consequence.<br/><br/>In ELYSIUM, setting in 2154, Blomkamp inherits his visual motifs from DISTRICT 9 (the skeletal robot resembles an agiler Prawn) and enlarges the cosmic extravaganza by erecting a pristine man-made extraterrestrial homeland for upscale class meanwhile the seething dystopian of a scuzzy and overpopulated earth is an upgraded version of the refugee camp for The Prawns in Johannesburg. Howsoever the film's box office prospect (a tepid response from the critics and its North American income is also disheartening, $82,877,000 so far), it is a bold decision for the production company to invest and purvey a wunderkind's second film with a costly budget (reported $115,000,000) for an original Sci-Fi actioner.<br/><br/>Accumulating an almost 4-times funds than DISTRICT 9, Blomkamp could summon Hollywood top-tier names to guarantee more tickets-buyers which backfires, however his South African kindred spirit Sharlto Copley continues undertaking a chief role as the brutal outcast ex-agent, whose ambition pans out to be even more vicious than the ostensible villain, the combo of Damon and Foster is a whimsical but diverting one, but due to the ill-fated procession of the story, they don't even share any scenes together, Damon is always a good Samaritan without memorable charisma to single himself out and Foster caricatures herself to a routine militarist with bizarre accent. <br/><br/>All the earthbound stratum is comprised of Latinos (save Damon here), Moura, Braga and Luna is certified foil around Damon's amenable hero, contrasts sheer with the high-and-mighty White race in Elysium, robot-like but dons haute couture, speaks French and enjoys a disease-free technology. The omnipotent machine stands out as the sole excuse for earthlings to go to Elysium (actually only for those who are sick or disabled), since the lucky immigrants who stow away from earth to there (19 minutes by aircrafts, a rather facile maneuver) will all be effortlessly captured and repatriated back to the globe, so why they make a fuss over risking their lives in an ill-fated journey? Also the entire re-programming and rebooting scheme is a heedless product of a wholesome mind and cursorily conducted for the sake of being assimilated as any of its same kind. Unfortunately there are many equivocal set pieces like this pervading the entire film which restrains its potential to be a bona fide awe-inspiring eye-opener.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, imagination is contingent on the real world where germinates all the possible routes to extend and maximize our capacity of creation, the world in ELYSIUM could be our worst nightmare comes true because it touches on the basis of our undying prejudices on individuality and the callousness and irrationality looming over the inexorable gap between the wealthy and poor, as I mentioned in my review of DISTRICT 9, Blomkamp will always be on my radar as the new blood in the massive assembly line, time is all he needs to hone up his expertise and mostly essentially is to be on the lookout for a distinctive screenplay, he will fabricate his own CHILDREN OF MEN (2006, 9/10) one day."
"Incendid","5","0","2","7 September 2013"," Gore, The Space station and all the accents you can get!
","Ciaran: Elysium, spaceships, gore and realistic settings. The movie started out like many other films based around space, although how they explained the back story i feel could have been done not in text but with ambient vocals. Elysium also stood out with good casting, realistic violence and stunning visual effects, although it had its flaws like the excessive violence and the pace of the movie and most of all pointless plot holes and unnecessary characters, the movie could have been mastered by keeping the slow pace and dramatic sideline stories and this would have kept the doors open for the creators to film a sequel, but this wasn't done. Instead we have mixed movie with escalates from slow to awfully quick within minutes. Overall the movie had gore galore and a rushed storyline. My Rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Jacob's Review: To compare this movie to District 9 is like comparing Indiana Jones to Star Wars. One may be better than the other but they are completely different movies. While District 9 was an intelligent movie with perfectly executed social commentary, Elysium is a fun action movie with a social message but not as intelligently portrayed in District 9 but not too forced either. I loved the realistic portrayal of the corrupt futuristic world; not everything is pretty and flashy. The visual effects are incredible, the music is great and it is just an awesome flick. There are only a few minor problems though. While the characters are not incredibly deep or fleshed out, they are well realised and have good motivations especially the grimy villain. The problem is Jodie Foster's character and overall performance. It is just strange, odd and her character is two-dimensional. There are other nit-picky points like why did we build a giant space station that must have taken decades to produce when we could use some of resources to help humanity. These are not important as the film is a blast (to a guy's face) from start to finish. 7.5/10"

Some elements weren't quite right, such as the first ship in the introduction seen making it to Elysium, or how all the citizens around Max (Matt Damon) were what looked to be Mexican or some South American race. Jodie Foster is not threatening at all, but Sharlto Copley, the bounty hunter she hires, can get pretty intimidating at times, pulling out swords, tracking explosives, and even remote-detonating ninja stars. Don't forget about his 2 sidekicks, Beavis and Butthead. They talk through most scenes, but still play an important role in the story.

If you fan of District 9 then you should enjoy this although not quite on same par. Many similarities in the filming such as colour and the way Earth looks like sprawling south African townships. Film slightly disappoints with quite a few plot holes and the typical annoying use of computer code that is easily cracked in minutes. A lot of other plot bits, no spoilers, more just to keep story moving. Baddie is excellent, Matt Damon good but bit dull and Jodie Foster does the annoying acting she always does where her mouth hardly moves! Bit more character development for the Elysium characters would have helped. Also the way it is filmed with wobbly camera especially in action scenes which is typical of modern action movies is more off putting than good.

"jafar-iqbal","7","0","1","3 September 2013"," That difficult, but successful, second album
","I'm gonna go off on a tangent for a bit, but trust me, I'm going somewhere with it. One of the most interesting things about music, to me, is the concept of the 'difficult first album'. When an artist or band releases a spectacular first album, all attention turns to what they'll do next. What happens next determines the longevity and the overall appeal of said musicians. Either they're exposed as one-hit wonders, or they prove that they can keep on being the great artists that they are.<br/><br/>Elysium is Neil Blomkamp's difficult second album. For those of you living under a rock for the last few years, he was the creator of District 9, one of the best sci-fi/socio-political movies to hit the screen in a helluva long time. Bold, controversial, and highly entertaining, it breathed new life into science fiction.<br/><br/>Fast-forward four years, and we have this new creation. Once again, it's a science fiction movie set in the future. Once again, it is a satire on the state of the modern world and (more importantly) the state of African politics. Once again, it's about one man's fight against something he should not be able to fight.<br/><br/>Once again, Neil Blomkamp is on to a winner.<br/><br/>The story quickly: Max (Matt Damon) lives on an Earth full of poverty and disease, while the privileged few live on another planet called Elysium, which is more or less Utopia. When he gets infected with a fatal virus, Max has no choice but to go on a mission to Elysium. The chances of success are near-impossible, but success could lead to total equality for the entire universe.<br/><br/>Now, it has to be said, I don't think this is as good as District 9. There was something raw and unpolished about that movie which enhanced it. What makes Elysium so good, though, is the storyline. Just like its predecessor, it does a very smart job of mirroring the corruption and class divide we see in the world today, wrapping those concepts around a very taut and enjoyable thriller. Expectedly, Blomkamp once looks to the continent of Africa (his home) for inspiration, this time touching on the issues of poverty, disease and class alienation (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Having a bigger budget also really helped Blomkamp this time round – he made good use of special effects in District 9, but he goes ten steps further in this film. Robots with crazy weapons, space shuttles, brilliant action scenes involving a lot of guns and quite a bit of fire – it is all very similar to the future of District 9, but amped up. Almost as if the world of those two films are the same.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, what hurts Elysium is probably what should have bettered it; that being the cast. Now, don't get me wrong, the cast is probably the main appeal of the film. Matt Damon in the lead role, Jodie Foster lurking around, it's not bad at all. But Damon never quite fits in the role, and I felt somebody else could have done a better job. Similarly, Jodie Foster's portrayal of the shady Elysium controller felt forced and unnatural. Funnily enough, the best performance comes from Sharlto Copley, who was the lead in District 9. He steals every scene he is in, which made me want him to be the leading man.<br/><br/>As far as difficult second albums go, Elysium comes out as a success. It's probably not ideal to keep comparing it to District 9, but there are so many similarities between the two, it's hard not to. Elysium is a very strong, solidly-directed movie that reinforces Neil Blomkamp as one of the must-see directors going around. Worth going out of your way to see."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In the year 2054, massive over population and massive poverty have left earth a baron, desolate wasteland. The rich and powerful have hop footed it up to a magical new place called Elysium, a paradise where people can live in peace and luxury, at the expense of the hard labour of those down below, such as Max (Matt Damon), a bulky manual worker who gets infected with something nasty after an accident at work. To get the cure he needs, he has no choice but to take on an assignment for renegade Julio (Deigo Luna), in the shape of apprehending smarmy Elysium corporate manager John Carlyle (William Fichtner) and stealing some information from his brain. Delacourt (Jodie Foster), the ice queen ruler of Elysium, can't have this and sends the ruthless Kruger (Sharlito Copley) to deal with him.<br/><br/>Very few directors start off as big names. It's unlikely a major studio, with no track record of their previous box office magic, will grant them a huge budget to start off with, however visionary their ideas may be or however driven they appear to attain perfection. So it's more likely, if they're going to end up making a big name for themselves, that they'll need to get a cult hit on their hands first, a small budget offering that maybe becomes something of a sleeper hit and develops a loyal fan base, even if it's only a small one. And so Neill Blomkamp a few years back, gave us his still memorable District 9, that had the distinction of having impressed none other than Peter Jackson. And if the Lord of the Rings guy loves it, who is anyone else to complain?<br/><br/>Despite having a much bigger budget and consequentially far more publicity, Elysium still hasn't lost the touch Blomkamp gave D9, this time with visually awesome, magnificent special effects that retain the dark, dystopian feel he managed with a much smaller budget. It's a film you need to catch at the cinema, preferably an IMAX, I guess, where you can get the full effect of the stunning spectacles on offer. Of course, aside from these, Elysium suffers in other ways. Naturally, as a post apocalyptic science fiction film, there's the opportunity for some social commentary on how things could turn out and the pros and cons of living in such a world, but the screenplay seems far less concerned with what over population could drive the world to, and instead just getting on with a fairly generic, predictable story that just serves as a catalyst for all the destruction and mayhem that ensues.<br/><br/>The film aims to blow you away with it's scope and vision, and you have a right to expect great things in that department. You can even expect a decent piece of trashy fun to munch some popcorn to. But you'll have to be in a far less demanding mood in terms of the writing, dialogue and anything else that would have given it more substance. ***"
"3xHCCH","6","0","1","3 September 2013"," The Gap Between Rich and Poor
","In the world of ""Elysium"" set a century hence, the ever-widening gap between rich and poor has reached its ultimate level. The rich are now floating above the earth in a utopia set-up in space. The poor remain to suffer on the squalid wasteland that remains on Earth.<br/><br/>Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is a laborer who was stricken with severe radiation illness in a work accident. His only chance to recover is via the healing facilities located up there in Elysium, exclusive for the use of Elysium citizens. Max seeks help from renegade hacker Spider (Wagner Moura) to smuggle him across. Max was provided with an android- like exoskeleton (which gave him superhuman strength) and a cerebral link (to steal vital Elysium information). <br/><br/>However, the powers-that-be represented by the fanatical Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster) makes sure the impossible immigration laws are strictly enforced and their floating space station remains pure. She has her sociopathic enforcer Kruger (a frequently unintelligible Sharlto Copley) on Earth to make sure no ""undesirables"" ever crosses over the line, and that includes Max. <br/><br/>The social message is very clear in this film, criticizing the great financial divide and its diabolical implications, especially with regards to health care. Director Neil Blomkamp previously tackled racial discrimination in his acclaimed previous film ""District 9"" which made it all the way to the Oscar Best Picture shortlist a few years back.<br/><br/>Despite the presence of bigger stars, ""Elysium"" is not exactly better than ""District 9"". While intentions of the story are obviously noble, the execution of this story was rather roughshod, as rough as the dizzying shaky camera technique employed (unnecessarily, I thought) in most of this film. <br/><br/>The best part of the film was Matt Damon, who managed to remain believable as the flawed hero Max, even if the circumstances of his story became unbelievable. On the other hand, the usually cerebral Ms. Jodie Foster actually comes up with an over-the-top one-dimensional performance here, which did not fit her well. <br/><br/>Being a science fiction film, we expect to be regaled with special effects, but here, we were shown nothing we have not seen before. Of all the futuristic equipment shown, it was the powerful healing machine Med-Bay which was the most impressive. It was able to perform a total face reconstruction in minutes complete with nicely trimmed beard! <br/><br/>One really head-scratching moment was the ""surgery"" of the sick Max in the hands of rebels to receive sophisticated technical gadgets attached not only to his body (through his t-shirt, mind you) but also his brain. You really need to suspend your disbelief big time how that could have been done, given the crude conditions Max and his ""neurosurgeons"" were in. <br/><br/>Overall, I would just rate this film a little above average. The ending scenario though was very good despite the rocky road the film took to get there. The initial premise was very promising, more could have been done with it. For instance, we don't see enough of what life on Elysium was really about. It was not a bad film, but just a bit disappointing given its potential."
"TheSquiss","7","0","2","2 September 2013"," District 9 on steroids. Max action, minimal social comment, good entertainment.
","In 2054 the super rich have abandoned Earth for a space station of opulence, Elysium. Earth is now the domain of the poor, unhealthy dregs of humankind who serve the industrial needs of the Elysium privileged but are never likely to receive invitations to champagne-fuelled soirées. Like an extreme version of the American dream, those on Earth stare up at the sky and dream of a citizenship chip in their arm that will give them entry to a society where life is perfect and illnesses are cured by a few seconds in a 'med pod'.<br/><br/>Max (Matt Damon) is a factory worker who is exposed to a lethal dose of radiation. The computer calmly informs him he has just days to live so Max agrees to embark on a mission for black marketer Spider (Wagner Moura) accompanied by his friend, Julio (Diego Luna) with a pass to Elysium his payment. Up on the space station, however, Secretary of Homeland Security Delacourt Rhodes (Jodie Foster) has no intention of allowing the mission to succeed and brings in her violent secret police forces, led by Agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley).<br/><br/>The immediate comparison to be made with Elysium is with writer/director Neill Blomkamp's feature debut, District 9. Elysium has the same initial 'look' to it with a rotting, corrupt and uninviting futuristic Earth and massive social issues that reflect the troubles of our world today. Blomkamp's work looks largely at inequality and injustice though a sci-fi avenue. His next offering, 2015's Chappie (based on his short film Tetra Vaal and again staring Copley) looks likely to follow the trend, at least in the sci-fi crime aspect. But Elysium is to District 9 what Aliens is Alien. He has moved from thought-provoking human study set against a particular backdrop, to full on action thriller that is more about weaponry and spectacle than surprise.<br/><br/>But that's no criticism in itself. I loved Aliens. It's just a different type of film than Ridley Scott's original. Elysium is a good film. It's a fun and engaging film. It's just important to know from the outset there are no surprises, it's formulaic and pure entertainment using social comment as an excuse rather than it's raison d'être.<br/><br/>Damon further flexes his muscles as the intelligent action hero, ably assisted by good-looking sidekick, to selflessly take on the two-dimensional evil, arrogant villain. In her role, Foster is a joy to watch. It's rare we are permitted to watch her chomp scenery and get down and dirty with people's lives. Her Rhodes is deliciously conniving. She is the power-hungry bitch you can't help enjoying while looking forward to her destructive end.<br/><br/>Likewise, Copley is on overdrive here, dosing up his District 9 persona with a bucket load of steroids and going on the rampage. This isn't another performance of desperation and panic; in Elysium, his Agent Kruger is a gun-totting, black-hatted Wild West sheriff hurled forward in time a couple of hundred years and given access to weaponry bad sheriffs couldn't even dream of.<br/><br/>Luna feels underused as Julio and perhaps the predictable thread of Max's childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), and her sick daughter could have been jettisoned in favour of a deeper relationship and screen time for these two characters.<br/><br/>Enjoying District 9 is a fine starting point when approaching Elysium, but leave your expectations at the door. You'll see the conclusion almost from the moment the opening credits fade but it's still an enjoyable romp.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","I enjoyed this movie on a few levels. As an avid sci-fi buff I like a good story and this is a good story. But I also enjoy the philosophical idea this movie presents because it is not so far fetched. The movie itself is a struggle between classes which somewhat parallels today's society in the US where the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. There is no longer a middle class... If you have money you live the good life, get medical treatment and live peacefully on The Elysium Space platform. If you're not rich you fend for yourself on a wasted Earth.<br/><br/>Elysium is a movie, but also a political commentary on absolute power. We all know what absolute power does, but I won't get into that.<br/><br/>Matt Damon is solid as well as Jodie Foster. The special effects are good, not great. The character development is sparse, but given the time frame of a movie that's expected. The movie will make you think long after you leave the theater."

","I like to compare this movie with Oblivion. Oblivion has a lot of beautiful scenery, Elysium is very different. It's gritty, it's rough, it's brilliant. After Matt Damon is exposed to radiation, he has only five days to live. He needs to get to Elysium where every illness is curable. To get a ride up there he steals information and stores it in his mechanical suit. He is then hunted by assassins for the information. Matt Damon is a brilliant lead. I wasn't sure what accent Jodie Foster was. There is some gory imagery which made me cringe a little. This is truly more gritty than Oblivion but just as impressive. There are some truly brilliant fight scenes that I found really gripping and a bit shocking."

","Elysium review (7 out of 10)<br/><br/>I approached this movie with a lot of excitement but after seeing some of the initial reactions scaled back my own expectations. I have to say I was not disappointed or blown away; though if you are into action or sci-fi movies then you will find the movie enjoyable. It doesn't really have any plot holes and doesn't have many particular set-pieces that seem implausible or illogical.<br/><br/>Cinematography<br/><br/>Starting with the best reason to watch this movie; the camera angles, the slow motion effects and video-game like camera movements, the attention to detail of the weapons and setting. The universe felt real and was absorbing; with no spectacularly naff Bay-esque explosions. The choice of setting for the future of Los Angeles felt unnervingly realistic and hopefully this movie doesn't turn out to be prophetic for the future of the human race.<br/><br/>Casting and Acting<br/><br/>Compared with its stablemate, District 9, this movie had a much bigger budget and thus attracted far more famous faces which were well-cast and well-acted even if the script left the characters feeling a bit one dimensional at times.<br/><br/>I was particularly impressed by Sharlto Copley's turn as a despotic war criminal/cyborg and Matt Damon portrayed the protagonist of the story with his usual blend of intelligent, measured aggression which fitted the character perfectly. Jodie Foster's fascistic security leader was good; though some may find her accent a bit forced and jarring. The supporting cast stood out as realistic, though I found Wagner Moura's caricature of an idealistic criminal ""Che Guevara"" was the exception to this rule because of its naive simplicity.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Fairly straight forward action plot with a fairly predictable outcome with no particular questions left unanswered at the end (unless you are a bit of a nerd and want to debate the Malthusian implications of the outcome...).<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed the final tussle for power between an idealistic ""socialistic"" hero, a murderous despot, an obvious fascist (cough *neo- conservative*) and an ineffectual democratic president.<br/><br/>Conclusion Though not genre-defining, it a good movie that is worth a watch: especially if you are a fan of the action/sci-fi genre."
"slicedbread117","8","0","1","31 August 2013"," A solid sci-fi action movie that doesn't tap into its full potential.
","Niell Blomkamp gave us the extraordinary District 9 back in 2009, and proved to us that his space in the sci-fi genre was legit. For me, Elysium was highly anticipated with how much I loved D9 and while many will be quick to compare the two, they are different films and I will treat them as such. So, while Elysium was an overall solid entertaining film, you can't help but think of the vast potential this movie had to when the end credits role.<br/><br/>2154. That's the year the movie is set in. Technology has come a long way, and has allowed for the construction of a massive space station, where the rich and privileged reside. The rest of humanity is left to live on a now-deprived Earth. You can really tell how much the residents of Elysium separate themselves from those of Earth, especially in a scene where CEO of Armadyne (the company behind all of Elysium's tech) tells an Earth citizen to not breath his way. Eventually, bad things happen and Max Da Costa (Matt Damon) is forced with finding a way to get to Elysium to survive. The plot is solid, and is largely pushed forward by co-star Jodie Foster, who portrays Secretary Delacourt, a woman in search of power and protection of Elysium. There are some easily predictable moments, however, so the plot doesn't always have you on the edge of your seat. Though the focus of the movie is on Damon's character (for the most part) I felt as though the plot could've been more, larger I suppose. In a futuristic setting, there's usually always room to make an expansive story, and I felt like this film could have been bigger. <br/><br/>The movie takes a while to get rolling, but when it finally does, the action is tight and exciting, and the futuristic setting allows for some cool weapons and gadgets to be used, including the exo-skeletal suit Max receives. The action is the best part of the film, and is complimented by a final 20 minutes of high-energy, exciting and emotional action. Another small negative I had, was that Max's suit is also never exploited to it's full potential, never showing its true strength and ultimately leaving Matt Damon's character at times seem a little too weak and never totally awesome. The story was good, and the action was great, two things you very much need in a strong sci-fi action movie.<br/><br/>Along with the plot, the cast is all-around solid although some characters don't get enough time to develop into better characters. Matt Damon is terrific like usual and his character, Max, is well developed. But the supporting cast doesn't share the same fate. Delacourt (Foster), aforementioned CEO John Carlyle (William Fichtner), and Max's close friend Julio (Diego Luna) never get enough room to expand as more meaningful characters. Max's love interest, Frey, played by Alice Braga, is a better developed character than the previously mentioned ones, and the movie benefits from it, adding a heart-felt emotional side of the movie with her and her daughter's story. Also, aside from a few parts, humor is practically non-existent, but that doesn't affect the film in any large way. <br/><br/>The film's visuals are beautiful, displaying a futuristic Los Angeles that is now in ruins, and of course, Elysium in a larger-than-life creation that is stunning to look at, more outside than in. The weapons and ships look pretty cool for 2154, and the robotic androids that keep the order also look sharp and science fiction-y. The audio design is great, giving cool sounds to the guns and gadgets and the score provides an emotional top-heavy soundtrack but this is good for the most part.<br/><br/>Was Elysium everything I expected it to be? No. But was it a solid and entertaining film anyways? Absolutely. Elysium might suffer from untapped potential in almost all areas of the movie, story and characters especially, and a couple of predictable moments, but overall, Elysium is a wonderful creation that opens a setting for great sci-fi action, beautiful visuals, and another wonderful performance from Matt Damon. Niel Blomkamp might not have brought all of that District 9 magic with him to Elysium, but he still proves that his role as a major player in this genre is still alive and kicking.<br/><br/>7.5/10 (IMDb score rounds to 8)"

Dismissing all clichés, ""District 9"" set out to be different, not to become your average popcorn muncher, thanks to it's director Neill Blomkamp.<br/><br/>This is where ""Elysium"" fails. ""Elysium"" really is just another Hollywood blockbuster, which never dares to be as raw and emotional wrenching, compared to ""District 9"". It's a disappointment on many levels, but worth praising when it comes to other areas in the film.<br/><br/>""Elysium"" has an original and intriguing concept to begin with, but then travels into the realm of a typical action film. For at least the first half an hour, the film plays around with the culture of it's setting; shows you how the world has developed and then it thrusts you into bombarding set pieces, which mainly take place on Elysium. Saying that, the action and CGI is a joy to watch; pushing the boundaries of the film when it comes to certain scenes, including a man being healed after a severe wound, due to an exploded grenade. On a whole, the film really does look amazing, with some exceptional shots of the Elysium habitat.<br/><br/>The characters are well played by a sublime cast list, ranging from Jodie Foster to Matt Damon; who both act considerably well. Saying that, it is Sharlto Copley who really steals the show, as Agent Kruger, a vicious sleeper agent who is intriguing and fun to watch. <br/><br/>What I really wanted to see from Blomkamp, was a sequel to ""District 9"", but instead I got a satisfying piece of cinema, which delivers better than some of this years earlier Sci-Fi offerings. <br/><br/>5 stars out of 10 = Good."
"lianaki-imdb","5","0","1","30 August 2013"," Close to being a great movie, but it lacks creative plot
","Once again, like with ""District 9"", Neill Blomkamp's work amazed but also disappointed me. When I saw District 9, although I loved it, I felt that the concept of the movie had much more potential than what it delivered. That was even more intense in Elysium. In both movies, the main idea was so original, but it feels like in Elysium, Blomkamp rested on that and didn't provide us with an equivalent plot. The plot looked superficial and not at all detailed.<br/><br/>The story was very simplistic and stayed pretty much on the surface instead of getting deeper into the socio-political issues that were brought up. The audience didn't have the chance to get to know the different societies and the links between them, or the structure of the system. Nor did we get a wider glimpse of Earth, besides the slum city Max (Matt Damon)was living in. Also, towards the ending, the whole movie gets a little bit flat. <br/><br/>The direction of the movie is absolutely brilliant. Nicely done scenes, and full of the director's personal style. First with District 9 and now with Elysium, Neill Blomkamp reveals himself as a great new director. He comes up with great ideas, he doesn't give us the usual Hollywood sci-fi movie but something more. He's very original, very avant-garde, I am actually pretty excited to see his next piece of work. <br/><br/>Elysium exceeds the expectations based on its trailer, but if you are a District 9 fan, I must say, you will probably find Elysium inferior. But still, it is a good film. For me, it starts very strong and then loses it, but i overall enjoyed it."
"a.lampert","6","0","1","30 August 2013"," Expectation not quite fulfilled but still entertaining
","I had rather expected more from Neil Blomkamp's follow up to the brilliant District 9. Elysium basically highlights the difference between two lifestyles, the 'haves' on the Elysium platform and the 'have nots' on a future over crowded Earth.Whilst Elysium has some stunning visuals I thought the dialogue was at times weak. Oh! and why do some actor's have to mumble so much, I had trouble catching a lot of what Matt Damon was saying at times, which doesn't help trying to follow a storyline which is quite complicated, as most Sci-Fi's are. I'm not sure Matt is the right choice for heroic roles. He always strikes me as too nice and cerebral and doesn't really have that killer instinct in his personality that say Jeremy Renner or Russell Crowe have on screen. On the other hand, Sharlto Copley gives us a classic villain that I think will be remembered for a long while. In the tradition of great screen villains he gives the outstanding performance in this movie and it's worth paying the admission price to see him. Jodie Foster is my favourite actress and I know she wanted to be in this movie because I read she admired District 9 so much, something I read, long before she was cast. Jodie, I ask, what was that accent? Elysiumese? or was it supposed to be English? I'm not quite sure but it didn't work for me. I do think her dialogue was a bit weak and she didn't have a lot to work with and perhaps she tried to imbue it with this odd accent, but it comes over as strained and at times she sounds like she chewing her words. Having said that, she's never boring, particularly when she's just sitting still as she often is. Even then, she never just sits there.She has a gift for using inflections in her face, hand movements and what she's saying that somehow makes the most mundane line more interesting to watch. There is a scene near the beginning where Jodie speaks softly in fluent French and in her normal voice and I longed to hear her use it but that was not to be. The Elysium platform is fabulous to look at, I read the designer who worked on Bladerunner designed it and it's superb, very impressive. The fight scenes I found a bit too frantic and confused and at times they seemed a bit clumsily executed although there are certainly plenty of them so if you just want lots of action, this film has that by the bucketful. I just felt it was at the expense of good characterisation and dialogue. A side story involving Alice Braga and her little girl who's ill was a bit wasted I thought as she apparently knew Matt Damon from childhood, but the chemistry was missing for me. All in all, watchable but not very involving."
"wolfrahms","5","0","2","29 August 2013"," I didn't buy the vision.
","I'm going with my guts on this one since they were turning the entire time when I watched the movie. The universe and the action unfolding within didn't feel right. Great actors like Matt Damon and particularly Jodie Foster did nothing to improve it, but the fault does not lie with them. The problem is the demand for realism in ""fantastic"" movies. I just didn't buy the vision of the future that the movie presented. The movie's vision of society and technology was clumsily stitched together with a shallow story, and the seems are so visible that it hurts. Let's go over a few examples.<br/><br/>Since the movie clearly wants to be ""science faction"", I expect consistency. Max is doing manual labor, and it is seen how he is treated with no regards to his humanity. However, if there are robot policemen in the universe who can have conversations with humans, there should be VERY few jobs left for humans to do, because a policeman's job is one of the most complex things imaginable to make a robot do. So unless the government is OK with an inefficient and expensive police force, we must assume that robots in this universe are as good as or better than humans at doing this job. It is blatantly obvious that the robots are only there to convey a message to the audience. The message is again that the government is treating Max like an object because they deal with him through robots. The moderately informed viewer will not buy this inconsistent vision. IT MAKES NO SENSE. Max should be a policeman, and robots should be pushing stuff around. Later, Max is being hunted by humans. The reason for this is that it must be personal. We cannot hate a robot in the same way that we hate humans, and the movie does an excellent job at setting Kruger up as a villain! It ruins the movie when I am painfully aware of these things. The monochrome screens and the stupid messages displayed on them was also a huge annoyance. They should drop those and just have the actor tell us what happened instead of insulting our intelligence.<br/><br/>There should be fixed levels of automation and technology in the universe, and the story must play out according to the rules with such consistency that most people will accept the vision and forget that the universe and the story are not really one. Otherwise it must stop trying to be realistic.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who has a moderate interest in science fiction and has something to compare it to. I don't usually write anything, but I make an exception on this one because I want others to know that this movie is seriously flawed.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, one last thing: The shuttle and the velvet rope... come on."

","'District 9' was a brilliant directorial debut and also a true sleeper hit. It didn't feature any stars (or recognisable faces), was directed by a first-timer and was set in South Africa (an unusual location for a sci-fi movie), featuring some of the ugliest aliens for some time. However, it was a box-office hit, managing to recuperate its budget over six times and garnered critical acclaim, eventually (and deservedly) scoping an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (another unusual thing for a sci-fi film). Thus, Neill Blomkamp's follow-up attracted great interest, especially since being another gritty work of science fiction and featuring Sharlto Copley, who was so great as Wikus in 'District 9'. Sadly, 'Elysium' is no 'District 9'.<br/><br/>The premise sounded very promising. In 2154, the Earth has become over- populated and over-polluted, with the poor residing there in slums while the wealthy have moved to an elaborate space station called Elysium in order to preserve their way of life. Max (Matt Damon) is an ex-con who is now a factory line worker; unfortunately, he becomes fatally exposed to radiation and is given five days left to live. As a result, he decides to do all in his power to get up to Elysium even if that means melding his body with a mechanical exoskeleton. As Max, the reliable Matt Damon is quite good, making the down-on-his-luck hero a likable lead. However, it is Sharlto Copley who steals the show, portraying a character that is a world away from Wikus, clearly revelling in the nastiness of Agent Kruger, who despite being a one-dimensional villain, is a magnetic presence whenever on screen. Jodie Foster, on the other hand, delivers a wooden performance with a bizarre and stilted accent.<br/><br/>Like 'District 9', this movie is home to some brilliant design work, the decaying Earth is beautifully ugly and the CGI robots slot seamlessly into the world. Some of the action sequences are good, especially the first one after Max puts on the exoskeleton, but the flat third act becomes focused on generic action and good-guy-punch-bad-guy. This action-heavy finale wouldn't feel sterile if it wasn't for the touches of greatness present within the first act, where everything is expertly set-up. However, 'Elysium' only has touches of greatness and that doesn't equal a great movie especially with a heavy-handed and clunky political message. That isn't to say that it is a bad film – it's not – it's alright, but nothing more."

At the end, the ""Spider"" and his ship are just shown easily landing in Elysium. As the start of the movie they show the air defenses. Suddenly this ships lands no problem. With all the state of the art weapons and DNA signatures, etc. you mean to tell me they had no automated radar and defense systems? 3. Elysium in general seemed way underprotected. Again, given what was happening on Earth, it was ridiculously underprotected. 4. John Carlyle has one small shuttle with two robot troops in an easily accessible takeoff zone - really? He had to know he was a major target. The scene where he is so easily attacked is hard to believe. 5. Some Hispanic thieves are experts in surgery AND spaceflight? Come on! 5. Less of a big deal -- but if it was so easy to send automated ships with healing beds down to earth in minutes, why did Elysium not just do this?

On display is a realistic overpopulated future Earth in contrast to the spatial Elysium both of which are wonderfully realised.<br/><br/>Matt Damon proved his worth as an action star with intelligence and stealth in The Bourne Identity (2002) but he appears slightly miscast here - that said he does a good enough job and brings some needed emotion and likability to his characters unsavoury past. Jodie Foster is simply outstanding as Delacourt, a steely no-nonsense executive although her screen time is limited. Villain Kruger played by District 9's Sharlto Copley - and like Foster - freshly plays against the stereo-type Hollywood antagonists. There's also a strong supporting cast including the likes of William Fichtner and Alice Braga with each of the supporting characters right down to Kruger's sidekicks being developed and given attention by writer, director Blomkamp.<br/><br/>As with Blomkamp's previous outing there plenty of subtext in the screenplay and amongst the great action setups and visual spectacles there's also a straight forward story for all to enjoy. As with any film and especially in science fiction it's difficult to come up with entirely original ideas and Elysium is no exception but everything is packaged arguably better and more authentic than in other recent sci-fi movies. <br/><br/>It's not Blomkamp's masterpiece but it's still a finely executed science fiction with shrewdness which certainly raises the bar in terms visual effects. In addition, it has more to say than most films of the genre."
"bstormy","6","0","3","25 August 2013"," After a stunning debut, this is a disappointment
","Shades of ""Donnie Darko"" here as again, a successful young filmmaker, lauded and certain for further glory crashes to earth with a a whimper, not a bang.<br/><br/>I was going to say ""flies too close to the sun"" but in this case no such lofty goal was attempted. Director Neill Blomkamp's District Nine heralded a new blazing talent in genre cinema. Bursting with moral outrage, this thinly disguised invective against apartheid by a white South African was a showstopper. Its premise - aliens invade, was hardly new. Its subtext, how we treat the invaders, how we treat each other and how inaccurately we peg our species on the moral scale was superb, fresh and intelligently handled.<br/><br/>Alas. In Elysium Blomkamp hits on another a surefire hotbutton topic. His scenery is designed by amongst others: Bladerunner's Syd Mead (Oh yes, and it shows). His cinema verite style is present and his fascinating ingénue Sharlto Copley is also present (playing against District 9's type this time - but surely a Dinero in the making).<br/><br/>So what went wrong? The main problem with this film is that it is a Michael Bay film. That's shorthand for: there is no subtext. Reviewers often call Bay's films ""boneheaded"" and most are. But some (very few) are good! What's essential to understand about a Michael Bay film is that the lack of a subtext or a ""deeper meaning"" is emphatically intentional.<br/><br/>This was Blomkamp's summer actioner. From what I see on the screen he never intended to spark a single ""Obamacare"" thread. The subject is too thinly treated - everything the public has focused their ire and admiration upon is essentially an afterthought.<br/><br/>Here's another, more fatal problem with the film, Elysium.<br/><br/>It Looks Cheap.<br/><br/>Yes it shows the five or show glorious panning shots of Mead's Torus Spacestation that you see in the trailer - but THAT'S IT. The rest is mundane helicopter footage of favelas - familiar to audiences from Fast and Furious (film or FBI stumble - be my guest) and a very few sequences about on a par but not surpassing Blomkamp's incredible ""alive inside"" advert for some motor company, way back when.<br/><br/>There's little else to say. People will nitpick the ludicrous (to anyone with even a modicum of experience with computers) plot - and that's only worth mentioning because it betrays a general lack of care to the finished product.<br/><br/>The dagger in my heart is this: recently Blomkamp extolled the virtues of that live action 'Masterpiece' Transformers the movie. Let me tell you: Transformers The Movie is a better movie than Elysium the movie.<br/><br/>I just hope Blomkamp realises just what a great film his first effort was and we don't end up with another lazy hack like Kevin Smith or a deluded pseudo auteur like Tarantino.<br/><br/>Some people need to heed Samuel Goldwyn's maxim: ""the harder I work, the luckier I get!""<br/><br/>{Also worth mentioning: rare misfire from Matt Damon. He or his people always pick the best material. I'm surprised.}"
"siderite","7","0","2","24 August 2013"," Neil Blomkamp fails to rehash District 9
","The film was entertaining, but not great. Blomkamp, made famous by the sci-fi metaphor for Apartheid in South Africa, tries his hand again, with more money, good actors and Mexicans instead of Africans. But his metaphor now is strained, the script unchiselled and the acting empty. Neither Matt Damon's presence or Alice Braga's smile could save the lack of involvement that plagued the script.<br/><br/>That's not to mean it is not watchable. Many a bad movie were released as summer blockbuster and made me angry at paying for them. Elysium was not like that, but only barely. If you make the effort to design an overpopulated and unmanaged Earth controlled by unsympathetic robots and rich overlords that live on a giant space station and have God-like technology, then continue this effort in adding depth to characters and their stories, making sure there are not blatant (even offensive) gaps in the logic of the world created.<br/><br/>Matt Damon's natural talent at acting saved this film from being a failure. You could probably just stop him on the street, give him the script and ask him to act a little and he would do it fine. The special effects were fine, maybe better than fine. But the rest just felt tired: Jodie Foster in her most two dimensional character ever, Michael Shanks appearing in a few scenes in the background (I am not sure he said anything) a story that made as much sense as Hunger Games and a deep misunderstanding of socio-economics, not to say politics, that made it all look like a cheap game.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Blomkamp's metaphor for the gap between Mexicans and US citizens failed to impress in any way because it was deeply flawed. The only way one could empathise with it is to actually see the future where robots are everywhere and poor people are not required for menial tasks anymore, but that would be a lot more complex than what this film can offer. If you want something good like that, just watch Sleep Dealer."
"Smiffy0","9","0","2","24 August 2013"," This isn't a movie about inequality you morons....
","Blomkamp: ""painting this realistic image of a future Earthwhich meant the borders being erased entirely and having this fluid population group that basically moves from Chile all the way up to Canada. It just flows, because it can.The numbers of people that are Latin are going to overwhelm the numbers of people that aren't."" Blomkamp on District 9: ""the collapse of Zimbabwe and the flood of illegal immigrants into South Africa, and then how you have impoverished black South Africans in conflict with the immigrants."" A little history. Blomkamps mother dragged the family off from Johannesburg to Vancouver after a 17-year-old friend was shot dead by black carjackers. This isn't a movie about inequality or the 1%. This is a movie about a future in which immigration and over breeding by 3rd worlders ruins the United States. The entirety of LA is Mexican in the film aside from Max. Look at current trends in birth rates and immigration. Both Europe and the US will soon be majority non white. This is what Blomkamp is talking about."

","This movie is just O.K. if you ask me, we saw it in the theater and there were a lot of cool visual effects and chase and fight scenes but it is just your average movie. It is not nearly as good as District 9 was. Matt Damon I am a big fan of you but in this movie you are just basically running around and being yourself. Not bad or anything but not really worth seeing on the big screen for like 15 bucks. Bourne Identity series of movies was way more entertaining than this. Could have been a great movie but just didn't deliver. If you like mindless action entertainment it delivers but worth waiting for on DVD or for free on TV even."
"Robert_duder","8","0","3","22 August 2013"," Very nearly superb...Neill Blomkamp nails it again
","Elysium had a lot to live up to in my books and in a lot of other people's books. District 9 came out of nowhere and very nearly floored everyone in the sci-fi genre. It was brilliant. So there was a lot riding on Blomkamp's second outing. Elysium was amazing. It was solidly entertaining, moving, gritty and well put together. It was very nearly as superb as District 9. Unfortunately there were a few performances that lacked a certain depth (and its surprising who was the worst perpetrator), and there were some pretty significant plot holes that I would have thought Blomkamp would be too thorough to let go. Still the film has an extensive plot that covers a lot of ground with that amazing political undertone that Blomkamp does so well. Elysium is a sweeping sci-fi epic with absolutely stunning special effects and breathtaking scenery and setting from the visceral horrible conditions of Earth to the beautiful setting of Elysium. You spend far more time in the shoes of someone on earth fighting to survive having grown up dreaming of a better place. I couldn't help but think how nearly perfect this was...District 9 was a solid huge ten for me and this was so close to a nine but I just couldn't quite give it that.<br/><br/>Matt Damon was superb. He is always a great hero but his flawed and tortured character was just riveting to watch. He just shined when he was on screen and did a first rate job. He fit the style of the film so well and lead the cast flawlessly. Jodie Foster (whom normally I don't mind...she's far from my favourite but she is usually pretty good) is the perpetrator I mentioned above. Her wooden performance is unforgivable in this movie. She sports an awful fake accent...not even sure whether its English or just upper class but its awful and makes her sound fake and campy and unlike Damon, she does not fit the tone of this movie at all. She could have been an amazing villain with class and style and a subtle evil but she blew it hands down actually probably took this from a nine to an eight single handedly. Fortunately we had a secondary villain played by Sharlto Copley. Copley's villain is violent, over the top, psychotic and fun. He is definitely the physical force against Damon and his character was great. Alice Braga was decent as Frey, Damon's life long friend and love interest. She showed appropriate emotion and intensity and yet didn't quite blow me away but she was good. Diego Luna was excellent in a smaller role as Damon's best friend. I wish we had seen more from him because he really did a great job and had a good role. Same for Wagner Moura who was really terrific as Spider. At first I was worried he was cheesy and campy and like Foster but all doubts went out the window because he turned out to be a really solid role and well acted on his part. And I have to mention William Fichtner because (although he often plays very similar roles) I thought he was fantastic in a small cameo role as the factory head with little emotion or sympathy for the people on earth.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Neill Blomkamp got a much bigger budget for this film. Perhaps that was overwhelming to him so some details slip through the cracks in this one. Don't get me wrong...this was still an excellent, powerful movie and Blomkamp now has TWO fantastic sci-fi pictures under his belt. The film is full of emotional scenes and powerful action sequences. There is no down time and the pacing of the film is non-stop. I can't tell you how much I respect Blomkamp for working such powerful political messages into mainstream Sci-Fi epics. This one reeks of a message about immigration reform and struggling to find happiness in another place that seems to have it all. I'm not sure the message about everyone being made citizens changes the world for the better makes sense but its still a really terrific film. You may have to ignore some plot hiccups and Jodie Foster's performance but you will find yourself blown away by this sci-fi flick. I can't wait to see what Blomkamp has in store for us next. 8.5/10"
"ericnottelling","7","0","2","17 August 2013"," MD saved this movie from being really bad
","While watching this movie I felt torn between two positions. I really like MD as an actor, and I didn't like district 9. I think those 2 things come to head in this movie and left it as a draw.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of syfy but Neill Blomkamp has had no real appeal to me in his movies. It is one thing to get over the overly human syfyness of the movie, it's futuristic I get that. However, having less character development than transformers is hard to over look in this future world. There was plenty of action in this movie which I'm sure some will say takes away from working on characters. However there was plenty of action in bourne identity too and we still had character development. The lack of feeling any real connection between these characters drags it down. <br/><br/>MD did a very good job with his character. He does his usual cool action scenes, tries a little tough guy comedy, and plays the roll probably as best as anyone could have played it. I think the movie would have really sunk without him. His ability to put any personality on screen has been amazing and his presence gives this movie it's only resemblance of character which is missing through any dialog or action development.<br/><br/>The one thought I was left with walking out of this movie is I wish they had a better bad guy. All syfy movies need a great villain and in this movie they relied more on these evil social morals than actually putting together a darth vader quality villain. Good guys need a great bad guy to fight. Luke had vader, batman had the joker, superman lex, autobots decepticon. You can't name me one great good vs bad movie that didn't have a great villain. Even the ghostbusters had the staypuff! MD didn't have a quality villain. They were bone heads in bland rolls. That combined with a lack of character connection makes this movie a 7/10 held up only by MD. If he wasn't it this movie it would have probably ended up a 5/10."

","From the awesome director of District 9. Set in a future world where the rich and privileged live on Elysium where there is no sickness and the live perfect lives however the planet earth is full of the ill and under privileged. It was great see Matt Damon back in a action oriented role.The movie did take awhile to get going, When it does start the decent to super sci fi action mode it is very entertaining. Some very interesting sequences which are the mark of this director.There are many similarities to District 9 in terms of landscape and design of future earth. A interesting story with some beautiful camera work but does falls short to its predecessor although it is not a sequel it does have similarities to District 9 so you can't help compare both movies."

","Elysium is set in the year 2154 and tells of a story of the extremely wealthy living on an advanced space station named Elysium where there is no poverty or disease and the poor live on earth struggling with disease and war. Matt Damon (Max) finds himself exposed to lethal dose of radiation which prompts him to go on a mission fighting death and his frail body to save himself and the only way to do so is to get to Elysium where all diseases can be cured. In his path he comes up against Kruger played by Sharlto Copely who is a menacing mercenary who will stop at nothing to hunt down Max. Without giving too much away the film is brilliantly shot with some deft camera work and great directing. It has a very gritty feel to the movie and shows some signs of Distric 9 although the movie is not as good it's still a very impressive movie. Again highlighting a social problem present in today's world Neill Blokamps vision of the future is put to screen in a very pleasant way with a story that flows and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters gel well together and story doesn't over complicate itself. Sharlto Copely comes up trumps with the guy who just won't go away! Overall a delightful movie with just enough to pass itself off as a Sci Fi."
"ameliajimgra","5","0","2","21 August 2013"," No plot, kinda entertaining, but not my film
","I give it a five because the special effects are great and all the robots and weapons are nicely designed. First of all, I don't understand which people are living on Elysium (how many of them, why they are wealthy, how they don't get bored with living in the same place doing nothing, who votes for the President). You can't see clearly why Elysium is SO GOOD. Secondly, I don't understand why people on Earth are SO poor, they are criminals or they seem so, nobody cares for birth control plans (too many people on Earth and only a few on Elysium?) and all people there dream of living on Elysium, but they don't know anything about it apart from the fact that people seem to have no diseases at all. I don't think that Matt Damon's character wants to be a hero ""to bring equality to the world"", as the summary says. If you watch the movie, you'll see his reasons, and, in fact, you don't clearly see them till the end of the film. The movie doesn't make you think about differences among people, the rich ones are bad and the poor ones are sick rats, apart from the fact that on Elysium they speak French and on the Earth Spanish. I prefer, for example, The Island, with Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. A lot more fun, a nice plot, a movie that made me think about having money to do whatever you want. Not this one. This wasn't my piece of cake."
"top_gun0101","6","0","2","21 August 2013"," Matt daemon shadows all his co-actors, making them seem like ambient noise.
","I will try to remain as objective as possible. I entered the film expecting an epic sci-fi thriller that would be re-watched for years to come. instead turned out to be hyped mediocre film, sic-fi with poor story,forgettable characters, and no surprises in plot. However the action sequence is pretty cool for the few seconds they lasted. some nice visual effects including an awesome over the top futuristic shield, and of course a mans entire face wiped off in real time. apart from these couple of moments nothing was memorable.<br/><br/>The main issue for me was that Matt daemon is a huge star and you have a hard time being immersed given that you know he is gonna escape any situation. Moreover he has SOOOO much screen time 90% is about him, if i didn't know any better i would say it's a documentary about him. In other words the story has poor character development, they never tell us anything about anyone else.... poor backgrounds makes me not care about the characters when something dramatic happens to them, because they are just like random people you don't know enough to feel for them. <br/><br/>If I may I would like to compare this movie to a movie from the same genre ""Sunshine"" was a sci fi, released in 2007 had amazing character development all the characters where on equal footing none to famous you never knew who the main character was, which made it so thrilling to watch as events unfold every minutes you learn something about the character. in conclusion if you want a decent sci fi for years to come watch sunshine."
"damian_hockey","7","0","2","21 August 2013"," Not bad but no district 9
","Elysium isn't a bad movie just a disappointing movie. Being the Neil blokamp fan that i am i felt a little disappointing at the fact that after months wait YEARS for a movie to top one of my most highly rated sci fi films of all time (District 9) It didn't come, But i still hold hope chappie will be better As I've said its not bad, its exactly what i expect in some respect from Neil blokamp a futuristic thriller with lots of turns and a deep driving political message underneath, But it lacked character interaction. Jodie foster could of been written out of the plot entirely without anyone noticing, she was there as a name to promote, The film looked beautiful from a CGI perspective but i felt some of the action lacked what i wanted it to, E.g the Exo suits weren't quite what i was expecting i was looking for something with some far better fast pacing I loved the soundtrack and the cinematography was really good in lots of places but it still lacked what i wanted from this film Thats why i only rated it 7 out of 10"

","Not long in the future the world becomes a giant ghetto. The 1% escape to a lovely space station that looks like Halo called Elysium. There the rich jerks speak French, live in opulence and enjoy perennial health thanks to a machine that scans their body and restores their health. Foster is in charge of Homeland security and she sure acts like a neocon, while the president and some council is more forgiving.<br/><br/>In hell/on earth some people are lucky to have a job assembling robocops that oppress the population. Everyone in the US lives in what looks like miserable favelas inhabited by Mexicans. They all dream of going to Elysium but for the purpose of healing themselves. And there is actually a mechanism to go there in some home made spaceships run by some guy who has his own personal cheapo NASA operation going on. One of the workers is Damon who as a child was adopted by a nun and made friends with another orphan girl. He likes to challenge authority and that gets him in trouble with his robot parole officer. One day at his abusive workplace he ends up radiated with carcinogens. He has five days to live. So he makes a deal with this future high tech coyote guy who wants him to steal information about Elysium. They implant him with some electro-exoskeleton that makes him stronger and connects data to his brain.<br/><br/>They decide to steal the data from a 1%er pig who owns the robot factory. Incidentally, Foster is organizing a coup with him to topple the president. Damon and his crew succeed in getting the date but it is protected. They also are attacked by some infiltrated agent on earth who works for Foster. And by now Damon just happens to run into his flame from his youth who is a nurse and has a girl with leukemia. That forces Damon to take them to Elysium where he'll confront his nemesis as well. And of course the goal of the coyote guy is to legalize all the humans in Elysium.<br/><br/>Neill Blomcamp sure knows how to direct movies, the actions scenes are so exciting, the movie looks great, it all seems so new and fresh. He also has great ideas and his sensitivity to social issues that he manages to package in movies with popular appeal is really something special. But like most movies these days, dialog is reduced to a minimum. Add to that a foreign cast that is very hard to understand, even more so if there are all sorts of noises while they are talking.<br/><br/>One could interpret this movie as glorifying illegal immigration and illegal aliens. Just as with District 9, the easy superficial interpretation is also the least fruitful. Elysium presents a very likely future highlighting what is already a remarkable and absurd wealth inequality. For now the 1% are happy to rule in their gated communities over the billions of struggling. As the demographic factor is very much against them, it's not inconceivable that as the ghettos expand there is less and less space for palaces. And we see the inequality spreading beyond just income and power. It's also evident in health care, the justice system, and other areas. Political figures and celebrities are without doubt considered more ""valuable"" in society and the health care they get is in a different league altogether compared to the butchery that passes on as health care for the rest. Pets get better health care than the 99%.<br/><br/>Elysium isn't perfect. The casting is annoying (Wagner Moura and Sharlto Copley are particularly dismal when they try to give long speeches in English), the story with the girl is a bit ridiculous, the obligatory climactic fight scene with the nemesis is entirely unnecessary. Still Blomkamp continues to prove himself as one of the best directors around. He just needs to work with an additional writer, pay more attention to dialog, and tighten his stories a bit more. Looking forward to his next project."
"jntenaglia","7","0","2","19 August 2013"," Nowhere near District 9, but still a pretty good action flick

Matt Damon does his job as always, Jodie Foster unfortunately isn't used properly, and Sharlto Copley is wonderfully sadistic as Kruger. If you're looking for some action to get your blood pumping look no further, but if you're looking for a great film or something to really leave you thinking you might want to look elsewhere. Here's hoping Blomkamp can come back strong wherever he decides to take us next, and hopefully he takes Copley along with him too."

The story is just awesome and has all the elements of an addicting formula. The characters are fun, the performances are great and the action is so gritty and awesome that I wanted more of it.<br/><br/>If the movie had any problems, it's the fact that the story is a little chaotic as it will shift gears and alter course abruptly during its running time and some of the characters felt like they needed more development. However, the bad in this film is so small that it didn't stop me from loving every second.<br/><br/>Finally, while Matt Damon was great as Max, it was Sharlto Copley that stole the movie as Kruger.

"GoDzReaper93","7","0","3","19 August 2013"," HebsMediaReview: Elysium
","Director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) delivers his science-fiction film, ""Elysium"". The film portrays Earth as a dirty, poverty-dominated land with citizens scrambling for food, water and shelter. Meanwhile, citizens with wealth have migrated to a massive space station, called Elysium, where there is no poverty, no war and no sickness. Max, played by Matt Damon (The Departed, The Bourne Identity/Supremacy/Ultimatum), suffers an incident which renders him terminal. This creates his drive to go to Elysium to heal himself.<br/><br/>The concept is very interesting, however, it is not original as seen in last years ""Total Recall"". Unlike the Colin Farrell actioneer, Elysium is a film that is extremely well directed, well scored, well shot, well written and well acted. It is cl<br/><br/>ear that Blomkamp is not a ""one hit wonder"" after the excellent District 9. As a large budget science-fiction film, it is expected that a large quantity of CGI will be used. Unlike other films of the genre, such as Transformers or the Star Wars prequels, the CGI of Elysium is used to advance the story, which is refreshing considering the huge amount of CGI- driven films these days. Furthermore, the CGI is excellent. Many scenes looked practical (such as the robots/droids of the film who act as police officers) and the CGI looked extremely organic. It should also be noted that, although Neill Blomkamp and Peter Jackson have publicly stated that District 9 rose out of the ashes of the failed Halo production, Elysium seems more ""Halo-ey"" with the actual space station being a literal Halo crawling with habitat and inhabitants.<br/><br/>First-time composer, Ryan Amon delivers an excellent score (which also sounds Hans Zimmer- esque) which makes the heart beat rapidly during intense action sequences whilst also slowing down the tone during heart-breaking sequences. The performances of Elysium are all excellent, with Matt Damon spearheading the superb cast which also consists of Jodie Foster (Panic Room, Inside Man), Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A- Team) and William Fichtner (The Dark Knight, Black Hawk Down). Matt Damon is excellent as the motivated Max, while Jodie Foster is equally brilliant as the evil political secretary of Elysium's defences. However, the standout of the film is Sharlto Copley, who delivers an astoundingly brilliant, edgy, hilariously-morbid and downright scary portrayal of Elysium sleeper agent, Kruger. <br/><br/>Much has been said about the premise of the film, the poverty-laden wasteland that has become Earth. However, the film is simply using this as a backdrop to place the story of Max and his struggle and not as social commentary. Although, it is evident that Blomkamp likes to deal with potential social issues such as racism and apartheid (as seen in District 9).<br/><br/>Elysium does have a couple of flaws, however. One of these is predictability. We know that eventually people will rise up and take control of Elysium, we know that the bad people will get what is coming to them. In an intelligent science fiction film, full of excellent aspects, this is one of the only issues which stands out. The other flaw is the shaky-cam during fight scenes. <br/><br/>Elysium is an excellent science-fiction film from director Neill Blomkamp, which delivers excellent action set-pieces, heart and drama. Neill Blomkamp, after delivering two excellent science fiction films, has now solidified himself as a director to watch out for.<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on Neill Blomkamp's Elysium? Leave some feedback and comments below!<br/><br/>Elysium: 9/10<br/><br/>The Good: - Damon, Foster and Copley deliver excellent performances - Organic CGI - Excellent practical effects - Excellent setting - Interesting concept - Excellent score - Excellent cinematography - We're a little closer to a live-action Halo film<br/><br/>The Bad: - Predictability - Shaky-cam"
"Troy_Campbell","7","0","2","19 August 2013"," Visually spectacular.
","Johannesburg-born filmmaker Neill Blomkamp burst onto the scene in 2009 with his brilliant debut feature District 9 - an allegory of the South African race divide disguised as an alien action movie - and evidently set the bar too high for his sophomore effort. This Matt Damon- headlining sci-fi is best judged on its own merits rather than against the superior District 9, as it is visually intriguing adventure that boasts top quality special effects, well placed violence and a handful of fine set pieces. Fun to look at then, yet occasionally let down by a screenplay that is as subtle as a kick to the nether regions. Quite obviously a parable for today's increasing difference between the rich and poor, Blomkamp's script isn't satisfied with sly digs or hidden metaphors but instead smacks you in the face with it's agenda. Damon is reliably awesome (and completely bald) and Jodie Foster lets loose as an evil bitch, however it's Sharlto Copley (Murdock from The A-Team) who flicked my switch the most as the indomitable sleeper agent who relishes the chance to hunt somebody - anybody - down. If, like me, you can get past the overwrought message and a few noticeable holes in logic, then you're in for a great time."

","I was expecting quite a bit from the director of ""District 9"" and thus wanted a lot out of this movie. And it doesn't deliver all the goods, but it's still a competent sci-fi movie. It's also riddled with political messages which is fine, but the movie as a whole just doesn't make sense. Even for a futuristic setting on earth, it simply has a lot of plot-holes. And doesn't have the edge to make the audiences more absorbed with the characters and the situations they are facing. In another words it just isn't a very compelling movie. It also seemed to be missing bits and pieces that could have made this movie great as a whole. Not sure if it's because of the budget, but it just seemed like it needed something more going for it. The characters motives and agenda just doesn't make much sense a lot of times. And thus seems like bits and pieces of the scenes were missing. ""Elysium"" however does have some great scenes that stand out though and even cool adult sci-fi elements. Sharlto Copley however is the scene stealer in this despite Matt Damon being the main protagonist or anti-hero. Sharlto Copley is an actor that has range. He goes from a weak mild mannered manager and reporter in ""District 9"" to the crazy guy in ""The A-Team"". To this intimidating, sadistic, and psychotic agent or mercenary that works for Elysium. Like I said the plot isn't anything mesmerizing or amazing but it does get the job done for the most part. It's about 150yrs into the future, where there is basically two classes of people. People that live on earth and people that live on Elysium. Earth is over populated and polluted to the point of instinction and police(run by Elysium) brutality is at it's worst. But life in Elysium provides just about everything a human being can want in life. It even has cure for cancer, facial change and reconstruction, healing, even increase lifespan. So the people of earth all want to reach Elysium where all the rich and wealthy people live. But people on Elysium doesn't want immigrant coming in, so they can keep all their lavish lifestyles to themselves. Especially Jessica Delacourt(Jodie Foster) who is the secretary of defense in Elysium. And when the protagonist played by Matt Damon ends up only having 5 days to live. He takes the initiative and tries everything to fight and reach Elysium. The plot and setting of this sci-fi movie reminded me of ""Battle Angel Alita"" a lot. And wouldn't be surprised if Neill Blomkamp either got a lot of ideas or was inspired by ""Battle Angel Alita"". Although ""Elysium"" just doesn't fully deliver and didn't really develop upon it's cool and innovative ideas. It didn't beat or even meet my expectations but it was a alright watch.

","I ventured to the movie theater yesterday with a couple of family members to watch Elysium. The trailers had done a good job portraying a Sci-Fi flick that seemingly would be worth seeing in theaters, but honestly, I was skeptical Elysium would be a another cookie-cutter bland action movie after skimming through some user reviews here on IMDb. Some reviewers rated this movie low because of reasons like ""Obama-Care"", plot holes, clichés, etc. Being the average movie-goer, I review movies on how ENTERTAINING the movie was, not on underlying messages or linking the movie to politics of today. Elysium was an extremely entertaining movie. The story is very straight forward and is not difficult to comprehend at all. To me, there wasn't any major plot holes evident and any clichés that has been overused, it was actually a very original movie in it's own regard. The ""complaint"" of Obama-care is baffling to me, the movie was not made to be a political platform or to present any underlying messages, it was simply made for entertainment purposes. If you want to see an Amazing Sci-Fi movie with astonishing visuals and an immersive story, take a chance on this movie because it is well worth it. The only grievance I have with Elysium dissuading me from giving it a perfect 10 is that the plot could have been a tad bit deeper, but nonetheless, the story was well delivered."

"PWNYCNY","8","0","2","16 August 2013"," Unconventioanl roles for Foster and Damon.
","This movie was good. It entertained. It told a story. It's just too bad that Jody Foster plays such a negative character. Casting Jody Foster as a heavy just does not work. She simply is not believable as a prissy, power-hungry bureaucrat. Foster has to be the hero, not the villain. She's the wrong person to die, and not get revived. As for Matt Damon, he's out of character too, with mixed results. What this movie needed was a young Sylvester Stallone or a Dolph Lundgren to play Max. Not that Foster and Damon's performances are not good, they are, but they're typed casted already and that's a huge hurdle for them to overcome. In fact, Foster looked wonderful in her business outfit, so neatly did it fit her. Also, William Fichtner performs effectively in a relatively small role as a corrupt robot manufacturer. The story itself is good, although a bit contrived, with the rich people portrayed, of course, as being pampered and self-indulgent, and the poor people a bunch of victims scrounging to survive. The point is made: there is economic injustice and it can drive people to commit acts of desperation. The movie includes imaginative depictions of life on a space station and of space travel as being routine. Whether that will ever happen is a subject for conjecture, but the movie suggests that space flight, at least, low orbit space flight, can be done economically. Anyway, this is a good movie that keeps the audience's attention and is worth watching."
"constantin-aliferis-688-686247","9","0","3","16 August 2013"," Elysium: Unusually enjoyable movie with an ethical soul
","I will not repeat here the plot description and many aspects covered by other reviews. Instead I will point out the salient observations about this movie that come to my mind:<br/><br/>Elysium is an excellent modern example of the classic scifi format: since the early Metropolis every serious scifi has dealt with contemporary and pressing societal issues using the future as a metaphor that provides a less biased or more revealing perspective to the viewers. <br/><br/>Blomkamp has a remarkable command of action sequence involving technology: on par with an early James Cameron imo, and I cannot find a better praise than that. Specifically he sets up the action sequences so that we know what propels it, where are the various agents of action, and how it unfolds in space and time. He paces action at the right speed, he structures episodes of action so that they escalate, sustain, recede, accelerate, and surprise. <br/><br/>Blomkamp has a very sophisticated take on future weaponry too: in his films the weaponry of today has been replaced with instruments of destruction that bring a reality and excitement that the moronic cliché of a 20 century automatic masquerading as futuristic weapon is thoroughly abandoned. Because future weaponry is so powerful, gory mayhem follows and at the same time many silly Hollywood heroics (think james bond dodging 10,000 bullets unharmed) are eliminated.<br/><br/>The set design is remarkable aesthetically and remarkably effective narratively: on one hand never before since Stalker have we seen a more decrepit future earth than here. The contrast to the pristine Elysium is both jarring and narratively compact to the extreme. In a few seconds the director establishes beyond doubt what is wrong with this world.<br/><br/>Copley is spectacular: with a Rasputin like appearance and a demonic energy, he acts like a virtuoso of destruction and brings Terminator or Alien levels of menace to the story.<br/><br/>A hero is not a synonym for the protagonist: among many members of the audience and many critics, the notion of a hero and a protagonist are often confused. A hero sacrifices to attain a higher goal. A protagonist does not sacrifice anything. The main character of Elysium is a hero. We need more movies with heroes.<br/><br/>Weaknesses are abundant but do not hold the movie back: this movie is not perfect. Sometimes the dialog lacks polish, nuance, or just sounds cartoonish. The music is adequate, but think what Vangelis accomplished with Bladerunner, or what Goldsmith achieved with Alien, or Fiedel with Terminator, or Poledouris with Conan to understand how much better the experience would have been with a more inspired score. Finally the direction and acting is pure melodrama at times. This affects primarily the secondary, textural elements of the story, and does not spoil the core of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Elysium is a great movie, not just unusually enjoyable, but thoroughly worth contemplating about both in terms of cinematic form but most importantly in terms of societally and ethically important issues which is its earnest goal."

"Jackkrsk","9","0","3","15 August 2013"," ""Elysium was overall enjoyable, but the middle of the film dragged out.""
","South African film director and producer Neil Blomkamp introduces us to his second sci- fi/action flick ""Elysium"" which I recently watched in the theater. <br/><br/>The picture has a little bit of familiar elements from ""Distirct 9"", which was the first official picture that Blomkamp directed and produced . Los Angeles in Elysium has the same elements of the slums of South Africa found in District 9 but, without the aliens of Elysium.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the year 2154 when two classes of the people exists. The wealthy class who live on a luxurious space station called Elysium built by the Armadyne Corporation. The CEO of the Armadyne Corporation is John Carlyle portrayed by character actor William Fichtner. On Elysium there is no poverty, disease, or war, and there are affluent homes. The poor live on over-populated and ruined Earth.<br/><br/>In Elysium, Matt Damon portrays an ex-con named Max De Costa, who lives in the ruins of Los Angeles and works in one of Armadyne's factories. Max reconnects with an old childhood friend Frey (Alicia Braga) who is a nurse at the hospital. Frey has a daughter named Maltida, who is dying of Lukemea. Damon did a pretty good job playing the role of tough guy akin to his role as Jason Bourne from The Bourne films. By the way, Elysium is not Damon's only Sci-Fi flick. He did a voice role in the 2000 animated Sci-Fi adventure film ""Titan AE"", which I grew up with and saw it in theaters when it was released.<br/><br/>Here's the main story of the film: Max had a rough past that involves his female childhood friend Frey, but he's struggling to stay on the right side of the law when he realizes that his only hope for survival after being exposed to deadly radiation is to reach Elysium. Should Max succeed, he will strike a major blow for equality in the eyes of his fellow surface dwellers; should he fail, it will mean certain death. In his quest to become the hero who can restore the balance between the rich and the poor. He joins a group of smugglers to get to Elysium and they made him wear a robotic HULC suit. One of the antagonists of the film is Agent C.M. Kruger played by Sharlto Copley, who also started in District 9.<br/><br/>The actress amazing and talented Jodie Foster also stars in the film. Every dramatic or suspense role she performs never fails. I consider her to be one of the greatest movie actresses. In Elysium she portrays Jessica Delacourt, who is the secretary of defense of Elysium. The European accent she feigned made her role all the more powerful. Elysium was Jodie Foster's second Sci-Fi film she star in. Her first Sci-Fi film was Contact, which was released in 1997.<br/><br/>I would have to say, the CGI special effects of the Elysium space station was tremendous. The CGI of the space station made it very realistic. I was also impressed by the special effects of the daytime in the Elysium space station. The Mercedes Benz symbol shaped space station reminded me of the space station from 2001: A Space Odyessey (1968) due to the way it moved.<br/><br/>Elysium was overall enjoyable, but the middle of the film dragged out. The middle point of the plot was not achieved until it was close to the end.I still thought this film was entertaining.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for people who loved District 9 and it's still worth buying a ticket to see this picture. I give it a 3 out of 4 stars."

","Elysium is just another future style Total Recall movie. Watch the old Total Recall it is a better movie. The special effects are old news. One could see a message of today's political debates about immigration, health care, etc. What was effectively scary about Elysium is what happens to the earth with over population. With over population comes, poverty, unemployment, disease, and a employer who could can be nasty because of surplus in the labor market. The environment will suffer from over consumption, human waste, and people depleting the Eco-system. The movie started out believable, but I did not like the ending. What happens when the space station Elysium becomes over populated? None of the movies problems were solved. A depressing ending."

Then in the last 20 minutes he dies and the little girl gets cured. When that happened I felt like saying...Why the heck did they do that. When you see a movie there's a built up of anticipation, especially an action movie. Everything should tie in together-the beginning, middle and end. Why did they throw in the idea of the girl getting cured at the VERY last moment. The point was that HE get cured. <br/><br/>The movie should have just been about Matt Damon getting to there to save the little girl. There would have been 1 solid plot and it could get carried out by getting her there, like he did anyways.<br/><br/>There could have been more action. What was there was good don't get me wrong. I wish Matt Damon wasn't sick through most of the movie. That's not very exciting to watch. They should have given Jodie Foster more screen time. The beginning was a yawn.

Jodie Foster was doing well with the role, but was unable to unfold. Some random bum enter the main role of the villain and the movie revolved around him. The main character died and so could not engage in the healing chamber. Matt Damon was just a messenger and failed to enter the true role of savior - not able to personally lead negotiations with the management of Elysium. It was not clear how Elysium was not crowded, and why not build more of these towns. Protection of Elysium was very weak, relying on the protection from the earth from a bum.

And Jodie Foster is a favorite, but this was not a good role for her and ultimately an incredibly stilted and unconvincing performance. I would love to have seen Tilda Swinton or Kate Blanchett. Matt Damon is just so weary throughout that it's hard to root for him - I only really cared, somewhat, for the character Frey and the little girl. It is visually stunning and looks even better when the ""shakey-cam"" (which is getting really old) settles down. Great idea and I'm glad I saw it, but it just left me pretty unsatisfied."

Matt Damon's Max reminds me a lot of Sharlto Copley in District 9. Max is more human than hero, and it shows for most of the film. He's willing to do whatever it takes to survive. And while he is a good person, he is not the typical Hollywood altruistic hero that we're all so used to.<br/><br/>The special effects put on a display of just how much computers can do these days. High-tech gadgets and vehicles look sophisticated, yet worn and dirty. Good use is also made of live-action special effects, something that is criminally under-valued in the eyes of so many directors.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster, not surprisingly, gives a seemingly effortless performance as one of two main antagonists. Sharlto Copley gets the golden star for his role as Agent Kruger; I'll let you see him for yourself.<br/><br/>Hard to find anything to complain about with this movie.

The wealthy live above the poor on a beautiful space station where health care is provided to the 1%. Below everyone struggles with poverty and illness. Maybe a little to obvious in it's messaging, but i think we need that simplicity in today's world. This film shows everything wrong with our country and our world today. The overall message is clear. Keep pushing the and squeezing the lower class and you will have a revolution. <br/><br/>As for the film overall it's good not great. The visual effects are believable and the production design manages to be contemporary and also reference 70's science fiction films. Jodie foster is good as a cold calculating villain. I felt that Matt Damon is good but the role was not as complex or deep enough for him. He's a really good actor but there wasn't much for him. He was really good though. <br/><br/>The negatives have to be the cinematography. The camera work often gets shaky especially during the fight scenes. It's a little been there done that. Also it could have used a longer prologue and certainly a longer epilogue. i wanted to see in detail what happened after the film's plot was wrapped up.

It's all just a quick shuttle ride away from Earth. Close enough to be realistic, but just outside the reach of masses.<br/><br/>Matt Damon plays Max, a heavily tattooed former criminal trying to get this life back on the straight and narrow, but the Los Angeles of 2154 where he resides makes it difficult. After a run of bad luck he is dealt a deadly dose of radiation while working at his factory job. From here Max's only chance of survival is to get to Elysium. Conveniently, Max just happens to be on a first name basis with Spider, a mastermind hacker crime boss that has the means to get Max there. After an unpleasant scene were Max is fused to with a robotic exoskeleton, all he needs to do to attain his passage is hijack a corrupt official's brain and download the data to his own.<br/><br/>The dismal picture that Blomkamp paints of our future as a species is grim, although slightly glorified. His Los Angeles 2154 resembles the favelas of current day Rio de Janerio, hardly a fictional dystopia, and although Damon is a pleasure to watch amidst this dystopian fiction, his overall goal of trying to save his own life is not enough to garner sympathy. It is difficult to care about the worth of a single ex-con's life amidst the pandemonium and violence that everyone around him also suffers.<br/><br/>This disconnect never really resolves itself despite an attempt: Max ends up trying to save his childhood friend, and her daughter too. It doesn't work, but it also doesn't matter. This film is about wholes, big pictures, sums of all things greater than the individual. The technological marvels of Elysium are matched only by the decrepitude of the world that Blomkamp creates.

"heartinstone","8","0","4","12 August 2013"," Ignore Jodie Foster's horrible French accent.
","As one of the most anticipated movies of the summer, Elysium comes at the heels of Pacific Rim, another post apocalyptic film widely received from Del Toro. Elysium comes from the Director of District 9, Neil Blomkamp, and stars Matt Damon and Jodie Foster. Did it live up to it's expectations? It depends on how high you set them. As a Matt Damon fan, my expectation were that of any Matt Damon movie: it would be awesome. Did I like it more than Pacific Rim? Nope. But I did like it a lot, and here's why.<br/><br/>Like District 9, Elysium focuses on the social and political issues that are relevant to today. These issues are so close to home that you almost feel like: man, this could actually be how it is in 2154. It focuses on health care, separating the classes between the rich and the poor. It touches on dangerous working conditions and corporate involvement. But Elysium isn't just about the social issues. It's about becoming aware of exactly who you are and who you should be as a person. It's about self-discovery and the idea that sacrifices must be made in times of dire circumstances. Elysium is a commentary that encompasses every aspect of morality.<br/><br/>The script, though not the best written one, was well delivered by Matt Damon and his supporting cast. Jodie Foster's French was almost fluently spoken all though when speaking English, the accent itself was horrible. Sharlto Copey, who we know from A-team and also District 9, is actually a bad ass villainous character. He's creepy and satisfyingly evil enough that Kruger is a believable character. The art direction and production is also something to admire. The design of the ruined Earth as opposed to Elysium was well contrasted and beautifully creative.<br/><br/>If you see one dystopian / post-apocalyptic film this summer, it's a toss up between Pacific Rim and Elysium. But if you liked District 9 and love Matt Damon, definitely choose Elysium."

The contrast between the paradise of Elysium and the destitute servant class on earth is made visually, as well as depicted early and forcefully by interactions with robotic police, working conditions, and quick glimpses into medical care on an overpopulated planet.<br/><br/>While it excels visually, Elysium lacks in terms of a story line. We are left with hardly enough time to really get to know Max (Matt Damon)and the plot is very standard action movie fare. The plot also has more holes than swiss cheese, and the magic wand of science fiction is waved over some rather critical components. This rampant outbreak of plot holes and absence of any real character development or resolution leaves you feeling like you've been cheated, and is certainly disappointing coming on the heels of D9, where we were allowed to really identify with the protagonist as he underwent his mutation into an alien. <br/><br/>Elysium's real beauty is in it's undeniably relevant social commentary. The film makes an obvious plug for universal health care, but leaves more subtle commentary to the viewer. Elysium exists as a powerful symbol of class division, one that exhibits a shockingly relevant point: all human beings are inextricably connected. Despite the best efforts of the rich to isolate themselves from their economically enslaved servant class, fate would have it otherwise. This isn't to say that anything is better as a result (indeed, there were no indications that the world was operating with unlimited resources) but that the plight of humanity as a whole cannot be lost in a private reality, for eventually it will make itself known.<br/><br/>TL DR; <br/><br/>Go see Elysium, but be ready to simply drink it in and wait for a few days before you make any strong evaluation of the film. It's a visually stunning, entertaining action film with brilliantly subtle messages."

","The movie starts off explaining how the world became overpopulated and how the rich people fled to a place called ""Elysium"" where you can live for hundreds of years and be cured of any disease or handicap you might come across. Which, lets be honest, if that's how things turn out to be, might be pretty awesome.<br/><br/>There is also a little back story of Matt Damon's character as a child growing up along side a young girl named ""Frey"". They are the best of friends and it's his promise to one day take them to Elysium.<br/><br/>The cinematography might be the best part of the film. The way the world is portrayed as an overpopulated mess is brilliant in my opinion. A very grimy and dark place to live and you get the feeling no one wants to be there. And then you see Elysium and how beautiful it is. I also liked the way it was designed.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the story. Damon's character becomes exposed to a severe amount of radiation that will kill him in 5 days. The only way to survive is to get to Elysium. That's when the action begins and we get action sequences which are a bit gruesome but entertaining nonetheless. However, some of those scenes are shot with a hand-held camera so it becomes shaky which I don't like at all. But, it doesn't take away too much from the movie.<br/><br/>Jodie Foster plays the villain who wants all the power of Elysium in her pocket. It doesn't get explained but I'm assuming on Earth, there is no more President or Vice President, etc. But in one scene after Foster's character does something without authority, she gets summoned by the President. So I'm assuming that means all the big authorities live on Elysium. Anyway, she doesn't like the way it's being run and wants to do something about it. It's just, I'm not sure if she was trying for a French/American accent or any accent for that matter, you don't enjoy the movie while she's on screen. But maybe that makes the movie work.<br/><br/>Bottom line for me, if you enjoy science fiction movies, you will enjoy this one. It's an interesting take on what could happen should the earth become overpopulated. It's not as good as Bloomkamp's first movie ""Distric 9"" but it had me entertained from beginning to end."
