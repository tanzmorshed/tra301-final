"miriam-seraia","10","203","242","16 March 2016"," A movie that qualifies as strong meat a.k.a. be ready to digest a lot of reality and face the true face of a world unknown to people living in a happy bubble.
","This movie undid something inside of me. It's that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don't live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can't protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. ""Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don't do anything about it, that's when we fail. A poet once wrote, ""You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night."" So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!"

","I've rated almost a hundred movies and I've only ever given out six 10s on this website. I don't rave about many movies and I am tough to please when it comes to film, but this film is absolute brilliance. It is flawless. This one earns its 10 and it is one of the best films I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Everything about this film is brilliant. The camera work is great and the score is underrated. However, what makes this film is an absolutely genius screenplay that is acted to perfection. This script will rock your world. I am not Catholic. I didn't grow up in a deeply Catholic area, but this film still affected me greatly. Everyone should see this movie for that reason. That is something that you have to see for yourself. <br/><br/>However, I'd like to focus a little more on the technical aspects. Beyond the fact that the subject matter is heavy and extremely important to American and world culture, this movie does everything else right. The acting is absolutely phenomenal. This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn't much more to say. This film is pure brilliance from its opening frame to its closing moment. For both cinematic and cultural reasons, this is a film that every person should see."

","Going into the theater to see Spotlight, I had read the rave reviews and knew I was in for something special. This movie did not disappoint! Being from Boston, this movie really made me think about my life growing up, as a lot of ""what ifs"" came to mind. ""What if"" I went to church every Sunday...""what if"" I was gullible enough to have a priest lure me into his lair. Spotlight goes straight to the heart of this amazingly sad (and apparently never-ending) saga of the Catholic church and the amount of abuse priests have inflicted on hundreds of victims. The acting is all-around fantastic, from Mr. Keaton to some actors that I am not familiar with, which is an aspect of this fine movie that makes it so profound. Tense throughout, I was saddened to hear that this abuse is an epidemic and probably will never be stopped. The exclamation point was when a member of the audience stood up and told the rest of us ""...I am a survivor..."" WOW..."
"brendandevere","9","64","80","3 February 2016"," Catholic Church in the Spotlight.
","Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the 'spotlight' on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These 'men of God' preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. 'Spotlight's' dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.<br/><br/>Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn't afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For 'Spotlight' to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.<br/><br/>The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, 'Spotlight' pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, 'Spotlight' refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American's. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real 'cherry' in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes 'Spotlight' to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.<br/><br/>This is the best journalistic drama since 1976's 'All the President's Men'. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe's newsroom as it should have been. 'Spotlight' doesn't shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and 'Spotlight' has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism. Sit back and enjoy."

","Spotlight is a 2015 American biographical drama film directed by Tom McCarthy and written by McCarthy and Josh Singer. The film follows The Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States, and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The film stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.<br/><br/>Spotlight was shown in the Out of Competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. It was also shown at the Telluride Film Festival and the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on November 6, 2015, by Open Road Films. It won numerous guilds and critics' association awards, and was named one of the finest films of 2015 by various publications. It is nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor: Mark Ruffalo, Best Supporting Actress: Rachel McAdams, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.<br/><br/>In 2001, The Boston Globe hires a new editor, Marty Baron. Baron meets Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, the editor of the Spotlight team, a small group of journalists writing investigative articles that take months to research and publish. After Baron reads a Globe column about a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, he urges the Spotlight team to investigate. Journalist Michael Rezendes contacts Garabedian, who initially declines interview. Though he is told not to, Rezendes reveals that he is on the Spotlight team, persuading Garabedian to talk.<br/><br/>Initially believing that they are following the story of one priest who was moved around several times, the Spotlight team begin to uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. Through a man who heads a victim's rights organization, they widen their search to thirteen priests. They learn through an ex-priest who worked trying to rehabilitate pedophile priests that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston. Through their research, they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and begin to find their victims to back up their suspicions. When the September 11 attacks occur, the team is forced to deprioritize the story. They regain momentum when Rezendes learns from Garabedian that there are publicly available documents that confirm Cardinal Law was aware of the problem and ignored it. After The Boston Globe wins a case to have even more legal documents unsealed, the Spotlight Team finally begins to write the story, and plan to publish their findings in early 2002.<br/><br/>As they are about to go to print, Robinson confesses to the team that he was sent a list of twenty pedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on. Baron, nevertheless, tells Robinson and the team that the work they are doing is important. The story goes to print with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law, and a phone number requesting victims of pedophile priests to come forward. The following morning, the Spotlight team is inundated with phone calls from victims coming forward to tell their stories. The film closes with a list of places in the United States and around the world where the Catholic Church has been involved in concealing abuse by priests."

","It is no secret that I left the Church for many years after they failed to deal with the abuse scandal. Like the Globe personnel, I had no idea of the scope of the problem. I was just angry that those responsible had gotten away with it.<br/><br/>The Globe thought this story was worthwhile when they had uncovered 13 priests that abused children. When they discovered it was closer to 90, they were shocked. The eventual number in Boston was 186! This is not surprising when it is estimated that 50% of all priests are not celibate.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was amazing in this film, and Rachel McAdams was superb. Neither will likely win awards in a year of fantastic performances, but there is a chance the film may steal an Oscar. It would be a great thing.<br/><br/>The film was very difficult for a Catholic to watch, but it was definitely worth it. Unlike the recent documentary, Mea Maxima Culpa, it focused on the Globe and the story, and not the abuse."

","It won best film, deservedly so. This is a film that resonated with me long after I watched it. The complicated tale of the investigation of paedophile priests in Boston and the publication of it is told in riveting fashion by Tom Macarthy who does not waste a frame or a scene to anything less than the plot or character development. I never felt the running time or in any way disbelieved any of the actors in their portrayals.<br/><br/>Keaton seems to be on a total roll at the moment and he is excellent as the head of Spotlight but the whole ensemble seemed to put in a real shift. This felt like a documentary at times and I could feel the audience around me leaning forward as each new revelation is uttered. <br/><br/>Just brilliant."

","... because by the time the credits roll and you start to breathe normally again, you will suddenly realize that this was not a horror film as such, this was a re-enactment of events that actually happened, with real victims and real perpetrators and real well-meaning third parties covering up the whole thing as fast as the body count kept piling up.<br/><br/>And then you will once again have difficulty catching your breath.<br/><br/>As a film it is superb. McCarthy who did double duty as writer and director deserves acknowledgement. The cast is universally excellent. Ruffalo gives the performance of his career, Keaton is solid as a rock, and McAdams reaps overdue dividends from her decision to broaden her career into non-glamorous roles at a time when the only scripts they were sending her were for Diva parts. Smart lady.<br/><br/>A reviewer is not supposed to interject personal feelings in a review but I will say without apology that I miss films like these -- films that speak for the injustice in society and offer solutions -- and wish there were more of them. It seems that when I was younger there was a lot more interest in doing the right thing merely because it was the right thing. This no longer seems to be the societal meme, and that troubles me.<br/><br/>A must-see."
"classicalsteve","10","58","83","28 February 2016"," All the Vatican's Men in Outstanding Investigative Journalism Film Revealing the Skeletons in the Boston Archdiocese's Closet
","In ""All the President's Men"", young reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered a national political scandal when they, through their investigative journalism, revealed the White House under then President Richard Nixon was using campaign funding to finance dirty tricks of political enemies, nicknamed Watergate. In ""Spotlight"", a similar team of investigative reporters reveal a scandal of epic proportions which makes much of the Watergate scandal seem tame by comparison. They uncovered widespread sexual abuse of minors committed by priests of the Roman Catholic Church who, in turn, hid the crimes. Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber), Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) work for a group of investigative reporters within the Boston Globe called ""Spotlight"" who succeed in finding the skeletons in the Boston Diocese proverbial closet. For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.<br/><br/>The story begins with a quick flash-back to 1976 when a priest is jailed for sexual abusing a minor. The film then cuts to 2001. Marty Baron (Schreiber), a Jewish Floridian, becomes the main editor for the Boston Globe. He meets the different editors and journalists, and learns of work by Spotlight. A Globe column reveals a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, claims Cardinal Law, then Archbishop of Boston, knew Father John Geoghan, a priest within Law's diocese, was sexually abusing children, and the bishop did not bring him to the attention of authorities. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate further to see whether the claim is true and an isolated incident, or if there is more to the story. The ""seed"" is similar to the break-in of the democratic headquarters at the Watergate Complex which eventually revealed the Nixon White House had been engaging in multiple plots against perceived political enemies.<br/><br/>The Spotlight team is headed by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Keaton), a no-nonsense fair but tough reporter/editor. They agree to Baron's wishes and begin researching deeper to see if there is a larger story. Their first lead is the attorney mentioned in the article, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci). Rezendes (Ruffalo) peruses Garabedian who acted as negotiator between the Boston Archdiocese and victims of Father Geoghan. The reporter wishes the attorney to reveal names of the victims, but at first Garabedian declines. Eventually, Garabedian agrees to contact victims, who are now much older, and ask them if they are willing to speak with Rezendes without revealing their names. Eventually, interviews are set up at the attorney's offices. The question then becomes whether there were other priests who engaged in similar criminal behavior against minors.<br/><br/>On another front, other members of the team, including Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), begin discovering the unspeakable reality of other victims possibly at the hands of more priests, aside from Geoghan. Then a tip from a former rehabilitation counselor for priests informs the team that, based on statistics, there may be as many as 90 priests involved with sexual abuse of children in the Boston Area alone. The team then appropriates volumes of an American guide book of Roman Catholic priests, published once a year, which lists the whereabouts of every clergyman in the church in terms of dioceses and parishes. The investigators make a startling discovery. Certain names in the book over several years are listed as ""on leave due to illness"", ""on administrative leave"", or other designations of inactivity after only one to three years at a particular parish, leading the team to consider these may be priests who engaged in sexual misconduct with minors. If true, it would place blame not only on Cardinal Law as possibly covering up the church's indiscretions but the entire Roman Catholic Church, all the way to the Vatican.<br/><br/>This is a stunning film about the power of a small group of urban reporters to uncover wrongdoing by one of the oldest and far-reaching institutions in the world: The Roman Catholic Church. In particular high marks for Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, and Michael Keaton as Robbie Robinson. So much of the story parallels the Watergate Scandal of several decades earlier. As horrible as the actual victimization of minors by the priests, often boys because they were less likely to ""squeal"" because of the shame, the cover-up by Law was nearly as criminal. Instead of taking the priests to justice, as he should have done, he tried to cover it up by offering settlements to the families, often when the victims were minors. Law and probably other church officials moved the priests to other parishes where they engaged in similar behavior, thus allowing widespread sexual abuse to continue. It was eventually revealed that not only did these sexual predators victimize children in other parts of the country, it was happening internationally."

","Seconds after the credits for Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" roll, an overwhelming feeling of changing your career takes over. Is film criticism really where I belong? What important, life-changing story am I not writing about? Truth is, quite a bit of classic films give off that same feeling. ""Rocky"" made a bunch of our fathers and older brothers go for a morning run and drink raw eggs. ""Rudy"" made us want to go out and play Notre Dame football. ""Spotlight"" makes you want to go down to your local courthouse and search the public records for clues. Then, get on the phone, with a pen and a pad, and start asking some really tough questions. Honestly speaking, ""Spotlight"" is the best investigative news drama this century. Matter of fact, behind ""All the President's Men"" and maybe ""The Insider,"" it's among the best ever made.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.<br/><br/>Where you must begin, with any praise for the film, is the audacious and fortifying script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. The two create cinematic magic in their articulation of words, characters, and narrative storytelling. Each person feels authentic. Each scene feels rich and equally important as the last. And most of all, its the tightest, most satisfying film from beginning to end, seen this year. From minute one, you're hooked, up until the last second, where they decide the last words spoken should be, ""Spotlight"" is astonishingly crafted.<br/><br/>I'm still in shock and awe that Tom McCarthy is the one who made this. This is a writer/director who I've appreciated but didn't have the ""love"" factor surrounding any of his films. Paired with an outstanding cast, co-writer Josh Singer, editor Tom McArdle, cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and composer Howard Shore, Tom McCarthy gets a chance to create his masterpieceand succeeds. He makes brilliant artistic choices, such as letting a Mark Ruffalo letter reading play over a 2-minute taxi car ride back to the newspaper. McCarthy's direction is one of the best directorial efforts from any filmmaker this year thus far.<br/><br/>All the players performing are top-notch but walking away, best-in- show, is the performance of Academy Award nominee Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo exhibits his best screen performance to date, and makes a stake in his claim for the Oscar this year. Weirdly reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's work in ""The Master,"" Ruffalo builds his 'Mike' from the feet up, giving him his own characteristics that I'm not sure McCarthy and Singer set out to do. His expressions in words, mannerisms, all encapsulate the magnitude of his work, bookended by an explosive scene that brought tears to my eyes. Think back to Emma Stone's acclaimed work in ""Birdman,"" and the scene that made everyone notice. I wanted to simply applaud.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams, who play ""Robbie"" and ""Sacha"" respectively, are attune with their characters and destinations. Each bring strong sensibilities and sensitivity to their roles that desperately call for them. Hotly worked into the story is Liev Schreiber as a newly appointed Editor, that in the little screen time he's given, makes a long-lasting impression. Stanley Tucci is also afforded the same opportunity, and gives one of the film's best monologues.<br/><br/>If there's a film this year that feels like an Oscar-winner, ""Spotlight"" sure does make a compelling case. Dramatic, heart- pounding, and necessarily made. It's one of the most important films this year and probably THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR. The Telluride tradition may continue."

In this day of digital news, this movie makes us stand back and realize what we may lose in the way of investigative journalism as we slowly kill off print media.<br/><br/>The lengths the directors go to to achieve a sense of authenticity is remarkable. We are there in Boston in 2001-2002. We get to know enough about each character to make him or her real, but not enough to create side dramas. The focus remains the child abuse scandal in the archdiocese in Boston. That reflects the conflict the characters face and deal with when events make them rethink the focus of their article.<br/><br/>The movie is riveting, though we know the outcome."

It's not flashy, but still an incredibly effective piece of advertising. You know in an instant that this is a journalism movie; die-hards in rolled-up shirtsleeves working all hours to unearth a national scandal. I am an absolute sucker for this.<br/><br/>The scandal herein is the systemic cover-up of pederasty within the Catholic Church. To that end (even though a lot of the dialogue in this movie is come-from-behind startling), one line in particular jumped out at me: ""They say it's just physical abuse but it's more than that, this was spiritual abuse. You know why I went along with everything? Because priests are supposed to be the good guys."" This isn't just a story about the crimes committed, but there's also sensitivity towards the victims themselves. I dunno, I just found that line deeply unnerving.<br/><br/>But when all is said and done, this movie runs on the grueling nuts-and-bolts detective work of investigative journalism; a uniformly excellent cast, great writing and tension that continues to build.<br/><br/>Amazing stuff.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jtindahouse","7","67","117","31 January 2016"," A fine film but not worthy of winning Best Picture
","Going into 'Spotlight' I was aware that it was the front runner to win Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. After having seen it I can't really understand why. That's not to say it wasn't a good film, it simply didn't blow me away at all. It told a story, an admittedly fascinating and true story, in an informative way but it didn't do anything that great films do like inspire me, move me or leave me stunned with the powerful nature it was told with. Best Picture winners of the past, like 'Schindler's List', told true stories but also encompassed all three of those traits and plenty more. That was a film I will never forget, 'Spotlight' will probably be completely out of my mind by this time next week. Frankly, I was a little underwhelmed with the lack of emotion such a serious subject brought out in me. The film just didn't really seem to try to do that. It felt more like a documentary reenactment, simply with very fine actors, than anything else.<br/><br/>My disagreement with it likely winning Best Picture aside, there are some very fine filmmaking skills on show here in all departments. Director Tom McCarthy, in only his fifth turn at directing, has been nominated for a Best Directing award. While I don't like the lack of emotion his storytelling brought out in me, he clearly had a vision to tell a story in a certain way, and he got it done. He tells it in a punchy fashion that never allows the audience to drift off. The Best Directing race this year is a tight one with four of the five all being widely in contention. I don't think McCarthy will get the win however, as his film doesn't have the ""X-Factor"" going for it that a lot of the others do. Having said that, any film that wins Best Picture has to get some real credit for its director, so don't completely rule him out if it does indeed win that.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams have also been nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Actress awards. I have trouble understanding how, to again be frank. Roles based on real life characters always get more attention than others but these two had absolutely nothing to work with in the script. They were almost never given a chance to shine in any scene. Because of this I don't believe either has a chance of winning their respective award. It wasn't a film designed to make actors look good. Having said that, the stand out performance for me was Michael Keaton. He almost won the Best Actor award last year and this year can't even get a nomination. Had his been considered a Supporting Role I'm sure he would have but it was probably considered in that ""in between"" state, which may have hurt him.<br/><br/>There are a lot of true stories at this year's Acadmey Awards and I think 'Spotlight' is benefiting from being the most interesting story of them all. 'The Big Short' is another case of an interesting true story, however that was told in a very unique and clever way. Interestingly, that is the biggest competition 'Spotlight' will have when the winner is read out on the night. My fingers might just be crossed on the seeing the upset."
"Danusha_Goska","8","106","194","23 November 2015"," Spotlight is the Best Film of 2015
","""Spotlight"" is the best film of 2015 and I will be disappointed if it does not receive the Academy Award for Best Picture. As good as it is, it is just one step short of greatness. <br/><br/>""Spotlight"" depicts Boston Globe reporters investigating priest sex abuse of children. ""Spotlight"" focuses like a laser on what it is to be a journalist, to consider whether or not to cover a story, to select it, to research it, to uncover piece-by-piece, a full narrative, to publish it and to live with the consequences of publication. <br/><br/>You don't learn about the reporter's personal lives except for what you see incidentally as they work at home. There is no romantic subplot; there are no trumped-up action scenes where a reporter punches a priest. There's actually one of those scenes, no doubt a self- conscious salute to classic newspaper films, where you see newspapers being run through one of those giant machines that rapidly prints, folds, and stacks hard copies. <br/><br/>I've never seen a film in which I liked these actors more: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian D'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Len Cariou. Lesser known actors in minor roles are every bit as good. There is no Hollywood in these performances. There's no sexy costumes or makeup, no grandstanding for the Academy. The actors are dressed in the workaday attire of newspapermen and women. Much of the film takes place in a grubby shared office full of sloppy manila file folders or in cafes and working class neighborhoods where informants are interviewed. Each performer plays a cog in a giant wheel working to uncover evil. None of them knows about world-shaking scandal still to come, or Pulitzer Prizes. They are just, with a pair of tweezers, turning over one leaf and seeing what lies beneath and adding that to the information already gathered. Even though viewers already know how this story played out in real life, the audience gasps when a discovery is made; the audience fears that a rock will be thrown through a window; the audience fears that judicial complicity will keep the story hidden. I began crying half an hour into the film. I was crying at the end. I made audible ""Huh!"" noises at especially and outrageously ironic moments, as did others in the audience. We applauded at the film's conclusion. <br/><br/>The film opens with a child in a police station, accompanied by his parents and a priest. A lawyer enters. Everyone speaks in hushed tones. ""I promise this will never happen again."" The police are cynical. The lawyer is smooth. The child is crushed. The parents are heartbroken. The priest appears slickly demonic. The scene is anonymous. Events like this were repeated at least a thousand times. <br/><br/>July, 2001. The Boston Globe acquires its first Jewish editor, Martin Baron. The Spotlight team is considering following up a case of priestly sex abuse. Slowly but surely, they discover that there are far more incidences than suspected. They discover not just one bad apple here and there. Rather, Cardinal Law has reassigned abusive priests to new parishes. Baron meets with Law. Law presents Baron with a copy of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. <br/><br/>""Spotlight"" mentions ""Good Germans"" – people who kept their eyes closed to the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors, and the sudden appearance of ash falling from the sky. Just so, there were many ""Good Bostonians."" It's sickening to confront the many who had awareness of priestly sex abuse and did nothing. Targeted kids were powerless and without allies. One had a schizophrenic mother. Some had absentee fathers. Some were gay. Many were from the wrong side of the tracks. After they were abused, some became alcoholics, drug addicts, or suicides. When SNAP activist Phil Saviano is invited to the Boston Globe's office, and he talks about a conspiracy to protect abusive priests that stretches all the way to the Vatican, he comes across as a twitchy, obnoxious, conspiracy theorist raving about Area 51 – someone easy to write off. <br/><br/>The most nauseating reason of all given for ignoring clergy sex abuse: money. The Globe could have covered clergy sex abuse earlier, but it didn't. Over fifty percent of the paper's subscribers are Catholics. Boston is a small town, with a lot of insular Irish Catholics who don't want anyone rocking the boat, or risking various money streams, including the church's significant charity work. <br/><br/>Especially poignant are the scenes where abuse survivors are encouraged to detail what happened to them. ""It's not enough to say he molested you. You must give me the clinical details of exactly what happened,"" reporters insist, to sobbing survivors, who must then re- inhabit their worst memories. <br/><br/>The plot churns forward with the single line of a freight train running on schedule. I was never bored. <br/><br/>The priestly sex abuse crisis is not a tragedy because the Catholic Church is corrupt. The priestly sex abuse crisis is a tragedy because the Catholic Church is great. The film could have become better than it is had it included this theme. Show Catholics feeding the homeless. Show Catholics recovering from grief with the support of their faith. Show Cardinal Law for what he once was – a courageous hero in the Civil Rights movement, when that meant receiving death threats and alienating the powerful. That something so beautiful is so sullied, along with individual victims' pain, is the heart of this tragedy. <br/><br/>I am a lifelong, church-going Catholic. I present my reasons for being Catholic, in spite of everything, in my book ""Save Send Delete."" I salute, not boycott, the Globe's reporting, and films like this. Confession and redemption are gifts we shared with the world."
"PrashunChakraborty","7","37","62","25 February 2016"," A good docu-drama but nothing more
","I liked this film, thought it was a well done solid film. But I am afraid I can't say anything more than that, it is very documentary like which can be it's biggest strength (a very fact driven plot heavy film) or it's biggest weakness (characters feel cold and distant and other than the plot nothing really impresses, also quite bland in the visuals department). However the characters do start to show some life nearing the end of the film but by that time damage is done it can be hard if not impossible for viewers to differentiate between the reporters for nearly one and a half hour of the film, they all suffer from different faces but same objective syndrome and inadequate effort is made to separate one from the another. Also speaking of run-time, this film is a wee bit over two hours long, editing especially in the first half could have made this film a bit crispier. However I did like the accuracy level in the film regarding the cellphones, ads, electronics and the cars used in 2001; a lot of films these days are becoming very careless in this regard. I would compare it to last year's Foxcatcher another fact driven docu-drama film, solidly acted, but nothing special in the direction, editing and cinematography department, I would still recommend it but no way this film deserves a second watch, you can absorb everything there is to get in a single viewing. All in all, a solid well written docu-drama which will have it's time in the ""spotlight"" (pun!) this Oscar season and will become ""oh that movie about pedo priests"" by next year's Oscar season."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","38","65","15 May 2016"," Very relevant and important, but not very good
","""Spotlight"" is an American movie from last year that runs for slightly over 2 hours and was written and directed by Tom McCarthy. It won two Academy Awards earlier this year, including the grand prize for Best Picture. And the reason for this is probably that it is about a really important subject, namely the way it was discovered by a major newspaper that pedophilia was something that existed on a larger scale in the Church, despite many attempts of the latter to keep it disclosed. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams managed Oscar nominations for their supporting performances. I cannot say I agree with either sadly. McAdams played her part well, had a couple good moments, but I don't think it was one of the best of the year in her category. Probably more of a coattail nomination, I remember it was also pretty surprising she got in. Ruffalo's nomination was no surprise, he got in at all the precursors too. But I had sometimes problems with his performance. It seem over-the-top theatrical and it had a touch of one man against the Church at times, which went entirely against the idea of the team collaboratively managing great things. I am usually a fan of Ruffalo and he has good moments here too, but I think a mix of not so good writing and perhaps not the best approach to the role may have hurt the character. Keaton, Tucci, Slattery and Schreiber are pretty much the same, good but not great, but probably on par with the two nominees. It was a team effort and nobody really stood out. Seeing these names now I kinda think it helped McAdams with her nomination that she was the only female from the bunch.<br/><br/>In terms of the entire film, I summarized it appropriately in the title I believe. It is a very important subject and it was a strong cast making this subject work with dignity and professionalism, but I personally felt the heart was missing. And this subject certainly would have deserved to make a more emotional impact in the grand scheme of things than it did on me. The attempts by McCarthy to deliver in terms of that were something that felt rather forced than effective to me. They brought in references to the journalists' private lives and how it impacted them to some extent, but it did not feel too compelling for me to watch these and the victims also did not add as much as I hoped they would. The ending with Keaton's ""Spotlight"" quote was nicely done though. I also liked the way they brought in 9/11 getting in the way of disclosing the events. Overall, I believe this is an important movie that is worth watching mostly because it all happened in reality and because with the Best Picture win, it is probably now the defining film on a very contemporary and tragic occurrence of events. But I still feel it did not make the impact that it could have made and my favorite McCarthy film to this day stays ""The Visitor"". But I recommend ""Spotlight"" too of course. I would say it's nowhere near the best or worst Best Picture Academy Award winners."
"ferguson-6","9","96","184","12 November 2015"," Faith
","Greetings again from the darkness. Faith. A word that easily could have been the title of this gripping and heart-wrenching film. Faith can be defined as trust and belief. Faith can also be defined as religion and ideology. Few things are more devastating than broken faith  the core of this ""based on actual events"" story of The Boston Globe's exposure of rampant child molestation by dozens of Catholic priests, and the systematic cover-up by ""The Church"".<br/><br/>It's challenging to name a movie that is as well-made as this one, while also being as difficult to watch. We know the story  we even know how it snow-balled globally  but the raw emotions of disgust and sheer anger permeate much of our being as we watch it unfold on screen. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, The Visitor) co-wrote the script with Josh Singer (The Fifth Estate) and it's worthy of favorable comparison to other investigative newspaper films like The Insider (1999), Zodiac (2007), and even the granddaddy of them all  All The President's Men (1976).<br/><br/>The opening scene takes place in a 1976 Boston police station. A priest has been accused of molesting a child. Within a couple of minutes we witness the empty promises, the intimidation, and the cover up. So much is conveyed in this brief opener, not the least of which comes courtesy of the ambivalence of the veteran cop as he shrugs it off as 'just another day' in front of an idealistic rookie cop. This is accompanied by Howard Shore's spot-on score, with the best parts featuring only a piano and bass.<br/><br/>Flash forward to 2001 as we meet the investigative journalist team called ""Spotlight"". It's led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his three reporters: Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). They report to Ben Bradlee Jr (John Slattery), whose father was the editor of The Washington Post during the Woodward/Bernstein/Watergate era. New to The Globe is managing editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Unlike the others, Mr. Baron is neither a Boston local nor a Catholic. In fact, we catch him reading Dan Shaughnessy's book ""The Curse of the Bambino"", just so he can get a better feel for the community and its people.<br/><br/>What is most fascinating about the movie is that it focuses on the investigative aspects – just how diligent the reporters were in putting the story together – and how fluid the process was  the story led them, not vice versa. There was no media agenda to ""get"" the church. Instead, the reporters experienced natural shock as each piece of the puzzle was discovered. One of their key sources was a priest-turned-psychologist (voiced by Richard Jenkins) who helped them put scope to the numbers. Another was Phil Saviano (Neal Huff), the leader of a victim's group, who had tried before to provide documentation to the press. Saviano is the perfect example of how someone so passionate about a cause can be viewed with such skepticism  right up to the point when they are proved correct. Three attorneys add perspective to the cover-up. Eric Macleish (Billy Crudup) made a career of settling cases (and silencing victims) for the church. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) is the polar opposite – he fights vigorously to get the victims heard, while Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan) is caught in the middle – settling cases for the church and struggling with his conscience. Other interesting characters include Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, a smooth-talking power-broker for the church, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law – the man at the top who eventually apologized and was rewarded with a high-ranking position at The Vatican.<br/><br/>The film is so well crafted and acted that it features more than a few ""best scenes"". Sacha has a brief encounter with a former priest on his front door stoop. The priest freely admits to molesting kids and his rationalization will certainly deliver chills to most any viewer. Since this is Boston, it makes perfect sense for the reporters to be so distracted by the story, that it supersedes the Red Sox game they are attending at Fenway Park. Being that the investigation lasted well into 2001, it's quite informative to watch a news agency shift directions for the September 11 tragedy, and along with the nation, put all else on hold. Finally, there is a point in the movie where we as viewers have just about had our fill of extreme emotions – we either need to hit something or throw up – and reporter Rezendes comes through with exactly what is needed: an emotional outburst and release of exasperation rivaling anything previously seen on screen. It's a wonderful moment for Ruffalo as an actor, and a peak moment for viewers.<br/><br/>The story hit the front page of The Boston Globe in January 2002. The paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for its superlative investigative journalism. The report vindicated so many who had been taken advantage of, and exposed the colossal arrogance of the church. The innocence of a child vs the power of God. The story broke the faith that so many once held, and started a global (as evidenced by the closing credits) reckoning and awakening that was desperately needed. The film offers a line of dialogue, ""It takes a village to raise a kid  or abuse one."" In other words, it took the often silent actions of so many to allow this despicably evil horror to continue. In a tribute to the newspaper profession, it took a small group of dedicated reporters to pull back a curtain that should never again be shut. Let's have faith in that."

","The awards season may just have found its first forerunner. In a 2015 movie year that has been average at best without any standout films initiating awards conversation, Tom McCarthy's Spotlight rising above the heap to assert itself as one of 2015's best.<br/><br/>With an all-star cast including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup, Spotlight shines a light on a 2001 investigation by The Boston Globe's on the sexual abuse within the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton plays Walter Robinson who leads the Globe's investigative unit with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James). Under a new editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), the team begins to unfold a horrific pattern of child sexual abuse by the church that was muted and covered up by high priced lawyers and payoffs to victim's families. As Walter probes further and further into the events (the setting is after the events the 9/11) the investigation reveals layers and layers of injustice of Catholic Priests that were aided by the highest powers of the church in an effort to keep the story muted.<br/><br/>It all starts with a featured column about Catholic priest John Geoghan who was accused of abusing over 100 boys. A civil suit is filed but the details of the abuse were ordered sealed by the courts. Schrieber's Baron puts the team of reporters on the case and within days the evil that lurked with the sacred rooms of local churches begins to reveal is foul and despicable face.<br/><br/>The investigation goes on for months as the team hits roadblock upon roadblock taking one step forward for every two steps back. But the story eventually breaks and the emotionally exhausted team is eventually able to bring to light one of the more depressing and important stories of the early new century.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was really good in last year's Birdman and named himself many awards and an Academy Award nomination for his part. In Spotlight, he may be even better. Under the direction of Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent), Keaton shines and carries a performance of determination, frustration and redemption that is delivered with precision.<br/><br/>Nods to All the President's Men will be inevitable. But that was a different era. A different movie. Spotlight is fresh and invigorating in its painfully frustrating subject matter. Audiences should leave with a renewed belief that investigative reporting is of monumental importance and that stories such as the one originating in 2001 Massachusetts are still out there clouded in red tape secrecy and muffled whispers. It is painful to watch at times. Trusted bonds between people, children, parents and the institution that promotes the opposite to what it sometimes preaches are disgusting revelations that are brought to the screen with sizzling effects.<br/><br/>The entire cast from top to bottom is perfectly cast. And McCarthy doesn't populate his frames with unnecessary spectacular visuals. Spotlight is instead very straight forward. Focused and driven.<br/><br/>Spotlight will be nominated for Best Picture and Keaton should get a nod for Actor. Ruffalo may also sneak his way onto ballot sheets. But whether Spotlight wins any hardware is unimportant as long as we recognize the importance of films such as these. A few years ago I would guess that 99% of the population knew nothing about the Iran hostage rescue highlighted in Ben Affleck's Argo. Spotlight should have the same effect acting as a docudrama that is both highly entertaining and educational at the same time. It is both a very good film and an important one.<br/><br/>http://theintestinalfortitude.com/"

There's no denying that there have been some wonderful TV/web series in recent years, but I think a film like Spotlight is the refresh button that moviegoers have been looking for. The story is compelling, the acting is unnoticeable, and the script seems to flow the way a real conversation would. The writers and director of this film are the ""Spotlight"" of filmmaking, opening up a sensitive story that people acknowledged but probably couldn't imagine on screen, and they brought it to us in a way where I felt all the emotions of someone finding out the truth for the first time. I watched Spotlight at the Zürich Film Festival and after 2 hours, thought it ended too soon.

"sunraider","7","93","186","13 December 2015"," Solid Film Lacking Dramatic Punch
","This was a solid drama elevated by superior acting from a top-notch cast but I left the theater somewhat underwhelmed. The movie lacked the sort of drama that makes you wonder how the story will end even when you know how the story will end. The main problem is that the Catholic Church just doesn't come across as a particularly forceful adversary. We're told that the Church is so powerful and has kept the abuse hidden for decades, but when a group of reporters actually goes digging they encounter some roadblocks but nothing that gives you the sense that the Church was something to be feared. While I didn't necessarily need Cardinal Law to dispatch some Opus Dei goons to discourage the reporters and the victims, the movie would have been more rewarding if they'd encountered much stronger resistance from the Church, public officials, and their own family and friends."
"JaysonT","6","50","97","28 December 2015"," Compelling Subject, Average Film
","The film Spotlight plays like an average Joe type of movie. There is no inspiring cinematography or unique dialogue floating off the screen. It's a clean cut film about a team of reporters who decide to expose Priests molesting children in Boston- and later, we learn, all over the world.<br/><br/>It takes place in 2001, right when the internet was just starting to replace print journalism as the new way people read their news. As the story opens, we learn that a section of the Boston Globe- the movie's title- is suffering from low ratings and no readers. The new boss that is hired to direct the team asks the Editor of Spotlight, Michael Keaton, how long it will take for the next story to unfold. <br/><br/>""A few months, maybe more."" Keaton says casually. This does not make his boss very enthused. The rest of the team, which includes Mark Ruffalo as an eager reporter, and Rachel McAdams as a bland one - begin digging for clues and interviewing victims of the Priests around town. Other people in town refuse to address the topic. Stanley Tucci, who is very good, eventually lets Ruffalo interview a victim who goes into deep detail on how his molestation took place. It's rather uncomfortable to hear, but necessary. McAdams also has interviews like this, and soon everybody wants the story to release. But then September 11th hits and they decide to wait. And wait longer. <br/><br/>While the subject matter of the movie is very interesting, I found the movie to be an uninspiring showcase of events save some strong performances- Ruffalo and Tucci are the best in show. Keaton is okay but nothing to write home about. And Rachel McAdams has NEVER been so dull. Why she's the only one in Oscar consideration is beyond me; her character lacks any personality other then to speak like a dial tone and be the sole female on the team. She can do better than this. But because the script is dominated by male personalities (and screenwriters), what more do you expect?<br/><br/>Is this the Best Picture of 2015? According to many sources, yes. It's the default, safe choice because allegedly voters aren't going to want to crown far more intriguing movies like The Martian, Mad Max, Brooklyn or Room- to name a few titles I found far more exhilarating. It's an okay attempt to tell this important story about a corrupt justice system and of course the Catholic Church in general. But it's stale when it comes to the artistry. <br/><br/>FINAL GRADE: C"
"Data-1001","Null","28","51","18 January 2016"," Good cast, well-acted, but....
","As several other reviewers have stated here, Spotlight is a ""solid"" film. There is absolutely no fault with the actors, who all acquit themselves very well, and the movie itself never drags.<br/><br/>However, there's really no character in the movie whom the audience can latch onto. It's a terrific ensemble, but the fault, I think, lies in trying to give everyone in the ensemble an equal part in the story. Without making it about one person (whether a reporter or a victim), the emotional impact falls very, very short.<br/><br/>What the viewer is left with is a general notion of, ""It's shocking that went on for so long and the church kept covering it up,"" but zero emotional investment and reaction. Unless you have a personal identification with any of the elements in this story, I think you will remain similarly aloof in regards to this film."
"mgumsley","10","20","35","4 March 2016"," Understated rendition, maximum impact
","Despite its imposing title, Spotlight is an understated movie with a methodical approach that slowly gains momentum. It clearly, confidently shows us how our most precious resource, our children, have been damaged by abuse from catholic priests. This abuse has been prevalent mostly in the United States, but it has occurred wherever there is catholicism, and the church has systematically turned a blind eye to the proceedings. Some children have been driven to suicide by this abuse.<br/><br/>In 2001 The Boston Globe decided to investigate one priest said to be abusing a large number of children, and the ensuing investigation reveals a huge cover up, with the catholic church using its power to frighten away the globe, and lawyers refusing to reveal important knowledge, and most importantly, an ex priest who rehabilitates abused children refusing to speak to the press.<br/><br/>The Globe realises that they are handling one of the most important stories in the history of the newspaper, and their pursuit becomes relentless, leading to a shattering conclusion.<br/><br/>This film scooped best picture at the Oscars and it bears all the hallmarks of the ultimate winner: absolute honesty and integrity in its subject matter, a complicated story simply told and beautifully acted by its committed team of actors. Most of the Spotlight team were catholics by birth and clearly this aided the process, the same applied to the actors, with Ruffalo particularly impressive as a reporter of Portuguese stock. I also liked Stanley Tucci as a lawyer who had dealt with many of the abused children, who was at first reluctant to deal with the Globe, but is won over by their commitment to the story.<br/><br/>Abuse of one kind or another is a daily story in the newspapers these days, when it happened on this scale in a church it is even more shocking. This film lays out the facts in the most humane way possible, and everyone involved deserves credit for this. This really is a film that surely must give some comfort to the families that suffered because of this wicked abuse.<br/><br/>Mary Gumsley"

","I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one. Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this."

Not so much a disappointment a film that doesn't really do anything radical in its sub-genre. Investigative journalism movies all suffer from the same structural problems along these lines: <br/><br/>Journalist A gets hold of a possible lead , gets pulled in to the editors office and is told ""We can't run this"" <br/><br/>Journalist B gets another lead on the same story , gets pulled into the editors office and is told by the editor ""We can't run this"" Journalist A and B work behind the editors back on the story and cut through every red tape obstacle in their path<br/><br/>Journalist c gets another lead on the same story ... you can see where this is heading can't you ? One thing the film does do well is explain to a secular audience the type of metaphysical power a Catholic priest has over a congregation but apart from that the rest of the film is curiously uninvolving and distant and one wonders if the acclaim it is receiving might be down to the subject matter rather than its cinematic credentials <br/><br/>As it stands SPOTLIGHT is yet another slightly unsatisfying film expected to win prestigious prizes . There's no doubt in my mind that the 2016 Oscars will be dominated by THE REVENANT . As with every year there's always a film at the ceremony that ends up close but no cigar where it gets several noms but no Oscar in any category .

How do the journalists expose it? they call up a bunch of guys who said it before, but nobody listened to them. No doubt it's an important story, however I didn't detect any brilliant journalism - this is not All the President's Men, nor is it The Verdict where Paul Newman battled against the church. Spotlight reporters never stray in the dark or risk anything - the story is basically handed to them on a silver platter, and they only verify it. Drama? hell with it. worst of all - No brilliant cinema, no actions, just dialogue about this and that, we hardly get to know the characters outside of work, so we don't care about them. Bottom line is that this horrible case leaves hardly any impact. By the end of the movie you just realize that there have been pedophile priests. Didn't we already know this?

The city of Boston was torn apart by the scandal that had lasted for decades, and according the film, many people worked to shield the Church from the consequences of the scandal. Without the cover-up, the scandal would not have lasted so long. <br/><br/>However well done and easy to follow the story was, it was predictable. Few revelations were made for me. Certainly, it is an important story to tell, and I am glad I saw the film. However, none of the characters lived up to the power of story itself and the actors adding little to its telling. This may be the case of too much story, too little screen time. The film attempted in a couple of cases to make the suffering of the survivors real, but it played like an episode of ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit"" and not like a feature film. It was too small for such a lofty topic. <br/><br/>In the film, they often mentioned that people died, but it seemed unreal. Examples of that were need to bring it home. The film covered too much time without making the connections for the audience. I really want to like this film more, but it fails as cinema in too many ways. It would have made a better Lifetime Channel Drama as it was written. Rating: Matinée<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is good but not great. After a while, Mark Ruffalo's (playing lead reporter Mike Rezendez) pained expression wears thin. Does he have any other look? Not much in this film. Stanley Tucci puts in a good turn as a lawyer working with the survivors, but the rest of the cast is pedestrian.

","Before you consider watching ""Spotlight"", I STRONGLY urge you to think twice. It isn't because I think it's a bad film--it's amazingly good. But it's also a difficult film to watch--particularly if you or someone close to you has been a victim of sexual abuse. I know that in my case, it was particularly tough because I am a retired psychotherapist and used to specialize in working with sexual abuse victims and perpetrators...the latter, which, I think benefit very little from treatment (which is much of the reasons I changed careers).<br/><br/>The story is about not only the discovery of a huge number of pedophile priests in the Boston parish by Boston Globe reporters but the organization's discovery that the problem went all the way to the top. In other words, even the beloved Cardinal Bernard Law KNEW about the many, many victims and yet did nothing to discipline them or restrict their access to more victims. But the film doesn't just talk about so much that we know to be true today but it covers the stop by step process by which the paper began and completed the investigation.<br/><br/>Why did I give the film a 10...particularly since I almost never give films such high scores? Well, the reason is that the folks making the movie really, really cared about the subject matter and getting it right. Instead of focusing on making money with the film and including the usual glitz and glamour, the filmmakers chose instead to emphasize realism above all else. Normal looking actors (such as Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo) are used...and they make efforts to keep them normal looking. Additionally, the film has a relatively slow and deliberate pace--again as they weren't interested in making a pretty or Hollywoodizing the production. Overall, a great film made greater because the folks making it really, really seemed to care and wanted to get it right...which showed great sensitivity for the subject matter and the victims. Great film!"

Just scene after scene of people in varying states of agitation either reading or speaking. Compare this to a movie like Steve Jobs (2015) which is also very dialogue heavy and note all the various ways in which Boyle and crew aid their dialogue through camera movement, interesting angles and shadowing, etc. It makes you realize how thoroughly uninteresting Spotlight is in that particular way.

She, Lombardi, and the Phoenix did the dirty work and the Globe took the credit and is still taking the credit. The rumor, at the time, was that the Globe was bullied by the church into denying that any of the stories published by the Phoenix were true. The Globe became complicit in helping the church keep the story as quiet as possible.

"OttoVonB","5","16","31","19 February 2016"," Oscar-Bait Crumbling Under Its Worth
","Spotlight is based on the true story of a Boston Globe editorial team's efforts to uncover systematic child abuse and abuser protection by the Catholic Church. Hardly fresh news, and a topic that will raise strong emotional reactions, and rightly so. But how does it hold up?<br/><br/>Given the weird emotional volatility surrounding this one, allow me to qualify this review (and its writer): the scandal revisited here is unarguably heinous, as are the many people who took part in perpetuating it. My own feelings about organized religion mean I was only mildly surprised, but then perhaps the subject of the clergy's hypocrisy is worth revisiting, as it has been in entertainment since Moliere's Tartuffe. But this is a film website, the medium is narrative film, and so Spotlight should - and shall, in the longer term - be judged.<br/><br/>This is a film that owes its success and Oscar nominations to its topic and, to a lesser extent, to its ensemble cast. It is also a throw-back to harder-nosed journalism-based films like All The President's Men - a much better, less self-righteous film. The end result however is a bit awkward: first, the structure is wobbly, throwing us in headfirst and assuming perhaps too much familiarity with the events. The character introductions are very rushed, which means it takes more time to build empathy, especially when it comes to the victims. The climax, such as it is, and ensuing denouement are a bit limp culminating in the obligatory white text on black background to tell you succinctly with words what the filmmakers could not achieve with visuals. It makes you wish, as many reviewers have, that this were a documentary.<br/><br/>The cast are uniformly good, with Stanley Tucci and Mark Buffalo the stand-outs, but these are solid, seasoned turns, nothing that cries out ""best performance of the year"". Technical credits are closer to a TV-movie than a major Hollywood release.<br/><br/>I can't give it credit merely for tackling an easy target from such a safe distance, but I would concede more points if it told its story more fluidly and dared to explore some of the more dangerous angles a bit more, such as police collusion, or that one memorable scene where a guilty priest rationalizes what he did in a way that hints at even worse events. Sadly, this chooses to play things way too safe."

","Mmm, might make my top 50 of 2015. It's a perfectly good movie about investigative journalism, and it's interesting to see the process of journalists, but it's extremely pedestrian filmmaking and has like zero insight into the subject at hand (which is the cover-up of priest molestations). Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James play the Spotlight team at the Boston Globe. They're all good, but, except for one big moment with Ruffalo, none of them do anything exceptional. The Globe's new editor, Liev Schreiber (somewhat more interesting, but not much), decides to follow-up on some earlier stories about the subject he thinks are incomplete. The best performance in the film belongs to Stanley Tucci, who plays a lawyer for victims. The second best belongs to Neal Huff as the leader of a victims' organization. Both Huff and Tucci are angry that the Globe is just now getting interested in the story. I think even critics in Boston know that Mad Max: Fury Road is a better film than this. Maybe some day the Spotlight team can uncover that conspiracy."

"FabledGentleman","9","11","20","1 March 2016"," Right in front of our eyes, the most terrible things happen
","I remember when this story broke back in 2002. It quickly became a huge story that spread all around the globe. As unthinkable as it seemed in the beginning, the mountain of evidence that built up, not only in Boston, but the rest of the world, showed everyone that people we trust, people we see as friends and guardians, have sexually abused children by the thousands.<br/><br/>This happens right there, right in front of us. Powerful people know about it, and powerful people help covering it up. Lawyers, police, politicians, journalists, priests, u name it.<br/><br/>It is absolute horror, and a story that needs to be told and understood. For how can this even be possible?. We live in what we call modern societies, where no one is left alone, where everyone has rights, where everyone will get help if needed. But this world did not exist for the children that are victims of this conspiracy.<br/><br/>It is almost ironical that 9/11 happens right in the center of this story, and that the story is about people not paying attention, about people not doing what is needed to seek out the truth, especially to respect the victims of these crimes.<br/><br/>Can conspiracies truly happen on such large scales?. Without ""anyone"" knowing about it?. Yes, it can. And even worse, people that we trust and believe in cover it up, and try to hide the truth.<br/><br/>Thousands upon thousands of children abused, systematically, for years, by hundreds of priests, all over the world. Children. Our children. On our watch.<br/><br/>This is a strong film, actually the best film i have seen this year, with ""The Big Short"" as number two. Which also show how a corrupt system works behind our backs, taking what we own, only to get richer and more powerful themselves.<br/><br/>Who is the system?. It starts to look like our leaders and our masters, our politicians, who we elect, all are a part of a corrupt system, that works together, and that we, normal people are being farmed, so to speak. Is what I'm saying far fetched? I bet more and more people start to understand that this might be true, but to explain how it works, is very very difficult.<br/><br/>The film explains how the Boston globe started out investigating one priest, and then just to reveal more and more cases, more victims, and then connecting child abuse to more and more priest. And as the story grows, the horror becomes real. It is a remarkable script, and the direction is steadfast.<br/><br/>All actors in this film gives rock solid and some really remarkable performances, but my hats off to Mark Ruffalo. Again we see him at the top of his game, he is so good at what he does, i believe every second of what he delivers. Just like in ""Zodiac"" and ""Foxcatcher"" to mention a few.<br/><br/>This movie got Oscar for best motion picture a few days ago, well deserved, and it also got the Oscar for best screenplay. As i also predicted, but not giving best supporting actor to Mark Ruffalo, was not the right decision IMO.<br/><br/>See this movie everyone, it is an outstanding film, with very few flaws. It is a film that grips you the very first minute, and never lets go. It's a story about crimes we could not even dream of, not in the world we live in. And it needs to be told, understood and retold. Again and again and again.<br/><br/>9/10 - Very Good"
"aharmas","5","19","39","26 November 2015"," What's Wrong With This Picture?
","""Spotlight"" is based on one the biggest scandals that has rocked the Catholic church, and just about anything which affects religion and its consequences, is the stuff that fuels the best dramas and performances. Mix children, cover ups, legal maneuvers, with some of the best working today, and you should have a winner, but ""Spotlight"" is a long way from achieving its goal.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is a hundred times better than he was in ""Birdman"", where he looked like has no direction at all. Here he's a conflicted soul who must weigh his working ethics against his personal faith. He, along with his team become part of an investigation that reveals darker truths that they imagine or want to hear. We see stereotype after type make appearances: the eager reporter, the centered editor, the professional lawyer, the loyal follower, the reporter with the big heart, etc. The entire bunch of elements are there, but there is something that throws the whole film out of balance for no matter how horrendous every discovery is, we remain numb, and this is not the result of our shock. It's just the inability of the film makers to connect to either th material or provide that connection to us. <br/><br/>Scorcese's film about Christ's alternate life was one of the most controversial ever, only to culminate in one of the most faith reaffirming moments in cinema. ""All The President's Men"" remains the finest example of newspaper reporting cinema, engaging us with fine performances, a magnificent script, and some of the exciting directing choices for this type of film. That world is dark and threatening, and no matter how many times we see it, we are full participants in the reporters' quest. Redford's and Hoffman's turns are classic. Here, the actors try really hard to save the day, but they have limited material to work with. It's not the nature of the controversy, but the poor adaptation that ends up feeling like we're watching a poorly edited documentary that says a lot but forgets the hideous nature of the problem. We have statistics thrown at us every five minutes, and we are given the token shocking lines and scenes, but with a couple of exceptions they feel empty, hollow.<br/><br/>Ruffalo is wasted, McAdams was way more interesting in ""Morning Glory"" where she was allowed to open her soul. Here she reads her lines, stands where the marks are, but one can sense a little frustration as it's clear she's trying to hard. Keaton is the only one who is able to come up with a semblance of pain and conflict, and Liev is one character that because of his role manages to ring true since he's not given the opportunity to be smothered by bad script.<br/><br/>If you want to feel the emotional power of the story, read the novel where we get closer and deeper in the hell that these incidents were. I was wondering why that annoying and overbearing score kept intruding, and in one of the few moments of quiet, it stops, giving the film more power by its mere absence, only to be ruined a chorus of snoring patrons behind me that had already succumbed to this overlong and uninvolving piece of film."
"bob-the-movie-man","7","10","18","31 January 2016"," All the Paedo-Priest's Men
","""Spotlight"" is the investigative team at the Boston Globe newspaper who focus on 'big' issues that they select to pursue - work that can take many months to come to fruition. Headed up by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton) the rest of his team are Mike (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha (Rachel McAdams) and family man Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). It's 2001 and times they are a changin' at The Globe. New editor Marty Baron (Liev Schrieber) is a workaholic wild duck from Florida with transformation in mind. He sees value in the team pursuing a 'cold' story about a Catholic priest accused of multiple counts of paedophilia, all of which appears to have been quietly 'shushed up' by the church. The investigation progressively uncovers a far more widespread and murkier story that goes on to break as a global scandal for the Catholic church.<br/><br/>This is an important film given its controversial subject matter. And the acting is all top-notch. Michael Keaton feels extremely comfortable in his role as the investigative journalist, delivering one of the most 'goose-bumpy' lines in the film (as seen in the trailer) - ""Which story do you want us to write - because we're writing one of them"". He must have been disappointed not to receive another Best Actor nomination for this.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams both did get the nod for the Supporting Actor/Actress nominations: Ruffalo's performance in particular is stellar, full of earnest passion. But it has to be said that all of the rest of the cast also more than pull their weight, with Liev Schrieber and John Slattery (as sub-editor Ben Bradlee) being very strong and the ever-reliable Stanley Tucci electrifying the screen as the dilligent but cranky lawyer Garabedian. As I write this, the Screen Actors Guild has just awarded ""Spotlight"" the award for the Best Ensemble Cast, and this is well deserved.<br/><br/>The film looks great, with cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi (""The Grey"", ""Silver Linings Playbook"") supported by fantastic lighting and superb editing (also Oscar nominated). It's refreshing that the location filming in Boston doesn't lean on the more 'touristy' shots normally depicted. The persistent and effective piano score is by Howard (""LOTR"") Shore.<br/><br/>So, with all this going for it, I'm heading for a 10-star rating then? Well, actually, no. There is something distinctly missing in the film that was initially difficult to put my finger on. The film bears closest comparison with 1976's Redford/Hoffman classic ""All The President's Men"". And whilst it does compare in some ways (a lot of indecipherable dialogue and a mass of different names being one!) there's a key ingredient missing. While both stories were true, and you KNEW what the outcome was, ""All The President's Men"" still managed to build up an incredible sense of tension of the ""will they, won't they"" kind that is almost completely missing here. Not that there isn't the opportunity: for example, will delays (caused by certain other newsworthy events happening in September of that year) allow ""The Herald"" to break the story first? But no, the opportunity is squandered. A significant twist in the story (not spoiled here) around Keaton's character is also let off like a damp squib on a rainy night. And where was the scene of 'reaction' from the church, led by Boston's Cardinal Law (Len Cariou)? <br/><br/>So the two Oscar nominations I would most have issues with are Best Director (for actor/director Tom McCarthy) and Best Picture: undeniably it's a good film, and you should go and see it, but in my eyes it was an opportunity missed - - it should have been an absolute classic.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"ssjkid97","10","9","16","5 March 2016"," An absolutely brilliant film that will stand the test of time.
","First off, this is an important film. The fact there's such a rampant systemic issue with an organization as large as the Catholic Church is appalling. The issue was known, but Spotlight highlights the story of the brave men and women who had to invest copious amounts of effort just to tell the world about it. This movie is brilliant all across the board: the performances, the cinematography, the story, the dialogue, the direction, and just about everything in-between. If you're Catholic, please understand this movie is NOT an attack on Catholocism, but mainly a film exploiting a systemic issue in the Catholic Church. If anything, Catholics should be more outraged than the rest of us, but I digress. Spotlight is a beautifully realized film with a very obvious amount of blood, sweat and tears put into it. From the geographic accuracy of Boston and other areas around it, to the details of the story, to the portrayals of the characters, Spotlight is a nigh-flawless product that not only excels on a technical level, but is going to have relevance for many generations to come."

One of the elements that was really intriguing is how long it actually takes for this team to compile this particular story. It took them mouths to finish the story, but it does not feel like mouths, cause they make the story they try to compile interesting to watch. Plus we get to know the characters on a personal level without getting too personal. Nothing takes us away from the main focus of the movie.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo gives an impressive performance as Michael Rezendes. He was very intense and passionate and it comes off great, and was a great role for him. He stood out in a very interesting ensemble cast that included Michael Keaton, as the editor of spotlight supporting his reporters as they chase the story and Liev Schreiber, as the new editor and chief of the Globe, an outsider who saw a story that the others too close to home, did not. They're other great performances from Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci as well. <br/><br/>Spotlight also makes Boston itself a charter, by using scenery to show what a small town it can be and how much of an influence the Catholic Church has on it. <br/><br/>It hits all the right buttons without trying, that's a sign of good story telling. It brings you into a compelling story, well acted by a great cast that did great things together."
"guchrisc","Null","8","14","29 February 2016"," ""6% act out""
","'Spotlight' has just won the 2016 Oscar for Best Picture, and deservedly so. However, 'Concussion' and 'Trumbo' did not even get nominated, though Bryan Cranston was nominated for his role in 'Trumbo' playing the eponymous communist screen-writer blacklisted by Hollywood. Will Smith playing the doctor who exposed the concussion scandal in American Football, like his film, is sorely neglected, but that is another story. What all three films have in common, is a story of powerful groups exerting their power at the expense of individuals. This seems a common theme and all three films are worthy products telling true stories.<br/><br/>'Sleepers' (1996) told a tale of child sexual abuse. The authenticity of that film is much disputed. 'Spotlight', by contrast, is a factually true story, but one that reminded this reviewer of the earlier film because they both deal with the same subject matter. It is interesting to note that Billy Crudup appears in both films.<br/><br/>A brief opening sequence, informs the viewer that the subject matter of the film is child sexual abuse committed by Boston priests, as is also quite clear from the trailers. The film then has a pleasant party scene at the Boston Globe newspaper marking the retirement of the newspaper editor. The film moves quickly into gear as the new editor, an outsider from Florida, played by Liev Schrieber, arrives. He meets Michael Keaton who plays the head of the Spotlight team. The editor is informed that Spotlight do long-term investigations, though at the moment they are trolling for work. The editor then tasks them with exploring and expanding on a smaller story of a priest guilty of child sexual abuse.<br/><br/>The film that follows is almost totally concentrated on the ensuing investigation. We viewers see the team investigate the matter and realize, through the paper-trail, that this is not just about one priest, and that it is also about a cover-up too. Of the Spotlight team, Michael Keaton plays the cool-headed and practical manager, Mark Ruffalo plays a passionate and obsessed character, and Brian d'Arcy James's role is somewhat similar. Both are concerned with how close the issue is to them. We see this also in Rachel McAdams role too, though she is used more to show the drudgery of the investigation; firstly, as she knock doors, later, as she conducts interviews. All thespians convince in their authentic playing of newspaper investigators, appalled at the story that unfurled, committed to exposing the truth. John Slattery and Liev Schrieber, in smaller parts, play well their roles as overseers.<br/><br/>Neal Huff and Michael Cyril Creighton are very impressive in their scenes as they explain grooming and child sexual abuse. It should be said that it is these references, and this subject matter, that gives this film a rating of 15 in the UK. It should also be said that these issues are discussed, but not shown.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schrieber seem to have gone to some trouble to adopt distinctive accents that surprised this reviewer when first hearing them. Thankfully, the distinctive voice of Stanley Tucci was easily spotted, as he himself was not. He plays a campaigning lawyer who looks a little worn-down and unkempt, perhaps even in need of a haircut, which is why he is a little difficult to spot. Billy Crudup and Jamey Sheridan also play lawyers and Paul Guilfoyle also has a small role.<br/><br/>Since the birth of Jesus Christ two thousand years ago, for the first one and a half thousand years there was only one Christian religion. In the last five hundred years the Catholic, or Roman Catholic, Church has still been the premier Christian religion. The church proclaims itself a church of sinners, but it's adherents were shocked to discover that so many, had sinned so much. For many, discovering the extent of sin within, to be precise; the extent of child sexual abuse by priests, and the cover-up by the hierarchy, has sickened them to their stomachs, and produced a crisis of faith. This is shown well in this film.<br/><br/>Although a solid film about a newspaper investigation, this is also a sombre film, but one with a spot or two of moments of black humour, surprisingly. It tells the tale of the exposure of the cover-up of child sexual abuse in Boston by priests, a story that the powerful church tried to keep the lid on, but that lid was lifted, and the story went around the world.<br/><br/>The story of powerful institutions using their powers at the expense of individuals, and then that power being broken by brave individuals, is one that often makes good material for a movie. This is certainly the case with regard to 'Spotlight'. The same themes are also at play in the excellent 'Concussion' and 'Trumbo', both of which deal with a single individual against a powerful institution, and both of which are worth seeing too. Those who like a good gangster film should know that the recent 'Black Mass' tells the story of the gangster Whitey Bulger, who was exposed as a protected FBI informer by the Spotlight investigation team of the Boston Globe.<br/><br/>'Spotlight', which also won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, tells an important and true story, that is one that is well worth seeing. 10/10."

It's a film with hardly a misstep or false note. Eschewing the histrionics and emotional manipulation that other films would have brought to the same material, ""Spotlight"" understands that the screenplay and actors hired to interpret it are strong enough without any emotional embellishment, and the film is far more powerful because of the understated approach. The entire cast is at top form, with Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and John Slattery as the standouts (Ruffalo in particular delivers an impassioned soliloquy so emotionally powerful that it nearly brought me to tears), but this is an ensemble film with actors working together like a well-oiled machine, and it seems unfair to single out any one when they're all so good.<br/><br/>Director Tom McCarthy is most known for his work to date on the Pixar movies, and you couldn't find a movie further away from the colorful palettes and winsome stories of the Pixar world. But he proves himself a versatile filmmaker, one who knows how to handle extremely varied material. It would be easy to discount the direction of this film, but one should not underestimate how difficult directing a film that consists almost entirely of conversations would be. And when one also considers that part of good directing is getting good performances from actors, McCarthy's goes down as some of the best directing of the year.<br/><br/>So far, this and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" are my two favorite movies of the year. How's that for opposite sides of the movie spectrum?<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"Quinoa1984","10","13","26","7 December 2015"," script and performances is all, and that's enough
","With a movie like Spotlight, the one thing you can say against it is that it's not particularly showy. We won't remember the movie this year let alone years from now for its cinematography (though perhaps its lack of being 'showy' or really darkly lit or stark in contrasts is its own visual statement). This isn't to say that Tom McCarthy doesn't so his job as a director in an elemental sense; he does get some good shots (there's one where the camera simply backs up as a crucial statistic is laid out by the ex-priest turned therapist who gives the Spotlight reporters what they need to move forward into the bigger picture of their story, and it works beautifully). But what he does is put together the best cast possible - Keaton, Ruffalo, John Slattery (as Ben Bradley Jr, which I'll touch on in a moment), Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, and even Richard Jenkins as the voice on the phone - and makes sure that they're all on a level where no one ever upstages another. The story is all here.<br/><br/>It's a subject that carries with it some exposition - you got to know the facts of this case, and there are times you get a lot of information, not unlike say Law & Order SVU - but it's all in service of a narrative that makes it welcome and exciting. This is about what it means to craft a story and to get it right, but what 'right' even means in the grand scheme of things, which here being the sort of Court of Public Opinion. If you don't get the facts right, or have enough 'deep cover' to back things up, things can be poked through, especially in the context of this story being in Boston and the Catholic church. While pederasty wasn't unheard of in 2001 with the priests and organization in general, it was seen as more-so isolated incidents. The key to Spotlight being so compelling is to draw the viewer in the same way the reporters do: the stakes here are so high.<br/><br/>It's easy to compare this to All the President's Men for a number of reasons; one thing I saw as an interesting coincidence was two generations of Ben Bradleys here, with Robards as the Senior in 'Presidents' at the Washington Post and the Junior played by a no-BS Slattery, similar level of sarcasm in the midst of professional talk by the way. What it comes down to is how much do performances and the search for information against a super-powerful institution (one the branches of government and conspiracy of the Executive level, the other an institution that ""thinks in centuries"" as notes in the film) elevate the material? I think just as with the Pakula film, this does it exceptionally well. While it may not have the same sort of effect of that 76 film (no Gordon Willis, as I said it's not a particularly stand-out film as far as the look), Spotlight really has some deep things to address about faith and trust, and it doesn't shy away from making these reporters real people in the midst of their search. <br/><br/>Ruffalo and Keaton may stand out the most for people, chiefly as they get (I think, I could be wrong) more impactful screen time as they are each looking for precious information (the former with his connection to Tucci's lawyer, who handles cases involving pedophilia and the church and in the screwed up legal system, the latter with the 'source' he has and his own background growing up in Boston and the Church). But I was very impressed by the screen time being evenly laid out; Ruffalo and Keaton may get the Oscar attention, but Schreiber has a number of remarkable scenes, such as an awkward/polite conversation with Cardinal Law, and McAdams as she knocks on doors and has the most startling scene involving a conversation with a priest who reveals, remarkably, candidly, that he didn't really see what he did as rape (he should know, he says, as he was raped).<br/><br/>If you like seeing a cast keeping things grounded and realistic, and yet have moments of powerful drama and conflict that cuts at a lot of corners of society (especially, also, involving class as this is also a class issue involving low-income families having kids who were molested/raped), this is a film to see. It doesn't exactly leave you feeling all that 'good', but it does celebrate what journalism can do in an unfussy, unsentimental way that is refreshing too."

","As we know Spotlight pulled off something of an upset at the 2015 Oscars by winning for Best Picture. It might have not been my first choice, still it is a good film dealing with a most distasteful subject, molestation by Roman Catholic priests of minors.<br/><br/>For centuries the priesthood has been a refuge for closeted gay men who were then never questioned about their lack of interest in women. Then along came Stonewall and gay liberation and chances undreamed of for gays to live openly. So there was no longer a need to enter the priesthood. That caused a lot of vacancies and to this day the Catholic Church has never filled all the openings.<br/><br/>Secondly celibacy is just one insane requirement. Back 1000 years ago when it was introduced we never knew about libidos and sex drives. For some with low or no sex drive it's no big deal. But some of us have needs. Put it together you have a recipe for pedophilia.<br/><br/>Not that this wasn't known. Back in my younger days I knew a family that numbered a priest among a few brothers. This individual while an ordained priest ran for NYS Assembly. But one day we heard he was transferred to a new parish on an Indian reservation in the southwest. That was a favorite dumping ground for priests from the New York Archdiocese who got caught and were in too many parishes. Cardinal Francis J. Spellman's favorite exile place. <br/><br/>Maybe Cardinal Bernard Law if he knew about what Spellman did he might have put off what happened to his Archdiocese in Boston. This all started with the expose of one Father John Geoghan who was transferred to many parishes in the Archdiocese after it got out he had a taste for young boys. <br/><br/>What the team of investigative reporters from the Boston Globe did was tell the wider story and the film is their search for evidence. The film is always compared with All The President's Men and how the Washington Post broke the Watergate story. One big difference is that a couple of high powered box office names in Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford led the cast. No big names in Spotlight's cast, just a well assembled ensemble. <br/><br/>In fact two of the cast Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams were nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. You might well ask the question, who were they in support of?<br/><br/>Spotlight is a good film, not a great one, but it has a few moments. One that is unforgettable for me is Rachel McAdams on the trail of her story going to the house of a former priest. If there were an award for brief significant performances category than Richard O'Rourke as the defrocked priest would have got it for that year. Watch Rachel's reactions as O'Rourke who is so clearly not emotionally developed starts talking of his experiences. Then he's cut off from McAdams by his sister played by Nancy Carroll who is protective of her child like brother and orders her off the premises. That scene told you a lot about many who went into that vocation.<br/><br/>I don't think the great film on the subject has yet been made. But Spotlight will do until it is."

","Wow, just took me to January 1st, 2016 to see my only 10 star film of 2015.<br/><br/>This movie is amazing and captivating from the first frame. I was literally that hooked from the second the movie opened. I wanted to know more, see more, learn more. The cast was incredible, believable, real and had wonderful chemistry. In fact, not one moment passed when I didn't feel like I was a part of this real story and sitting alongside all of them. <br/><br/>I could go on and on, and will. The story was fascinating, motivating, deep and intriguing. These warriors, these journalists, weren't just doing their job, they 100% believed in it and wanted to correct their own mistakes as well as the countless other demons within the catholic church.<br/><br/>This story needed to be told back in the early 2000s, as it does need revisiting now. I know the catholic church truly wanted to sweep this under the rug once (or make that for DECADES,) but they also wanted their poor decisions, to put it mildly, to be forgotten in the years following. It shouldn't. Their horrendous crimes and cover-ups should never be removed from our memory. Forever, the church should be remembered for their terrible sins.<br/><br/>Guess it helps I'm not catholic. And I might be getting a little emotional. The movie, about the Boston Globe's small Spotlight investigation team unraveling decades of deceit within the catholic church in which they were hiding/relocating pedophiles, was so great and wonderfully simple on so many levels. From acting to direction to pacingthat alone usually irks me, but not once in the over two hour runtime was I not on the edge of my seat. That says a lot about a movie that has no action or high Hollywood dramatic scenes. (Well, there was one speech by the fantastic Mark Ruffalo and I envisioned that scene being shown at the Oscars for his inevitable nomination, but it didn't feel fake or forced.)<br/><br/>From a cinema lover's viewpoint, this should be seen on how much they got right. From the normal audience's POV, it should be seen to remind us: if the big entity (the church) did it once, watch for it again, if not currently. And from the victim's corner, they should cherish these heroes as the surviving Holocaust members and family viewed Schindler's List. <br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: On a personal level, it helps I love actual newspaper/investigating movies. Another one of my favorites also starred the brilliant Michael Keaton: The Paper. I already miss these days when real journalism happened not just 98% of the internet crap. So, that all said, this movie might be slow to most people (hell, they showed the extent of the ""inter-net"" back in 2001 with a full billboard in the Boston Globe's own parking lot for AOL) but to me, to see real people doing real journalism was and always will be fascinating to me."

","Note that this movie will get less than 10 stars because Catholics will vote it down to minimize getting the truth out. The movie shows how hard Catholics try to hide the truth.<br/><br/>The movie (and actors) do a great job of telling the story of Boston, and the influence and awesome power the Catholic church once had in the city.<br/><br/>It then shows how they tried, in 100% of cases, to hide and move known pedophile priests, and they knew about it.<br/><br/>One thing they don't mention is that this is enabled by something called ""Catholic confession"", in which a priest can confess his child rape to another and get completely forgiven in 15 minutes (in defiance of Jesus in Matt 18:6, by the way).<br/><br/>However, now the new priest that heard the confession knows he can get away with it. This caused pedophilia to run rampant through Boston and the Catholic church, where there were at least 249 known pedophile priests, and over 1,000 victims.<br/><br/>However, there were probably at least 1,000 priests that heard these ""confessions"" each time any of the 249 raped a child, so the institution knew, and still does and hides it today.<br/><br/>It is chilling to hear the interview with Fr Pacquin, who readily admits to the Globe that he molested a bunch of children, as if it was no big deal because all the other priests were doing it, too.<br/><br/>The movie shows how hard it was to get the truth out of the Catholic church, which intentionally protected these pedophiles, moving them to new locations where their evil wouldn't be known, never warning the new community, and sometimes not even warning the leaders.<br/><br/>This pedophile protection came from the top, from Cardinal Law, and was passed throughout the hierarchy, which worked like the Nazis, just doing what they were told, despite Jesus in Matt 18:6-14.<br/><br/>You can feel the awesome power of the Catholic church, which they use at every opportunity to get away with evil, and never to help children. The characters in the movie are sickened by the truth, and the intention of the organization to protect every child rapist, with no regard for the victims.<br/><br/>This is an organized crime movie."

","By no means movies awarded the best movie academy award are the best out there. That's for sure. Neither Miss Universe is the ""most beautiful woman in the world"" etc.<br/><br/>I will probably fail to remember which movies won the Oscar the last 3 decades. Some of them are totally forgettable and makes you wonder if they were deserving a nomination in the first place. In my opinion ""the best picture of the year"" should be a game changing movie, that leaves you speechless while you are watching it and make a permanent imprint in your mind and soul.<br/><br/>Spotlight won the Oscar for the best movie of 2016. Was it worth it? In my opinion faaaar from it. Was it a bad movie? Of course not. But it is far from being great. It has adequate performances from the well known leads. A bright photography, which for me is always a plus, but...<br/><br/>Of course the premise touches a sensitive subject but it doesn't make an impact to the audience. You will hear: the number is not 13 it's more than that like 20 or even 90, and that is supposed to have an impact to the viewers, about the scale of child molestation from priests and a possible church cover-up, but it really hasn't. You hear 2-3 testimonies but you don't see the act, not even in the form of a flashback. So, for that, it is not effective.<br/><br/>I read some reviews praising how ""controlled"" this movie is. In my opinion that was a mistake for that subject. The testimonies weren't enough to draw a picture about the problem. Also there is no actual heroes here. The reporters just doing their work and the paper had the opportunity to do something years ago but let it slide.<br/><br/>Overall: I cannot understand how this movie is considered as the best of 2016. It is a mild ride. No surprises no heroes. A little bit on the boring side in its 2 hours 7 minutes duration. Nothing extraordinary. Just adequate as a film and far less than that as a statement against a serious problem of our societies."
"Karl Self","7","5","8","26 March 2016"," Lecture me
","It's not that this isn't a star-studded gripping movie about an important subject. It just wasn't best picture to me (for which it won an Academy Award, along with best screenplay). For that it played it far too safely. Much of the movie reminded me of the 1994 ""The Paper"", also headlined by Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>In a way, The Paper was better because it was entirely fictional and therefore could go all-out. ""Spotlight"" (named after the editorial crew of the Boston Globe that uncovered the scandal) kinda had to try to fit the facts. For example, the journalists seemed to do relatively little uncovering themselves, for that they relied heavily on attorneys, experts and interest groups, and at times they even blocked the investigation. Boston is described as a type of mafia territory where you can't escape the Catholic church, except for when you're Jewish or Armenian. That seemed a pretty shallow explanation.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams didn't seemed too much of a Hollywood blonde to fit into the newspaper. Have you ever seen newspaper journalists? There's a reason they don't work in front of the camera.<br/><br/>For me, I'd rather have a great movie about a trifling subject than a good movie about an important subject.

","For me this film was beautifully tragic; by this I mean it was a fantastically acted film and gripping; but I'm disgusted and mortified that it actually happened.<br/><br/>It was good that the film focused on how the conspiracy into the abuse was covered up; for me it was a preference than focusing on the victims and bringing any more agony to them. It brought a tear to my eye to know the depths that this went on (and probably still does) and the number of victims that were involved. As someone who has a criminology degree with a focus on child abuse this film was particularly poignant. I was appalled at the end to see that the cardinal for Boston was moved to a high ranked job in the Vatican; when it was clear from scenes and evidence brought up in the film that he was aware. The end provides a list of places where it has been uncovered; this is heartbreaking. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was fantastic in this film, however, for me the stand it performance was from Michael Keaton as the 'Spotlight' team editor. <br/><br/>For me it was first 10/10 of the year (2016)"

","You spotlight up my life, you give me hope, to carry on... Sorry to get all Debbie Booneish on you in my intro on my review of the spectacular movie ""Spotlight"". Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is shaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why not? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of its expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The Boston Globe's investigative ""Spotlight"" department shined on unveiling this disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting performances from the actors playing the ""spotlight"" write players; including Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral Matt Carroll, and the ""Birdman"" himself Michael Keaton as the group's leader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but all should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting. Other fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel Mitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty Baron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will be very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting Ensemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer had all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering an uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists as literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was their greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they were investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something like that? Anyways, I pray that ""Spotlight' receives many Oscar nominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then share the ""Spotlight"". ***** Excellent"

","By coincidence I watched this film only a week after listening to the editor in chief of Huffington Post UK say that authentic writing cannot come from paid journalists, which is why they do not pay their writers (although Adriana Huffington seemed fine with the millions she got when she sold the website). This stuck in my mind when watching this very fine drama about how the Boston Globe reporters uncovered and exposed a mass cover-up of abuse within the Catholic Church. Also in my mind was a sense of disbelief that this true story is not too much more than a decade old – the mass abuse of children by Catholic Priests now just seems such a known thing now that it is hard to imagine a time when it wasn't.<br/><br/>Perhaps because this is so well known, the film is compelling because it focuses on the story of the story, focusing on the journalism. This gives the film the challenge that in terms of action it is mostly people typing, people on the phone, and lots of talking. This it manages really well, building a compelling but robust drama that builds well and takes the viewer along with it. The subject matter means that the emotional side is not left behind either, and the film deftly reminds us of the people (not just the facts) in ways that are natural and integrated, not sentimental or manipulative.<br/><br/>McCarthy directs with professional control, and standards are high – mostly noticeably in the casting. It is not easy to point out one lead, because so many famous faces are here, and all of them do their job in a way that integrates with the rest – there are no really showing moments, no moments where you feel someone is pushing for an Oscar; it is a real ensemble piece, with too many good turns to start to name them all. The end result is that strong writing, and respect for the process of journalism, combines with the importance of the true story and the strong delivery of all aspects to produce an engaging story which carries emotional and professional weight."

","Everyone needs to see Spotlight. The writing, direction and acting are all flawless. The story is totally engrossing.<br/><br/>I never quite 'got' why the courts and the media are now going after the Catholic Church hierarchy, rather than going after the pedophile priests. This movie answers that question.<br/><br/>What it doesn't answer is why the Church hierarchy didn't just de- frock the pedophile priests, rather than move them from parish to parish. Kicking them out would have STOPPED the abuse rather than just MANAGING the abuse. It would have sent a message to other pedophile priests and actually done something to fix the problem rather than perpetuate it. <br/><br/>The other question I have is this: the vast majority of people in all churches and all religions are good people, doing good work with good intentions. How could Catholic Church hierarchy have allowed the pedophile priests to remain in the Church when they knew that children were being abused. How could they have allowed the children. How?"

","Chances are Spotlight will walk home with Best Picture of The Year at the Oscars. I'm calling it now. I was very excited to see it because I love Michael Keaton and last year's Birdman was so bizarre. Plus this seemed to be the type of film that could only be great with a great cast and an incredible, disturbing and important subject matter. Spotlight is fascinating. It's at least as good as Trumbo was but the problem with this and Trumbo is that both films were just good. Spotlight is based on the horrifying story of a team of reporters at the Boston Globe who single handedly uncover one of the biggest cover-ups in history of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. It's interesting, it's well acted but it's far from great. The pace is good, nothing gets in the way of the main story and there are strong performances from an ensemble cast. No one really ""stars"" in the film but rather everyone works at driving the important story. I felt like from an entertainment perspective it wasn't necessarily thrilling but it does tell the story decently. To me a Best Picture nominee should have all their ducks in a row and Spotlight doesn't really fit that bill for me being just ""good."" <br/><br/>Their is no real ""star"" in Spotlight because it's an ensemble cast. And despite the big names, no one really stands out because it's not a character driven story really. Still Michael Keaton (who has always been a favourite of mine) brings his usual style and chemistry to the picture and helps properly guide it. I think he gives the best performance even if it is subtle. Rachel McAdams is fantastic in general. I always enjoy her but her performance in this is barely existent and the fact she got an Oscar nomination seems ludicrous. But we all know this can be the case with Oscars. She is background character in this film. Mark Ruffalo is decent and shows a lot of emotion compared to some other characters. Liev Schrieber is also good but a role that is far too small much like Ruffalo's. John Slattery is always a good addition for a character actor but once again, too small of a role. Honestly, everyone else is even smaller roles including Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup who could have used more screen time. I think the film could have been far more effective if some of the major players have been given more development.<br/><br/>It's hard to speak bad of a film that has received so many nominations and is the favourite it win the Best Picture Oscar but I feel like so far the nominations I've seen this year have been sub-par with the exception of Mad Max. I tend to think there is usually some great gems on the Best Picture list but Spotlight doesn't fill those shoes. Tom McCarthy isn't a well versed director and his previous film was one of the most made-fun of (Adam Sandler's The Cobbler) so how did he end up directing this and why does everything think it's ""so great?"" I mean Spotlight was good, it's a very important story but a ""great picture?"" No not even close. I don't know what the critics see in it but Spotlight is average and watchable but won't floor anyone, it certainly didn't floor me. 7/10"

It rightly shock the church to its core. Social Media made this possible and the cover up impossible to continue, one of the places where this started was the Boston Globe, who started investigating the story with its 'Spotlight' team, a group within the paper that investigate special interest stories. Led by Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton, first rate here as always) his small team take on the task full time only to have it temporarily delayed by the events of 9 / 11. But Robinson and his team are persistent and the more bureaucracy they come up against that seems determined to sweep things under the rug the more persistent they get until the bough breaks and final the cradle falls, leading to law suits world wide through out the church.<br/><br/>Cinema was made for films like these, not only is this film damn good, its probably one of the most important films to be made of the last decade and if its overlooked at the Oscars this will be nothing short of criminal. All the cast are first rate here and entirely convincing, from Rachel McAdams as the caring reporter with a heart, to Stanley Tucci's diligent yet suspicious lawyer whose all too aware of how fickle the loyalty of a reporter can be. Jamey Sheridan and Billy Crudup are just the right side of bent but it is Mark Ruffalo in his portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes who take the acting honors here. His impassioned outburst must have resonated with many victims who were brave enough to watch the film when he cries out 'Why not now, what are we waiting for? We have to nail these bastards.' - Never before has a greater crime been committed against such a large number of innocent minors and all in the same of God. Watching the film makes me feel that the Church world wide should pay back every cent to the hell they put those people through.

The story itself is engaging to start with but the screenplay, direction, and acting all come together flawlessly to create an incredibly powerful and emotional film. By the time the end credits roll, the film has landed such a powerful and lingering punch that the events portrayed almost seem surreal. This is most definitely a film that will not be forgotten soon.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch with everyone from Michael Keaton to Mark Ruffalo to Rachel McAdams giving possibly the performances of their careers, respectively. This is one of the best ensembles of the year. Even those who didn't have as much screen-time like Liev Schriber, Stanler Tucci, and John Slattery shine when their time is given.<br/><br/>Overall, Spotlight is an exceptional film that will most likely receive some major nominations come awards season. The leading and supporting cast all bring their A games as well as director Tom McCarthy. This is a movie you most definitely do not want to miss.<br/><br/>""It takes a village to raise them. It takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it."""
"SillyPuddy","2","21","49","26 January 2016"," Hollywood being Hollywood
","Yet another film with big name actors playing journalists. Same clichés in far superior films such as All The President's Men (ATPM); everything that worked in that film did not work for this one (IMHO). The only two characters that didn't annoy me were played by Tucci and Schriever (sp). I see this material and subject better suited as a documentary piece on Dateline and 20/20. If it had to be a film then I think casting lesser/unknown actors would deliver more of an impact and remove the preconceived notions and biases of the bigger names involved here. Ron Slattery is an old hat at playing the upper management type and is no different here..Michael Keaton plays another manager who gets to sit in an office (did they really need him to do this?). Rachel McAdams gets another shot at being a serious reporter (State of Play) while being stripped of the charm and freshness she brought in Wedding Crashers, Morning Glory. We are treated to Mark Ruffalo running to the office (deep, riveting stuff). Then we get to watch him in the waiting room of a law office until he takes initiative to talk to the lawyer (another reference to ATPM). To me it distracts from a really important subject and has Hollywood stamped all over it. Best Picture? Something tells me it was a foregone conclusion that when this was released it would be nominated, regardless of merit."

","After seeing all of the best picture nominees this year, I have to say this is my least favorite. It's a good movie, that's for sure, but I wasn't really blown away by it.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly well written and especially acted (I want to point out Mark Rufallo and Liev Schreiber) and the story was very interesting. But still, when I finished watching the movie, I just didn't have that special feeling I get when I watch a great movie. It's not boring at all and it's not afraid to go into details, it's very realistic and sometimes it even feels like you are watching something real happen. This did happen and at some parts you really feel like you are watching that and not the movie and also some parts are really messed up. It's never shown, bit you are shocked just by characters talking about it which is great. But I just didn't find myself so invested in the story.<br/><br/>It's a very well done movie, but to me it feels like something is missing and till the end of the movie, I wasn't that interested anymore, but I think many people will like this movie."

It's based on the true events of a group of reporters that investigates the cases of sexual abuse of priests against children's in the 80's. This movie shows how corrupt even the most ""sacred intuition"" can be and how blinded people can be for their own benefit, or defending what they believe to be correct, putting aside the harm they are making. McCarthy made an excellent direction that can be seen even in the little meanings that are shown in the transition scenes.

","Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' is the Finest Film on Journalism since All The President's Men. No Kidding. This is a fierce, powerful & unforgettable film, that brings a true-story to life. With an Ensemble that delivers like never before, A Screenplay so strong you can't move & Directed with such command, 'Spotlight' is a major achievement from every corner of filmmaking.<br/><br/>'Spotlight' is The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.<br/><br/>The harshest aspect of 'Spotlight' is, that its based on a True-Story. A horrifyingly shocking one. But this is a heroic story about those who went against the church & exposed its demonic priests. Its a challenging, undeniable story, where justice is eventually served to those who deserve nothing but pure punishment. <br/><br/>'Spotlight' works from start to end. McCarthy and Josh Singer's Screenplay is powerful, as disturbing as it is. The Writing refuses to slow-down & the narrative is so engrossing, you can't move from your seat. You watch the heroes uncover a regrettable chapter of human history & the approach in the narrative, is no-holds-barred. Its non-stop, high-powered Drama. <br/><br/>McCarthy's Direction is defines Command. The Director is in top-form & 'Spotlight' is his finest effort to date. No two options on that!

Howard Shore's score is perfect. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: 'Spotlight' boasts an ensemble, who are at the peak of their powers. Michael Keaton is astonishing, delivering a yet another power-packed, classy performance. If you thought Birdman was the best he could've ever done, watch 'Spotlight'.

"LloydBayer","10","4","6","17 December 2015"," Impeccably written and crafted, Spotlight is a first class drama and a standout for 2015.
","If I am allowed just five words to describe Spotlight, those words would be Stellar, Scandalous, Stupendous, Spectacular and Sensational. But even these words can't afford enough praise for a visceral film about honest and instinctive journalists devoted to pursuing truth in the interest of justice.<br/><br/>These journalists are a crack team of investigative reporters assigned to the titular arm of the Boston Globe. Led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), with newshounds Michael Rezendez (Mark Ruffalo) and Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), the team goes to work when new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) suggests a closer look at sexual abuse allegations in Boston's predominantly Irish-catholic population. Through exhaustive interviews and investigations, the Spotlight team goes from isolating ""bad apple"" priests in Boston, to indifference in the Massachusetts law enforcement and all the way up to the Vatican. What the team finds is not only the biggest cover-up by the Catholic Church but equally shocking is the fact that documents proving the cover-up existed all along while no one did anything about it. And even worse is the revelation of not just a flaw in the system, but a ""phenomenon"" all over the world. <br/><br/>Based on actual events in 2001, co-writer and director Tom McCarthy exerts restrained precision on how this original story is told. Although rated 18+, McCarthy avoids visual reenactment of these abuses but still brings out the pain and trauma of victims through interviews with the team. Just hearing their ordeal is as gut-wrenching as having to see the act. They are now adults, but when they describe what was done to them, they cry like babies, like when you take something away from a baby. One extraordinary scene has Sacha interviewing a retired priest. You can almost feel the lump in her throat when she asks him if he ever molested a child. The smiling priest casually replies that he ""fooled around a bit"" before disclosing that he himself was raped as a child by another priest. Another scene has a juvenile choir singing Silent Night. Almost instinctively, you wonder if those kids have been touched. McCarthy has a few of these chilling moments to reiterate just how important this film is, but keeps it simple to follow despite a blistering pace.<br/><br/>From cluttered newsroom desks to locations around Boston, Spotlight feels highly authentic in narration, detail and performance. At a time when major newspapers were on the decline, the film captures the anxiety of these reporters, their fear of being made redundant by the internet boom, competition from other newspapers, hence why they must remain the best at what they do. As an example of detail, McCarthy even uses the 9/11 attacks as an event that threatens to shut down the Church scandal, but the team's focus remains undeterred. And so do the ensemble cast. Keaton, especially after his comeback in last year's Birdman, is definitely here to stay. But it is Ruffalo that takes center stage as a relentless and inquisitive reporter married to the job. From hustling his way between courthouses and lawyers for and against Spotlight (Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup) and accessing restricted information, Ruffalo is at his outstanding best. There's another great scene when his character flares up in frustration. For a second I thought he would rip through his clothes and turn into an angry green giant. <br/><br/>Casting and delivery, along with an intelligent and impeccably written story makes Spotlight a standout for 2015 and a first class film at that. Altogether, it's a good old fashioned drama celebrating good old fashioned journalism. Just as gallant as the pursuit of truth, the film too ends up pure and absolute. And the five words I used to describe this film? I'd also trade them for a Star each."
"walion","10","7","13","5 March 2016"," 4 Journalists uncover the maybe darkest secret of the Chatolic Church.
","I was deeply affected after watching Tom McCarthy's based-on-a-true-story movie 'Spotlight'. After I left the cinema hall in my town I felt some kind of unease inside me. This feeling was provoked not only by the fact that the movie is based on a terrifying true story but also by how the actors accomplished to bring this story to life with ravishing performances from Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes), Michael Keaton (Walter 'Robby' Robinson), Rachel McAdams (Sacha Pfeiffer) and Brian d'Arcy James (Matt Carroll).<br/><br/>'Spotlight' follows the story of an investigation, conducted by the team 'Spotlight', working for the daily newspaper - Boston Globe. The team of 4 investigating journalists brings to light a 30-year-old secret that has its roots deeply in the Chatolic Church hierarchy. A story, about child molestation, which nobody can be indifferent to. Most of the molested back then kids - 30 years later with kids of their own, had been through many obstacles due to the ghastly immoral act. Some of them had taken the path of the syringe and drugs. Others had gone crazy and schizophrenic and the other part had killed themselves due to maybe the embarrassment they had to live with for the rest of their lives afterward.<br/><br/>Most of the kids, who were molested would not talk about the act, because they were in some way petted by the priests and were too scared and too abashed to talk with somebody about this. Tom McCarthy's 'Spotlight' shows us the importance of the investigating journalist's work and also that they have the power to unfold great mysteries to the public no matter how dark and horrifying the mysteries are."
"antoniotierno","9","7","13","29 February 2016"," masterpiece
","All in all it's a compelling piece of work from McCarthy, perhaps his best to date. Spotlight is a zippy and mightily distracting film. Performances are all excellent. ""Spotlight"" tackles a big, true and important story which really does deserve to be told. An admirable job of telling the events as they truly happened, showing the viewer the key players and how they investigated this devastating case, from the beginning to the end. No matter how close to the truth the story is, the fact is that everything is perfectly compelling. The thing that most people will be likely to remember is that the vents are gripping, forcing the audience to be glued to the screen. ""Spotlight"" does tell an important story and for its two-hour runtime, the film is perfect."
"Nosy_and_Opinionated","10","7","13","15 February 2016"," Smart, Gutting, and Grounded
","In 2002, The Boston Globe ran a series of articles covering a history of child molestation occurring inside the Catholic Church. It shocked the world, resulting in a Pulitzer Prize for the newspaper, while forever tarnishing the public perception of priests everywhere. The film Spotlight, directed by Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent, Win- Win), recounts the story of the Globe's investigation, with a star-studded cast and a commitment to historical clarity. It is an extremely faithful procedural that offers a thoroughly intriguing, and sobering, dramatic experience.<br/><br/>The film's heroes are four journalists working for Spotlight, a small and specialized investigative team of the Boston Globe. Mark Ruffalo, Rachel Mcadams, John d'Arcy James, and Michael Keaton all give excellent performances as these team members, though excellent is just par for the course with Spotlight, as every role in the film is entirely convincing. Each character is given just enough believable depth to avoid dipping into cliché, an impressive feat when considering the size of this cast. <br/><br/>In fact, calling the members of Spotlight ""heroes"" doesn't seem appropriate, as they feel less like valiant white knights of a righteous cause, and more like actual people. They each have their own set of personal responsibilities to deal with, both familial and social, and do their best to not have it effect their work. <br/><br/>There is a great sense of place in Spotlight, and Catholic Church's authority in Boston is ever-present. A character early on in the film mentions that although the city's population is large, Boston is still a very small town, and the cinematography reflects this idea beautifully. Exterior shots will often times have cathedrals appearing in the background as a looming reminder of how integral and all-encompassing the Catholic Religion is to Boston. It may seem a bit obvious and trite, but one Google Maps search for ""Boston churches"" will net more results then ""Boston Starbucks"". This is not some underhanded attempt at symbolism, it would just be near impossible to find a shooting location in Boston where a church isn't in the background.<br/><br/>McCarthy seems intent on holding the film to a strict level of naturalism. All of the dialogue feels functional and direct, lacking the traditional levity expected in the prose of most major releases. There is a professionalism in the way people speak that goes far in establishing the authenticity of the newspaper office setting.<br/><br/>There's also a clear effort to show journalism in the sort of grounded, realistic way not found outside season 5 of The Wire. You aren't likely to see many eureka moments of revelatory discoveries, or impassioned speeches set to obtrusive score. Any swelling emotional moments are few and far between, and instead the film opts to portray the profession in a more genuine light, as a job. As the tedious and methodical collection of information, over a long period of time, that slowly accumulates into a big story. A nine-to-five trek that requires equal levels of passion and caffeine. <br/><br/>I'm worried that some might interpret this as a very dull approach for a feature film, but that's because Spotlight won't hold an audience's hand or accommodate any lack of interest. It doesn't so much demand attention, as much as it requires it. It's a film for adults. Not because it's rated R, but because it approaches its hefty topics with maturity and intelligence, and expects the same level of both from the viewer."
"Red-125","10","7","13","11 December 2015"," A movie that needs to be seen!
","Spotlight (2015/I) was co-written and directed by Tom McCarthy. In the 70's, 80's, and into the 90's, ""everyone knew"" that some priests were sexually abusing children. However, no major newspaper had had the courage and/or the staff to bring the story to light.<br/><br/>By sheer determination, combined with investigative excellence, in 1992, the Boston Globe published a factual, detailed expose of the behavior of the rogue priests, and the cover-up of these abuses by high-ranking church officials.<br/><br/>Remember that this was in Boston, where the main ethnic roots are Italian and Irish. Attacking the Catholic Church on what is basically its home turf wasn't easy, and it wasn't fun. However, publishing that story brought many people to the realization that they were dealing with a highly flawed institution. Also, those flaws of abuse and cover-up were nation-wide, not just in Boston. (And, as it turned out, not just in the U.S.) The Boston Globe won the Pulitzer price for reporting, and it was richly deserved.<br/><br/>This movie gives you the feel of a nuts-and-bolts investigation. Blocked avenues that must be circumvented or somehow opened; dealing with people who were damaged by the abuse; working against the power of the church and its supporters; working with people who should be helpful, but who have their own agenda.<br/><br/>The cast includes many fine actors: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and Billy Crudup. It's an ensemble movie--each reporter has a distinct personality, as do the lawyers, the churchmen, and the victims.<br/><br/>As I write this review, Spotlight has an overall 8.6 rating, which is extraordinarily high. Believe the rating--it's a great film.<br/><br/>P.S. I hope everyone reading this review who lives in or near Rochester, NY, recognizes the quality of the films shown at The Little Theatre, on East Avenue. Right now The Little is screening Suffragette, Trumbo, Spotlight, and Brooklyn. (Also Macbeth, which we haven't yet seen.) If you love movies, and you're not a member of The Little, you should be!"
"parolina","5","9","18","5 September 2016"," Won 2015 best film Oscar for subject-matter, not artistic quality
","I rarely watch movies, but someone recommended this one to me as a ""balanced"" portrayal of the priest abuse crisis. I wasn't impressed, especially after having read traditional Catholic Randy Engel's excellent investigative journalism into the priest-pederast crisis, her 5 vol. «Rite of Sodomy: Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church».<br/><br/>The film mentioned how homosexuality has nothing to do with this crisis, which is not at all true (80-90% of the cases are ephebophilia, sodomitic attraction to teenage males, not pedophilia). It portrayed the free press as the real savior of mankind (thus promoting more French Revolution, Liberal errors; cf. Pope Gregory XVI's encyclical «Mirari Vos»). The journalists were portrayed as ""secular confessors."" I did learn one thing: The Boston Globe got its first Jewish editor, Marty Barton, right before the Spotlight team started running hundreds of stories against the Church. Conflict of interest? Balanced journalism? Where are the stories on pederast rabbis? Pedophile school teachers? etc.? In this sense, the film correctly portrayed Barton as being against ""the system"" (i.e., against the Catholic Church).<br/><br/>Also, Boston Globe won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 because of its Spotlight team's work. The Spotlight film won an Academy Award for best film of 2015! Pattern here? Yes: Jew-dominated, self-laudatory awards being used to undermine the Church's authority.<br/><br/>The film's character development and artistic quality was sorely lacking."
"RupertBoyd","5","16","37","23 November 2015"," Flawed film about the Catholic sex abuse scandals
","I wanted to like ""Spotlight."" The epidemic of sexual abuse in Catholic parishes deserves all of the attention it can get, but the execution of this film just simply did not cut the mustard. Those extolling the virtues of this film, and clamoring for Oscar nods, seem blind to just how ill-conceived the story is. <br/><br/>The leads were one-dimensional; sure, they wanted to break the story of sexual abuse within the Catholic diocese in Boston, but there was never any sense of dilemma, conflicting desires, or backstory which could provide a stronger motivation for the goal. Everything was straightforward and on the nose. <br/><br/>The characters had a deliberate way of of speaking, and a deliberate interest in breaking the sex abuse scandal, but their motivation was entirely unclear. I suppose we ought to just believe that journalistic integrity dictates that any crime or scandal must be broken to the world, but there was never any appreciation for the dilemma of the characters or the stakes they faced. Basically, the stakes were as follows: if we break this story, the Catholic church might be mad at us. Those could very well have been the stakes in the actual, real-life story, but they don't make for good cinema. A strong cinematic dilemma might be that one of the journalists is a personal friend of one of the abusive priests, and thus is faced with the conflict of doing the right thing versus protecting his/her dear friend. Or, perhaps by breaking the story, the journalists are jeopardizing their own physical well-being. Again, adding such dilemmas might be violating the veracity of the story, but it's a film, and if the drama and the dilemma aren't there, then maybe a documentary or non-fiction book are a better means of telling the story. The war epic, ""Gladiator,"" is hardly historically accurate - Marcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus (the driving force behind the film's revenge plot) - but it makes for great cinema. <br/><br/>In the same vein as murky character motivations, is the problem of obstacles. There was not a strong source of antagonism behind preventing the scandal from being released. The writer of ""Spotlight"" could have written the Catholic church as a more menacing and formidable force. I was never concerned that our hero journalists would fail in their mission. And more importantly, I was never worried that the truth would continue to be obfuscated by the Church. The writer could have expanded the Cardinal Law character into an active enemy of truth, and someone whose cunning and entitlement is sickening. The Cardinal Law character could have been as menacing and nuanced as Noah Cross in ""Chinatown."" In fact, ""Chinatown"" is a great example of everything that is missing in ""Spotlight."" If you recall the line in Polanski's magnum opus, when Cross says to Gittes: ""You may think you know what you're dealing with, but, believe me, you don't."" In that scene, the audience truly feels the gravity of the moment, and the truth that Gittes is embarking on something bigger than himself, and that he should tread softly. <br/><br/>Another point about this story, and it may be the biggest point, is the medium. Every story has an appropriate medium for telling. The Catcher in the Rye, for instance, does not lend itself to a cinematic retelling, to say nothing of Salinger's steadfast refusal to sell the book rights. Likewise, ""Spotlight"" is not a story that is best told through a visual medium. There is just simply not enough action. Each scene in the film consists of characters talking to each other, hoping to gain new information. While this can work in films where the dialogue is an art form in-and-of itself, it is not the case in ""Spotlight."" The dialogue and characterization was not nearly strong enough."
"oOoBarracuda","5","10","21","20 January 2016"," Spotlight waited too long to turn the light on
","Another 2015 big name ensemble piece, with a heavy storyline, Spotlight was sure to be a brilliant film, until it wasn't. Directed by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight brought together Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and Stanley Tucci to tell the true life story of how a writing team on the Boston Globe first broke the sex abuse scandal within the Catholic Church. As a Roman Catholic, I expected to be disgusted, saddened, and perhaps angry at the events that were to take place on screen. Instead, I was simply stricken by how badly scratched my favorite watch has become.<br/><br/>Taking place within the confines of the overtly Catholic Boston, Massachusetts, any egregious claims against the Catholic Church is going to be outright denied and silenced. With the urging of a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), the premier investigative team of the Boston Globe's known as Spotlight, is propelled to examine the claims of sexual abuse against young boys at the hands of their priests. Coyly led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), the team acts on the scarce archived clippings they have to see if there is anything to the allegations. Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), is the forceful hothead with the most screen time, clearly trying to settle his own score with the Catholic Church. Mike's constant contact with the tight-lipped lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), representing the victims, is strained as Garabedian reveals that he has sent material to the Boston Globe in the past and been ignored. Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), another member of the team makes headway interviewing victims and former priests discovering that one of the men who oversees a victim's support group has also, years before, sent information to the Globe only to be ignored. The obvious resistance to the story from the community does not remain outside the Globe's walls. Through an intense scene of dialogue between the writers and editors, Robby reveals that it was he who ignored the information being sent to the Globe years before. Trying to make things right now, Robby goes after all leads with a fierce intensity. As evidence mounts, the team is driven to expose what too many people are content in keeping a well-known secret.<br/><br/>Typically, a film bogged down almost from the beginning by poor pacing, is going to be filled with rich dialogue. This is not the case for this film; Spotlight, is slow with very sparse, elementary dialogue throughout. Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci both give excellent performances (but when don't they?) Mark Ruffalo's Mike was insufferably overacted and took on far too many distracting nuisance, for instance, I know that Ruffalo can act in an entire movie only speaking through pursed lips. Rachel McAdams, who I tend to like watching, also tried too hard to be an investigative journalist, complete with spastic head movements and darting eyes, and forgot to be an actress. All of these intricacies that I'm sure the talented actors were using to lend realism to their characters were incredibly distracting and removed me from much of the film.<br/><br/>It's difficult when you leave a film you were looking forward to and expected to enjoy and being disappointed. It's even more difficult when you are a fan of the snubbed Carol, unable to comprehend how a masterpiece was overlooked but the Academy found a place for Spotlight. This film is one that if you skip, you won't miss and probably won't be talked about again, unlike some of the other Best Picture nominees."

The subject of the movie,clerical child abuse, is harrowing,but nonetheless it is a story that has to be told. We should never forget all those children who for decades faced abuse at the hands of priests whom they trusted and looked up to. It is sickening to to see in the movie how the Catholic church tried at every turn to cover up the abuse perpetrated by its priests.'Spotlight' brings the stories of abuse victims to light,and while there is good and bad in everyone,those that abuse the trust others put in them should be prosecuted and not have their crimes covered up,whether it be by the Catholic Church or anyone else.I would highly recommend this movie,go and see this.While their is a sad story being told the actors and director brought this story to light vividly.

This film shows how professional journalists work to uncover a tremendous story – said professionalism so sadly lacking in today's media world - with hard work, dedication and honesty. How finding out the truth and exposing it was crucial to bringing hard to grasp facts to the focus of the entire world. I see Oscar winners written all over this picture. Best Picture right on to Best Male Actor – and two of them should be nominated here, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Terrific performances by both. This movie moves right along, bringing it all together in a way that almost numbs your mind by the time it's done. When the end credits roll and it shows how this single story brought out atrocious child molestation scandals, not only in America, but all over the world, and you see the long, long list of places, you can hardly manage to get up from your seat and walk out into the world. You are stunned. This is not a spoiler, but I have to say, at one point in this film, without a word spoken, you watch the camera scroll down pages of names and facts, and in the background you hear a chorus of innocent young voices singing a Christmas carol, the hair on the back of your neck rises.you KNOW you are watching something brilliant.

","Amazingly this is an excellent movie. It is amazing because in this day and age when Hollywood has opted to play up sensationalist glitz at the expense of substance, this movie does just the opposite. It tells a story. It does so in a straightforward manner, with no gratuitous scenes of violence or seedy sex. The story depicts a team of reporters who do a job, and do it right. They have some leads, develop their sources, collect the evidence, put it all together and publish a story. What they did took a lot of courage. Michael Keaton gives a strong performance as the leader of the team of reporters. However, it is Mark Ruffalo who emerges as the star of this movie. His performance dominates the movie. The subject of the story is controversial and sensitive. It deals with a religious institution that allows itself to become a cover for sexual perverts and then tries to cover up the mess, in the process deceiving the public. Sadly, but not surprisingly, this movie is based on a true story. That's why this movie must be watched."

They went through some old documents and talked to a couple of lawyers. Thats not enough for a story line. <br/><br/>There is nothing extra ordinary that the so called spotlight team did - things just came to them - and they didn't do earlier anything for 20 years and finally published a report. <br/><br/>In case its an advertisement for the Boston Globe, its a bad one.

","Amazing cast (but none of them doing career best work), weighty theme handled well (and yet the Church is completely demonized, with no reasonable opposing view of their actions in dealing with the scandal) the direction is fairly tight - however the dialogue is occasionally very on the nose and scenes often skim the surface and then cut away to the next thing without really building or exploring in depth. The music and pacing was fine but at times felt like a really high end TV movie rather than a theatrical film. It is an affecting drama, well-told, I just felt it never reached the fever pitch of outrage it really should have, and the ending is quite underwhelming. There is a lot of talking/exposition/monologuing. Would have been nice for some revelations to happen visually/through action the audience could observe first hand. It feels kind of labored as is. I personally don't think anything about the film is awards worthy, except maybe Ruffalo (what else is new?) and while Todd McCarthy is a fine filmmaker, this is not his best film and nowhere near the directorial achievement of someone like Lenny Abrahamson for Room. I just feel like the reason critics are really raving about this film is that it shows their fellow journalists getting to be the heroes."

It is distant, you cannot feel the tense, the importance of the case ... <br/><br/>And acting could be a bit better as well.

","So I watched this on the plane, had plenty of time to kill, because it won an Oscar, yet it was as exciting as watching paint dry...<br/><br/>We get it that the subject matter is controversial and it's an ""important event"" in reality. THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT MAKES IT A PLEASURABLE ENTERTAINING FILM (and no, I don't need Michael Bay or ridiculous 'Taken' action sequences; I'm looking for a story that has great build-up, brings in different emotions, blows my mind or puts me on the edge, etc). You say 'WHAT?! You don't find people in the church raping young children finally being exposed by a local newspaper move you in anyway?!"" The real-life story/subject matter, yes... but NOT this film. <br/><br/>If your ""enjoyment"" is just observing a depiction of what we already knew and was established, then this is for you.<br/><br/>There really are no satisfying or shocking moments/ending. What you see is what you already know... you don't really get anything out of it. The journey does not flow well. How can anyone find this movie ""shocking"" when we already knew about the premise and it really adds nothing new to it? I mean, for a movie like TITANIC, we KNOW the ship is going to sink, but the EXPERIENCE of the film made it worthwhile. Spotlight fails on the EXPERIENCE. It is as boring as observing a meeting at an office. <br/><br/>For this to win an Oscar just meant they like to give awards to the 'underdog' or just simply because of the controversy subject matter.<br/><br/>This film is on the same level as when 'The Artist' won Oscar - another overrated boring film (probably forgotten by most people by now; as much as I can enjoy black and white films) - which just simply won more for the IDEA than the quality of the film. <br/><br/>Skip it."

","Look,<br/><br/>This isn't an attempt to downplay the events, this isn't a cheap shot at the ""Best Picture winner"". This is just a technical look at the medium used to tell this story.<br/><br/>But first a little bit of background, this story has made headlines all over the world, year-in-year-out, since this full extent of these atrocities were uncovered. Everyone who watches the six o'clock news, buys a paper or scrolls through Facebook knows roughly what happened.<br/><br/>It makes it all the more confusing then, when a story like this is thrown onto the big screen, and told in an agonisingly straight style. By this I mean, there isn't anything new here, the production isn't groundbreaking or cutting edge, there are no boundaries being pushed to help cinema float into the future. They didn't bring anything to the table, attempts at building suspense are short lived - with bottoms hardly having enough time to get to the edge of the seats. <br/><br/>The performances are passionate, but let down by a textbook (not in a good way) approach to the cinematography, it leaves it feeling distinctly flat. If they were dealing with a more unknown story, it could have been effective. There are some examples of this, letting the camera on, being calm in the face of evil that work. Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 documentary ""The Act of Killing"" - exploits this flat style to further sicken the audience. Jumping back to ""Spotlight"", a story this big needing some more sting in its tail? Just to make people wonder about the things our species are capable of? It's pretty worrying.<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking, ""it's supposed to be black and white, hype and tension would only look like fear mongering..."" You're right. But!

"kingbk-2","8","7","14","2 January 2016"," Challenge of Faith, Beliefs in this Excellent Journalistic Piece
","After watching this wonderful film, I felt like Mark Ruffalo's Michael Rezendes character: ""I really want to find a reason to come back."" He says this in regards to being a lapsed Catholic who wants to find a reason to return to Church, but hasn't found it. In many ways, that's where I am in my faith and beliefs. I'm a lapsed/cultural Catholic who goes to Easter and Christmas mass, but other than that, really don't practice the religion, or any religion at all. There are many reasons for this, the child abuse scandal a factor in this, but I've wanted to find a reason to come back. I have to say after watching Spotlight, finding that reason might never happen again in my lifetime.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 2001. It follows The Boston Globe's Spotlight Team, a group of four writers who preach quality over quantity. They spend over a year on research and take a long time to write a story on a subject. Things change when the Editor-in-Chief at the paper retires and is replaced by Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), a Jewish bachelor from Florida who dislikes baseball. For as big and important of a city that Boston is to the country, it's very tight-knit in many ways and provincial, which makes Baron stick out like a sore thumb. He instructs the Spotlight Team to investigate the Catholic Church child abuse accusations, asking the team to take on a giant, in that Boston is a deeply Catholic city and the church has a big influence on everything going on. Walter ""Robbie"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) leads his team of writers in this new challenge, each of them a lapsed Catholic with deep roots in the city. Joining Robinson and Rezendes is Sacha Pfeffier (Rachel McAdams), a Midwest transplant from Ohio who has extended family in Boston and stops going to weekly mass with her Grandma due to this story and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), a writer who left Catholicism to join his wife's church. Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery) is the Managing Editor, trying to balance the team from not wasting too much time on the story while also hoping to impress Baron, who admits to looking at making cuts at the paper.<br/><br/>The story is dialogue heavy, no frills. There aren't side stories or love stories or really anything to make it ""Hollywoodized"". The battles are to get information from the many sources: the victims of the abuse, the Priests themselves, Cardinal Law, and the lawyers who were quick to settle with the church and victims. The characters and there relationships keep the story moving and interesting. Unlike some reviewers, I was never bored with the story. I got excited when they uncovered a new lead and I gasped when new facts were released. <br/><br/>All the characters were very well acted, but Ruffalo does an excellent job in his role. Rezendes has so much nervous energy and tension surrounding his interest in the story that you can't help but feel on edge every scene he is in. His rant at Robinson when the story hits a speed bump is strong and his monologue during the taxi ride is the best scene in the movie. I hope he gets serious Oscar consideration for this role, as he truly deserves it.<br/><br/>The movie will make you think about faith and beliefs, both in religion, as well as mass media. Both do a lot of things to make us have our doubts, but Spotlight shows us we need to think about the good as well as the bad and once we have all the information, we can make an informed decision."

","Earlier in my life I would instantly ""rate"" a film after having seen it, based on feelings it invoked to me. Nowadays I tend to ask myself a question: ""what is it that will make me remember this?"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this movie after seeing it, I think that the overwhelming issue, the elephant in the room, remains the very subject that this film is occupied with in general. Almost nothing you see in this movie will ""stay"" with you.<br/><br/>Very nice cast, very nice acting all in all, but story and character building is ""flat"" in my humble opinion. I never gotten to feel something for some character: not enough sympathy for the newspaper team (not threatened or risky enough - they didn't have to sacrifice anything), not enough dislike or wish for vengeance towards priests/Archbishop (did not actually see/hear their demeanor or reaction to this - just reported attitude), not even particularly sorry for the victims (just not convincing enough).<br/><br/>A few years from now I think I will probably just remember that some journalists in Boston uncovered a lousy pedophilia scandal within the Catholic Church. And although pedophilia is a vast, shocking problem, well, you knew that before seeing this film."

","Having watched this on a plane, and not fully finishing it (and missing some parts because I was nodding off), this review is based on my impression of the parts that I did watch. <br/><br/>Based on a true story, Spotlight does well at giving a pragmatic account of what actually happened. I'm not very sure at which part I stopped watching (and which parts I missed) but from what I saw, the progression of the film seemed to take a while. Also, because it dealt with an industry I don't know much about, most of the technical talk went over my head.<br/><br/>I mean it's great that they're bringing this story to light, but I was not following along that well. The cast did a good job at playing their characters though, and it was great to see A-list actors playing characters outside their typical roles.

","""I'm just a poor boy from a poor family"" says one of the victims of systematically covered up child abuse by paedophile Priests in Boston ""and when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal. How do you say 'no' to God?"" <br/><br/>The victim might well have added, as I did, subconsciously, the paraphrased words of Freddie Mercury ""spare me my life from this monstrosity.""<br/><br/>Because let's make no mistake here. This was a monstrosity.<br/><br/>The story is, on the surface, a journalistic procedural about the 'exposing' (no pun intended) of paedophile priests in Massachusetts (Boston specifically) by The Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' tiny hit squad at the turn of the millennium. The investigation is set into motion at the instruction of the ailing paper's then Editor, Marty Baron, played with callous inscrutability by Liev Scriver. It's a masterful performance.<br/><br/>Or at least that's how the movie's billed. In actual fact it becomes a complete deconstruction of the 'Three Estates' and commentary on their deep rooted self protection; the clergy, the news industry, the legal sector, the monied are all systematically pulverised in Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy's acid script.<br/><br/>No one comes out alive.<br/><br/>Including, tragically, many of the thousand and more victims of this institutionalised psychological 'phenomenon' that is peculiar to a significant minority (6% apparently) of the Catholic clergy, not just in Boston Massachusetts, but the first world over.<br/><br/>That's why this film is so important, because as we bemoan the effect of Islamic fundamentalism of the World order right now the Christian religion has been breeding just as insidious an evil, but from within and of its own, for decades (maybe, no probably, longer. As the movie opens it quickly becomes apparent that Spotlight is a commercial indulgence in the context of falling newsprint sales and the fledgling 'internet' bringing with it, as it did, almost unlimited free 24 hour news. The new editor, with a reputation for cutting the workforce elsewhere, initially looks at Spotlight (a team of four) with scepticism.<br/><br/>They grow their stories at leisure and have an unhealthily parochial attitude towards them. They look set for the chop until Baron learns of a priest who's been exposed and thinks it's a story for the Spotlight team. Apart from eager beaver, Mike Rezendez (another magnificent performance by the chameleon-like Mark Ruffalo) they're initially reluctant because they know the city 'mafia' (it's strongly Catholic and protects its own) will not make the task easy and could, in fact, boycott the title if the accusations are distasteful.<br/><br/>The Spotlight team go for it with vigour. The meat of the film gradually excavates the layers of deceit,and cover up executed by the Archbishop, his cronies and the legal profession who carry out extensive, but not particularly elaborate burial of evidence, misfiling of case reports and the turning of blind eyes right left and centre.<br/><br/>The police are implicated (no, accused) the most senior judiciary (some of them also Catholic) subvert and seal important files.<br/><br/>Frankly, the whole thing sucks.<br/><br/>And then 9/11 strikes, suddenly the world's eyes turn to Islam, including Spotlights'. <br/><br/>How ironic.<br/><br/>It's a tragic intervention in many ways because the team is making real progress; extracting victim stories from grown men, mainly but not exclusively, that agree to tell their stories and closing ion on the legal, clergy and city movers and shakers that are at the heart of the cover up.<br/><br/>But eventually the case resumes and we reach our inevitable and well publicised finale.<br/><br/>What Tom McCathy has achieved here is turn a movie into a fly on the wall docudrama, shot , as it is, in unglamourous fluorescent light for the most part. The lead performances by Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton and John Slattery are selfless. Spotlight is bigger than any of them. ( A special mention must also go to Stanley Tucci for playing the lawyer with a heart in an award worthy turn.)<br/><br/>The script is a whodunit of epic proportions and the content is both worthwhile and necessary and the sum is most certainly greater than the parts.<br/><br/>Praise to the real Spotlight team was ultimately massive (they won the Pulitzer prize for their efforts) but the impact it has had as it has resonated across not just the Boston Globe but its entirety makes this an effort of monumental proportions and the basis of a truly great movie that should win best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards."

","The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. <br/><br/>Going into awards season, ""Spotlight"" was the early front-runner. And after the nominees were announced, it has remained a favorite. More than a handful of award nominations surround it, and we should expect it will get at least one, if not a few.<br/><br/>Will it get an award for best screenplay? Certainly it has the chops to do so, as it has made journalism interesting again, the first film to do since since ""All the President's Men"". And it addresses the Boston clergy scandal in a fair way. This is not a smear campaign, but an honest look. Even the Church itself has accepted and praised the film. Vatican Radio, official radio service of the Holy See, called it ""honest"" and ""compelling"" and said it helped the Catholic Church ""to accept fully the sin, to admit it publicly, and to pay all the consequences."" Luca Pellegrini on the Vatican Radio website wrote that the Globe reporters ""made themselves examples of their most pure vocation, that of finding the facts, verifying sources, and making themselves—for the good of the community and of a city—paladins of the need for justice.""<br/><br/>There are two acting awards to look at. Michael Keaton was projected to be nominated, but was not. In his place, we have two supporting actors: mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams. For whatever reason, the actress roles year after year are generally not very strong, and this may allow McAdams to sneak by. She is not outstanding by any means, but better than her usual self. But Jennifer Jason Leigh seems to be the front-runner, and Rooney Mara is also someone to watch. This is not your year, Rachel.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo has a better shot. He has gone all out, and this may be his finest performance yet. For a guy who appeared in such films as ""13 Going on 30"", he has really distinguished himself. The intensity here. There is one clear ""Oscar scene"" where Ruffalo stands up to Keaton's character. His biggest hurtle, though, will probably be Mark Rylance (""Bridge of Spies""). They are two very different performances, but the Academy's tendency to give out ""lifetime achievement awards"" makes me suspect it will tip in Rylance's favor.<br/><br/>Tom McCarthy as best director? Clearly if a film can be best picture the director deserves a chance to be best director. The two are almost always linked. But McCarthy has a strike against him: the Adam Sandler film ""The Cobbler"". Are people ready to forget about that? Probably. But yet, it seems like Inarritu (""The Revenant"") may be taking this one... for the second year in a row, if memory serves me.<br/><br/>Now, of course, that leaves best picture. As noted, the hype is there, the push is there, if you were involved in an Oscar pool this would be the wise bet. For me, it is a fight between ""Spotlight"" and ""The Martian"". But I probably stands alone on that, and the reason is because ""Spotlight"" is the more important film.<br/><br/>""The Martian"" is a hopeful story, but ""Spotlight"" focuses on the importance of journalism and standing up for what is right. The film is even more important today than when the scandal happened because of the Internet. And they hint at that in one scene where a priest tells his congregation that the Internet cannot make faith obsolete. The real message is that the Internet cannot make good journalism obsolete. Papers may be shutting down or merging, but good reporting will always have its place... and thank goodness we have the folks at Spotlight to do that sort of work for us."

","Spotlight is a great movie and it's a powerful movie. I hope that everyone sees it if only to reinforce the harsh reality that there are evil, corrupt, and powerful people in the world who use that power to increase that power, instilling fear and pain in the meek and poor.<br/><br/>Every scene builds exactly as it must, step by step, increasing in the shocking revelation that not only were some Boston priests getting away with child rape for decades, but a lot of people knew it. Worse yet, the people who had the power to stop it didn't because no one had the guts to stand up to the power or majesty of the church. Indeed, even the reporters at the Boston Globe had to face that even they botched several early chances to stop the abuse, but either the truth seemed too shocking to be real, or their own religious beliefs closed their eyes to reality.<br/><br/>Given the global scope of the child rape scandal, it shocks me that anyone with a strong religious belief could remain an active member in the Catholic church. Possibly the most shocking moment comes just before the end credits, when we briefly see pages of cities in America where rape scandals occurred, then pages of cities around the world where rape scandals occurred.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is good, but not as inspired as in Birdman. Mark Ruffalo has a good yell to inspire Oscar tremors. Actually, everyone is very good in the movie, especially Stanley Tucci as the misunderstood grump with a heart of gold, and even Liev Schreiber, who plays a man with no emotion about as well as anyone could. The actors portraying the victims do excellent jobs as well, never letting terror or discomfort overcome the need to tell their stories.<br/><br/>There's only one scene that seemed off: a little halfway through, a group from the Spotlight team are in the basement archives, and Michael Keaton doesn't have his reading glasses , so he awkwardly states he can't read without his reading glasses. That's a goofy insert at an awkward time, and could have been handled much more fluidly. Other than that, this is surely a must-see of 2015."

","Tackling subject matter like Spotlight does is very difficult to portray on film. You have to accurately tell the story enough to not create outcry while also not relying on the weight of the source material in order to induce emotion. It's difficult, but certainly not impossible and Spotlight did pretty much everything right. The acting from one of the best ensemble casts of the year is phenomenal. Everyone gave such a great performance that no one ended up stealing the spotlight, pun intended. The directing is top notch as Tom McCarthy perfectly weaves between scenes without any wasted screen time.<br/><br/>Spotlight is based on the 'Spotlight investigative team at the Boston Globe and their uncovering of the Massachusetts Catholic sex abuse scandal. I think what I was most impressed with was that it by no means was a catholic hate fest, and it definitely could have been. In fact, several moments throughout the film it is shown that even the Spotlight team made many mistakes during the course of this piece. I really appreciated the way everyone was portrayed.<br/><br/>The performances are all incredible. I'm sure the film will garner many awards come a few months, but it was the chemistry between the entire group that was most impressive. There isn't really a lead, the whole team should be honored. But if I had to pick, I think Mark Ruffalo deserves the most recognition, in large part due to the writing, but it's his subtly emotional sequences that are most effective.<br/><br/>When you think of investigative journalism films, All the President's Men certainly comes to mind for most people, rightfully so. But I think Spotlight may this generation's version of that. There are plenty of moments in which it's obvious is inspired from that film, and they both do a great job at making a film without any action, very interesting. I'd be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for a ton of Oscars and possibly even win best picture.

No, they did not manage to lay their diseased hands on me, but I know what these monsters are all about and their modus operandi is familiar to yours truly.

The Roman Catholic church used its influence, particularly in places where Catholics were politically powerful or influential, to protect creeps who preyed upon children. These children, who were almost always young men, were chewed up and spit out without either governments or the Church doing much, if anything, to protect them. This story does capture that narrative, and it does so competently, but the performances seemed flat and the story was told in a somewhat plodding manner.

","'Spotlight' provides a riveting look at the Boston Globe investigation of the Roman Catholic pedophile priest scandal. As almost everybody knows, the church hierarchy concealed their knowledge of numerous priests who were molesting and raping under-age parishioners. The cover-up of these serious felonies was orchestrated through pay-offs and arm-twisting by Boston's archbishop, the despicable Cardinal Bernard Law. This corrupt cleric seemed to rule over the city, and his criminal negligence allowed the depraved activity to continue for many years.<br/><br/>The victims were countless Bostonians who endured this abuse and had their lives ruined. The heroes were an embattled lawyer, a resolute editor and a small group of persistent journalists who dismantled the obfuscation and red tape of respected authority figures and entrenched institutions. The villains were Law, his venal church and the priests who pretended piety while they preyed upon the young. 'Spotlight' tells this twisted tale with excellent writing, direction and acting. <br/><br/>It's worth noting Law fled to Rome after the scandal broke, was given an honorary position and still lives in comfort in a Vatican palace. In 2012 he was the prime lobbyist against giving women more responsibility in the church. Nothing much appears to have changed in the RC Boys' Club."
"jbroc62","9","6","12","10 December 2015"," Spotlight: A Realistic Movie That Treats Both its Audience and Reporters with Repsect
","Spotlight is a remarkably well-written and phenomenally acted film that tells a shocking and disturbing true story that just floored me. <br/><br/>First of all, I went into this film not really knowing anything. I knew it involved the Boston Globe, that there was some sort of scandal with the Catholic Church, and that it takes place in the early 2000's. That's all I knew, and as the film unfolded before me, and revealed bit by bit of it's amazing, astonishing story, I was completely blown away by how incredible the writing and acting in this film was. <br/><br/>Tom McCarthy both wrote and directed this film, and he did a phenomenal job on both ends. What he did when writing this screenplay is that he didn't make the reporters who are working on this case heroes. He made them who they truly are; reporters who care about their jobs, who care about the story, who care about justice being served to the right people. He makes them incredibly human, and through this, these characters become very relatable to the people who watch this film.<br/><br/>A lot of the way that Spotlight tells its story is so subdued to the point of brilliance. Sure, this is an Oscar movie, but there really aren't any ""Oscar scenes"" in this movie, save for one scene in which a character has an outburst of sorts. These actors are really holding back their dramatic chops in this film. For example, when you here bad news, do you throw a chair against a wall and go into a temper tantrum? No. In this film, as this case builds, and builds, and builds to the point where you're amazed that this is a true story, the characters in this film simply shake their head, sit back, and say things that actual people would say, like ""Oh my goodness,"" or ""Wow This is not good."" It's truly riveting stuff.<br/><br/>The entire cast in this film is spectacular. Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, and Stanley Tucci all do great work. Liev Schreiber is great in this movie as the new editor-in-chief at the Globe, and I loved seeing him in a more restrained dramatic role that I'm not accustomed to seeing him in. Michael Keaton is terrific in this movie, and I'm so glad that Birdman wasn't just a fluke for his career resurgence. He is truly subdued, and brilliant in this film. However, Mark Ruffalo is the standout in this film. He gives one of the best performances of his career in this film, and the voice he has in the movie really works with his character to the point where I didn't even see Mark Ruffalo. And honestly, that statement pretty much goes for every single actor/actress in this film, and that's because the story and the characters are so well-realized. And when you have well-known actors disappearing into their roles to the point where you don't recognize them, that deserves praise.<br/><br/>Spotlight is one of the best films of the year, and it deserves nothing less than that."
"BrendanMichaels","5","4","7","1 April 2016"," This won Best Picture?
","Spotlight has two main things going for it. A very strong script from Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer that is reminiscent of All The President's Men and the stellar cast made up of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Mark Ruffalo, Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Brian d'Arcy James. But besides all of those 2 great aspects, does Spotlight present itself as the film that deserves the slew of award nominations that it has been slammed with? To me, no.Spotlight seems to be a movie that shows itself as an amazing film but lacks focus on characters and doesn't stretch boundaries for cinema. Does that mean all that praise isn't in the film? No, Spotlight does shine brightly in the script and performances.<br/><br/>Spotlight is based on the true story of the Boston Globe reporters in the Spotlight section that are tasked with finding evidence for a story on the Catholic Church child molestation cases but discover something bigger in the process. The 128 minute film follows the reporters as they come across the victims of these molestations. While others will say Michael Keaton is the standout in this film for me it's Mark Ruffalo giving my personal favorite performance from him. Stanley Tucci, Liev Schreiber, Rachel McAdams and Brian d'Arcy James give great performances that help give the film a bit more shape but sadly it doesn't help that their characters and how they're shown to us are the root of my problem with Spotlight. Spotlight's characters are never given much detail so we don't really feel a personal connection with the reporters like we should because they're the main characters.<br/><br/>The writing in Spotlight is great and definitely deserving of the awards it gets. While the characters are written from a bird's eye view it at least gets us to sympathize with the characters and get us invested in how they discover the conspiracy, I wish the directing were the same. Tom McCarthy is a director that hasn't been able to wow me. This is probably because the last film I saw him direct was The Cobbler, one of the worst films of 2015, and he did the opposite of intrigued me and more or less had me rock in the fetal position and think about the choices I have made in my life. He does an adequate job for a biopic. It's really hard to get me to love a biopic nowadays because they all follow the same movements and never fascinate me. A minor nitpick is that each time something important happens in the movie a few notes from the piano played and it was cute the first time but really made me question as to why that had to be the go to music for those moments.<br/><br/>Spotlight is just another Oscar baity film (a term I hate using but is definitely true in this case) that has a great script with decent direction and outstanding performances from Keaton and Ruffalo. But the lack of depth in the characters just astounds me. Easily could have been directed better if Spielberg had taken helm. I would definitely recommend to watch but not deserving of Best Picture in my mind. It's definitely a great film that should be shown to people who want more info on the scandal."
"lloydmorgan111222","6","4","7","25 February 2016"," Interesting But Not Engaging
","'Spotlight' is a good film but it doesn't go beyond just ""good"" because it is interesting but not very engaging.<br/><br/>The film adopts a straight-to-the-point approach to telling the story of The Boston Globe's investigation into the cover-up of multiple incidents of child abuse within the Catholic Church. This is a good way of recounting real life events but not the best way to make a film that engages and resonates with an audience.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with this approach is that it neglects the development of the characters. And I don't just mean character development, in which characters change or learn something over the course of a story. I mean characters that are well rounded and engaging in some way. None of the characters stood out to me. I missed most of their names so I just referred to them in my head by their actors' names. My lack of investment in the film made the ending feel anti-climatic. From a logical point of view, it isn't, but there was nothing really substantial to hook me in and feel the arc of the story. <br/><br/>The actors all do a fine job by their way. My favourite scenes were the ones in which the members of the Spotlight team interact with survivors of these abuse cases. The actors who played the two survivors (Neal Huff and Michael Cyril Creighton) were believable and made me invested in their scenes. It's possible that my lack of familiarity with them helped sell those scenes but they were well suited and made an impression either way.<br/><br/>In at least one review, the visual style has been compared to that of a TV drama, and I can understand why this comparison was made. Tom McCarthy's directorial decisions seem to be based mostly on capturing the actors instead of making the film more engrossing. The directing is still good, but it doesn't do anything to balance out the flat characters. The generic music that felt too bland for a theatrical feature also didn't help matters. <br/><br/>Overall, 'Spotlight' is a good film that stands out mostly due to its cast and subject matter. I wouldn't really recommend it unless you find the topic interesting or you already want to see this film.<br/><br/>You can read more of my reviews at: http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/films/reviews/"
"rogerdarlington","Null","4","7","31 January 2016"," Stunning film about a vile case of abuse and its cover-up
","This film tells the astonishing story of the ""Boston Globe""'s Pulitzer Prize-winning Spotlight team of investigative journalists who uncovered the Catholic Church's systematic cover-up of widespread child abuse by more than 70 local priests. It took five months of hard investigation before, in January 2002, the newspaper printed its first article.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is a wonderful piece of ensemble acting with Michael Keaton as the team's head Walter 'Robby' Robinson, Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as the reporters Sacha Pfeiffer and Michael Rezendes, Brian d'Archy James as the researcher Matt Carroll, Liev Screiber and John Slattery as the editors Marty Baron and Ben Bradley Jr, and Stanley Tucci as the victims' attorney Mitchell Garabedian. The fact that Baron was Jewish and Garabedian Armenian suggests that often revelation of scandal requires the intervention of an outsider to the system<br/><br/>In this quietly stunning film, we see how good investigative reporting requires passionate commitment and fierce independence plus forensic attention to detail and a lot of shoe-leather and door-knocking. There are no action sequences and, except for one scene, no grandstanding in a movie in which the story is everything and really two stories in one: the actual abuse and then the cover-up. There will naturally be comparison with ""All The President's Men"", another true-life account of brilliant investigation by committed reporters, but that film was 40 years ago and one could also relate ""Spotlight"" to ""The Big Short"", released about the same time, since both are appalling examples of the abuse of power and the difficulty in holding power to account.<br/><br/>For six years, I was Chair of the Internet Watch Foundation in Britain which combats the availability of child abuse material online. so I know that the viewing of such images and the perpetration of such acts cuts across all classes and occupations. But there is something especially vile about child abuse by religious figures and, in the case of the Catholic Church, a vital factor is the mandation of celibacy by its clergy. I went to Catholic schools and an epiphanic moment for me was when we were taught that celibacy was a superior moral state to marriage. <br/><br/>At the end of ""Spotlight"", there is a list of the many other cities besides Boston - in both the USA and around the world - where there have been other cases of such child abuse by Catholic priests. One of them was my home town."

He may in real life been sexually abused by a priest. He plays a convincing role!<br/><br/>Sexually abused children often go into a hypnotic trance to keep the abuse a secret and know what it feels like to be in perpetrators shoes. They will often grow up to be caught in reenactment to master the trauma as victims or perpetrators. They will often have intrusive thoughts.<br/><br/>The priest who stated that he did not receive any gratification by raping a young boy was still caught up in the hypnotic trance. It was like it never happened as he said you see I was also raped.<br/><br/>This is broadcast journalism at its finest! It doesn't matter if it was The Globe or The Phoenix who bore witness to this story. <br/><br/>Am now wondering if Tom Mc Carthy and John Singer will be blacklisted from making another film?"
"vsks","10","4","7","4 December 2015"," Master Class in Telling a Story That Makes the Viewer Care
","Shades of Woodward and Bernstein, the based-on-a-true story Spotlight follows the actions of an investigative journalism team way out on a limb in Catholic Boston. They're not just in pursuit of the story of clergy child sex abuse, their mission is also to expose the shameful cover-up of abusive priests, and the institutional shortcomings that allowed them to carry on. Unlike today's social media blowhards (and political candidates), they can't just make accusations; they need actual proof. A nice coincidence is the support the reporters receive from another Ben Bradlee—this one Ben Bradlee, Jr., played by John Slattery, who never has a good hair day. Like his father in the Watergate era, he lets the reporters run, even though he's initially skeptical they'll come up with anything. Crusading journalists are a social corrective we have largely lost in the era of declining newsroom budgets and staffs and the competition for sound bites and snarky bits. The reporters in this film reporters fill the job description, pushed by a fierce desire to expose the truth. Sometimes, of course, that leads to more truth than they might desire—closer to home truths of different kinds. They're after the kind of story that wins Pulitzers, but more important to the journalists, they know it's an important story for the affected families and a sobering story about how evil can hide in plain sight. The principals include the Boston Globe's new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and his investigative ""Spotlight"" team, led by Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton of the pursed lips), with reporters Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo, who sticks his head out like a turtle, so eager is he to grab onto the story), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachael McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian D'Arcy James). The actors do a fine job, as do Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup in smaller roles. As written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy, the film is a ""magnificent nerdy process movie—a tour de force of filing cabinet cinema,"" says Justin Chang in Variety. Yet it is never uninteresting. Even better, it is never sanctimonious. The film's tension comes from fear that the Church will find out what the Globe is up to and exert its considerable influence to put a stop to it or—and almost worse from the reporters' point of view—the Boston Herald will scoop them. If they can delay publication until they have proof top Church leaders knew about the abuse, it would be impossible for them to persist in the ""few bad apples"" claim. In sum, ""A taut story, well-told,"" says Jim Lane in the Sacramento News & Review."

","The world is filled with secrets. Everybody have their own, but usually they are quite small and do not interfere with others. However, this can only be applicable to ordinary mortals. When an important man or even a big institution are involved, things get ugly before they get beautiful. Nowadays we have plenty examples to support that, and when a well intention guy or group try to dive into this deep waters, things usually become disagreeable.<br/><br/>Spotlight is one of these cases. The story here is about a true story of how a research journalist group named Spotlight, working for the Boston Globe, uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core, the Vatican. Although the majority of the young people are not well familiar with this scandal, it really shacked and shocked everyone and had repercussions beyond the expectations. Therefore, some courage is needed to direct a story of this magnitude. So, and thinking that the film was extremely well produced, I would like to underline the amazing job of the Director Tom McCarthy. He really did it! This incredible and complex true story is properly treated in this movie, with all the sequence making sense, guiding us throw the complexity of the research made by these brave guys. Complex in every matters, because it involved pure journalism, intricate laws, important people, huge institutions. And Tom McCarthy presented all in a very simple way that make us understand everything from the beginning until the end without missing a bit. This movie is really about the story and everything is there!<br/><br/>Regarding the actors' performance not much can be said, once the brilliance of the movie relies on the story itself, so all the credits should be attributed to the team who have written and directed the movie. However, if someone must be mentioned, Mark Ruffalo (Mike Rezendes) is that guy. He is one of the journalists involved in the research for the Boston Globe and slowly get into the subject and began to be slightly affected about it. Actually, all the team, began to demonstrate signs of disturbed behavior as the research proceeds, which is quite normal regarding the atrocity that they were exposing. He is one of the main stones of the group and is responsible for a few interesting scenes. His character evolves in the movie and Mark really manages to convey all the interior pain that he is feeling.<br/><br/>With all that said I have scored this brilliant movie with a 9/10 because it really captured one of the most controversial scandals of all time. Besides all the time passed, this could be a story of today once a lot of speculation still exists. Incredible job for everyone but as I have said, this is a movie that depends exclusively of the story without any shining performance. However, it will capture all your attention during the entire time. I truly recommended it."

","Mark Ruffalo definitely deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of an investigative journalist so in love with his job that the only exercise he gets is jogging to work. He nails it with such sincerity that he left me feeling like I was feeling what he was feeling. I don't know if his role would be considered best actor or best supporting actor-- seems the Academy decides that by a flip of the coin. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job but this time around it's Ruffalo, the best I've seen from him ever, hands down. Rachel McAdam's puts the powerful female character wasted in the utterly confusing True Detective Season Two to better use as another member of the investigative team. And the rest of the cast is nothing short of brilliant and convincing. This is one of those rare movies that can build almost unbearable suspense with not much more than phone calls and note taking. What makes this such a nail biter is just simply how realistic it's all portrayed. You REALLY feel like you're in that newsroom; you REALLY identify with each of the characters and understand what they are going through and the stakes involved. This is one of those gems like Glengary Glenn Ross that will have you on the edge of your seat even though there isn't a single bullet fired, explosion, killing or action sequence whatsoever. Bravo to Spotlight."

I agree that the story-telling is clear and unfolds in a way that adds to your knowledge of the history of events, but that could be achieved in a documentary too. I don't agree that the acting was great, it felt mediocre to me, but with its ensemble cast you have weak characters, no character development and so very little for the actors to get their teeth into. It felt to me like any drama or tension was crow-barred in for the purposes of giving the audience some excitement, when for example Mark Ruffalo's character is running to the records office and banging on the door as it closes. Such moments seemed forced and straight out of the cliché book. Commendable to make a film on this subject and bring people's attention to the crimes that were allowed to continue to take place,but a worthy subject does not make a great film. For me the direction was really dull and this looked like it could have been made for TV. A much better film on the subject is 'Doubt' without doubt."

","Spotlight is a movie which is making you realize how dearly we should never surrender our freedom of the press.<br/><br/>This movie tells the real story of a team of 5 journalists working for the Boston Globe who, despite the deep willingness of the Church and their supporters to bury it, uncovers one of the biggest scandals which shook the entire planet: the scandalous and systematic cover up of priests molesting young children they were in charge of by the Catholic Church itself.<br/><br/>It all started with one case, then thirteen until it reached the chilling number of ninety priests molesting children during their entire career while people knew but turned their eyes because of all the good the Church was doing for the city.<br/><br/>I was deeply shocked by the hypocrisy and real stiffness of this system for example when Rachel McAdams is interviewing that priest who admits the facts he's accused of but insists that it was not rape as he was raped himself. When the interview ended, while she walks down the stairs, she realizes that the priest lives nearby a school. What's even more shocking is the reaction of the Church towards the issue. They surely know of it but prefer to cover it up by hiding legal documents proving the rapes so nobody could gain access to it with the providential help of justice employees or even by frequently putting pressure on the journalists to protect the Church reputation.<br/><br/>This movie is also an ode to reporting throughout those 5 journalists who keep digging, tracking down each of the victims to get their chilling statements even risking some hardly gained friendships with defense attorneys to get to the truth. My compliment by the way to Jamey Sheridan who played one of those attorneys who was just doing his job despite being secretly disgusted by his clients abuses.<br/><br/>Spotlight is a must see and it truly deserves its Oscar for the Best Picture of the year.

Spotlight does not really deliver on this. It is a good film, and it tells an important story with an important message about the fourth estate. Well, actually, the film is also largely about the flaws of the first estate, second estate, and third estate, but the fourth estate (the press) is the one that rebounds from its flaws. <br/><br/>This methodical telling of a true story about the importance of a vigilant press is rated highly by critics this year. It is a story about how the press, politicians and religious leaders all conspired to protect a terrible group of people. This is an important story in that we must prevent this from ever happening again by any people in our society. <br/><br/>But the importance of the story itself is not how you rate a film. This film is well crafted, well acted and very well cast.

","Spotlight (2015) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Excellent movie based around the Boston Globe's investigation into various accounts of sexual abuse that was hidden by the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>Obviously, SPOTLIGHT doesn't deal with a fun subject but the film is the perfect example of how to make a great movie. Take a great director and give him a great script to work with. Then you get a great cast to deliver great performances and bring those lines of dialogue and story to life. Why aren't more movies made like this? I'm going to guess it's because these types of films aren't going to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office but if you're a fan of cinema then SPOTLIGHT offers a whole lot.<br/><br/>The subject matter itself is something that will make you blood boil but director Tom McCarthy handles it in a very classy way. The screenplay is so great because it really comes across as a blueprint on how journalism should work and obviously while watching the film you're going to think back to movies like THE FRONT PAGE and ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN. The story here is one that certainly grabs your attention and McCarthy does an excellent job at building up the tension as the reporters race against a clock but also race to find more victims to try and build case.<br/><br/>Again, the subject matter isn't pretty but the film perfectly blends the drama of the victim's story as well as the drama and moral clause that people like reporters have. It certainly doesn't hurt that we're given an excellent cast that bring the material to life. Michael Keaton turns in another wonderful performance as the main guy who maybe connected to the crimes. Liev Schreiber has never been better than he is here as the man who pushes for the investigation. Then you have a tender performance from Rachel McAdams as well as Stanley Tucci delivering his finest work in years. With that said, Mark Ruffalo steals the film with his remarkable performance as the main reporter trying to bust the creeps who hid the crimes. The emotion, rage and power in his performance jumps right off the screen.<br/><br/>SPOTLIGHT is technically quite flawless as the cinematography, the score, editing and every other aspect are terrific. Of course, a movie like this works on an intelligent level because it asks questions to the viewer and doesn't always just spell out the answer. The movie manages to be highly entertaining from start to finish and it really packs a punch without having to resort to preaching."
"scottastonandrew","6","3","5","26 January 2016"," Best Film? No. Best Documentary - Try that!
","Storytelling takes many forms and mediums and as much as I enjoyed 'Spotlight', it could have been presented better by way of Documentary as opposed to the traditional 'Hollywood' storytelling narrative. Now being a fan of Documentaries, I tend to also enjoy films that fall into the category of 'based on actual events'. I know sometimes 'Hollywood' gets in the way of presenting a factual story but as great as the performances were from all leading cast members, I found that the characters were weak and overshadowed by the star power that took them on. <br/><br/>Clearly it was the punchy script that attracted the leading names because none of the characters had any real depth and really don't stand out as a role that an actor would 'just have to play'. Keating, McAdams, Ruffalo and Tucci were all great in the portrayal of real people - This was definitely Ruffalo's film. I get it though... This isn't a film about characters. It's a film about journalistic investigation (Hence why a documentary film may have been a better approach to tell this story). Hearing the word's come from those individuals who worked tirelessly to blow the lid off the Catholic Church in interview style would have made for a more gripping narrative. Spotlight just doesn't have the excitement that came with films like Argo or Erin Brockovich. Was it the director's choice to simply keep the characters two dimensional in order for the investigative journalism to shine through? If so, mission accomplished and well done. However, was the journalistic investigation interesting enough to warrant a 'Hollywood' story - I'm not sure. I was thirsty to know more about the characters motivations for pursuing this story. I was expecting a hardline connection by the Boston Globe to the Catholic Church in order to give that 'Ah-ha' moment that just never came. I was waiting for that 'Hollywood' moment that told the audience that this is why it warrants the storytelling narrative. I wanted an 'Erin Brockovich' and all I got was everyday 'John Smith'.<br/><br/>What I did enjoy about this film is it's visual tone and production design. I enjoy seeking out time and place in regards to era based on the production design elements. The colours, lighting and depictions of the environment both internal and external were en pointe. Natural tones, Light makeup, non saturated colours assist to translate this as real life events - Well done.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a solid drama, well written with good honest dialogue between the players. Tom McCarthy has done an exceptional job with both the written word and direction. But traditionally we like our protagonists with a healthy does of antagonist, in this instance the catholic church was the antagonist, yet their presence wasn't really felt. They didn't come across as the 'big bad', there was no power struggle, the cover up was just spoken of without being shown. Even the victims stories didn't seem to have that vital punch to help drive home the message of evil. Our protagonist are a vital ingredient to the film recipe and here it was missing altogether. <br/><br/>And finally, a little side note that always seems to 'erk' me with films that are 'Based on Actual Events' and thats the text based epilogue, commenting on what has happened in closing - For me, this is somewhat of a cop-out from film makers. As an audience member, I want my payoff, I want my finale and I want to see it brought to life by the characters I've just invested the last two hours in - I wanted to see the Catholic Church go down for those heinous acts. If I wanted to read about it, I would have written to the Boston Globe and asked for a copy of the story.<br/><br/>In this instance, I yearned for Hollywood to get in the way of a factual story. Deserving of a supporting actor nod for Ruffalo and a writing nod for McCarthy - but best picture? Nope - I'm not sold."

Where a film like All The President's Men succeeds (a clear compatible film) is in a palpable sense of danger. In Spotlight, the main dramatic tension came from making sure The Herald wasn't going to get some unsealed documents first(?). Honestly... who the f**k reads The Herald?Anyway... The unraveling of the bigger picture wasn't as compelling as I wanted it to be. I so desperately was rooting for this movie, because the 70's style cinema brand of talking and sitting (pre-Sorkin cinematic evolutionary 'walk and talk') is right up my alley. My favorite films employ this kind of human story-no big set pieces-just actors being great with great writing... But something was missing. No mystery.

The main problem here is you have a story with heavy subject matter, and a realistic portrayal about how a group of journals might go about solving the problem. But the realism doesn't allow for a dramatic engaging look into the issue that gets to its core, that is hard hitting enough for the subject's weight. Basically it needed someone in the movie to go, ""It's about child rape. What's the moral grey area of that assh-les?"" Instead Mark Ruffalo goes ham but not really.

Led by editor, Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), the team uncover more than one story, but a massive child molestation scandal within the city's Catholic Churches that would bring the issue of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests into the national limelight. Directed & co-written by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight is able to show the power of investigative journalism, and how a small group of journalists were able to take on, a large social entity. Because of that premise alone, the movie kinda remind me, a little bit of 1976's film, All the President's Men with its all-star cast. The main actors that make up, this small group are amazing. Each one of them, really did shine, but if I had to pick, two, it would be Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo. Both really put, most of their emotional weight in this film. There are also strong supporting characters in this movie that it makes many of the minor scenes, very appealing to watch, but if I had to showcase some, I would pick character actors like Stanley Tucci & Billy Crudup. The reason why, I felt they were awesome in their small roles, is because they really did seem like lawyers with hidden agenda to the best degree. Its characters like them that made the film, so engaging. Because of that, the film feels like it hardly has any slow and tedious moments. But if I had to pick a slow moment, it would be any scene dealing with Boston College High School. I found those scenes to be, a bit too controversy and turn-offish to be, worth watching. Still, for the most part, I love how the film delicately balances its focus on giving the story somewhat room to breathe and the survivors their voice. The music by Howard Shore add to it, with its tone of feeling of disgust with a mix of hope. However, some parts of the film, can be a bit confusing with the limited exposition and somewhat rushed, due to the quick pacing. A good example for me, is how I got confused, between dialogue talking about Cardinal Bernard Francis Law (Len Cariou) and that of, Canon Laws. I really didn't know, who or what, they were talking about. There are plenty of dialogue full scenes like that, where a few names, local places, judicial process, and historic events are said by characters that might go over many moviegoer's head. While, I found the movie, somewhat engaging because of the dialogue, I think a little research on the subject matter, beforehand, would help, make sense of it, for the viewer, when watching this film. But if you can't find time to do that, and you going to watch this movie, pay close attention to ever detail in this film because there will be stacks, and stacks of information that your mind has to wrap around. The astrosphere for the film was also great. You really get that feeling, of change, going around. You really do sense, the end of newspaper business with this film with how outdated, some of their methods are. I just love, the details of seeing tons and tons of papers folders, scatter around the office and the journalist calling from, flip phones. It shows the industry in its last hurrah, before getting crush under the weight of online v-blogs, interactive media, & conversation threading. Small talks in the film about how the internet will change, how journalism is run, is amazing to hear. The same with the church; you really get the sense, that social institutions like that, are losing its control on the people. Just ask any Christian today, and you will see more and more people are not as devout, as they use to be. A lot of strong Christians, are even lapsing or questioning, what does it means to a man or woman of the faith. As more and more information is available through the internet, it's easier to see the hypocrisy that Church for so long, try to hide. Indeed, this is the informative age. For the most part this movie is very accuracy to the events that came to be. While, researching for this review, I couldn't find much to couther this. Overall: While, this movie is a bit predictable, much of film's massive appeal, go primarily to the stellar cast, and the screenwriter Josh Singer, who approached the subject matter with palpable and empathy, care. While the movie is Rated R for some language including sexual references, Spotlight is surprising, not that overly graphic. You don't see, any graphic sex scenes, here, just adults talking about how, when they were children, they got molested. It wasn't too much of a turn-off. In the end, while Spotlight isn't for everybody; it's a film worth watching if you get the chance to. After all, horrible things like child molestation must stop."

","One of the best films, if not THE best, that I have seen based on a true story. The acting is great and the directing as well. The spectator soon realises that its intention is not to tell half the story, but the full deal! I was amazed by the persistence of the reporters of the Boston Globe in uncovering a huge case of child molestation by people who are supposedly conveying the word of God to people of faith. It's a must see for anyone involved in the profession of journalism, just to learn how their job should be done. Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of it and I surely hope that it will be rewarded by critics."
"intelearts","10","3","5","10 January 2016"," 571st Review - Outstanding Investigative Drama
","The story of Spotlight - the investigative team at The Boston Globe - who uncovered the abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, is told with such outstanding verve that this viewer was knocked sideways. I cannot recall another film this year that so intelligently and without melodrama produces scene after scene that just leave you wanting to know more.<br/><br/>The all-star stellar cast is underpinned by Keaton, who seems to have proved he has had his comeback - here he focuses on a nicely underplayed performance, and Ruffalo, whose slightly off-kilter manner works to his advantage, and Rachel McAdams, who moves from romantic comedies to this with the ease and promise she showed in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. There is not a dud moment in the film - it really is one of the best films about journalism, and ranks along with All The President's Men.<br/><br/>At the end of the day this is not just a great story, director Tom McCarthy, takes us along emotionally - but does so in such a forensic and well-judged manner that it produces a good mixture of trust and a measure of level-headedness. His script, with West Wings regular Josh Singer, is outstanding, simply the best script of the year that I can recall by quite a margin.<br/><br/>Of all the films I've seen this year, this is the one that tackles its difficult subject with bravery, clarity, and simplicity, but it never loses sight of why it matters. I am a loss to understand why it is not on everyone's Oscar list."

","Spotlight (2015): Dir: Tom McCarthy / Cast: Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci: Captivating film about a group of journalist from the Boston Globe who are focused on, or as the title fittingly puts it, putting the spotlight on over ninety priest who have molested children decades ago and the legal system that covered it up. There are lots of regrets and many speculations that this team is working to bring light to. Michael Keaton heads the operation hoping to convince old colleagues to reverse their previous decision and right previous wrongs. Mark Ruffalo has fun with a rookie role where he saunters about trying to get an attorney, played by Stanley Tucci to allow him to interview past victims. Tucci would prefer that the emotional wounds of these victims not be opened but he soon comes to terms with the importance of not having these incidents happen in the future. Rachel McAdams plays another journalist who is determined to break this story but often meets with rejection. At one point she even has a former priest admitting his wrong until his sister warns her away. Liev Schreiber plays a new arrival who first opens this story up. Director Tom McCarthy handles the film in similar vein as All the President's Men or The Paper with realism in the sets and locations with a touch of paranoia thrown in. The subject is sensitive and controversial but perhaps the film deals this subject because it is handled very discreetly in reality. Now it is given the spotlight it needs to bring the guilty to justice and the victims closer to closure. Score: 10 / 10"
"burlesonjesse5","10","3","5","28 December 2015"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Spotlight
","""I wanna keep digging"" quips the character of Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), a well respected reporter at Beantown's most heralded newspaper. What can I say, I ""dug"" all 128 minutes of the vehicle I'm about to review.<br/><br/>Anyway, for all Academy Award purposes and historical insight, Spotlight is the quintessential best picture nominee. It's secure, by the book filmmaking and that doesn't hurt it in any way. 1976 had All the President's Men, 1981 had Absence of Malice, 2007 had Zodiac, and now 2015 brings us ""Light"". All these films have one thing in common. They are dialogue-driven, feed off paranoia, and resound in crowded newsrooms. ""Nose goes"" gets a nose for the news. Natch!<br/><br/>Taking place in the early 2000's and helmed by director Tom McCarthy, Spotlight moves along like a jack rabbit. Yeah this flick is talky but it never comes off as insipid. There are a lot of continuity cuts between scenes, ensemble acting (where everyone helps each other out) of the highest order, and crackling intrigue inhabiting every frame. Alongside his previous endeavor Birdman, ""Light's"" lead in Michael Keaton, is now two for two. His co-star (Mark Ruffalo) who got nominated for a supporting role via 2014's Foxcatcher, is also batting 1.000.<br/><br/>So yeah there might be a repetition in Spotlight involving every (news reporter) caricature interrogating a victim and/or a suspect. No matter. This Open Road Films release rings true because Josh Singer's screenplay is tight and engrossing. What we have amongst the muck, is the best movie of the year (so far). And just like one of my other top picks (2015's Black Mass), the city of Boston swallows the proceedings whole as if Michael Phelps decided to inhale tons of hot dogs. You want to see actual events depicted that involve a massive cover-up among the Roman Catholic priests? You'll get that in ""Light"". You want the 9/11 attacks to be used effectively as a backdrop? You'll get that as well. You wanna witness a small investigative team unravel the secrets behind so many young churchgoers getting molested? It's all there. And do you want to revel in having the Boston Globe be the locale where all the news shtick goes down? Prego. Finally, do you want a cast that includes Liev Schreiber, Stanley Tucci, Rachel McAdams, and Billy Crudup? Who wouldn't.<br/><br/>All in all, Spotlight involves behind-the-scenes preoccupation in small rooms and quiet, open spaces. Every nuance between the troupers sticks. With its disciplined magnetism and critical darling demur, ""Light"" shines brightly. Rating: 4 stars."

","I went to this movie not expecting much of anything. I had no real opinion either way about the subject nor the film itself.

The next thing shown are three full screens full of a list. I will not say more. <br/><br/>Go see this film. The actors do a fantastic job of telling this story and the power of the events surrounding Boston in 2001.

"magical-kingdom","10","3","5","13 December 2015"," Revelation of unforgivable acts kept under wraps way too long
","Based on the true events, Spotlight takes sharp aim at the Catholic Church and its extensive cover-up of the copious acts of molestation by its priests against child victims throughout the world. Just an objective, powerful retelling of the awful truth we normally try to avoid. The film depicts the investigative research and reporting that finally exposed these heinous crimes. Despite the quality of this film and cast, the disturbingly tragic topic makes this film hard to watch but must be told. Although most are aware of this activity, seeing a list of widespread statistics shown at films end was shocking.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Live Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci, Jamey Sheridan, Billy Crudup, Neal Huff, Paul Guilfoyle all did a commendable job presenting a true life account of The Boston Globe's expose on the shocking Catholic Church scandal involving its clergy's sex scandals in molestations thru out the city's parishes,a great depiction of the influence and awesome power the Catholic Church had in the city. It shows how they tried in 100% of cases to hide and/or move pedophile priests. The Catholic act of confession enabled these priests to confess child rape to another and be forgiven,thereby opening the gate of permission for a new priest hearing their confession to commit rape and get away with it. This caused pedophilia to run rampant through Boston and the Catholic church,where there were at least 250 known pedophile priests, and over 1,000 victims.<br/><br/>There could be no doubt that the Cardinal had complete knowledge and choose to cover it up. Hiring lawyers to defend offenders,who were sworn to secrecy/confidentiality. Boston Globe's journalists had an extremely difficult time obtaining records that had disappeared,having to threaten lawyers to confirm and provide them with information.<br/><br/>There were 600 follow up stories. The public was submitting letters of opinion and demanding the Cardinal's resignation. Cardinal Law did resign but was transferred to a post in Rome. An average citizen aiding/abetting a crime of this nature would be sent to prison which earns our Judicial system another black mark. Injustice,cruelty and taking advantage of another person infuriates me.<br/><br/>The film is receiving quite a lot of recognition which will I'm certain not be earned by box office receipts due to the nature of the subject and the uncomfortable feeling it will impose on viewers. However,even if it doesn't receive any awards having the issue in the public's eye is a plus."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","9","4","8","1 March 2016"," Powerfully told story
","I'm not the first person to say this, but Spotlight probably is the best journalism movie since All the President's Men. It starts with Martin Baron (Liev Schreiber), who plays the new editor of the Boston Globe, catching on to a potentially explosive story that nobody seems to be covering in great detail – the sexual molestation of young boys by Catholic clergy. So he assigns the Globe's ""spotlight"" team to the story – a close-knit group of journalists who uncover the biggest scandals in Boston. Michael Keaton leads the team consisting of Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and a few others as they delve into one of the most important journalism investigations of our time. <br/><br/>The execution of Spotlight is what really made it the best picture winner at the Oscars. The way it delves into the journalistic process – the countless interviews, the research, piecing things together with scant evidence until you get the smoking gun – that's what keeps you watching this movie. A journalism investigation is not exactly something you think would hold your attention for two hours, but it does. It is also a very tightly edited film – each scene moves the story forward and not a moment is wasted or excessive. <br/><br/>What I especially admire about Spotlight is its low key feel and humble nature. It celebrates the value of investigative reporting while acknowledging that journalists really dropped the ball by not pursuing this story sooner. It gives this serious issue the importance it deserves while asking the question – why did it take people, particularly journalists, so long to act? All of the pieces were there for them to put together. Could they have done something sooner? And it does all this with very few manipulative, Oscar baity moments. It lets the story stand for itself. <br/><br/>Spotlight is a triumph of good story telling with little flash or style, and there's nothing wrong with that."
"eddie_baggins","8","4","8","29 February 2016"," A moving true tale with an on song ensemble
","Calling Spotlight an enjoyable film would be wrong due to its heavy subject matter, but Thomas McCarthy's film is from the get-go an engaging and finely produced piece of filmmaking that aptly shines a light on a pivotal moment in journalistic history that changed the world's views of Catholicism for ever.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Spotlight sees McCarthy somehow wash himself clean of the stench that was The Cobbler and dust off any fears we may've therefore harboured for him as a filmmaker to deliver his most ambitious and loaded film to date, that also sees him for the first time handle such a powerful story and pedigree cast.<br/><br/>Famous for intimate character studies such as The Station Agent and The Visitor, McCarthy forgoes his tendency to delve into characters over scenarios to focus his story directly into the Boston Globe newspaper's investigation into abuse cover up in the Catholic Church system. Doing so allows McCarthy to let the story take hold on the viewer and the enormity of the situation wash over us as we realise just what was being uncovered by these reporters, and without ever playing up situations for easy emotional pay offs, McCarthy delivers hits without an air of melodrama or cinematic tricks, no doubt aware that the material speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Saying that the story is the star player here would however take away from a finely tuned ensemble that's led by another great Michael Keaton performance and both a reminder of Mark Ruffalo's talents and Rachel McAdam's ability when given the right substances to work with, although her Oscar nomination feels somewhat strange. Each actor brings a subtle nuance to their incarnations and they act as another telling example of McCarthy's (an actor himself) ability to not only direct and write, but draw out excellent performances from his cast's.<br/><br/>Spotlight is an astutely crafted investigation procedural that never strays to far from what you'd expect from such a tale but with a winning script and a likable cast of performers it's a high quality production that could've benefited ever so slightly from a larger focus towards the cinematic.<br/><br/>In light of this however, Spotlight is a quietly powerful and sometimes devastating look at a topic that continues to be played out daily in far too many cities around the world.<br/><br/>4 foreboding church buildings out of 5"

","Many people, judging by media reports, still seem to be a bit shell shocked that Spotlight hopped over The Revenant to win the Best Picture Oscar yesterday. The bookies as we know had Revenant ahead. But so did lots of other commentators. <br/><br/>I was glad Spotlight won. Always thought it was a better overall film. At first hearing it may not seem much like a movie that would be of wide interest. A bunch of investigative journalists uncovering a story of widespread child molestation by the clergy in Boston. Yup, sounds interesting conceptually but perhaps too serious a subject matter for an afternoon's entertainment?<br/><br/>Actually, try it out. The team of journalists at the Boston Globe, all have fleshed out characters, look vibrant and engaged in what they are doing, and act well as an ensemble. No one big dominating hero here.

"anteksw","9","4","8","2 February 2016"," A Riveting & Important Piece of Cinema
","With 'The Hateful Eight' being my favourite film of 2015, it's pretty obvious that I enjoy dialogue-driven movies which showcase true talent... and thankfully, 'Spotlight' is one of those movies. This film arrived at a perfect time - with the internet slowly killing off print media and people forgetting about the significance of investigative journalism, Tom McCarthy reminds us that real news can have a massive impact in the corrupted world we live in. Watching 'Spotlight' at the cinema restored my faith in the current state of the film industry - alongside all the reboots and mindless action flicks, important works of art are still being created and distributed across the world, and I am truly glad I had the chance to support this film.<br/><br/>'Spotlight' tells the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, but it also explores the painful trauma of those unfortunate victims and the sheer determination of some amazing journalists to get those voices heard and make things right. It's one of those riveting stories that keep you on the edge of your seat simply through a great script and stellar performances; Mark Ruffalo amazed me in particular with his energetic and captivating performance, and even two lesser-known actors (Michael Cyril Creighton and Jimmy LeBlanc) portraying two of the victims managed to impress me quite a lot in their short yet emotionally powerful roles. In short, the casting for this film was perfect - each actor gave their best and worked off the expertly written script wonderfully.<br/><br/>On the technical side of things, the film doesn't exactly ""impress"", the camera work isn't anything special - simple shots with simple compositions creating and showing what's necessary, and that's okay. The film doesn't need to be visually impressive, it needs to be coherent and represent the story in an appropriate manner... which is what it achieves. If I had to pick out a negative aspect, it would have to be the soundtrack - it's somewhat typical, simplistic and it enters the film way too often, generally making some of the transitions feel either awkward or forced. But that's it, that's the only flaw I could think of in this otherwise magnificent piece of cinema. 'Spotlight' is not just an impressive achievement, it's an important film that needs to be seen by everyone, which is why I'm giving it a solid 9,2/10."
"heisenberg12","6","4","8","15 January 2016"," Good, but Overrated B Movie
","I just watched this movie. Once is enough. It's a very good ""B"" movie, but I found it overrated and over-hyped. It wasn't bad or anything, but just a solid low budget film.<br/><br/>The cast really gave it their all, and I would praise them for their performances, especially Ruffalo, McAdams, and my favorite was actually Schreiber, who I'm surprised was overlooked (maybe he didn't have enough screen time here).<br/><br/>The fact is that in my humble opinion, this film was boring because it was very repetitive. It was just one reporter after another constantly sitting down with a new victim or lawyer or knocking on a door or sitting down in the office discussing the case. There was little suspense that proposed any truly dramatic effect on the characters. For example, in a similar film, see The Insider about the nicotine investigation and whistle blower, where Michael Mann uses threats on his main characters' life and family to elevate the tension and drama. The effect is much more compelling and riveting.<br/><br/>That's not to say that what they provided wasn't sufficient, but there was ultimately no escalation in climactic events, and that's where this redundancy I mention became apparent. I found myself looking at my watch to see how much longer the movie would last because the scenes were also ""chippy"". What I mean by that is that they were all super short (seemingly 2-3 minutes multiplied by (scenes)=_____) in this repetitiveness.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I'm sorry, but I don't see it. I don't see all of the award praise and favoritism. That's why I wanted to see it- to see if it was as good as what I heard, but it honestly fell short for me. It is a great low budget movie with good performances, but nothing special."
"Rendanlovell","8","4","8","27 December 2015"," A better version of Concussion.
","'Spotlight' is based on a true story about some really terrible things that happened in Boston just over ten years ago. What we see is the process the reporters behind this story took to uncover this awful story. In many movies like this the film can't resist making its main characters heros and the people they are going against the epitome of evil. One movie that comes to mind that did this was 'Concussion'. It set up Doctor Omalu as a hero and the NFL as the most evil corporation on the face of the planet. Fortunately, 'Spotlight' is not one of these films. It's one that understands how far subtly can go. And how far honesty can and should go. This is what makes 'Spotlight' stand apart from virtually every film in this genre. It displays some serious restraint on the part of writer/director Tom McCarthy. He seems to have such intimate knowledge about both this case and how we, as humans, react to things of this nature. <br/><br/>This allows this story to unfold in the most natural way possible. It lets the audience feel exactly what these people are feeling. Thats what I loved about this film. It lets this riveting story unfold in such a way that lets you basically relieve the story as if it was happening right now. Each new reveal that we get not only throws its characters and audience further on our heads.<br/><br/>Which is exactly what the film wants. It wants to show how horrible people can be without hardly anyone knowing about it. What's scarier about this film is how some people do know about things like this but sweep it under the rug to avoid unwanted attention. In fact this film is exactly what 'Concussion' should have been. Both are about roughly the same issue except this film views it from a third party perspective. <br/><br/>Which, again, allows the film to unfold in the very best way possible. Although I felt as though the film was a little too restrained at times. It wanted us to feel the heft of the situation and, for the most part, it does. Except, it holds back certain ideas that keep the film from thoroughly realizing its true potential. We don't learn a whole lot about our characters and that keeps us from really investing in this story. We see them uncovering and reacting to everything but they all react the same way. No one seems to have a unique view on anything. <br/><br/>This is really the only thing that holds the film back from being the best film of the year. It doesn't quite let you fully get into things due to too much restraint on the characters part. But that doesn't stop the film from being an intensely scary look at corporations and religion. It's a beautifully realized film that is perfectly crafted and executed by both its cast and director."

","What's unique and extraordinary about ""Spotlight"" is that you never feel as if you're viewing a film. You feel you're watching real- life journalists uncover the greatest sex-abuse scandal in American history. Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" is about the journalism heroes at the Boston Globe who told the disturbing true story of how the Catholic Church covered up the wide-scale rape and sexual assault of young kids all over the entire world. The scary thing is that the Boston Globe thought it was just in Boston that this sickening trend was occurring in, but later discovered it was all over the world, being covered up by the Vatican. Tom McCarrthy crafts this win of non-fiction perfectly, giving you the daily lives of the investigative journalists who broke the silence and did the reporting. Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schrieber and Rachel McAdams all give amazing performances that feel so authentic and so real. Each actor studied their real life characters to the most specific detail, and the result is the absence of actors and the bringing to life of real people who did extraordinary things. ""Spotlight"" is a disturbing story, but a story that needs to be told, and exposes a horrible story of abuse."

It shows step by step how they found out about it and how the Catholic church does everything in its power to block them.<br/><br/>Powerful and frightening drama. It's not a loud movie. It's all talk and moves slowly but I was never bored. I'm a native Bostonian and I remember when this story broke. However this movie reveals a LOT more that was never made public. I was VERY angry by the end. It makes it clear that the church knew very well was going on and did nothing to stop it. Even worse they kept transferring the priests from parish to parish spreading the abuse. The movie treats this in a matter of fact way making it all the more powerful. It was beautifully filmed in and around Boston. It's easy to see why this got a Golden Globe nod for Best Direction and an Oscar for Best Picture. All the cast is good--especially McAdams and Ruffalo. When Ruffalo loses control at the end it's shocking. A long and depressing film that will make you angry but it's a must-see movie."
"jadepietro","10","4","8","22 November 2015"," Sins of the Fathers
","(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended. <br/><br/>In brief: This powerful yet restrained exposé of the sexual crimes against children should be required viewing by all.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-<br/><br/>Tom McCarthy's Spotlight takes its laser-sharp aim at the Catholic Church and its extensive cover-up of many pedophile acts by its priests against hundreds of child victims throughout the world. The film focuses in on the beginnings of these cases, going back to 1976, and depicts the investigative research and reporting that finally exposed these heinous crimes.<br/><br/>￼We immediately are drawn to a group of top-notch columnists at the Boston Globe as they begin to follow some leads and theories into certain alleged acts that have been overlooked by many parishioners and various institutions throughout the city, including the newspaper itself. The film is a riveting behind-the-scenes look at this story and it thoroughly captures the ennui and the sense of passion and discovery that goes into the job of a reporter brilliantly, with its subtle touches of paper-shrouded desktops and tight cubicles littered with post-notes and family photographs.<br/><br/>￼Based on the true events, the film is interested in reporting the facts of the long research- extensive process and its impact on the investigative team called Spotlight, a team that will later go on to win a Pulitzer Prize for its exposé. The acting is wonderful, one of the strongest ensembles this year. Mark Ruffalo plays the overworked lead reporter, Michael Rezendes, and he shows the characters' inner strength and stamina with a performance that understates the horror he sees as he talks to the various victims and fights for their cause. Rachel McAdams delivers one of her finest roles as Sacha Pfeiffer, a lapse Catholic. Her scene where she interviews a suspected priest is particularly memorable in its matter-of-fact conversation. Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll, the third reporter on the team, brings the physical outrage front and center. Adding yeoman-like support are Liev Schreiber and John Slattery as the editors who helped to break the story, and Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, an obsessed lawyer fighting for his young clients' rights. All are splendid, as are Jamey Sheridan, Billy Crudup, Neil Huff, and Len Cariou as the unethical Cardinal Law.<br/><br/>￼But it is Micheal Keaton who is the standout in his supporting turn as Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, the chief editor of the Spotlight team. The actor layers his character with an underlining grace and intelligence. He interprets this role by playing Robby as a soft-spoken observer and hardened professional and it is such a nuanced and completely believable performance. The character leads the team on its steady course amid subtle threats and allegations and Keaton leads and centers the other actors around his straightforward portrayal. One hopes that his work he will not go unnoticed during award season.<br/><br/>￼The director, who also wrote the screenplay along with Josh Singer, uses his narrative skills masterfully. The film relies heavily on its insightful dialog and well-defined characters. Much of the film is talk with very little action, but the story itself is thoroughly engrossing. McCarthy also uses strong imagery to reinforce his film, with scenes of the massive Catholic churches dwarfing and overshadowing the smaller houses and playgrounds within the city to maximum effect (Kudos to Masanobu Takayanagi's cinematography, Howard Shore's non-intrusive music score, and Tom McArdle's effective editing.)<br/><br/>￼The film shies away from lurid details and is, at times, too restrained than needed. It sidesteps any real melodrama and resists the urge to manipulate its audience and toy with their emotions. Rather, it fully encompasses the scandal in a by-the book approach to its subject, a clinical remote approach, and lets the moviegoer learn more and more about the cases as the evidence is slowly revealed. In fact, the only emotional tirade comes from the lead reporter only once in the film, literally about the sins of the Fathers. There is no other hysterical outbursts or angry speeches, no sound and fury in telling this tale, just an objective and powerful retelling of the awful truth that we normally try to avoid.<br/><br/>￼Spotlight uncovers the truths and tells its story in a honest and gripping way. It's just the facts you see up there on the screen, no matter how ugly the truth may be. Go see this film, it's one of the year's best.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"pefrss","10","4","8","21 November 2015"," I have no faith that priests can live without sex
","This is a well made, well acted movie. Worth while seeing. Reading the reviews there is one review which claims that the story was really broken by Kirsten Lombardi working for an alternative Boston paper called Phoenix. She does not get any credit in this movie. I have found often that these alternative papers dig out a good story and because they do not have the resources of big newspapers are not able to follow up the same way. Nowadays there is not much money for investigative journalism anywhere. Everything is owned by a few corporations who impose their agenda on the news staff, which is very sad and worry-some. This movie also shows that journalists embedded in a community may not question thoroughly those which have been their friends since childhood and who may threaten their survival in that community. It sometimes takes an outsider to force the spotlight on things. That became evident in the journalist played by Michael Keaton. First I suspected that he might have been molested himself, but then it turned out that he had ignored the story twenty years prior though it was served to him on a platter. In this respect the movie was well rounded and realistic. It is also realistic about the abuse children had to suffer by priests. I was raised Catholic, I never encountered an abusive priest during my childhood. But there were plenty of indications that priests were suspected to have sex. With their housekeeper or with devoted church ladies. I remember people making jokes about it and finding it okay. In my personal opinion I consider it abuse that the Catholic church forces priests and nuns to live a sexless life. It is against nature and obviously nature takes revenge. If priests and nuns could marry the Catholic church would probably not have such a huge shortage of people willing to serve. I have left the Catholic church the moment I legally could. As a woman I saw no role models and no place for me. I looked at all the other religions in this world and decided that none of them appeals to me. Religion may be a comfort to some people, but it also seems to be the breeding ground for so much hate and so much violence. So for decades I have lived happily without religion or faith. A strange thing happened to me and a few dozen of other movie go-ers while trying to see the movie. We were informed by the theater management that they could not show the movie because they did not have permission. We were refunded and offered to see other movies instead. This was a first for me in decades of movie going. I ended up seeing this movie in a different theater run by a different company, they obviously had permission"

","I went into this film with an open mind. just having come fresh off ""The Revenant"", I was expecting a good drama. with people you care about and people you could connect with. but when viewing this movie, I got a two hour long snore fest that makes ""The Host"" from 2013 look like an Oscar contender. ""Spotlight"" is one of the most over hyped movies of the 2015 award season.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" follows the Boston Globe's Spotlight team's investigation of child abuse in the Boston area by the local priests. It stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup.<br/><br/>Everyone describes this movie as ""The best drama of 2015"" to which I say What movie did you people watch? The movie is incredibly BORING. There's no drama, you don't connect with any of the characters portrayed in the film, and there's no intensity. Now, when I watch a movie, I expect good acting, a good story, good characters, good direction, and most importantly, a good bond between me and the people on screen.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, both Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams give some fantastic performances. Easily worthy of Oscar nominations. Michael Keaton on the other hand, is once again a horrible actor. This movie did not make me like him any more than what I previously did. Granted I didn't review last year's Birdman, but I watched it and thought it was a garbage movie that made no sense. I hated him in ""Birdman"" and I hated him now in ""Spotlight."" Don't quit your day job Mr. Keaton, that's all I can really say about you. As for the other actors, the film was so boring to me I don't remember how the other actors preformed.<br/><br/>At two hours and eight minutes, ""spotlight"" dragged on as if it was 2 months and 8 days. it just wouldn't end. Now, ""The Revenant"" is Two hours and Thirty-Six minutes Long. I had just come off of watching that movie, and it felt like One hour and 10 Minutes.<br/><br/>Overall ""Spotlight"" is an over hyped, waste of time that should not be watched. This movie should be a 0.1% because of how boring it is. 8.9% is FAR to Generous. DO NOT watch this movie. save your money and go watch ""Room"". ""Room"" has a much better Narrative, better characters that you root for, a much better plot, and better acting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, IMDb doesn't allow you to give movies 0 stars or 0 out of 10s, so I have to live with giving ""Spotlight"" a 1 out of 10. An awful disgrace of a movie which should never be viewed by everyone. If you're an Academy Member and you're reading this, DO NOT vote for this movie. there are FAR better award movies out such as ""The Martian"", ""Mad Max Fury Road"", ""Room"", ""The Revenant"", and even ""Carol"".<br/><br/>Final Rating: 1/10. (0 out of 10 if I were allowed to.)"
"CubsandCulture","10","2","3","23 February 2019"," Powered by an exceptional screenplay
","I have watched this film 3 times and each time I am in awe at how finely tuned the screenplay is in terms of both the issues and the storytelling. The script, for example, both demonstrates the power of the media while bluntly criticizing the Globe for not putting the pieces together sooner. It makes the characters not saints but people who did their job well and did a service for the community. Likewise, by including a spectrum of reactions among Catholics (lapsed I some cases) the film manages to criticizes the Catholic hierarchy without criticizing the Catholic faith. The accounts of the victims contain enough detail to bring into focus the awfulness of sexual assault without being obscene or sensationalist.<br/><br/>But best of all, each scene feels included for the sake of the story. So, for example, when Mike blows up and gives voice to feeling betrayed it is both to give voice to that sort of reaction and a natural outgrowth of Mike's character. It explains why he had been such a workaholic on this story. Nothing feels included to shape the societal points and yet the more you look at the information presented a hell of lot of societal points are made. The script is one of the best ever written.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the masterful script is brought to life by a great cast and simply but effective direction. This is truly a great film."

","Spotlight is such an important and powerful film. This is the story of a team of Boston Globe journalists who discovered how the church was hiding many pedophile priests giving them no real punishments. This film won Best Picture about three years ago and it totally deserved it. What makes this movie so great is that it decided to showcase the complete journalism process, the way we start to see our four reporters start to uncover the truth is amazing. It's not about the drama or the personal struggles of a particular character, it's about how a journalist does his or her job, and why it's important. Apart from that, it doesn't shy away from the subject matter of pedophiles. On one particular scene Sacha, the character amazingly played by Rachel McAdams, says: ""Language is going to be really important here. The word 'molest' isn't going to be enough"". And that's totally it, we get the hard and difficult truth of the actual events that happened with no sugarcoating.
The overall look and tone of the film was beautiful, there are a couple shots that took my breath away. And this top level of filmmaking complements the top level acting from the whole ensemble.
This movie is so real it actually terrifies me about the situation they uncovered. It's the truth, which can be really hard and disturbing, but it's the whole truth."

It also never feels mawkish or preachy, traps that it also could have fallen into.<br/><br/>While it is a deliberate and relatively slow-paced film, it didn't leave me bored for a second, instead gluing me in with its excellent performances across the board, how it tells its story, it's beautifully balanced screenplay and sheer class. Tom McCarthy's direction has all the class and professionalism that 'Spotlight' needed.<br/><br/>Other strengths are the way it's filmed, it's very atmospheric and evocative in its detail and the cinematography is gritty and ravishing.

"zapatajustin","9","2","3","19 February 2017"," ""Spotlight"" uncovering the dark secrets of the Catholic church
","How far would you go to uncover the dark secrets of the world's largest institute? The Roman Catholic Church a place where people go to find peace and comfort is now tainted with allegations of priest's molesting and raping young boys and girls. In this captivating drama that is based on true events it is up to a team of news reporters to uncover the truth behind it all. I really enjoyed this movie even though going into it I had no idea what it was going to be about. The way ""Spotlight"" is set up is incredibly done and it leaves you feeling dumbstruck because you would have never guessed the outrages actions people did to cover this scandal up. <br/><br/>Like I said I had no idea what the plot of this movie was and at the beginning of this movie I could tell this was going to be a very serious. As this movie progressed, I was constantly shocked, surprised, and floored by a remarkably well written, directed, and acted film. This movie truly blew me away. ""Spotlight"" is very subdued in a lot of ways, the movie doesn't make the news reporters look like heroes but rather look like actual news reporters who love their job and just want the truth of this scandal to reach the public. The fact that this is based on a true story is absolutely incredible. ""Spotlight"" directed by Tom McCarthy and with great Hollywood stars like Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo and Liev Schreiber ""Spotlight"" hit the big screen in November 2015. <br/><br/>In 2001, editor of the Boston Globe Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) assigns a team of journalist to investigate allegations against a priest named John Geoghan, who was accused of molesting over 80 boys in the city of Boston. Led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), who runs a team of reporters such as Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Sachas Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), interview the rape victims of these priest and uncover sensitive information that would relieve the truth of what is really going on within the Roman Catholic Church. These brave reporters make is their mission to find proof that there is a cover-up of sexual abuse of girls and boys by the priest that are said to make these children feel safe within the Roman Catholic Church. No matter how many obstacles these reporters faced nothing would stop them from uncovering the truth. <br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is a film that is so well acted and directed that as you watch it you almost forget that you are actually watching a film, you feel like it is a documentary. The story is so well told that you truly feel these true events are happening right before your eyes despite the fact you know you are looking at Michael Keaton and you know he played Batman or the fact that Mark Ruffalo is the Hulk. Michael Keaton is fantastic in this film and the performance he delivers is absolutely breathtaking with his snarky remarks and straight forward attitude. But the one scene that really tugged on my heart strings was when Mark Ruffalo's character, wanting to publish the story early because he knew that this injustice in the Catholic Church needed to be put in the light but Michael Keaton's characters knew that waiting was the right call because the team still needed more informations to truly take this institute down. Ruffalo's heart warming speech was so well acted it truly had me feel his emotions right through the screen. <br/><br/>This film truly excels in making the audience feel for these victims and the reporters trying to get their stories out there. With amazing performances from all of the cast and a great director behind the chair this movie truly is worth watching. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know the truth of how real journalism works and that it is a tough job as any. This film is definitely for a more mature audience and I wouldn't recommend it for children but showing this film to a child would teach them a valuable lesson and that is the world is a dark and scary place but you shouldn't be afraid to seek the truth."
"barryrd","8","2","3","9 February 2017"," Spotlight on the Church
","I just watched this movie for the first time concerning a massive cover-up of pedophile priests by the Catholic Church in Boston. I liked the investigative team that went after the story, actors Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams. Ruffalo and McAdams showed the instincts and spunk of true reporters. Once they smelled a rat, they pursued the story relentlessly getting the facts needed to make public aware of the cover-up that kept pedophiles from answering for their crimes. Keaton was the boss who had to ensure the hard evidence was secured to give credibility to the story. Michael Keaton is compelling as the guy who grew up in Boston, attended Boston College and became one of the boys on the golf course hobnobbing with lawyers and journalists. But he knew things were not right in the way his hometown and its dominant religious body was dealing with a grave injustice that was wrecking the lives of many young people. We get the sense of life in Boston with its love of sports and homespun camaraderie, something of a foil to deflect crimes lurking on its own dark side. The new kid on the block, Liev Screiber, is the one who unleashes the hounds as he tries to break through the easygoing veneer of official Boston, particularly its clergy and its lawyers. He shows the uneasiness of a man who doesn't quite fit in but gives his team the support they need to get the story out. A fine movie with great acting from the above as well as Stanley Tucci, John Slattery and Jamie Sheridan. This is a movie that reminds people that institutions have to account for injustice and cover-ups aimed at protecting their sacred turf."

"lee_eisenberg","10","2","3","1 June 2016"," speak up for the truth
","Tom McCarthy's look at the Boston Globe investigation that exposed sexual abuse committed by priests hits all the right notes. As with ""All the President's Men"", even though we know the outcome it's still a riveting story. Part of the point that ""Spotlight"" makes is that the widespread cover-up of pedophilia in the Catholic Church required the complicity of all parties (you may have heard that evil succeeds when good people do nothing). The reporters who started looking into the story had no idea just how big it was going to be.<br/><br/>The movie's Best Picture win was well deserved. Not only does it look at this specific story, but it reminds the audience of the importance of investigative journalism. Investigative journalism is one of the main tools of holding the powerful accountable. The people at the Boston Globe knew that it was a risk to take on one of the world's largest and most powerful entities, but also knew that it was the right thing to do.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, and the rest of the cast put in fine performances. The characters refuse to waver in their determination to expose the truth. The fact that, following the publication, so many more people came forth and talked about having gotten molested shows how much power the church had over people (especially since the pedophile priests simply got moved to other parishes and did the same thing all over again).<br/><br/>Another movie focusing on pedophilia in the church is John Patrick Shanley's ""Doubt"" starring Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams."

","Spotlight is a drama film starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber. Based on the true story of the Boston Globe's uncovering of child sex abuse by Catholic priests, it is one of the best acted dramas I have ever seen.

"brchthethird","10","2","3","21 April 2016"," A compelling and sobering portrait of investigative journalism
","Did SPOTLIGHT deserve to win Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards? Maybe, I guess. I still haven't seen all of the nominees yet, but even still I recognize that SPOTLIGHT is an excellent film. Based on true events, it tells how the Boston Globe broke the story about a massive cover-up of pedophile priests in the Catholic Church. It also features an incredible ensemble cast who, although not given much to do individually, work great together in service of a very compelling (and saddening) story. Out of the five actors given top billing, I would say that Liev Schreiber and Mark Ruffalo fare the best, although the rest of the cast don't slouch by any means. Rachel McAdams is perhaps the weakest out of the bunch, but even she mostly holds her own. Far and away, the most important takeaways are the devotion to pursuing the truth no matter where it leads you, as well as the integrity necessary in investigative journalism. Some people have called this the greatest journalism movie since ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, but I still need to see that in order to make such a comparison. Briefly touching on other matters, I thought the score and cinematography were quite adequate enough to elevate this beyond something that would normally play as a made-for-HBO movie. In particular, I liked the use of substantial tracking shots, which visually reinforced the winding and interconnected paths that the Globe's spotlight team go on in pursuit of their story. Ultimately, there is a lot in here that could shake one's faith in humanity and human institutions, particularly religion, however I never felt like they demonized anyone. It merely acknowledged the imperfections and, some of the time, willful negligence of said institutions and the communities they serve, while also aspiring to better accountability in both. Best Picture winner or not, SPOTLIGHT is hands down one of the best that 2015 had to offer."

The events of ""Spotlight"" at the editorial staff of The Boston Globe happened 2001, when the internet was new to the big crowd and journalists had time for deep research work because of a lot of print readers (and enough money available for good work. Because when things run massively wrong in society, like in this terrible case at the Catholic Church, it needs dedicated people, who look deeply behind the smokescreen. The movie shows, how difficult it is, to mess with established institutions like the church, because people don't want to know, that with this savior they believe in, something totally going wrong. The members of the Spotlight team are true heroes, working in the background. The movie put a spotlight on their outstanding work."
"michaelmunkvold","8","2","3","5 April 2016"," A familiar story, but well-told
","If you've seen one movie about journalists, you've seen them all. They're like intellectual versions of the ""Rocky"" movies, with reporters as plucky underdogs who beat the odds. With ""Spotlight"", the story of how the Boston Globe uncovered 30 years of child sexual abuse in the Boston Archdiocese, the elements are all there: the intrepid reporters facing impossible odds, the shadowy good ol' boy networks blocking the investigation, the world-weary editor putting everything on the line, and justice being done in the end.<br/><br/>While the film doesn't break any new ground, however, it does do a very good job of telling the story of one of the last feats of real investigative journalism in America. There are no surprises here, even if you don't know anything about the sexual abuse crisis in the Church. But for all its predictability, ""Spotlight"" has moments of real brilliance, and knows the world it inhabits inside and out.<br/><br/>In 2001, Boston Globe reporters Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) and Sasha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) start investigating John Geoghan, a priest who molested hundreds of boys. They uncover evidence that the Catholic Church has been covering up decades of priest sex abuse and shuffling the offenders from parish to parish, allowing them to molest with impunity. Of course, the Church throws its full weight behind killing the story, but senior editors Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton) and Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) take on the corruption with help from Mitch Garebedian (Stanley Tucci), a lawyer representing the priests' victims.<br/><br/>I worked as a reporter for several years, and every detail of the investigative process portrayed in this movie rang true for me, often painfully so. It captures the thrill of chasing an important story and the frustration of hitting a dead end. It knows that a reporter's job is a thankless one, but that the small moments of triumph - a detail that puts everything together, your name on a front page story, an approving nod from your editor - make it all worthwhile. It's rare, and refreshing, to see a movie about people who love their jobs.<br/><br/>The top-billed stars, Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo, are okay, not great; they're at best blandly competent, occasionally slipping into ham territory with wide-eyed monologues of righteous indignation. This is a supporting actor's movie. As a lawyer for the Archdiocese who tries to block the story, Jamey Sheridan is compelling as the kind of reluctant accomplice who allows these sorts of crimes to go unpunished in the name of ""just doing his job""; he seems aged before his time by years of unacknowledged guilt. Keaton and Schrieber are nicely understated as men who have given their lives to a profession that is changing faster than they can adapt, old school guys who hate having to care about the online edition. Tucci is fantastic as a true advocate, a man who has spent years fighting for what's right and has the scars to prove it.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is at heart an old-fashioned story about good triumphing over evil through dogged work and unbending belief. It's a story all the more satisfying for the fact that it is true. It's a little by-the-numbers, but that's okay; it's nice to know that there is a formula for good people doing the right thing."
"sukanya-samy","9","2","3","1 April 2016"," Spotlight - What a movie
","Cardinal Law: '.A city flourishes when great institutions stand and together.'<br/><br/>Marty Barton: 'Personally I'm of the opinion that for a paper to best perform its function, it really needs to stand alone.'<br/><br/>This really sets the tone for Spotlight, a hard hitting movie about how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal single handed-ly about child molestation within the local Catholic Archdiocese. This is how great stories are told and more importantly this is how true stories are told. The movie is not easy to watch, not even for normal people but especially for children and adults who have gone through series of rapes and molestation by people they trust the most, people who are messengers of God. And the numbers are not small – the list of geographies and states the movie states at the end show you how deeply entrenched this problem is.<br/><br/>The movie does not try to sensationalize this subject, exactly how journalism is supposed to be conducted. It somehow reminded me of Zodiac (2007), a true story which became a great movie. The depth of the research and the portrayal of characters is simply outstanding. I have been reading about the making of this movie and its great that actors like Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are humble enough to get into their characters and learn from the actual people they are portraying. Just shows the discipline with which some movies are made. Liev Schreiber has a smaller role but he portrays the intensity of the real Marty Barton really solidly – Marty Barton must have had such clarity of thought to believe that it is the system that needs to be addressed, not the individual people who committed these crimes.<br/><br/>It also shows how faith comes crashing down, how painful it is to know that the people you think are the holiest are just as human as anybody else out there. It shows how frightened a society is, especially when it comes to uncovering something that everybody knows about but haven't done a thing about.<br/><br/>Its these small, humanizing factors that makes Spotlight what it is. It is brilliantly directed, the editing is tight and the movie keeps you on edge while dealing with a very sensitive topic. Its got 6 Oscar nominations and I am definitely rooting for Mark Ruffalo. I like the way he can play this puppy-dog-romantic and also act with intensity that really makes you believe in that character."

","I saw this movie before the Oscar winners were announced. I wasn't particularly attracted to it, as although the subject matter sounded interesting, I was fearful that it might be a rather plodding film – about journalists slowly uncovering a scandal that is no longer as shocking as it was back in 2001.<br/><br/>(Indeed, does anything shock us anymore?)<br/><br/>As with Brooklyn, I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>In many ways, this is an old-fashioned type of film and brings to mind similar films such as ""All The Presidents Men"". Spotlight, is a well-made, thoroughly professional film that was a joy to watch. It relates the true events of The Boston Globe's investigative reporting unit, who uncovered widespread abuse of children by catholic priests in the Boston diocese. Even more, it uncovered the indefensible and disgraceful cover-ups by senior clergy – in particular, the head of the archdiocese, Cardinal Bernard Law – in order to protect the perpetrators and the 'good name' of their church.<br/><br/>Spotlight was the title of the Boston Globe's four-person unit that went into battle against the powerful catholic establishment.They came under enormous pressure from those on high to cease and desist.<br/><br/>The film traces events back to the very start of the investigation when there weren't even enough facts to make a publishable story. Later, when it became clear that there was indeed a verifiable story which involved a single abusive priest; the editor refused to publish the story until they had uncovered the whole sorry mess. It was only after the Spotlight team succeeded in gaining access to hitherto court protected documents that they were able to blow the scandal wide open. As soon as their story was published, hundreds more victims of abuse came forward to give their own stories of abuse at the hands of Catholic priests in the Boston area.<br/><br/>One priest alone was revealed to have raped or molested 130 children for decades while Cardinal Law moved him around to different churches rather than going to the authorities and having him charged. Cardinal Law also orchestrated secret settlements for claims of abuse made against at least seventy of his priests, in which families were paid to keep silent about the molestation and rape of their children. The cardinal resigned after the story became public, but two years later he was promoted to a prestigious position in the Vatican by Pope John Paul.<br/><br/>Since the Spotlight's gritty exposition in 2002, the mass sexual abuse of children has been uncovered in the Catholic Church – not only throughout the United States but all over the world.<br/><br/>The tight paced direction, the great music score, and the brilliant ensemble acting by Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery – and especially Mark Ruffalo – have all made this a film well worth watching. I promise you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Along with most people, I was fully expecting The Revenant to get the nod for Best Picture, and I actually cheered out loud when they announced the most coveted Oscar of all went to Spotlight. It deserved it."

I enjoyed Tom McCarthy's take on this, and I wasn't sure I would be able to say that. He directed 2012, and Meet the Parents - both good movies in their own way, but directing a historically important movie like Spotlight is a little different.<br/><br/>Great casting choices all around. And it didn't take me out of the moment for even a second, when I noticed that they all had barely-there Boston accents. It takes place in Boston, mission accomplished.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a rewatch."

","Spotlight, the four person team working for the Boston Globe, investigates into the repeated acts of priests sexually abusing children over the course of 30 years, resulting in the unfolding of hidden secrets that this team desperately determined to reveal.<br/><br/>Compelling, investing, and brilliantly detailed account of a story that people tried to hide for so long. This film goes into so much detail about the emotional distress, the determination from the team, the struggle with the legal system in getting the truth out, etc. The ensemble cast is well picked out, with everybody doing a great job. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Mcadams both give Oscar worthy performances, and Michael Keaton was surprisingly amazing, showing that Birdman was not a one time hit for him.<br/><br/>For a touchy subject matter like this, It's really risky to put it out there, as some people (including the Academy) don't like films with uncomfortable topics. This film handled it so perfectly and so maturely that it deserves every bit of credibility. It's very historically accurate, resisting the temptation to make the main characters out to be superheroes that save the day, but instead just portrays them as people simply doing their jobs, which is what this movie does. It doesn't go out of its way to blow itself up bigger than it is, or try to establish any bit of greater importance, it simply does its job, and does it great. It is completely airtight, there is no fat on this film whatsoever. Every scene is escalating the plot further in some way, and is packed full of the meat of the story, which I savored every little bit of.<br/><br/>Tightly written, tightly edited, tightly acted, and tightly directed, this is a unique and impressive quality film that will inspire you until the end."
"Semisonic","9","2","3","28 February 2016"," Maybe not the best, but undeniably the most important movie of 2015
","There are two genres of modern-day cinema that are strictly American: the courthouse drama and the journalism one. Why? Because what they work with are the true powers #3 and #4 in America, absolutely on par with the legislative and executive ones. I realize that democracy and separation of powers is not owned or copyrighted by the United States, but only there we seem to have a system where judges can - and sometimes successfully do - defy presidents and the press can break careers of the government officials of a highest rank. I don't think i love America all too much, but these are the things that America can - and should - be respected all around the globe. Still, something is rotten in the state of Denmark, and to make things right it's not enough to simply be a power - you have to actually use it sometimes to enforce that the good remains good and the evil is eradicated.<br/><br/>Spotlight is a story of one case of such struggle. And this time it's not just Good vs Evil, it's about the evil that comes from the roots of the good itself. Because the way the film shows it, the Catholic Church is an alias for God himself for a great many people in America, and the problem of child molestation by Catholic priests is more than just a rare case of ""a few bad apples"", it's a widespread phenomenon, a tendency, a real system.<br/><br/>Of course, a journalism drama movie is mostly defined by the topic it covers, so it could be tempting to put the equals sign between the quality of a movie and the importance of the topic. However, it would be an understatement. A good movie is more than just a summary of the story, it's a drama (or even a tragedy) of simple people involved in it. And through their eyes we get to see what could be a dry text in an encyclopedia book as something living, vivid and emotionally disturbing. Something that we take personal.<br/><br/>And that's where Spotlight really shines. What we are shown is not just the facts - which, i'm sure, most of us have known (at least to some extent) for a long time - but the way those facts hit the real people living in the same world the story belongs to. Facts that hit people like a hammer hits things: some of them break, some get bent and crooked and some remain straight and pierce the reality around them to make a difference. The team of investigative journalists from the Spotlight section of The Boston Globe is a pack of those straight things: no matter what pressure is put on them by the story they uncover, no matter how personal it ends up to be, their top priority is to serve the public good.<br/><br/>What makes the story of Spotlight stand out is that the public is not completely aware of what is good for it. The Catholic Church is not an enemy people wanna fight, it's something that gives you faith, a ground to stand upon when the world around is shaking, but then starts corrupting all the good things it's done, leaving people confused, emptied and destroyed.<br/><br/>It's one thing to just tell about those horrible devastating things. It's a completely different one to make you feel something about it. And to give you more than a one-dimensional sense of shame or anger or disappointment, but instead to fill you with a stinging cocktail of them all, is a task only a master can accomplish. And i believe that the team that made Spotlight had such masters in it.<br/><br/>I believe that it was the characters and their portrayal by actors that made a difference. They are just a team of journalists and a couple lawyers doing their job. But at the same time it's not just a job for them. It's a personal stance. And each of them has different feelings because of it. Mark Ruffalo's character is energetic and angry, a true Hulk of a reporter (maybe even more believable as one than in Avengers or anywhere else), Rachel McAdams' characters brings soothing compassion only her face and voice are capable to convey. Stanley Tucci gives us an outsider with limited power who still tries to do the right thing. And Michael Keaton and Liev Schreiber show us the people who finally try to cha(lle)nge something that was neglected for way too long and go all-in while doing it. One by one, these characters don't seem like much special, but united by one thirst for justice, they become a force capable of making a major change.<br/><br/>I can't say that Spotlight breaks the confines of its genre. Even with Michael Keaton in it, it's no Birdman, and it can't simply fly away from all the rules set for it. Still, it's a movie that tries its best not to be a cliché fest, and for a story that's bound by the facts it's based on, it has a surprising amount of freedom in it. So if you even remotely enjoy movies where people talk about complex things more than they yell or throw punches, give this one a try."
"epaulguest","9","2","3","12 February 2016"," Disturbing true story powerfully told
","The pace of this film is necessarily slow, but even and never boring. It reflects a protracted investigation by the 'Boston Globe' of child abuse by some 90 priests in Boston over some 30 years. The main action takes place in 2001-02, with delays (by implication) after 11 September.<br/><br/>The investigation is hampered by a conspiracy of silence in the city between the Catholic Church, the legal system and even – at an earlier stage – the 'Boston Globe' itself. The 'Spotlight' team of investigative journalists has to be roused into action by the paper's new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber). Thus the paper is portrayed 'warts and all'.<br/><br/>Baron is a Jew and from Florida. It is significant that he is an outsider to the local community: Boston is the USA's most Irish and most Catholic city. Two other major characters are also outsiders: a lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), whose background is Armenian, and Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), who tells Garabedian he is Portuguese. Of the three lawyers featured, Garabedian is the only one truly concerned to ensure justice for the priests' victims.<br/><br/>We learn that the Church itself had found that the 'psycho-sexual development' of a number of priests was 'stunted' and equivalent to that of a 13-year-old. However, Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) tells his 'Spotlight' team that they need to tackle 'the system' rather than any individuals. This 'system' is in fact the local community.<br/><br/>Though the journalists clearly have victims' interests at heart, it's a pity that victims and perpetrators get relatively little attention in the film. Shown on the screen at the end, however, are some deeply shocking statistics – which may serve as a tribute to the journalists' dogged efforts. It is no less shocking to see what became of Bernard Law, formerly Cardinal Archbishop of Boston. These pieces of background information should be regarded as an integral part of the film.<br/><br/>'Spotlight' has a remarkable variety of settings, reflecting investigative journalists' need to keep on the move. Its dramatic use of close-ups is highly effective, too.<br/><br/>One need not be a Catholic (as I am) to feel the impact of the issue of child sexual abuse. 'Spotlight' tells a disturbing true story powerfully, without histrionics or gimmickry, unlike (in my view at least) 'The Big Short', another film based on real events and with a largely male cast."
"Argemaluco","8","2","3","11 February 2016"," Spotlight
","I think we have all heard news about the ""slips"" of many Catholic priests who abused of their position in order to obtain sexual favors from kids and teenagers. However, the film Spotlight has the purpose of portraying the tragic reality of those ""slips"", as well as the huge dimension of the problem and the unforgivable complicity of the highest religious figures who tried to hide the truth, or at least minimize it until it seemed something infrequent and excusable. In order to achieve that, co-screenwriters Tom McCarthy (who was also the director) and Josh Singer wrote a solid screenplay, which, I must say, feels diffuse and fragmented on the beginning, with the reporters talking fast about people we don't know and events nobody has explained us. During 15 or 20 minutes, the experience was a bit frustrating, as if I had arrived late at the cinema. However, we end up building the puzzle at the same time as the characters; and when we discover the final ""image"", we receive the same emotional impact as the characters. It was a risky strategy, but the result is very interesting, while trusting in the audience's capacity to think, instead of receiving everything spoon-fed. Besides, Spotlight feels like a love letter to investigative journalism, a discipline which has almost disappeared in this time of ""clickbait"", instantaneous gratification and ""listicles"" as a replacement of genuine information. Even with digital help (the events portrayed in this film happened in the early-2000s, so there already were electronic mail, mobile phones and all kinds of digital databases), the reporters have to invest long hours of real work, interviewing people, checking printed registers from the previous century and, specially, creating hypotheses they have to support with evidence. Hollywood has accustomed us to the typical scene in which someone uses a laptop to search in Google, and ready... in 30 seconds, he/she found the necessary information to capture a terrorist/discover the origin of a ghost/deduct the killer's identity, etc. But having to search everything in the real world changes the perspective of the narrative itself, and inspires renewed respect for this archaic discipline in danger of extinction. On the other hand, that means that Spotlight is a slow movie, with a deliberate rhythm which allows us to savor every detail of the story and the performances. Almost everything happens inside the austere offices of the newspaper; there are no chases, police mobilization, or legal trial with surprising verdicts; and even though the characters are well defined, there aren't any artificial conflicts to accentuate their emotions. Fortunately, those tricks aren't necessary when we have the excellent performances from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup and Brian d'Arcy James. In conclusion, I don't think I would consider Spotlight as a great movie; but it's a very interesting film which definitely deserves to be recommended."
"Lejink","8","2","3","7 February 2016"," Boston creep party
","This excellent film dramatises the Boston Globe newspaper's exposure in 2001 of the years old child abuse practices of hundreds of Roman Catholic priests in and around the city and the attendant cover-up by the powers that be in the church from the Cardinal on down. More than that, it points the finger at the shoulder-shrugging complicity of other areas of the establishment like the law courts, police and the press, including the paper's own earlier self, burying previous isolated reports on the subject deep in the paper without thought of following up the bigger story. Indeed it takes the arrival of a new editor at the paper to revive the story which he does by setting loose its specialist four-strong investigative team known as Spotlight on the case, where they soon find substance to the rumours and fight to bring it to light.<br/><br/>The subject matter is of course bound to invite viewer sympathy but the film doesn't simply prey on that. Reminiscent at times of the likes of ""All The President's Men"" and classic TV series like ""Lou Grant"", it works by taking us inside the workings of the paper and avoiding gratuitous dramatic showdowns with either individual priests or even the misguided Cardinal, the climax to the sordid affair is simply the story finally hitting the streets on the paper's front page. There's no big self- congratulatory triumphant scene at the end, merely a shockingly long list of other instances the world over of the church covering over the traces of paedophile priests abusing their positions of trust.<br/><br/>The acting is high quality, with the revitalised Michael Keaton as the sage leader of the team, keen to bring down not just the Cardinal but the whole cover-up system which protected the offending priests by signing them out of commission with anodyne phrases like ""on sick leave"" for example. He's driven by his own incidental complicity in not digging deeper into the story when it first aired years before but it's he who eventually drives out the vital corroboration which enables it to finally get out there. Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams are also very good as the Rossi and Billie of the team, teasing the story out of the worn-out and cowed solicitor who first tried to put forward the victims' stories, again well played by Stanley Tucci and generally putting in the hard yards behind the story to get it into print.<br/><br/>There's probably another story in there about the Vatican's complicity in the hushing up process, but the film is probably right to localise the action and let the viewer contemplate this and other pertinent questions (like where are the offending priests now, for one) arising from this worthy and well made picture."
"rubenm","8","2","3","6 February 2016"," An ode to slow journalism
","Watching 'Spotlight' should be mandatory for journalism school students. It's a perfect introductory course into how good journalism is done. It also shows the traps journalists can fall into: not recognizing a good news story, thinking it's already covered when there's still lots to follow up on, or thinking sources are unreliable because they have their own agenda. 'Spotlight' explains all of this, which is why it is an outstanding film.<br/><br/>The story starts with the arrival of a new editor in chief at the Boston Globe. He is not from Boston and the newsroom fears job cuts. But the opposite happens: the new boss shows them the best news story is right in front of them: a local lawyer representing the victims of child abusing priests. The only thing they have to do, is investigate it. <br/><br/>The journalists are not perfect heroes like Bernstein and Woodward in 'All the President's Men', but normal guys who make mistakes. The biggest mistake is that they didn't recognize the story sooner, even when they had the information. While they are working on it, they are amazed at how big the scandal really is. The uncovering itself is like a detective story: every new piece of information leads to another, until the whole story is puzzled together. At one point, an impatient reporter who wants the news to be printed, needs to be slowed down to make the story more complete. <br/><br/>The film shows the investigation as it is: interviews, documents, court filings, and the occasional tip. The screenplay focuses on the uncovering of the scandal, and nothing else. There's nothing of the usual Hollywood sentimentality, neither is there a love story or action scenes. There's only one short shot of the sort you see in every film about newspapers: the running printing presses, the stacking machines and the transport trucks. <br/><br/>The best thing about 'Spotlight' is that it is an ode to slow journalism, to investigative reporting, and to old fashioned printed newspapers, in a time when the internet seems to reduce news to short, fast items that are a dime a dozen."
"paulvisser86","8","2","3","2 February 2016"," Great movie about journalism
","My girlfriend and I were really impressed by this movie. Great directing, a superb cast and a beautiful storyline. This movie shows how important it is to have great journalists / newspapers in your country, who have the time and funds for extensive journalistic research. A really important message these days if you consider that all the newspapers have lots of problems to make enough revenues, as a result of the digital era where users almost expect that everything is for free. Good journalism is essential in a democracy, and that is one of the great lessons this movie shows her audience.<br/><br/>I think Spotlight has a great chance to win the Best Picture award at the Oscars. However, the Revenant has a higher chance of winning, as it is a more original movie which was certainly not easy to make. I think the Academy will definitely reward that, but that doesn't mean Spotlight isn't one of the best movies of the 2015/2016 Oscar season.<br/><br/>Go see it guys!"
"stephendaxter","9","2","3","1 February 2016"," A very BIG Oscar Contender - Fantastic Acting and Amazing Directing
","'Spotlight' is a Drama/Biopic that tells the true story of the Boston Globe reporting team known as 'Spotlight' and their investigations into the allegations of child abuse in the Catholic Church and how what they uncovered in Boston had a huge affect on the rest of the world. This isn't a topic that people really like to discuss openly and is something that happened fairly recently and is still having an impact on society today. And this film did an amazing job at presenting this story in a way that makes it easy to understand for the audience and keeps it very grounded and real without making it a very uncomfortable thing to watch. It is impossible to tell the story without having to go into some of the horrifying and somewhat confronting details, so the film did great at finding a balance between being too controversial and being too Hollywood. That aside, this movie was very well put together through multiple departments. The acting was fantastic as is expected from a cast of fantastic actors and actresses, Tom McCarthy did an astounding job directing the film rather surprisingly, the writing was exceptional and it really is a big Best Picture contender. <br/><br/>The performances in this film were just so damn amazing to see. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Shreiber, Stanley Tucci, and John Slattery all killed it in their roles. This was probably the best ensemble cast of the year as everyone was fully committed and delved deep into their roles to the point where you stop noticing that it is Keaton and Ruffalo. Amongst all the greatness, Mark Ruffalo was still the stand-out performance of the film, watching him act in this film makes me wonder why the guy isn't a bigger actor than he is. It is a shame that most people only think of The Hulk when you mention Ruffalo as he has other roles where he puts in some solid performances. Michael Keaton as always was great, he is one of the best working today so you just know he is going to nail any role you give him. Unfortunately because of the other amazing performances around him he couldn't stand out enough to get a Best Actor nomination but he was very entertaining nonetheless. <br/><br/>The directing by Tom McCarthy was a surprise for me after i had looked at his previous work. I was unfamiliar with his 3 earlier films so really all i had to go on was last years 'The Cobbler' and well, it didn't have me really excited to see how he does on this film at all. But after seeing the amazing work he did with this film, it is hard to say that the same guy who directed 'The Cobbler' also directed the Best Picture nominated 'Spotlight'. The way he ties this film together and arranges all of the individual stories going on was very impressive to see. For quite a bit of the film you have the various characters all going off and investigating certain aspects of the case, and to be able to follow each one of their journeys in a way that allows you to keep track of everyone and not get lost is a great achievement. I also like the way he paced the film, there were a couple of moments fairly early on where i felt it could pick up the speed a little, but after 30 minutes in it was smooth sailing. But when much of the scenes involve interviews, meetings and scenes of those sorts it is very difficult to try and cover everything without skipping things or boring people, so well done again. <br/><br/>So in the end, Spotlight is just an amazing movie and manages to remain entertaining for the entire 2 hour runtime. It provides you with many of the facts and information regarding the allegations and mixes that in with a very interesting and entertaining story and film. The performances are all great and definitely worth watching just to see these great actors doing what they do best. I love a good biopic and this is definitely one of them so i highly recommend checking it out. Will it win Best Picture? Although my pick is still 'The Revenant' i would have to say this one of the top 3 nominated that actually has a chance.<br/><br/>9.1/10"

Also, I was afraid it would become another ""Black Mass""; a well executed, factually correct, but ultimately, for me, a hollow experience.<br/><br/>But, there's a moment when this film decides to go its own way, and it does so very well: - The obstacles become increasingly more interesting. - The emotional scenes in this film are handled well. They seem appropriate and never forced. - The film is brave in its portrayal of the Roman Catholic Church, and pulls no punches. With films like these, you'd expect filmmakers to walk on eggshells and try not to offend their viewers.

It was difficult not getting any info on this, It hasn't premiered here in Denmark yet, but is already collecting a ton of reviews from the US, but I managed to see it at a special sneak peek before release, arranged by kino.dk and it was very good.<br/><br/>It is a very interesting way of showing these events or the notion and exploration of them, seeing it all from the journalists, how the start digging at something that seems small and then it just escalates, in Denmark there wasn't that big a fuzz about this, we are not that many catholics, so seeing the attention and wide range it had for the city of Boston and how it spread after the story broke is quite overwhelming. That this could even happen and be covered up again and again is appalling, but the film shows the story from a very good side, I expect that had it been some years ago, it would have focused more on the ""bad"" priests, what they did and why they did and how they covered it up, but seeing it all from the investigative side, from the journalists at The Boston Globe Spotlight division is really interesting. How they keep digging and digging, uncovering more cases, finding more survivors, talking to people and lawyers and trying to make it all make sense.<br/><br/>The acting is really good, they are all experienced at their jobs, some a bit out off their usual element, but they do a very fine job. Especially Mark Ruffalo as the workaholic, very persistence reporter, but also Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams & Liev Schreiber have some great roles as the Spotlight reporters, I could extend the list to all the other cast members, they all do a fantastic job.

It tells its story well, and its cast is fun to watch throughout. It was great to see Michael Keaton in a serious role a year after ""Birdman"", and Keaton definitely adds to the film's gravitas. Mark Ruffalo turns out a similarly strong performance. I had to do a double take, as I first thought someone had miraculously turned Tony Danza thirty years younger just for this movie--Ruffalo's haircut and accent were Danza to a T. But ""The Hulk"" turns out a strong performance, and provides an effective performance in the film's climax. Similarly, Rachel McAdams is my new celebrity crush--she shines in this movie.<br/><br/>The down side to this film is the subject matter. Yes, it's an important story to be told, and inasmuch as that's true, this is a very important film that everyone should see at least once. But as with other historical dramas of difficult subject matter, ""Schindler's List"" and the like, this movie leaves you emotionally drained. Because of that, the movie is not one that many will want to watch more than once.<br/><br/>That said, I will note that the film ends in a very satisfying way, providing a very effective closing scene that does add a certain amount of resolution to the movie. <br/><br/>All in all I'm going with 8/10 stars.

","""Spotlight"" is about the Boston Globe's investigation into the allegations of child abuse by some of the priests in the Catholic Church. In a similar style to ""All the President's Men,"" we follow the newspaper's team as they uncover awful truths and cover-ups. The story presents a bit more of a personal touch for the main characters as we observe how they are affected, and ultimately impacted from what they discover. In part, this is what makes ""Spotlight"" such a compelling and thought-provoking film. The scenes where the victims share their stories are powerful and heart rendering. <br/><br/>Even though the investigation keeps the movie's plot moving steadily, it is the performances that make the film memorable. Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo stand out in particular. Their characters are opposite ends of the spectrum. Ruffalo is passionate and intense as Mike Rezendes whereas Keaton is more reserved and calm as Will Robby Robinson. Both mold into their roles so well that I failed to see them as actors. The rest of the cast is sublime, even Rachel McAdams as the emotionally attached Sacha Pfeiffer.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is a great movie. It is engaging, powerful, compelling, and thought provoking.

"cultfilmfan","10","2","3","8 December 2015"," Spotlight
","Tom McCarthy's new film Spotlight is sure to be one of the most talked about and perhaps even one of the most controversial films of this year. The true story of a group of newspaper writers and their editors who decided to expose the vast number of cases involving sexual abuse within the Catholic church. This is a film that is extremely powerful to watch and while you are watching the film it affects you deeply because of the sensitive subject matter that it is dealing with and also because what these writers are uncovering is extremely disturbing and sure to leave you feeling uneasy and even perhaps a bit nauseated while watching the film. The fact that all of this is based upon true events that did not just occur over a short period of time, but spanning decades and perhaps even longer than that and the fact is that unfortunately the types of abuse documented and reported upon in the film are still happening to this day. The film takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and while a lot of priests and members of the Catholic church were uncovered there, it unfortunately doesn't just stop there, but spans all across the United States as well as pretty much all corners of the world. To my knowledge with the release of this film, I have not heard, or read about any backlash, or negative comments from the Catholic church regarding the matter, but on the other hand, if the film is factual which it certainly says it is, perhaps the church does want to remain silent on this issue especially because as I stated above it covers over the decades and is still a continuing problem. When, I make these remarks I must add that I am not an atheist, or have a personal vendetta against the Catholic church, or Catholics in general. While, I do not go to a Catholic church, I do and have watched a Catholic television series for years now and have really enjoyed the sound teaching of the program and in many ways it has been a blessing to me. Also, I do not think that the intent of the filmmakers here was to stir up trouble, or slam religion, or religious institutions in general. I think the main purpose of this film was to show everything that was being covered up for all these years and is still covered up to this day and the fact that these people claim to be worshipping God and obeying His word, but in fact living deceitful lives that go against the true teachings of the Bible and everything that their faith stands for. The film is not condemning religion at all, but instead the people who use religion as a means to pervert their own lies and injustices and claim that it is all okay because they hide under the cloak of the church and so for them it must be okay when really it is not. This is a fascinating film to watch and just like any good news story, or world event that is unfolding before your eyes the film is in equal parts fascinating, entertaining and yet as I mention above that because it is dealing with sensitive issues and based on fact that it is also extremely affecting and will certainly leave an impression on you after you leave the theatre and perhaps for longer than that. Everything is done right with this film from it's excellent screenplay which incorporates real facts, events and people and glues us to the screen in a film that is more captivating and in a sense more thrilling than any other action films of this year, or perhaps many others. The entire cast here is all top notch as determined people who are bound and determined to get to the truth of this story. They are not just doing this as to make names for themselves, or to bring themselves a lot of money, but instead because the subject matter is also personal for them and the people that they interview and meet, so in a sense they are out to right an incredible wrong and will stop at nothing to uncover this. The characters each respond to the matter in their own ways which also leaves a very interesting and percept view of the whole subject and runs the gamut of how each individual would, or maybe would not feel in this type of case, or situation. The character development and the portrayals by the actors is excellent. This is one of the strongest casts I have seen in awhile. This is a film for people who stand for truth and love deeply moving and affecting films and this is certainly a film that will leave it's mark on the audience and perhaps society as well which is all because of the power and talent that went into making it. One of the year's best."

","A film that starts off average for the first half hour but turns into something very compelling. This biopic might not be for everyone since the subject matter can be pretty disturbing and uncomfortable. But it definitely made me feel something at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The interviews with the victims made you understood how bad this scandal really was and they never shy away from telling you how unsettling it was to have someone you trust do things that disturb you. For that I commend this movie. Mark Ruffalo gives the performance of his career. I also liked the small scene at the end with Rachel McAdams and her grandma reading the article toward the end.<br/><br/>Some issues are the first 30 minutes before the plot really gets going. It felt inconsequential to the rest of the movie. Also some characters aren't as well developed as others, I didn't really care about anyone outside of the spotlight team.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend this movie as long as you can handle the touchy subject matter"

","This is a film based on real people and real stories. The film revolves around the focus group in the Boston-based ""Global Times"", in-depth coverage of the Geoghan case.<br/><br/>Generally, a movie marked with ""According to Real People"" always adds a layer of realistic meaning to the film, without the exaggerated shooting technique in the general movie narrative, the reversal of the plot, the focus on the lens and the story. Time clues can actually be regarded as a relatively bland movie. But when I watched the movie, I thought it was adapted based on the actual case, but it also made the characters in the movie come alive.<br/><br/>The story begins with the new editor-in-chief airborne editorial department. The newly appointed editor-in-chief nominates the focus group to conduct an in-depth investigation into the Geoghan case and provide a comprehensive and detailed report. As the work of the team members unfolded, it was discovered that the case was only the tip of the iceberg, and the number of bishops who committed similar cases reached as much as 6%. Take the Boston area as an example, 1500 bishops. 6% is 90, the number is huge, it is staggering. What 's even more irritating is that the Archbishops and Bishops in the area have been aware of these things happening in the diocese, but they did not punish the criminal bishops. In the current parish, this practice has resulted in more children being abused. The reporters ran around and rushed to gather evidence at the node of time, before finally revealing the viciousness of the entire church system. They faced not just a regional religious belief, but a question directed at the Vatican. A person who preached in the name of God, a person who carried the faith of the believers in an entire region, was behind the well-dressed, doing things that are not as good as the beasts, and the entire church system was blind and indulgent. My faith was shaken and I was disappointed.<br/><br/>God loves the world and becomes a joke.<br/><br/>The film ended with a report of the ringing of the phone ringing in the focused office. With the support of public opinion, more and more victims chose to speak. The film did not give the actual ending of the incident, but gave an open end. After checking the Internet, after the Boston Times published nearly 600 reports, the church was forced to respond to public opinion pressure. All relevant personnel were jailed and the church fined more than 2 billion US dollars. The incident came to an end.<br/><br/>This film is also a film focused on freedom of public opinion and religious power, and has a rare social depth. The reporter's persistence in justice and the maintenance of freedom in the film are also impressive. The most important thing in the profession of journalists is to have self-awareness as a public speaker. Use the pen as a gun, face the darkness, stick to the original intention, and dare to speak in the face of power. recommend!"

"TheCasualReviewer","10","1","1","16 December 2019"," The pinnacle of Investigative Journalist filmmaking
","Taking the #1 spot in the list for my favorite films of the decade, this Best Picture winning film shines a light on the extraordinary investigative journalists who revealed one of the most disturbing true secrets that the church had been hiding for many years.<br/><br/><br/><br/>SYNOPSIS:
In 2001, the investigative journalist team, known as ""Spotlight"", for the Boston Globe gets tasked with digging deep into a potential scandal of the American Church keeping secrets and hiding child molesting priests. Though at first believed to be just a couple ""bad apples"", the further the team researched, the more they begin to realize that this unimaginable secret is actually being done on a much grander scale.<br/><br/>DIRECTION:
Tom McCarthy really knocks this one out of the park. Every angle is a song and every angle is keeping the right amount of pace while tracking every bit of body language coming off of the phenomenal performances. I've been reviewing many films that aren't asked for an extreme amount of effort on behalf of the directing and I'm compelled to say the same about this film. Despite feeling this way, McCarthy shoots this film in a very particular way where it's hard for me to explain. He is always capturing the right frame at the right moment and whether it's a wide, a medium or a close-up it is particular to a point of perfection. I couldn't imagine the editing nor the direction being any different. I don't want it to be any different. The extreme organization of this film is exquisite and regardless if you're familiar with the true story you're still very much discovering every bit of information along with them. Although I can think of several films of the sort, the only other film I can really compare the meticulous direction with is that of David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" (2007).<br/><br/>WRITING:
Every element of this film is damn near flawless for me and the same goes for the writing. As I mentioned in my review of Dark Waters (an also similar film including Mark Ruffalo), when writing a script that is inspired or completely based on true events, you can spot the films that truly do their research. Now, I don't know just how accurate this film is to all of the dialogue that was actually said nor do I know what level of investigation these journalists took on, but anyone can see that this film really dug as deep as it could. A story like this could be scary to tell, especially when it's dealing with an enormous entity like the American Church and so I give the writing and anyone participating in this film in general all of the props in the world.<br/><br/>ACTING:
I'm just going to name all of the noteworthy actors: Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liv Schreiber, Brian D'Arcy James, John Slattery, Billy Crudup, Stanley Tucci and Mark Ruffalo. Now there are others who played very small roles who were all spectacular, but for this film I really want to narrow this SPECTACULAR lineup to Stanley Tucci and Mark Ruffalo. Stanley Tucci plays one of the most incredible supporting roles to date. He was so integral to the story and every line of dialogue that came out of his mouth felt so true that I nearly forgot he is an actor and I know that's the job and that's how it's supposed to be, but in every scene that he was in I nearly felt I was watching a straight documentary with the real lawyer. He was unbelievable. Moving on we get to Mark Ruffalo. Without having seen all of his films, I can say without a doubt this is the best performance he has every given. It's one of the greatest performances given period. One could argue the best of the decade. Maybe this story is so close to his heart or maybe he just sparked unreal-like empathy, but I felt as though this story affected him to his very core. The emotion was so raw that the whole movie I wanted this story to get out just so I could see himself get closure. I wouldn't be surprised at all that even though Mr. Hulk has smashed through several Marvel films that this was his most emotionally and mentally draining performance he's every had.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:
All in all, this film goes down as possibly one of my top 10 favorite films of all time. To take a story, entirely filled with dialogue and to keep my interest as much as a Domino's Chocolate Lava Cake, is speaking to significant heights. I can watch this film daily and still be sucked in just as much as the first viewing and the heart wrenching scene between Michael Keaton and Mark Ruffalo. Simply Impeccable. This is a recommend to absolutely everyone. I am a man of faith and for me to still enjoy this film as much as it does, I believe speak volumes."

"harrylosborne","8","1","1","20 April 2019"," Serious acting for an equally serious topic
","Spotlight is a dark insight into the secrets of the Catholic church in the USA, and does not hold back on any punches. The revelations uncovered throughout the film (and the actions of the church following) are like something fictional, making the topic even more startling. By experiencing it from the viewpoint of the media, it becomes even more apparent the lengths to which some senior members of the church went to avoid publicity - as well as the influence religion still has on modern-day society.<br/><br/>Strong casting helps to emphasise the story: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams (among others) all portray their characters brilliantly, hailing them as the heroes that uncovered the priest scandal of the early 2000s. Spotlight is not an easy watch, but navigates a difficult plot well by giving a glimpse of justice; however, even after watching, you will be left with an uneasy feeling that is hard to shake."

"sddavis63","10","1","1","2 September 2018"," A Powerful Story That Will Anger Those Who Watch It
","This is a difficult movie to watch - a movie that will make you truly angry, even if you aren't Catholic. It details the work of a group of investigative reporters with the Boston Globe in the late 1990's and early 2000's to expose the sexual abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church in Boston. Now, today, we hear so much about the sexual abuse of minors by priests that I fear we've become hardened to it. It doesn't seem to shock us anymore. But at that time most of this was unknown to most people - covered up by Church officials who just kept moving pedophile priests from parish to parish and settling with abuse victims out of court to protect the image of the church; used by lawyers who presumably made a comfortable living off the negotiated settlements; swept under the carpet by officials ranging from police officers to judges who turned their eyes away because they were Catholic themselves; ignored or minimized by the media when stories did leak out. It's a story about an out of control institution and the power of the Roman Catholic Church - not a wild eyed conspiracy type of story, but a raw, down to earth story about what was (and is) essentially a conspiracy to try to get the Church off the hook for the abuse committed by its clergy. This is a powerful story that makes you shake your head in disgust and contempt.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a brief account of an abused boy in 1976, and a visit by Cardinal Bernard Law to his family to work something out so that nothing goes public. So we're exposed right away to the fact that the Church cared more about itself and its reputation than about its victims. Then we jump into the story of the journalistic investigation. The strong suggestion of the movie is that none of this might have come out except for the fact that in early 2001 the Globe hired a new editor - Marty Baron (played by Liev Schrieber.) Baron was not from Boston. Baron was not Catholic. Baron was not Christian - he was Jewish. Basically, he had no stake in covering this up and so he demanded that his investigative team plow ahead with its work, with the goal being not just to find individual cases of abuse but to find out what the systemic problem was and how far up the hierarchy it went. Michael Keaton played the head of the ""Spotlight"" team - a team of Globe reporters who work solely on investigative journalism - ably supported by Mark Ruffalo, Brian D'Arcy James and Rachel McAdams as the team. The performances were superb, but this movie really isn't about the performances. It's about the story itself. You really didn't need well known names for this - the story drives the movie forward, as the scandal grows and grows - cover up after cover up. From a handful of priests involved to 13, to 90 all the way up the hierarchy of the archdiocese itself until it finally reaches the door of Cardinal Law himself (played by Len Cariou.) Many of the victims are found and interviewed. Some of their stories, while not incredibly graphic, are still sickening. And the movie ends with a huge list of places in the United States and around the world where sex abuse scandals have hit the Roman Catholic Church.<br/><br/>The story proceeds both slowly and deliberately - and provides a fair bit of detail into the investigation. In that sense it's also an interesting look at investigative journalism. But in the end it leaves you angry. I am a Christian and I am clergy - not Roman Catholic but Protestant and married with a daughter, but this still hits home even if I'm not part of that tradition. It is horrifying and outrageous. The abuse of the trust that parents placed in these priests only to have that trust abused in the worst possible way is shocking. I firmly believe that the vast majority of Roman Catholic priests are fine and faithful men who do not and would never abuse children. And the problem of abuse of trust is not restricted to the Roman Catholic Church by any means. But this story and the many, many scandals that have erupted since do point to a systemic problem in the Roman Catholic Church that seems to be out of control, and a larger than would be expected number of pedophiles within the priesthood.<br/><br/>It is truly difficult to find anything much to criticize about this. It's a first rate, well done movie that sadly remains entirely relevant and will probably remain relevant for some time to come. (10/10)"
"alindsay-al","10","1","1","13 August 2018"," An Epic really powerful film
","This film won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2016 and I have been told to watch Spotlight ever since and I have now had the chance to do this and this is truly one of the best and one of the most important films I have ever seen. The premise of this film sees a group of Boston reporters looking into possible misdoings from priests at the Catholic Church. The main star in this film is that of Mark Ruffalo and this is probably the best I have ever seen him, he sinks his teeth into this role and you can really believe that he is a journalist. It's also fascinating seeing his characters journey throughout the film and you just want to root for him all the way through. The rest of the cast is amazing too, Michael Keaton plays the head of the team and he continues his career renaissance by delivering a great performance full of depth and intrigue. Rachel McAdams is a great actress and she totally nails it in this film, her character has a good story in the film and it's great to see her given as important a role in this film as the male reporters in the story. Liev Schreiber is known for playing very powerful physical performances but he plays the new head of the globe and he gave a truly unique great performance that I wasn't sure that he was capable of. Other great performances come from Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, John Slattery and Jamey Sheridan who add so much to their smaller roles and really gave this film an overall sense of realism. The story of this film is so interesting with this group of journalists going on a hunt for this story. It deals with a ton of sensitive and important moments but it kept me interested and intrigued throughout. The script deals with its dramatic dialogue very respectfully and appropriately which makes it comes across as quite naturally. Also the little bits of humour made these characters feel like real people and not just characters that are in a movie. The style of the film is so tense and on edge that you don't know what the next twist is going to be and it always keeps you on your toes. Overall this is truly a special film that I feel should be seen by everybody to truly appreciate what films are about."

"KidWithOpinions","10","1","1","14 July 2018"," One of the best movies EVER
","Spotlight is probably the best Best Picture. This movie is the only movie so far that has gotten an A+. It gets it because of its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story.
 What surprised me the most was the fact that it only won two Oscars. I mean sure it won Best Picture, but all the acting awards it was nominated for they did not win. The 88th Academy Awards had Leonardo DiCaprio for Best Actor, Mark Rylance for Best Supporting Actor, Brie Larson for Best Actress, and Alicia Vikander for Best Supporting Actress. So I can see why it did not win any of the Acting Oscars. Even though it had some amazing performances I guess that does not mean it wins them. Spotlight got snubbed at the Golden Globes, which I do not agree with, the gave the Award for Best Motion Picture-Drama to The Revenant. This does not help the fact that I already hate the Golden Globes. This makes me hate them even more, so good job.
 Mark Ruffalo delivers the audience a phenomenal acting job. He did get an Oscar nomination but he did not win it. Rachel McAdams got the other nomination but did not win it ( sadly) but again there was no way that Spotlight could win any of the acting awards. Spotlight is super depressing but it is so well made that you feel an emotional bond to these characters, so good job on the writing, and hay, they won the Oscar for Best Writing-Original Screenplay. This movie makes you suddenly get more cautious of the fact that, you might live next to or go to church with child molesters.
 Spotlight is rated R for some language including sexual references ( official MPAA rating). You could show your kids this when they are about thirteen maybe fourteen. This movie is on the list of movies you have to watch sometime in your life. You will probably watch it if you go to film school.
 Spotlight is the best 21st Century Best Picture. I give Spotlight an A+, for its beautiful acting and its beautifully told story."

"asifahsankhan","8","1","1","28 February 2018"," More thrilling than most thriller movies!
","It's a story of unglamorous leg-work rather than thundering revelation. The drama here comes from the detail, and the reporters' slow realisation that their investigation could change the world far beyond Boston's city limits. The Church's power is revealed as smoke, mirrors and an unwarranted sense of deference, with journalism at its best proving its worth.<br/><br/>Director Thomas McCarthy's great strength is in his refusal to pander to audiences, or to default to easy answers; the correct reaction to the team's work is horror rather than jubilation. And while admirable, the reporters take some blame upon themselves. This crisis, after all, developed under their noses and it took an outsider to force them to examine it. Similarly, the cast (Mark Ruffalo was freakin' good!) modestly play down their characters' achievements and reputations. There is no Oscar-bait grandstanding (well, maybe one moment) and they all look quietly dowdy without indulging in any unnecessary uglification. These journalist greats could happily have rubbed shoulders with Woodward and Bernstein in All The President's Men, and they bring down an even bigger institution.<br/><br/>Talky and intelligent, this lacks the glib edge of Aaron Sorkin or the poppy zip of Tarantino. Given the subject matter, too much lightness would be inappropriate. Instead, its tone is led by its characters, moving from scepticism to revelation and the uncomfortable sense that we should all feel guilty for ignoring the secrets too hard to acknowledge."

","""Spotlight"" is a fine film based on a true story, even if the story was already told in a 2005 film called ""Our Fathers"". But a few of the reviewers here on IMDb have been unclear about something. Ronald Paquin was the priest investigated by Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams). Richard T. O'Rourke was just the actor who played him, and is married with children in real life. Never confuse the actor with the character. Nobody refers to Michael Keaton as a maniac because he played one in ""Pacific Heights""."
"gingerrdriley","6","1","1","29 April 2017"," I miss the Ottoman Empire.
","So, this film raises a good question: should the genre of a film be taken into account when considering the overall quality? <br/><br/>I understand that for the horror genre, it's generally well accepted that dumb characters and logic gaps are par for the course. The reason being that most people don't take horror too seriously, especially in the mainstream market. So with that in mind, does this film cement the standard for the ""journalism"" genre as one which requires no real direction or anything even remotely exceptional on a visual level? The blocking, cinematography, and art direction feel just flat out lazy and uninspired. All the scenes are constructed as though it were a Star Wars prequel. Just have a couple of characters stand around and talk to each other, and to spice it up we'll have them walk to a different part of the office. No effort is made to arrange the characters or the camera in a creative way which makes any scene distinguishable from the others. <br/><br/>So of course a natural counter to these complaints would be that the film is portraying the story with the realism it requires. The idea is that it's showing the journalists doing their jobs without exaggeration or sensationalist elements. It should be as it actually happened. May I ask though, in what way the plot would be seriously altered by creative cinematography or having the characters do something interesting while they're having dialogue? The lines don't have to change. The sequence of events don't have to change. The screenplay doesn't even really have to change. The director simply has to put in the effort to make it look even just a little bit interesting. Why not have a scene where one of the characters is putting together a jigsaw puzzle while the other is pacing around the room try to solve their own mental puzzle? I know that example is kind of dumb but it's a simple change that I think would make just about any scene in this film more interesting. Of course if it's shot in the same flat style as the rest of it then there wouldn't be much of a difference. <br/><br/>I want to clarify that I don't think this film is bad. It's just not really exceptional. If you like it then that's fine. There are things to like about it. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a film and not a radio drama. It takes more then having your actors stand there, having them recite some logistical dialogue, and call it good. Just because this film is about journalism doesn't mean that it just has to be people talking and nothing else. If you don't want to tarnish this story with the utilization of film making techniques then maybe you shouldn't bother with adapting it to begin with. Since this story was adapted into film however, I am going to consider it the same way I would consider any other film. As such it is not very good. It's okay. That's it. There is no excuse for mediocrity in film, whatever the story. Spotlight doesn't get a free pass because it's about reporters. <br/><br/>Wouldn't really recommend it."
"juliankennedy23","9","1","1","27 March 2017"," Turn on your Spotlight.
","Spotlight ( 9 out of 10) Everyone has pet peeves when it comes to movies. We hate romantic comedies based entirely on misunderstandings, we hate horror films where no one's cell phone works, or we simply hate movies that have either the word Adam or Sandler on the poster.<br/><br/>I hate true story movies that simply make things up. You know the type. We need a bad guy so let's take a real person and turn him into a racist (Hidden Figures), a murderer (Titanic), or a woman (Patch Adams). We need to condense the timeline and change real historical events (Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures again). We need to change the character's sexuality so modern audiences can relate (The Danish Girl). We need fascist slaveholders to talk about democracy and freedom (300). And the list goes on and on. This is without even mentioning Mel Gibson historical dramas that might as well have dinosaurs wandering through them.<br/><br/>One of my other pet peeves? Movies that take place in an office or business world made by people who clearly have never spent more than a day working in one. Like ahistorical true stories, this is ripe territory for rage. We have the office politics of Catwoman's evil beauty cream manufacturer. Not to be outdone the less said about how Wayne Industries is run ( a publicly traded company mind you) in the Batman universe the better. It isn't just superhero movies either. Romantic comedies often need a trip to HR and no making everyone an architect does not solve that. (Seriously do these movies even know what architects or museum directors or magazine publishers actually do during their work day?)<br/><br/>Spotlight easily could have fallen into both these traps. It simply doesn't. The timeline is correct. The discussions between professionals sound well professional. There are no made up heavy's to create drama, no fake romantic love interest, no surprise terrorist attack. Okay, it does have the last one but in all fairness, the movie's timeline starts in August 2001 and runs through the end of the year. But even in that moment, the movie handles it with intelligence and in a realistic manner. <br/><br/>There is a calmness and a professionalism in this movie that is refreshing. It rings true in both the big and small things. It is one of the best films I have seen this year."
"zkonedog","9","1","1","19 March 2017"," A Hallowing Investigative Treatise
","I'm a big fan of investigative films, with recent-ish efforts like ""Zodiac"" and ""The Insider"" immediately coming to mind as favorites. ""All The President's Men"", of course, is the industry standard for this type of filmmaking. ""Spotlight"" can easily hold its own with all those great films.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Spotlight"" tells the story of the investigative crew of the Boston Globe who unearthed a large child abuse scandal (clergy molesting children) that was being covered up by the Catholic Church. Reporters played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery all combine to pry the lid off of the scandal through diligent reporting and copious research.<br/><br/>What I really like about ""Spotlight"" is how it presents the material almost without ""editorial comment"" (to steal an apt newspaper phrase). This isn't so much a movie about the Catholic Church scandal (though implicitly it can be read as such, I guess) as it is a film about the journalistic/investigative process needed to unearth such facts. As such, there really is very little verbal or explicit moralizing that takes place on screen. Instead, director Tom McCarthy lets the process unspool and allows the viewer to form their own emotions as each new thread is pulled.<br/><br/>Of course, it always helps to have such a who's who of acting talent, and they all work perfectly here. They each bring something unique to the film while also functioning as a competent whole.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" can be a hard movie to watch at times (the subject matter, without being visually graphic, is difficult to digest), but it ends up being an important treatise on the power of journalism and investigation to reign in the power of establishments that feel they might be above the law. Whether you go to Mass every week or think religion is a bunch of hog-wash, you will still be affected by the message of this film.<br/><br/>As such, I now better understand why ""Spotlight"" took home Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards.

","Accurate, mesmerizing, astonishing thriller that will help you question everything you believe in. For the first hour of watching this perfectly amazing franchise, all I could think was how a couple of people from a magazine were breaking a story. But suddenly mark Ruffalo says up it could have been you. Suddenly the movie gets substantial. Everything comes back to you. The story changes from being a revelation to a revolution. Tom McCarthy uses every second of the movie for character or plot development. You start caring about the characters from the very begginning. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams give some extraordinary performances. After the credits roll out, you find yourself staring at the screen for 10 minutes digesting what you just felt. Best of 2015 and indeed a Oscar winner."

","I would call this review ""Another Heartbreaking & Excellent Reason Not to Be Catholic"" but someone else used it, fittingly, for the film ""Philomena"", another brilliant and must see film that exposes the unchristian ways of the Catholic Church. Yes I am a Christian so of course I'm not trying to make church look bad because the wickedness this film is trying to make everyone aware of has absolutely nothing to do with church. ""Spotlight"" is a well-crafted film that showed how the Boston Globe uncovered a huge scandal of child molestation in the local Archdiocese and how the Catholic Church tried to cover it up. I can see why this film won an Academy Award for best writing and original screen play, also the performances brought on by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Michael Keaton were fantastic. Being that this film is a true story it was disturbing how the Catholic Church went about covering up the scandal. While watching this film I was in awe. To me it was almost like the local Archdiocese was worse than the Mafia. It was amazing how much power and influence they had on the community. ""Spotlight"" is definitely a must see, not only because it's a great film but also what the film is about. I highly recommend this film. Please see it."
"robbin_schipper","8","1","1","25 May 2016"," Great film that is documentary-like and has its shortcomings
","First of all, let me state that this film depicts in great detail the American side of the sexual abuse of the catholic church. The story is interesting, well acted, engaging and original. I agree with the comments on the lack of development of the characters in the story. <br/><br/>One of this film's shortcomings as I see it however, is the lack of any mention of scandals in the catholic church on the same subject. How is it that the reporters do not refer even once to similar large-scale stories, for example in Ireland, Canada or other countries? By the time the Boston Globe reporters researched this story, nation-wide cases similar to this one had already come to light. The thing that disappoints me in this story, is the American based chauvinism that is trying to tell its viewers that Boston Globe was the first independent group of journalists that ever researched anything like this. This is strongly supported by the credits at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Overall an appealing, documentary-like story with little character development, 8/10."

","3 March 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Spotlight. This film was most definitely an Oscar winner. The script was outstanding, The actors were so enmeshed into their characters I found myself locked into the story from the get go. Any film that tackles socially taboo subjects is going to be hard to write, act and to sell to the public, Spotlight does all that as it tackles the emotive subject of abuse within the Catholic Church. The film follows the Spotlight team of the Boston Globe as they forage and delve down all possible avenues to uncover the story hidden for so many years. We share the horror and the disbelief as the scale of the cover ups come to light and get an insight as to how a good journalistic team can work together to find the correct facts and the best time and way to present them to the public. Spotlight was gripping and in no way uncomfortable to watch. I was rooting for The Danish Girl to win the Best Picture Oscar but having seen this film I realise it was a far superior offering and very worthy of the award. Absolute silence in the cinema as the film ended."
"ArchonCinemaReviews","8","1","1","3 March 2016"," Spotlight succeeds in its simplicity of storytelling and use of classic filmmaking
","Based on a true story, Spotlight tells the story of the reporters behind the breaking news report of child molestation and the Catholic Church's cover up in Boston.<br/><br/>Prior to awards season, Spotlight flew under the radar. Sure it has a killer cast and was well reviewed, but it was little known and littler seen. The Boston Globe is at a pivotal point in its existence in the early 2000s. Bought by The Times, staff cuts and uncertainty cause waves of concern for its journalists. A new Editor, an outsider to Boston, is brought in to hopefully lead to positive change for the Globe. His first order of business is to pursue a story left dormant and uninvestigated: that of a priest who allegedly molested boys and the Cardinal and church that knew about it. This story centers on the small staff that write for the Spotlight section of the paper who are assigned the case.<br/><br/>Most of us should be old enough to remember when this article broke and the ripple effect and later ramifications it had on the Catholic Church. The intriguing part of the film Spotlight is that it truly helps you understand the barriers these journalists faced just to get to the truth. This is a city where the Catholic Church has the greatest power and influence of any American city, permeating its reach into the political system. The lengths these individuals went to prevent the story ever being researched, let alone published, were against them.<br/><br/>Spotlight manages to showcase journalistic quandaries, ethical dilemmas, legal exploitations, and dense information regarding a complicated investigation into this systemic broach of trust all while doing so in an engaging way. Spotlight is coherent and approachable without ever being flat or verbose, a testament to a phenomenal script by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer. Furthermore, Signer and McCarthy are able to tell a story that spans across decades without using schticky flashbacks or overly stylized crutches and instead tell a simple chronological but gripping story.<br/><br/>Part of the reason Spotlight feels so real is that, well, it is. Based on a true story, it is beyond evident that the actors (Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton and Brian d'Arcy James) took the assignment of playing real life individuals seriously. Rather than exaggerating characteristics for effect which ultimately is detrimental to a film, the atmosphere of the staff of Spotlight reels like a group that has been together for years. Each character is unique but honest, well formed and have believably consistent actions and relationships with one another.<br/><br/>At its core, Spotlight succeeds in its simplicity of storytelling. With a narrative laid out from real life events, it had all the makings of a great film. Of course, that has been true of other films which have failed miserably so it's nice to see a movie such as Spotlight to live up to its potential and rise to the occasion.<br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>Please check out the Archon Cinema Reviews website for full reviews of all the Academy Award nominees."
"tavm","10","1","1","2 March 2016"," Spotlight was an excellent chronicle of the thorough research of the Catholic priests' molestation scandals
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend, this Oscar-winning Best Picture that was quite a compelling account of the reporting of various Catholic priests' molesting children over many years. He had seen it before and didn't mind going again while I was just experiencing this for the first time. No graphic scenes but many of the victims didn't mince words when describing what happened to them at such young ages so I either covered my mouth or hit the chair, not too hard, when those were revealed. Visually, this probably wasn't as impressive as another Best Picture nominee-The Revenant, for instance-but it was riveting enough dramatically, otherwise, for me and perhaps for my friend, as well. So on that note, I highly recommend Spotlight."

","Yet another true story film that does it right and adds itself to the already busy catalog of movies doing the same thing this year, probably making it to the top of the list. One of those rare films that simply doesn't miss a beat.<br/><br/>It is incredible how director Tom McCarthy manages to make every single scene bring us further into the story and characters. This is one of the best screenplays of recent years directed masterfully. This is a film about subtext, about trusting the audience and making them think and follow for themselves. Almost at no point there is some pause or some big monologue that spoon feeds us what is going on, what we should be thinking or what the film is about. Right from the opening scene, which hooked me terrifically, you understand how intelligent the movie is and how alive it is. Nothing is said explicitly, nothing is thrown at you, all of the characters are giving space to develop and live, which ultimately results in both us having a stronger connection to them and to the overall story. We get why it is so important for them and since it is important for them it becomes important for us, that is basic filmaking yet it is hard to nail and this is a full representation of it. Thrilling from the first to the last frame.<br/><br/>It is also marvelous to see a film put together with such technical perfection. The cinematography other than being gorgeous immensely helps in telling the story and not getting us lost thanks to fantastic visual sound. The editing is constantly brilliant and surprising. Howard Shore's music is pitch perfect for the film and the sound is so alive and flowing it contributes immensely into elevating the slew of great performances we have. What a cast ensemble. Everybody on A+ game, Ruffalo being a very good highlight, yet for me, Tucci in the first place rises above all other, but even more so: Liev Schreiber is stunning. As soon as he appeared on screen I knew something special was going on and he did not disappoint, his work is acting greatness.<br/><br/>Let me just make a digression on my grading system. I use a grading system out of 10 with half votes. Whilst I strongly believe that what ultimately matters is the review and the personal experience, I find that grades really help in giving the overall feel of what the movie did for me, they are my personal stance on each film. Generally when I enter 9 or higher territory, it's always because I thought the film was a masterpiece or almost. 8.5 instead is for great movies that just miss the mark by a hair. Really often I find that I can't immediately put focus on why many 8.5 film don't get the 9 treatment because I am so overwhelmed by how good they are, I never easily find the flaw, but I feel in me it's just missing that mark for something. And as it always happens that something isn't really anything that the film can be blamed for, it isn't a flaw per say, it's just that element that I feel is what is keeping the film from being the freaking best. This is the case of ""Spotlight"", I have realized what is that element that I admit would have been very hard to integrate and could have easily interrupted the beautiful flow the movie has, yet it's the element that if handled well, I believe, could have made the film as harrowing and riveting as it could possibly be. Enough digression, that element is the representation of the church. Now I am nor Christian nor catholic, it is not why I am saying this, the reason I say it is because the church is never given a light side in the film. Maybe the filmmakers thought that the psychologist-priest was that, but he isn't even ever on screen and talks twice. I am not in anyway denying how corrupt and terrible the church can be, on the contrary I am the first to say that, yet in the landscape of the film, giving the church also a light side, which undeniably exists no matter how big or small it is, that's what could have given the film a huge, even bigger, moral value. The discussion would have been raised a notch and it would have been an even more touching and reflective film, if that is possible. On a side note, I do have two nitpick problems: Mark Ruffalo has two scenes that are a little out of place in the film and feel forced, fortunately they are very brief, secondly the film does use end titles and whilst they didn't bother me as usual I still think they don't work 99% of times because they just kill the thirst of knowledge that well done true story films can instill in you and it is also a very cheap emotional punch.<br/><br/>On a further rewatch, which I hope to do very, very soon, I might change my idea and elevate this film even further. But that's not saying much since it is already one of the best films of the year and one of the delights a film fan can ask for."
"classicsoncall","9","1","1","16 February 2016"," ""They knew and they let it happen. To kids!""
","When news of child abuse in the Catholic church began to start filtering out, I immediately had a visceral reaction to it. It's something you just don't want to acknowledge is happening to young kids at the hands of those who are supposed to be the most trusted and credible members of a community. But then, when it became common knowledge that the perpetrators of that abuse were not held accountable, and in fact were reassigned to another parish to begin the cycle all over again, it was a turning point in the practice of my faith. As a Roman Catholic I had faithfully gone to Mass on Sunday for fifty years. No more.<br/><br/>Now I don't begrudge people from practicing their faith and I'm not on a personal mission to dissuade those who find solace in religion. It's just that the hypocrisy in this instance is simply beyond the realm. It leaves me with a conflicted feeling as well because a good part of my schooling was at the parochial level as well as Catholic high school, and those years were rewarding and fulfilling. So this was not an easy choice to make.<br/><br/>The power of the film lies in the tenacity and perseverance of the Spotlight reporting team in taking on a task against overwhelming odds and stigmatization. It didn't look like it was going to go that way at first, but as each revelation became known, circumstances kept multiplying to such a degree that the story almost began writing itself. It's a tribute to the power of intense investigative journalism that an evil like child abuse in the Church has been uncovered and reported on, and is finally bringing some measure of closure, if not relief, to it's victims.<br/><br/>The picture features a fine ensemble cast and it's noteworthy that no single actor overpowers the rest. As an Oscar contender for 2016, I think it stacks up about equally with ""The Big Short"", which means it's probably not going to win the big prize as ""The Revenant"" appears to be formidable. But it's a good film and an important story, so a viewing recommendation is in order."

","Spotlight centers a journalism team that tries to expose a scandal over Catholic churches. It takes dilemmas to show this story to the people that could bring a serious vulnerable effect at the culture of Boston. The movie showcases how impacting the work is, that it's not easy to just release a story in public, especially as devastating as this one. We explore their practicalities and ethics at handling this case, that it took a year for them to expose. Every detail of this process is done with excellent pace, disclosing every bit of information that is hidden by vulnerable people and giving intriguing arguments on how everyone will be ready to hear this story. Spotlight is powerful by just how smart it depicts the complexity of journalism.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't necessarily go against the religion or anything. Their targets are nothing more than the suspects. It takes an argument that despite that the priests are supposed to be respected for their spiritual commitment, hiding the dark truth behind their crimes would be an abuse of both the law and their power in their creed. There is not a good guy or bad guy labeling between the reporters and the church, it's basically just them fighting to find the truth from people who are hiding it for the sake of protecting either one's dignity or a victim's security. But the tougher choice is deciding when do they have to publish this story, especially close to the events of 9/11, which was a huge hindrance since it's the time when people who lost hope needed comfort from their faith.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't always stick-in-the-mud in this subject. There's some sense of humor when it asks for it. It also allows the characters to be developed, expressing how their job has taken over their personal lives and how suing the church is a big deal to them due to how Catholicism means to their childhood or loved ones. The film just lets it all engaging than just a series of information. The direction just lets us see how their reporting work in a quite compelling way; the uneasy confessions of the victims, the revelation of the amount of suspect priests, convincing. The acting is outstanding; mostly from Mark Ruffalo to Michael Keaton, the talents just shine at every moment they're in.<br/><br/>Spotlight, among the nominees, is the less showy one, but it acknowledges that it's the story it's handling is what makes it powerful. It's more about the hard work journalists go through rigorously finding facts and responsibility of sharing them at the right time. And how it profoundly handles this hot-button issue also made it fascinating. Slick direction keeps things engrossing, smart writing made it engaging and an amazing cast is just entertaining. Spotlight is a magnetic insight of the busier side of journalism."

The director masters the craft of consuming its audience into the images on screen making this film one of a kind. Its ability to solely focus on the content and deny attention towards the cinematic extras solidifies its title as a masterpiece. Directed by Tom McCarthy and Open Road Films, Spotlight is an incredible motion picture about a team of journalists known as ""Spotlight"" stationed at the Boston Globe. These cutting edge journalists uncover the hidden secrets held under the Catholic Church system and its neglect upon punishing priests accused of molesting and abusing innocent young children. What started off as an isolated matter in the city of Boston with thirteen priests later evolves into a worldwide phenomenon. With any reporting job, one must decipher the basis of the story and progress from there. Beginning with very little information and slowly collecting information and tips along the way until a full blown story has been uncovered. This act is demanding and time-consuming as the film portrays through its incredible team including actors Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson also known as Robby, Rachel McAdams as Sasha Pfeiffer , and Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll. With other incredible actors including Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, Live Schreiber as Marty Baron, and John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr. The team along with outside help embark on this dramatic journey to expose the identity and skeletons, which lie within the church and its priests, as well as the tear down of the system and destruction of law. With limited to no use of special effects, Spotlight utilizes the strength of its narrative and characters consuming audience members to become part of the story creating this unexpected performance.

"bartonj2410","10","1","1","1 February 2016"," Utterly compelling drama from Tom McCarthy
","Patience is key in the world of investigative journalism, a fact highlighted in Spotlight, the brilliant biographical drama from director Tom McCarthy. The same man who brought us The Cobbler last year has certainly made major amends with this compelling drama that tells the true story of the revelation that shook the Catholic Church to its core.<br/><br/>When Marty Baron (Live Schreiber) was hired as the new editor of The Boston Globe in 2001, he discovered the Spotlight Team, headed by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), a small group of investigative journalists who can take up to a year to publish a story, consisting of Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) and Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery).<br/><br/>After reading a column about a local Boston priest who was sexually abusing children and the Archbishop of Boston, who chose to ignore these crimes, Baron urges the Spotlight Team to investigate the story. Initially thinking they are investigating a one-off case, the team soon uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and the ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. <br/><br/>Having spent a semester at university studying investigative journalism, I absolutely loved how Tom McCarthy told the story of this team of reporters who slowly start to uncover the horrific truth buried beneath the Catholic Church, piece by piece. McCarthy's film, co-written by Josh Singer, doesn't hold back when it comes to its sensitive subject matter; a story we may not want to hear but one that needed to be heard.<br/><br/>The shock of the revelations are really felt through the screenplay and the character journeys we see throughout, particularly that of Rezendes. I was left shaking my head at some of the truths revealed about the local Boston priests however, I was left open-mouthed at the facts that closed the film. I just could not believe the sheer scale of what had been uncovered.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Spotlight really does boast one hell of an impressive ensemble cast. Each of them work well with the screenplay from McCarthy and Singer, delivering good performances however, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton are the ones that really excel in Spotlight. Ruffalo picks up yet another Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and is probably the main challenge to Sylvester Stallone, while Rachel McAdams really does earn her maiden Academy Award nomination in the role of Sacha Pfeiffer.<br/><br/>The score from Howard Shore impressed me as well. I really felt Shore captured the disturbing side of the investigation while also managing to emphasise the determined work ethic of the Spotlight Team. There's also an eerily brilliant use of the song Silent Night towards the end that deserves a mention.<br/><br/>It may not possess the cinematography of The Revenant or the heart of Creed however, Spotlight is an equally powerful and important film that has to be seen. I really do hope it walks away with the Academy Award for Best Picture come the end of this month."

","""How do you say no to God?"" This is the question that Spotlight at its heart battles with. The answer though is nowhere to be found. There is not a simple explanation and this is the way that Director Tom McCarthy and writer Josh Singer treat the material, with thought, care and complexity.<br/><br/>2001. Pre 9/11. The internet is about to explode. Newspapers are seen as the lesser of the two mediums and the Boston Globe is on the brink of uncovering the truth about Catholic Priests who have been molesting and raping children for years. Everyone else turns a blind eye to the truth, including the church that silences anyone who tries to speak out against them. The Boston Globe assigns a special investigative team 'Spotlight' to help bring justice to the hundreds of victims who don't just originate from Boston, but the entire world.<br/><br/>It would have been all too easy to lose sight of the characters in Spotlight and that was my biggest fear. However, we never lose sight of them for a moment. The main players are Walter Robinson (Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Ruffalo) and Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams). I did not need any more convincing from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams, that they are actors at the top of their game; especially Ruffalo who surprised me further, even after his excellent characterisation in Foxcatcher. He truly is the star of the show, subtly brilliant without drawing attention. Actors like him deserve to be commended.<br/><br/>Where does Spotlight excel the most though? That would be the writing, separating itself from the majority of Biopics and Dramas on the market that are sloppy, predictable and quite frankly a mess. The scripting is dynamic and killer lines sprinkled throughout help convey the drama to audiences, like myself who would never have believed that such horrific events really did happen. We are reminded (but not bludgeoned over the head repeatedly) by the facts. McCarthy handles the film gracefully. Admittedly a shock, when his last project was The Cobbler.<br/><br/>But Spotlight is absorbing cinema, that shocks to the core, never succumbing to the usual clichÃ©s, is dramatic and riveting without ever patronising its audience. When was the last time a Director achieved this with this much trust? Many other Directors would make a film that felt dramatically contrived, even though these events really did happen. The power of a great Director is to make the material excel and go beyond what could have potentially been dramatically inert and lifeless. Spotlight is always moving forward in interesting and meaningful ways. The performances and writing only account for a small percentage of the film's brilliance.<br/><br/>At first glance Spotlight is a film shot simply without an all- encompassing cinematic feel; upon further inspection though it's a beautifully dark and sinister film. With shots that linger on the performances, always cutting away at the right moment and frames that echo the superb brilliance of the famous opening shot from The Godfather. The slow reveal. <br/><br/>I honestly could go on and on about Spotlight because it really is a great film. It's also a rare film that changes the way you perceive the world and the people around you, without feeling exploitative. A statement that is applicable to very few of the films I have seen. Biopics do not get as captivating, thought provoking, emotional and gripping as Spotlight. Why would you miss this? It demands your attention and needs to be seen. It's a true story about real people and real problems we are still facing today, relevant now more than ever. It never feels phony, fake or begging for awards nominations (which it so rightfully deserves). It builds upon everything that comes before its 128 minute runtime and offers up a conclusion that is heart stopping. Not to mention tremendous support from Ruffalo, McAdams and Keaton who bring further emotional weight to the film. All of which contribute to Spotlight standing as one of the greatest films of the decade, if not all time.<br/><br/>A+"
"Troy_Campbell","9","1","1","28 January 2016"," Captivating, insightful and gut-wrenching.
","This journalistic drama recounts a pivotal 12 months of an investigative research team from the Boston Globe, who uncovered decades of systematic abuse against children by the Catholic Church. With subject matter so infuriating and gut-wrenching, it would have been easy for writer-director Tom McCarthy to create a good versus evil arc and give the audience a clear-cut bad guy to despise and deplore. But McCarthy opts for a more intelligent route and keeps the individual offending priests faceless (barring one unsettling and revelatory scene), instead homing in on the atrocities committed by the institution. Unravelling like a journalistic thriller sans the glee, Spotlight is an insightful, methodical and utterly compelling film that provides a window not only into the earth-shattering monstrosities at its core, but also into the mechanics and minutiae of old-school reporting. Understanding that the interactions between the key players is critical to maintaining a level of reality in what would otherwise seem completely unbelievable (despite being true), McCarthy keeps his direction unflashy, allowing the high calibre cast to flourish. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Brian d'Arcy James, Live Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci are all at the top of their games with fleshed out and layered performances that favour subtlety over grandstanding. Spotlight is a brilliantly told true story that captivates from beginning to end, deserving each of its six Academy Award nominations and a place on everybody's must-see list."
"abouhelier-r","10","1","1","27 January 2016"," Spotlight
","The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its score.<br/><br/>It's been nearly 40 years since All the President's Men turned two young reporters into stars and inspired a whole generation of young people to become journalists. Now the best journalism movie since Alan J. Pakula classic is coming to theatres; hoping the film will give a similar boost to journalists and their profession. This film is a disturbing movie, but in all the good ways. This happened, people dealt with it, they brought the story to light and this is why they were doing so good. The truly dramatic story here lies offscreen and goes a great degree in the past, while the journalists work consisted mostly of persistence, constant grinding and not having a life until the job is done - and maybe not even then. This film is most of all a reminder of the kind of investigate print journalism, which is becoming even more rarer. This material can't help but be interesting, even compelling. <br/><br/>As numerous notable films have demonstrated, the spectacle of lowly scribes bringing down the great and powerful can make for exciting, more than interesting cinema. However, there's none of the paranoia of a picture like (mentioned before) Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film or Michael Mann's The Insider (1999). Spotlight has a few inevitable journo clichÃ©s where male reporters are dishevelled, don't need to keep the same hours as everyone else, machismo on the subjects of poker and sports and they somehow never need to do the boring grind of sitting down and writing on computers. Though, this movie is honourably concerned to avoid sensationalism and the bad taste involved in implying that journalists, and not the child abuse survivors, are the really important people here. Plus, what is interesting about this film is that it reminds you that the theory of child abuse by priests was widely accepted until relatively recently. <br/><br/>On the one hand, there's no real depth given to these reporters. Unfortunately, characters are not interesting or distinctive enough, even the uniformly excellent actors playing them can't bring them to life all by themselves. On the other hand, the movie doesn't make them look like heroes as well, but more like what they truly are: reporters, doing their job in order to highlight a true story. In fact, Michael Keaton is terrific here again after Birdman. Throughout the film, as this case built and built to the point where you are just amazed this is a true story displayed in front of you; actors performed and hold back so well that as you watch it you almost don't feel like you're watching a film anymore but a documentary. Despite having actors that are so recognisable, they truly disappear into their characters and when you can say that of a film, they win. What McCarthy is saying in this movie is that threats never need to be made. A word here, a drink there, a frown and a look on the golf course or at the charity ball, this was all that was needed to enforce a silence surrounding a transgression that most of the community could hardly believe existed anyway. Finally, there is something cautious about the film dramatic pace and as McCarthy keeps the narrative motor running, there are some very good scenes. Chiefly the extraordinary moment when Sacha Pfeiffer starring Rachel McAdams confronts a retired priest ans asks him, flat out, if he has ever molested a child. The resulting scene had me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>Overall, this well intentioned journalism drama capably tells an important story. It blew me away, it's a remarkably well written and acted film."

","Don't remember the last time I saw a film so undeserving of the outpouring of praise it received. 30 minutes into this thing and it was everything I could do to keep from squirming and going to sleep and doing the dishes and working on my own stuff. I am sick and tired of movies that use the infinitely compelling and tragic topic of child molestation to gather interest, and then the movie does not deliver the goods. One or two lines about a priest telling a little boy to do something sick does not a great movie make. If this had been a Clint Eastwood movie, I guarantee he would have taken us behind closed doors, perhaps even a look at one of the sick, twisted mothers of one of these kids that knew her child was being molested by these nasty priests and did nothing about it for whatever reason. And dear God, where are the NUNS??? Nuns are just as sick and twisted as priests if not more. And maybe, its time for somebody to film the echo of one of these scenes taking place; show us the priest going into the boy's confessional or something. And where are the little girls that were molested? http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ crime-scene/tom-jackman/priest-sentenced-for-molesting.html I am still waiting for a good movie about this topic and this is not the one. Though touching in parts, this movie is well written, well acted BOREDOM. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, on its worst day, is better."

","If I could describe Spotlight in just one single word, it would definitely be 'Simplicity'. This could be found in every single aspect, like acting, editing, cinematography, setting, etc. When it comes to naturality and credibility, the film scores 100%. Frankly said,I don't really know what entire buzz is. Yes, Spotlight indeed puts a 'figurative' spotlight on the scandal in the Catholic Church, which is a touchy subject, but the film felt a bit dull and actionless. When it wasn't for the modest, humane and authentic acting performances, I would simply rank Spotlight with the endless reruns of the CSI-series we get to swallow every year again.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams (The Notebook, Mean Girls) shows her natural acting skills as the only female member of the team, called Sacha Pfeiffer. Mark Ruffalo (Shutter Island, The Avengers) as Mike Rezendes seems properly casted because of his ever-tormented facial expressions., which are not out of place for the somewhat frustrated and hard-working Rezendes. Stand-out was Brian D'Arcy James as Matt Carroll though, with his witty manners and fatherly care taken to the upper level, when he finds out that one of the suspect priests lives just around the corner.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film has a monotonous pace, which you really had to stay focused for. The lack of action and tsunami of dialogues creates a situation of information-overload and name-throwing, without even put a face to them. Although editor Tom McArdle, who also edited McCarthy's The Visitor in 2007, is nominated for Best Film editing, I never witnessed any peculiarities which could make Spotlight so outstanding. Also the setting was simple in that sense. Offices, court rooms,.. all of them very late 90's.<br/><br/>Remarkable once again is the cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi, who easily adapts his work to the director's style, but still is able to capitivate the atmosphere of the historical setting. The rather old-fashioned way of filming and use of colours (or lack of colours) reminded me of Scott Cooper's Black Mass (2015). And guess what, its cinematography was also by the very same Takayanagi.<br/><br/>What kept me watching was the detailed narrative and accuracy of the features given. Could you imagine 90 accused priests in Boston since the '70s? And they only came up with the report in 2001? Those are some details that really strike me. Hats of for the real-life journalists of the who went deep to get this case and report it in the Boston Globe in a humane and respectful way, although they involved many institutions in the controversy, namely Church and Law. The film based on these events is nonetheless too modest and not outstanding or provoking enough to be worth receiving 6 Oscar nominations."

","To watch 2015's most talked about movie ""Spotlight"" is to not only get compelled by its excellence but also to encourage conversation of its dark subject matter. As it is inspired by true events, every detail will crawl deeply on your skin. And it would be a fascinating picture to see it from three standpoints: one is obviously from its aesthetics, another from its morals and last on its stance in religion.<br/><br/>Aesthetic-wise, director Thomas McCarthy intelligently crafted a fine dialogue-laden picture with tense situations and compelling details. Necessary for a movie about journalists, especially about The Boston Globe's Spotlight team cracking the Boston Catholic church sex scandal. Every character is at the same pedestal, proving how every involvement matters. And the wonderful ensemble, composed of Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schrieber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci, makes up for writer Josh Singer's finely tuned script. At each point when one detail is exposed, a sense of terror is felt in every encounter. Also kudos as well to cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi's camera-work and editor Tom McArdle's pacing that keeps every scene interesting.<br/><br/>When it comes to its subject, the movie takes no sides. Everyone is on the same page, as journalism is amoral in form. And for that, ""Spotlight"" takes no safe detours on tackling taboo topics. What prevails is doing the right choice. And from a journalist's point of view, this film challenges the audience's stance in morality and rights.<br/><br/>Speaking of stance, for a loyally religious (like yours truly), ""Spotlight"" is an eye opener. One may get the gyst that seeing this movie will distort one's perception of the Church, given how comprehensive the real-life Massachusetts archdiocese sex scandal was. For the most affected, this should be a wakeup call to stand firm more in faith and tolerance. And for the rest, it is easy to accept this as a dark reality and a worldwide epidemic. But better understand this as a character study/period piece of people under fire from a painful subject matter; and does not reflect every member. And it would be easy for one to comprehend every horrid reality, as Tom McCarthy perfectly assembled one of this year's finest offerings and one of the best movies about journalism."

"paul-allaer","9","4","9","24 November 2015"," outstanding investigative journalism movie (reminiscent of All the PResident's Men)
","""Spotlight"" (2015 release; 128 min.) brings the true story of how the Boston Globe eventually broke the story of the widespread abuse of young children by Boston priests while the Catholic Church stood by and covered it up. As the movie opens, we are in ""Boston, MA - 1976"", where we see a priest being accused of abuse. ""Wait until the arraignment, the press will be all over it"", comments one cop. ""What arraignment?"", replies the other cop. We then fast-forward to ""July, 2001"", and we get to know the 4 member Spotlight, an investigative reporting team at the Boston Globe. The Globe also has just gotten a new editor, Marty Baron, ""an unmarried Jewish guy who doesn't like baseball"" (the implication being he's no fit for Boston). But it's not long before Baron picks up on a recent column about abuse by Boston priests, and he orders Spotlight to look into it. At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer and sometimes director Tom McCarthy (he won an Oscar for writing ""UP""), and I have to say, ""Spotlight"" is the giant leap forward as a director, and he has now placed himself in the upper ranks of today's directors. The trick with these movies is: how can the director brings a movie, whose outcome we already know going in, and still capture our attention? It was the same question faced by the makers of ""All The President's Men"", of course, and in fact ""Spotlight"" very much reminds me of ""All The President's Men"": top-notch all the way, and it feels like a thriller as you're watching it. At one point, someone comments ""it takes a village to raise a child, and it takes a village to abuse a child"", pinpointing the collective failing of all of Boston for so many years. The abuse of power and influence of the Catholic Church is simply appalling. Kudos to the various performers, including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachael McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and Liev Schreiber, just to name those. They all bring powerful performances. Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral score from Hollywood veteran composer Howard Shore. If ""Spotlight"" does somewhat okay at the box office, I think that this movie will be in line for a bunch of nominations and even awards in the upcoming awards season.<br/><br/>The movie recently opened nationally in the theater. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers, FL was reasonably attended but by no means a sell-out. I truly hope that this movie finds an audience, not just because it covers an important issue but most of all because it is one heck of a movie. IF you liked ""All the President's Men"", drop everything and go see this. ""Spotlight"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

"StevePulaski","9","4","9","23 November 2015"," A film so low-key and subtle you might mistake it for another adult drama in a saturated market
","""Spotlight""'s pervasive casual attitude and laidback presentation as a film almost effectively undermine two things - how uniformly solid the acting is all around and how terrific of a film this really is. Reminiscent of Danny Boyle's ""Steve Jobs"" last month in that it's a film that focuses on a lot of decidedly smaller, human moments that make up the entirety of the project, ""Spotlight"" is a film that, unless you really look at it from various angles in its acting, storytelling, and pacing, you might mistake it for just another drama in a sea of adult entertainment this holiday season.<br/><br/>The film revolves around The Boston Globe newsroom, specifically the Spotlight team, a division of about four field reporters who choose a topic apart from a great deal of media attention and devote months of investigation in order to give an elaborate, in-depth story on it in a future paper. The team is comprised of Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), the veteran of the group who often acts as the leader, Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), a young, persistent journalist, Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), the woman responsible for undergoing difficult interviews that largely involve cold-approaching people, and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James), a family man who does a great deal of the team's research.<br/><br/>In response to the paper's slumping readership despite being acquired by The New York Times years earlier, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) is brought into make adjustments where needed. Upon arrival, he more or less directs the Spotlight team to focus their attention on the Boston archdiocese and the prevalent cases of molestation and sexual abuse involving priests and minors in the Catholic Church. Once the group begins to dive in and investigate, they realize the scope of the case is much greater and more impacting than any of them imagined, and also learn that The Globe had a great deal of this information at their disposal years ago but sat on their hands instead of covering it.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" takes a fascinatingly relaxed approach to this story, focusing on the breezy conversations and etiquette in a newsroom. Boston Globe's Spotlight team proves that, while investigative journalism has the ability to shake an entire nation, it's also criminally underfunded, much like watchdog journalism, which both find themselves largely segregated on the secondary sources of the internet in the present day. This sort of very nonchalant vibe does wonders when ""Spotlight"" inevitably turns emotional, specifically when Michael and Sacha find themselves interviewing former victims of priests who have lived with the hell and uncertainty of their troubled childhood experiences.<br/><br/>Much like a well-written news article, ""Spotlight"" has the ability to infuriate in a manner that doesn't derail the project into manipulative territory. A large portion of the film is devoted to the meticulous practices of contemporary journalistic investigations in a way that really shows the talky, but elaborate process of interviewing. Americans, many of whom can't go a day without picking up a newspaper or reading a webpage or an email telling them the day's events, often do not consider what goes into the stories we read and take for granted each day; ""Spotlight"" not only showcases the impact the stories can have, but also shows the most important parts of the newsgathering process in a way that is gripping without being bombastic.<br/><br/>The lax attitude and approach writers Thomas McCarthy (also director) and Josh Singer almost disguises the attention to acting and character development on display here. Michael Keaton hits another home-run with his human portrayal of Walter Robinson, largely because his character, unlike Riggen Thomson in ""Birdman"" last year, is never too dramatic or out of his own element. Meanwhile, Mark Ruffalo does a great job at being both a younger journalist and a likable one; not a smug nor self-serious jokester who ostensibly stumbled into the job as generic Hollywood roles would traditionally have it, Rachel McAdams delivers some of the strongest and most compelling work of her career thanks to her realistic portrayal of her character, and the same goes for Brian d'Arcy James.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" doesn't look to shortchange any of these characters nor play them to predictable types. Walter isn't the kind of veteran journalist who screams and shouts whenever he doesn't get his way, Michael isn't the lackadaisical bloke who doesn't take his work seriously, Sacha isn't the ditsy journalist who needs to constant be reminded her job comes with a big responsibility, Matt isn't a stiff-as-a-board moralist, and Marty isn't the evil corporate downsizer looking to corrupt the integrity of The Globe (not openly, at least). None of these characters pander to conventional archetypes and perhaps that, much like the strength of the film's approach, will be lost upon audiences who do not actively notice it at first.<br/><br/>Finally, McCarthy directs ""Spotlight"" with humble interjections of style; consider a key telephone interview being the subject of a medium-length take that has all the members of the Spotlight team hovered around a phone. McCarthy's camera focuses on the telephone before slowly pulling back the camera to reveal the entire team, and then pulling even further back down a hallway to minimize the size of the team. This interview really establishes the scope of the Catholic Church's unforgivable crimes, and this effort to showcase how small this team is in the face of this huge issue is a nice way to capture the film with an unwritten thesis, and investigative journalism in a nutshell. Everything in ""Spotlight"" that's so brilliantly done is so quietly captured that it's almost as if it's designed for you to miss. With that, I'd advise you to watch it like you would read a gripping news article: with intent to focus and read between the lines, even the headlines."

","The politics in this movie will probably earn it some Oscar nominations, because if there's anything we know about the Academy it's that it loves historically or politically significant movies (The Imitation Game, American Sniper, The Theory of Everything as nominations for Best Picture just from last year). This movie will be a shoe-in for the nomination, but more importantly it deserves the nomination.<br/><br/>The issue depicted in the film may seem a little dated (the story takes place in 2001) but it is nonetheless an important issue to discuss. The movie is somewhat aware of this as there are constant references to the fact that The Boston Globe could have exposed this issue of priests molesting children years ago and it is a mystery why they did not.<br/><br/>Most people would probably describe the film as being slow-paced, to which I would respond that the movie wouldn't accomplish anything more than if it was edited to have a faster pace. This film needs to fill the audience in on details, and the audience is aware of that. It allows the audience to get the full impact of what is at issue here if we follow the journalists' investigation step by step.<br/><br/>Spotlight has an ensemble cast of A-list actors including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and John Slattery, who all deliver great performances. I predict that Ruffalo will be nominated as Best Supporting Actor for the second year in a row. There is a moment in the film when his character has to show determination and frustration simultaneously as his suggestion is denied by Keaton's character, and at this point in the story we are forced to side with Ruffalo and the scene is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>While the cast as a whole is great, we only get tiny insights into other characters' motivations and perspectives, but these glimpses still illustrate who the characters are perfectly. For example, one of the team members realize there is a pedophile priest living just a block away from him, and his first thought is to protect the children of the area. He cannot warn the children, however, until the story is released, once again making us question the decisions made by the executives at The Boston Globe.<br/><br/>My last comment is that this film is never visually interesting, but political dramas like this are not meant to be great works of art; rather, they are meant to create a cohesive story with well- developed characters to root for, and the film does exactly that and more. These types of film rely on realism, and while they are not necessarily documentaries, they need to inform us of real-world issues, and Spotlight never fails at doing so.<br/><br/>4.0/4.0"

","Spotlight refers to the group of investigative reporters who work for The Boston Globe. The group has been there since the 1970 and will often spend months working on a single story. In 2001, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) comes in from Florida as their new editor-in-chief and asks the current team to put their latest investigation on hold and look into allegations of a Catholic priest's sexual abuse against a minor and the potential cover-up. Retiring editor Walter ""Robbie"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) and his team of reporters are hesitant at first, considering Baron to be an outsider just trying to stir things up. Eventually Robbie and his investigators Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) agree to the story and find the truth is much worse than one priest and one child.<br/><br/>My only concern was the potential for deep lulls in the movie pulling the investigation and interviews together for their story over the course of the 2 hour and 8 minute film. The ""lulls"" of the investigation were actually the driving points of the film. Each stone the team overturned revealed more abuses, more victims and more cover-up on what turned out to be a global scale. I gave Spotlight an anticipatory 3.5 stars as I had a feeling it would be entertaining, moving and bold, but probably one of those films that seeing it once or twice would be enough without feeling the need or desire to own it. I actually lowered it half a star. Again, it's tough to rate these movies on their creative license when they are based on true stories, however, the main purpose of these reviews is to gauge how accurately the film as portrayed in the preview. The preview for Spotlight made it seem like religious leaders, politicians, lawyers and more would be vehemently blocking the team's investigation and story at every turn. In truth, it really wasn't that difficult for them to find attorneys, victims, and even perpetrators who were willing to come forward to help them piece their story together. There was a lot of talk about how powerful the church was and the reach of their control with friends in influential places, but little action to that effect throughout their digging.<br/><br/>Spotlight was, as anticipated, disgustingly moving and disturbing. It was well-written and brilliantly acted by the entire team, but a bit less dramatic than the preview lead me to believe. I enjoyed it, might watch it again, but most likely won't be making it to my home collection."

It is an important film and given the Royal Commission currently underway to address abuse cases originating from Australia, a topical one that really should be seen.<br/><br/>Without spoilers, I can safely state that this film is actually quite accessible and not as difficult to watch as I had previously anticipated. Whilst Spotlight addresses horrific crimes against children, I did not consider it to be in any way gratuitous or exploitative. It has a docu-drama feel about it which makes it somewhat cold and impersonal.<br/><br/>It must be noted that Spotlight is a true story about the investigative process led by three committed journalists, their editor (brilliantly played by Michael Keaton), the socially awkward editor in chief also wonderfully downplayed by the always dependable Liev Schrieber, and their relationship with members of the legal fraternity. <br/><br/>It is however less concerned about the abuse victims' stories and is largely focused on the team's interest in exposing the magnitude of the systemic abuse by the Catholic Church. Which as we are now all witnessing from watching the news, reverberates all the way to the Vatican. Make no mistake, in certain scenes, this film will make your blood boil. And this is to me Spotlight's fundamental weakness in that it really only manages to scratch the surface of the horrors for which the church is squarely responsible. And only just manages to do so."

","Surpassing all my expectations 'Spotlight' is a genre of film making largely left behind for the air-headed action blockbuster. A genre overlooked at the expense of storytelling with the highest degree of integrity. I was pleased I didn't know more than the basics before heading to the Cinema and surprised to learn I had just watched a 130min film that moved at such a smart pace it seemed more like 90mins. Looking back over the list of award winning talent involved, coupled with the extended care they took with editing explained why. While not always agreeing with the glitzy awards process this is one of the few times I felt they got it right. <br/><br/>The balance of voice over, and music under montages was flawless. Howard Shore's inspired score was special, managing to be melodic and actionful all at once. During one sequence, Shore propels a bed of rapidly edited investigative research images with an intense underscore, at the same time leaving me wanting to revisit the sound track just to enjoy the musicality. <br/><br/>It's not all that common to be treated like thinking adults by modern commercial movie makers and it leaves this audience member wanting more. The whole exercise had the look and feel everyone involved wanted to leave a little part of themselves (for all the best reasons!) etched in motion picture history. Director Tom Mc Carthy (remembered for his part in creating that great story ""Up"" in 2009) creates another winner. The sterling cast and crew are all deserving of their awards and nominations. It's also to be hoped this work may go towards convincing the perverted and sick to stay away from institutions whose sole purpose should be to serve as 'carers', not for gaining opportunistic access to the less fortunate. And perhaps if humanly possible, recognize and seek treatment for their afflictions, not inflict them on others. <br/><br/>All institutions must take responsibility for those they employ and how they conduct themselves to protect the vulnerable. The astonishing level of research details given within the end credits show a shocking pattern of actions taken by the Vatican 'city' in moving offenders out of prime positions throughout the world, into 'prime' positions within that very 'city' or otherwise.<br/><br/>When an institution supposedly dedicated to the word of GOD begins making and serving its own laws, there's little hope it can any longer genuinely serve God or humanity. As for the law society and their part in these and other atrocities...there's an equal measure of shame. Even, as this brave film demonstrates, journalists themselves are not without guilt. Can we also dare to consider this work may possibly contribute towards lifting the level of support for 'quality' journalism in these days of superficial 'social' media!!?<br/><br/>Bravo all round (and a nod of recognition for that other great Boston establishment WGBH for their past years of similarly great documentaries that this movie reminded me of) <br/><br/>Note to caring parents (if any still out there).

"ElMaruecan82","9","3","6","22 February 2016"," ""All the Archbishop's Men""... or 6% of them...
","Tom McCarthy's ""Spotlight"" is one of these movies that are either loved or hated for the wrong reasons. Wherever your faith stands, it is not a charge against the Roman Catholic Church, but members of the Archdiocese who covered up ongoing child molestations and protected incriminated priests. The film's goal is less to make people question their faith on God, than on the men in charge of their faith. Ultimately, the Church's greatest enemy becomes the Church itself.<br/><br/>And the film's brilliant screenplay erases all the controversy in one single line and I salute Tom McCarthy, the director of Catholic background, and co-writer with Josh singer, to have very intelligently made his point through one simple exchange. Reporter Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) is talking to one of the victims, and the man says he still considers himself a Catholic. How so? Mike asks. It's simple, the Catholic Church is an Institution, made by men, and men pass by while faith is eternal. Mike, a Catholic like many members of the 'Spotlight' unit, doesn't get it, but at least the point is made: the priests who commit these crimes were criminal and the whole investigation aims the accomplices, which leas to another masterstroke of writing: the portrayal of the 'villain'.<br/><br/>Wait, what villain? Did I miss something? Was there a bad guy in the film? Not outside the script as McCarthy deliberately avoided depicting the incriminated Cardinal Law as a physical presence in the film, in order to avoid the presence of a polarizing villain. And sometimes, the invisibility of the 'bad guy' makes his influence even more fearsome, especially when, as the investigations progresses, the journalists understand it's not just about the Church, it's a whole system that is involved. And you can feel it from the directing, Boston, the Catholic city, the birthplace of the Kennedys, the setting of ""The Verdict"" another thrilling courtroom drama with religious figures in cause, this Boston is a great city, but it feels rather small and confined in ""Spotlight"", as to convey a sense of paranoid entrapment, you know like ""what happens in Boston, stays in Boston"".<br/><br/>And this is exactly how the sexual abuses spread widely and became a pattern that would forever soil the image of the Church. No one took the responsibility, no one faced the facts, no lawyers had the guts to appeal to court and no journalist dared to dig deeper in the case, including the Globe, it was all settled privately. Everyone is responsible, and this is why the film's impartiality isn't to be challenged, they're all part of the same hypocrisy and like Mitchell Garabedian, Stanley Tucci as the lawyer who wrote a column accusing Cardinal Law of covering up a priest, ""it takes a city to raise a child, it takes a city to abuse one"". And I guess this is why it will take an outsider to start all over again. It's not too late after all, to make up lost time.<br/><br/>Marty Barone (Liev Schreiber) is the new editor of the Globe, and sees the Garabedian's column as the tree that hides the forest. He asks the 'Spotlight' investigate unit, lead by 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) to investigate. Thanks to Rezendes' tenacity, Geberian blows the whistle and give other names, and the snowball effect leads to a series of convocations, door-knocks, interviews with the victims, lawyers who were in charge of the case, and from a few priests, it turns to 6% of the Archdiocese being involved. And like its glorious predecessor, ""All the President's Men"", ""Spotlight"" makes a thriller out of a relatively safe mission without threatening phone calls, death threats, gunshots or chases in dark parking lots.<br/><br/>But if the journalists' lives are not at stakes, the harm is already done for the victims' lives, forever ruined as it wasn't just ""physical, but psychological"" abuse, so what the investigation does is a quest for justice and for shining (literally) the spotlight on the people who let some awful crimes to be and let be done. ""What's your responsibility to publish this?"" Mike is asked by a judge, his answer is perfect: ""what's our responsibility not to publish it"". It's a matter of ethics, and as the white knights, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams make an interesting Redford-Hoffman-like pair with Keaton as 'Jason Robards', encouraging the team to go further, or slow down for tactical reasons. Tlming matters as well and it's for these little subtleties, that the screenplay is a winner.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is one of the year's most critically acclaimed movies, and the Best Picture front-runner, earning a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Ruffalo was the pounding heart of the film) and for directing and screenplay. Speaking of the screenplay, there's an abundance of name-dropping in the film and that can get pretty confusing, (there's even a moment where they kept referring to Law, and I didn't know it was the name of a Cardinal). But these considerations are trivial because it was the same with ""All the President's Men"" and it wasn't much an issue, as the film is most about the procedural than the details, the big scope: how this team of five journalists will make the light of truth shine. And McCarthy's sober directing, respectful to our intelligence, doesn't overdo the cheers, the last shot alone is emotionally rewarding.<br/><br/>For playing in the safe side and for its own good, ""Spotlight"" turns out to be one of the best movies of 2015, and shouldn't be judged for its attack against the Church, but for its fight for the truth, for justice and for the dignity of the victims who were too scared to translate their pain into words. Indeed, it's hard enough to talk about 'sexuality' and religion in public statements, imagine in the same sentence. And it's reassuring that the film was also well-received by the Church which, in a way, is coming to terms with its own demons."

","""It could have been you, it could have been me, it could have been any of us. We gotta nail these scumbags! We gotta show people that nobody can get away with this; Not a priest, or a cardinal or a freaking pope!""<br/><br/>Good investigative journalism is a dying medium in today's world where most media outlets are in a rush to get the exclusive and tell the story first. The same could be said for the film industry, but there are always exceptions because for every dozens of films like Alvin and the Chipmunks, we get a Spotlight. Director, Tom McCarthy, takes his time to tell this brilliant true story through a tight script that slowly begins to uncover the truth behind one of the Catholic Church's greatest cover-ups. It is a reminder of how important good journalism can be in today's world. Hopefully after watching Spotlight more people will begin reading their news from trusty newspapers instead of simply reading headlines from any internet article. It was refreshing to see a film like this portraying what good journalism is all about without taking any shortcuts. As a communication major the subject matter really appealed to me and I felt very emotional during a couple of scenes. McCarthy did a fantastic job at going through the every day ordeal of investigating. If you notice there is barely any reference towards these characters backgrounds or their family life. The entire film focuses entirely on their profession and that is what makes this such a powerful film because it avoids any kind of manipulation into character development. I loved the attention to detail that McCarthy brought to the film and how he decided to exclusively build it all around the investigation.<br/><br/>Bringing the true events of an investigation concerning the child molestation cover-up by the Catholic Church to life in a film might not seem like an interesting subject matter, but McCarthy handles the material with grace. He manages to slowly build the tension by going through the everyday ordeals of serious journalism. Spotlight is the name given to the investigative section of the Globe comprised of four reporters that take their time to research an important issue and build a compelling story. In this case they discover a link between several child molestation incidents with some priests from the Boston area and how the Church has repeatedly covered up for them by simply relocating them to other areas. These four reporters are given the gigantic task of trying to unmask this secretly huge system of defense built by the Catholic Church. The film accomplishes what it sets out to do from the first frame and it delivers one of the best films about investigative journalism in years. <br/><br/>This is a team effort, there are no lead performances in this film. Michael Keaton might be the leader of the Spotlight team, but Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James all deliver strong performances. Ruffalo has received much of the acclaim because he has some of the more emotional moments on screen, and that verbal standoff off with Keaton is powerful, but everyone on screen delivers solid performances. Liev Schreiber is also outstanding as the new editor in chief who arrives at the Globe and comes up with the idea for the story. And Stanley Tucci of course is always mesmerizing any time he's on screen. Spotlight has probably my favorite ensemble cast of the year. I was a huge fan of this film and of course comparisons with All The President's Men are justified."
"wolverinesforever","9","3","6","2 January 2016"," The power of investigation
","It's incredible what good writing can do. The screenplay for ""Spotlight"" (written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer) takes several characters, a trying investigation that got deeper and deeper as the months progressed, and have managed to compact it down into a very compelling 128 minutes (and the film feels shorter than that, another good sign). Honestly, McCarthy (as a director), his crew, and the cast didn't need to do a whole lot else to punch things up. This is straightforward storytelling about an important piece of investigative journalism, and rarely does it make any mistakes.<br/><br/>Given how many people are involved in this (I'm even reluctant to declare one person the ""main character""), I'll have to summarize the plot without giving names. A new chief editor has been hired at the Boston Globe, and he's looking for a way to get readership up. He commissions the four person ""Spotlight"" team of the Globe to investigate reports of a priest molesting children in the Boston area (even though the team doesn't take requests). The team accepts the commission, but as they dig deeper, they find the case involves way more priests, victims, and even lawyers than originally imagined. <br/><br/>Given how labyrinth things get, one might think the script would try to shortchange events or dumb down certain scenes. But thankfully, McCarthy and Singer are smarter than that. They assume that we, the audience, are intelligent people, and that we will be able to follow everything on the screen. The amount of detail to the plot is heavy (and may require a second viewing, or subtitles), but as long as you stay alert, it can be followed. When the film ended, I had both a greater appreciation for all of the work the Boston Globe put into investigating this story, and I sought out more information for myself about the case. To me, that's a sign that I was really involved in the plot. <br/><br/>The cast? Home runs all around. What a relief to see Michael Keaton get a good role that's not Batman or references his Batman past. Liev Schreiber is incredibly convincing as the soft spoken, but determined new editor who wants this story told. For Mark Ruffalo, one of his best roles yet. The same goes for Rachel McAdams. Stanley Tucci? Hey, what else can you expect but excellence from him. There are several other names I know I've left out, but rest assured that every performance is very convincing. These are smart people in action; you understand why they make every decision that they do. Again, what a relief that this film assumes that we are an intelligent audience, and will watch smart choices on the screen.<br/><br/>I have heard a few people comment that the Catholic church doesn't seem like a big threat in this film. I have to disagree. The Catholic church is a force in this film, but not in an obvious way. The dirty work has already been done. The crimes have been committed, the paper trails have been eliminated, and now it is up to the Spotlight team to put the vast pieces together and write an all-encompassing article about the church's actions. When people involved with the church tell these reporters ""don't do this,"" I think it's more out of their knowledge of how much their (formerly) private world is going to be rocked, not so much a threat of violence. <br/><br/>The one thing this screenplay may be short on is character development. This is a film that is more interested in following the events of the investigation that deeply knowing the people involved. But that is an okay tact to go with, as it allows for the storytelling to be very straightforward. And, if you listen closely, there are a few clues peppered throughout that subtly indication what makes each person tick.<br/><br/>We've had some great movies about investigation in the past. ""Ciziten Kane"" on the fiction side, and ""The Insider"" on the non-fiction side, for example. Add ""Spotlight"" to that list. It's smart about its characters and their decisions, it assumes we are smart and will understand a detailed plot, and it leaves a thought provoking impression at the end. My interest has been very piqued in these events, and between that and the terrific screenplay, I'm not sure how much else I can do to compliment this film."
"joeravioli","8","3","6","13 December 2015"," Spotlight is the best film of the year (and an excellent film too!)
","Although it pains me to say this, I suppose that it is the truth, and therefore, cannot be brushed off as inconsequential: Spotlight is the best film that I have seen this year. I say this with some regret, because prior to having seen this film, I was convinced that no film could surpass the quality of Mad Max: Fury Road, and much of the films deemed as ""Oscar bait"" were little more than senseless, boring, over-acted, and rudely political dramas.<br/><br/>Ah well. Apparently politics has its place.<br/><br/>Spotlight is All the President's Men for my generation, in that it takes pity on our decrepit attention span and limited intellectual capacity, opting instead for a slower, less spastic narrative that successfully engages our minds without leaving us choking on its dust. If anything, it's a much better film than Pakula's classic, because it takes Redford and Hoffman's breakneck sleuthing, and intersperses it with an unexpected but welcome dose of real and painful human emotion. While Pakula's characters were inconsistent, McCarthys' have satisfying arcs and much more depth. Spotlight is focused and ambitious, and yet, manages to be an emotional experience.<br/><br/>Spotlight deals with a rather uncomfortable subject, and to its credit, refuses to water it down with taciturn dialogue and unceremonious character interactions. It is raw, and occasionally explicit (only in the verbal sense), the film conveying the real-life events of the discovery of sexual abuse towards children in the Catholic Church with all the fury that such a story should entail. Mark Ruffalo stars as Mike Rezendes, a reporter working on the ""Spotlight"" team at the Boston Globe in 2001. The film follows the same structure as All the President's Men, in that much of its running time is consumed by searching through records, convincing people to testify, and awkward interviews.<br/><br/>The one and only thing I didn't like about the film was Mark Ruffalo's performance, which, considering the fact that he was the main character, interfered with my enjoyment of the film. His character seemed to hover precariously between sociopathic and sensitive, making it seem as if Ruffalo felt out of place in his own skin. At times he is passionate, at other times he is unfeelingly ambitious and rude. I suppose that the journalist character has been, to a certain extent, narrowed down to an uninteresting clichÃ© of ambition and insensitivity. But, to McCarthy's credit, while Rezendes is often rude and tiresome, he has moments of riveting and unsettling emotion, transforming him from an ambitious journalist to an passionate and sensitive individual.<br/><br/>Taking into consideration the intellectual effect that the film manages to captivate the audience with, Ruffalo's performance is only a slight restraint. Spotlight is riveting and fun, giving the audience a well-deserved break from sloppy, boring dramas that critics seem to lap up without the slightest consideration as to how good the film actually is. It's a film that is good because it is made with sensitivity and intelligence, rather than a film that succeeds based on a label or on a performance. Taking into consideration the films I have seen, I can say with a certain degree of confidence that Spotlight is the best film of 2015."
"Hellmant","9","3","6","9 December 2015"," Even the Catholic Church itself, has praised the movie!
","'SPOTLIGHT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>This year's Academy Awards Best Picture frontrunner, is this critically acclaimed drama film; directed and co-written (with Josh Singer) by Tom McCarthy. It stars Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Liev Schreiber, Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. The film tells the true story of the Boston Globe's 2001 'Spotlight' team of investigators, which uncovered decades of sexual abuse, towards minors, by Catholic priests; and the Church's cover-up of the crimes. The film deserves all of it's praise; it's one of the year's best!<br/><br/>The Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' team, is the longest running newspaper investigation team, in the US. In 2003, they earned the paper a 'Pulitzer Prize for Public Service'; for uncovering decades of child molestation abuse, involving 87 priests in Boston alone, and the Catholic Church's despicable cover-up of the crimes. This film tells that story; and it centers around journalists Walter Robinson (Keaton), Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams), Ben Bradley Jr. (Slattery), Matt Carroll (James) and Marty Baron (Schreiber).<br/><br/>The film's cast is awesome; especially Keaton (who more than deserves another Oscar nomination, for his performance). The script is brilliant, and the directing is superb (which is a little odd, since McCarthy also co-wrote and directed 'THE COBBLER', earlier this year; which wasn't nearly as good). The movie isn't especially entertaining, or even greatly moving; but it is a very important film (and it's always involving and interesting to watch). Even the Catholic Church itself, has praised the movie; for it's honesty and compassionate treatment of the material. It's definitely a film everyone should see.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/dWmLQGusjEk"
"doug_park2001","9","3","6","7 December 2015"," ""If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one""
","The single most remarkable thing about this film is how it uses a confined scope to its advantage rather than otherwise, something that would only be possible in a docudrama of this sort. The makers of ""Spotlight"" were obviously seeking to avoid cheap sensationalism. There is no use of flashback, and the interviews with the now-adult victims are brief yet detailed enough to make their point. There is little showing of the pedophiliac priests, and the public outcry that followed the first exposures of the scandal in Boston and throughout the world is effectively limited to the after-notes. Yet, it as if you are the proverbial fly on the wall of the ""Boston Globe"" and flying along with their reporters on the street. While a film of this sort will never have huge mass appeal--which may in itself be several strikes in its favor--it's two-plus well-worth-it hours for anyone with a serious interest in the whole explosive affair within the Roman Catholic church. I was utterly entranced.<br/><br/>The details and complications are hard to completely follow on first view, and the sheer number of characters makes it difficult to place who's-who in some cases. That doesn't, however, conflict too much with the big picture. ""Spotlight"" is also quite revealing of the dilemmas and politics that take place within a newspaper office and its dealings with local VIPs.<br/><br/>Much of the success of ""Spotlight"" is, of course, due to the fine, fine quality of the acting and script. Special kudos to Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and all the actors who play the various victims. The subtle development of ""characters"" such as the cantankerous but obsessively dedicated and conscientious attorney Mitchell Garabedian (similarly well-played by Stanley Tucci) is also commendable."
"briand6465","9","3","6","2 December 2015"," Shining The Spotlight: What Investigative Reporting Is All About
","Saw ""Spotlight"" starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Rachel McAdams at Regal Cinemas. The film is based on a true story which portrays what kind of in-depth investigative journalistic reporting it takes to uncover decades of wrong-doings by the Catholic Church, regarding covering-up priests who took advantage and molested several children across Boston, Massachusetts and beyond.<br/><br/>This year-long investigation by The Boston Globe starting in 2001, explores several victims of sex-crimes which were committed; but no one up to this point in the film ever was convicted of a crime. It is up to the ""Spotlight"" Team of investigative Reporters at The Boston Globe, led by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, played by Keaton to lead his staff in cracking this case by exposing the abusive Catholic Church Priests to the public and getting justice for those victims.<br/><br/>The compassion for the victims these reporters had and the passion to gather enough evidence from decades past in order to write a top-notch story to present publicly was extraordinary and well-acted out throughout the film! Sacha Pfeiffer played by McAdams and ""Robby"" played by Keaton confront attorney Eric Macleish played by Billy Crudup who represented the many victims of priests within the Catholic Church, but ultimately they learn he settled these cases outside of court to prevent any paper-trail for a future investigation like this one and obviously public uproar.<br/><br/>Macleish initially refuses to discuss any details of these settlements and really never does, but while confronting him in the lobby where his law firm resides, ""Robby"" appears to threaten Macleish for a victim list. Both he Pfeiffer finally get a list of victims from Macleish later on in the film to add to the other compiled evidence; this after originally claiming he (Macleish) sent a list of victims over to the Globe a few years prior to this investigation and no revealing story ever came from it.<br/><br/>Ruffalo who plays Reporter Mike Rezendes shows how much desire he and the entire Spotlight team had to prepare and write a solid story by making several attempts to find credible evidence and sources, while pro-actively taking their time in the field to gather court documents which were sealed-off to the public prior to his efforts in getting those released to the court records room.<br/><br/>Searching for names through old books, making phone calls and hitting the streets interviewing victims were other strategies used by the Spotlight Team while they gathered vital information up to develop their damning story against abusive Catholic Priests. Overall, the film portrayal was interestingly on-point to real-life events as reported, in addition to the acting, and lived-up to its genre, Drama. Definitely a good movie night out! My cinema score is 9/10.<br/><br/>You can check out The Boston Globe's take on this film HERE: http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/spotlight-movie"
"maurice_yacowar","9","3","6","29 November 2015"," Boston journalists expose child-abuse in Catholic church
","Spotlight opens on a closure and ends on an opening. Shining light on the shadows is the film's purpose and thrust. In the pre-title scene a child-molesting priest escapes exposure, arraignment and suppression by being transferred to another diocese. Cardinal Law protects his predators instead of the child victims. Church and police conspire to cover up the crime -- and repeat it. In the last scene the Boston Globe's Spotlight investigating team is flooded with calls from other victims, encouraged by the paper's exposure of the church.<br/><br/>This film serves several functions very well. At its most literal it provides a thorough analysis of the Catholic church's scandalous record of child abuse and protecting the abusers. We learn with the journalists what the priests did, about the helpless on whom they preyed, how the system created the predation and then perpetuated it, how the putative celibacy requirement encouraged it. The information this film delivers -- all in densely scripted dialogue and brisk, compelling scenes -- would fill a comprehensive study. A post-credit series of titles lists the global replays of this Boston story. What had been conventionally passed off as ""a few bad apples"" proves a.massive criminality and corruption.<br/><br/>The film's most bitter irony: when Cardinal Law resigns in shame for having transferred his abusive priests to other parishes, he is himself promoted to an important sinecure in the Vatican. Don't tell me Jesus didn't weep.<br/><br/>The film also celebrates another endangered institution, investigative journalism. Several scenes of the mechanics of journalism -- the meetings, the interviews, the library research, the filing system, the whirring presses, the delivery trucks -- evoke a tradition of journalism films. Democracy needs independent investigative journalism as a check on the powers that conspire for their own purposes. And that's the very first cut that surviving papers make to trim their expenses to fend off internet competition. <br/><br/>The film's broader target is that wider complicity of evil. As one character remarks, if it takes a village to raise a child it takes a village to abuse one. Of course many people knew what the priests were doing and turned a blind eye -- which is not the other cheek Jesus advised. Some of the best scenes show oily respectable citizens, civic leaders, churchgoing pillars of the community, tacitly colluding to hide the horror. It takes two outsiders — the Jewish editor and the Armenian lawyer — to discover the evil that the lapsed Catholic reporters track down. Indeed, even more appalling than the priests' transgressions are the good citizens who enable and protect it. <br/><br/>The film's ultimate target, beyond the church, is any institution that preserves itself by living with evil instead of fighting it. The villain here, in addition to the Catholic Church, is also the Globe that five years earlier missed the story, the police, college alumni and business community that let innocent children suffer rather than embarrass the institution.<br/><br/>This film is so densely scripted and shot that incidental phrases accrue potent pertinence. A sign on the printing press enjoins both the printers and the journalists, plus anyone who values a humane responsible society: ""Stay clear."""
"bilbrown","10","3","6","26 November 2015"," Corrupt organization exposed
","This was a well done movie about an investigation of the Catholic Church. If the corruption uncovered had involved thefts of money instead of only molesting children, there would have been efforts to dismantle the institution for the public good. Fortunately, no money was stolen. In fact, some of the molested children and their families received token payments of money so they wouldn't feel so bad about what had happened. Church friends tell me they feel bad about the ""incident"", but will continue to cling to the church and its important dogma and leave God to punish any priests who might have been guilty. It is difficult to watch this movie, accept its depiction of events as true, and also know that the problem isn't solved. These are the people who establish our moral guidelines, who intercede for us when we sin, who monitor our lives, and who molest our children. I cry."

Spotlight highlights these unmentionable acts that many churches were hiding to keep there dignity intact. I am not questioning any religion, but what these priests did in 2001 (and before and after that time) was absolutely sickening. Spotlight is based on a true of how priests across America but specifically the Boston area, tracing back to the the 1960s sexually assaulted children from the ages of 5-13. These Roman Catholic/Christian priests of Boston/America were supposed to spread the word of peace and goodness of the lord, but they took advantage of there power and did something unforgivable. Spotlight is one of those rare films that completely shocks you, makes you think, and leaves very uncomfortable. Spotlight is realistic cinema at its best, this is one of those most superior films I have seen this year, its a film that makes the viewers feel uncomfortable, mad, and in it will move you to tears.

Facing political opposition and resistance from the far-reaching influence of the Church, the reporters undertake an explosive exposé on the corrupt system. <br/><br/>This year we have seen many great ensemble casts, but Spotlight has the best ensemble cast by far. Michael Keaton is simply amazing, he gets totally into character, and never acts a false note. His pre climax scene when his old buddy from college tells him to drop the case, and Keaton says Ill quote on what you said, is one of 2015's best sequences. Its a slap in the face. Mark Ruffalo, is a man on a mission in the film, and he steals the show in the film. His relentless act will get him an Oscar nominee for sure.Rachel McAdams gets one of her most acting orientated roles, and she is superb.Lev Schreiber character is a silent one, but when he speaks, he is the most powerful person on screen.Brian d'Arcy James underplays his role superbly.<br/><br/>There a couple of things that I will take back from Spotlight, that will continue to disturb me for awhile, its rare that a film affects me so such that it haunts my thoughts for so long. I just can't understand how so many churches that spread across the world, would let priests sexually assault children, for centuries, CENTURIES!!! It's absolutely sickening, how Church Leader's tried to hid these sins, by using there power influence, money, and by using the name of the lord. And then these used churches to make money off, by helping them get off cases. Did any of these people have a soul.Thoughts like these keep wandering in my mind. The film leaves you with a eerie feeling that you just can't let go of for awhile. Nevertheless Spotlight is complete brilliance. The films story and screenplay are superb. The film is not glamorized at all, the film is very gritty and real. Its a film based on real, and true facts. Its realistic cinema at its best. The films location, settings, etc are top notch, and nothing feels out of place for 2001. The film has no blemishes at all. The film is a investigative thriller, and it works in all accounts. You are at the edge of your set the whole time, and by the end of the film you are rotund for the Spotlight team. The films highlight is in its superb performances for its ensemble, and being so superbly informative, and so accurate in every aspect of how law works, how the investigation took place.<br/><br/>Overall Spotlight will sweep the Oscars this year because there is no film that stands a chance next to this classic. Its a film which I could call one of my favourites, but I don't know if I want to watch it again, because the stories of those innocent children still haunt me.<br/><br/>5/5* or 10/10"
"chanelcbrown","10","3","7","16 November 2015"," Powerful and Revealing
","This film is very powerful and gives viewers a deep look inside of the investigative journalism at the Spotlight team of the Boston Globe and the impact of the work they did on uncovering the scandals and secrecy within the Catholic church.<br/><br/>Prior to watching this film I had only heard tidbits of information through the news about priests who abused their power and after watching this movie I was shocked to find out how widespread the problem is and how far it stretches. This film really opened up my eyes a lot and I think that it will do the same for those of us who are unaware of the atrocities committed towards so many people across the world."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","2","4","8 March 2019"," An excellent film that asks the hard questions of the status quo.
","For many years, the running joke about the movies that have won the Best Picture Oscar is that they only won because another film should have won years prior. Spotlight (2015) is this generation's All the President's Men (1976) in that it is an excellent film about investigative journalism that broke open a huge cover-up, changing the world forever. Both films deserved to be Best Picture, but Spotlight manages to take an uncomfortable subject and be frank and open about the problems that we still see in today's society.<br/><br/>Since most of the movie is comprised of uncovering the truth behind the sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church, it's surprising how gripping and well-paced the film ends up being. Part of the genius of this film is the high-energy dedication these four journalists have in uncovering the terrifying truths that had been lurking in the shadows for decades. While such a subject could easily create a bias, this film manages to take an almost unbiased approach in its search for the depth of the problem that most people would ignore to keep the status quo. The tension created with each subsequent twist and turn of the investigation keeps the audience wondering how much further the corruption can go.<br/><br/>The impact of Spotlight deserves to be recognized, which is why I am glad that it won Best Picture for 2015. While intrinsically simple, this film delivers a powerful, emotional punch without relying on hackneyed methods to pull at the heartstrings of its viewers. Upon a second viewing a few years later, I was able to notice more of the menacing subtlety of the churches and cathedrals placed conveniently near playgrounds, schools, and other child-friendly zones. That is the brilliance of this movie: knowing the threat, but also knowing how many people are unaware of it.<br/><br/>An excellent film that asks the hard questions of the status quo, I give Spotlight 5.0 stars out of 5."
"kebbeh","9","2","4","6 December 2018"," Such a breathtaking film.
","The movie ""Spotlight,"" was a film about a massive sexual child abuse perpetrated by hundreds of priests of the Catholic Church. The main character of the film was Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, and Brian d'Arcy James. They go on a journey of finding out the horrible truth about the priests of the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>Spotlight was a group of four journalists named Mike, Walter, Sacha, and Matt. The four of them worked together to investigate, gather information, and were able to get their hands on sensitive records that were sealed to the public. As Spotlight continue to investigate, they come to find out that the Catholic Church were making settlements with the victims of sexual abuse to keep them from ever saying anything to the public. They then found out that a log was kept with the name of all the priests, and each time a priest committed sexual abuse it was written in the log with the excuse that they were absent due to illness. This was a simple act of covering up. At the end Mike was able to get a hold of the public record which reveal all the cases and hundred of priests involved. The law officials have known about these cases for many years and did nothing to stop it from ever happing again.<br/><br/>There were a few film techniques used in this film to bring out the story of these priests. I felt like the film focused more on the information rather than the characters. One of the techniques that I recognize in the film ""Spotlight,"" was the camera movement. In one of the scenes, Matt finds out that one of the accused priest lives close by. The camera follows him from behind as he runs up to the house where the priest lived and then slowly zooms up to Matt face. The scene was intense because it should how Matt was shocked but at the same time also wanting to protect his kids from the priest. Another example of a film technique used is the lighting of the film. I felt like throughout the film the lighting was neutral and, in a way, it almost felt like a documentary. I think the filmmaker wanted its audience to focus more on the details provided rather than the quality of the film.<br/><br/>One film that is similar to ""Spotlight"" is ""Citizen Kane."" These two films are similar because they are about journalists going about finding out the truth of the matter. In both films, the authors focused more on the information that was found by the journalist and what it revealed and the facts before publishing it to the public.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I enjoy watching ""Spotlight."" It was an eye-opening to know what was
going on and how many families were affected by this all. The director of ""Spotlight"" did a great job of telling the story and the truth about it. This film was a story that many of the Catholic Church didn't think will ever come out and the filmmaker did a great job at putting its focuses on revealing the truth."
"Leofwine_draca","10","2","4","4 October 2016"," A fully deserved Oscar winner
","It's not often I follow the Oscars or go out of my way to see Oscar-winning films, because they're usually not to my taste. However, I can make an exception for SPOTLIGHT, a film which looked fantastic from the trailer and what I had read about it. Having just caught up with it and watched it twice in a row, I can report that this is an excellent piece of film-making: dark, harrowing, and grimly realistic, but also thoroughly entertaining with it.<br/><br/>It tells the true story of the Boston Globe newspaper's exposure of child abusing priests from the Catholic Church. The viewer follows the story from the rumours at the outset to the very real and grounded information that comes through and the final publishing of the story. There are lots of quieter moments and some eye-popping twists and turns, usually when the scale of the abuse is exposed. I know the subject of paedophilia in film is very distasteful, but this film is more about the crusading journalist team than the subject matter itself. In that way it harks back to classics like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, although Fincher's ZODIAC is also a reference point.<br/><br/>The calibre of this film is excellent and everything about it is very strong from the cinematography to the direction. Despite the lengthy running time, this is a fast-paced feature in which no scene lasts more than a couple of minutes. It takes you on a roller-coaster ride of fact-checking, breakthroughs, and battles against both a conspiracy of silence and the American legal system. The acting is excellent across the board, which is a surprise in some cases (Rachel McAdams) and expected in others (Ruffalo equals and surpasses his performance in ZODIAC). Michael Keaton also delivers one of his best performances and puts the old memories of a rubbery Batman far behind him. SPOTLIGHT is a real gem."

In my taste, it's work well for Paul Greengrass not for Tom McCarthy. <br/><br/>It's well made film that deals with an interesting issue but I miss some more drama, It's a fascinating & shocking subject, so it is surprising that so many scenes are boring. Although the main focus is the Press, I hope for more humanity attitude, for example, more focus on the victim. Dramatization is not a necessarily a bad thing in films, a little more scenes who are audience oriented would have made this movie more interesting and overall better.<br/><br/>In other aspects, it's great movie, the actors, script, directing but it's not Network (1976), Ace in the Hole (1951) and All the President's Men (1976)."

","It is self-evident that SPOTLIGHT is a tailor-made Oscar-bait in every aspect, chronicles the sensational and gasping 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning reportage by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team, to disclose the rampant pedophiliac activity among the Roman Catholic church in Boston, a more shocking revelation is the fact that the entire church system has been unscrupulously cover these clergymen over decades, transfers them from parish to parish, and nips any opposition in the buds. The film is a strenuously faithful re-enactment of the story, directed and co-written by Tom McCarthy as the fifth time he sits in the director chair after a quite consistently outstanding resumé (THE STATION AGENT 2003, THE VISTOR 2007, WIN WIN 2011), on the ground that we could all pretend that the horrendous Adam Sandler vehicle THE COBBLER (2014) had never happened.<br/><br/>It is remarkable that McCarthy adopts a completely down-to-earth approach to present the narrative, encourages his sterling ensemble cast to strike a personal contact with their real-life characters and maximumly imitates their personalities to the silver screen, no melodramatic frills are allowed to manipulate audience's reactions and simply lets the truth speaks for itself, and trust me, it is more than enough to make the point.<br/><br/>The whole investigation is conducted at the behest of the newly-appointed editor Marty Baron (Schreiber), whose Jewish origin could be appropriated as an easy target for his motivation, but his keen perception and pensive temperament determine that there is nothing to hold him back until they hold the whole corrupt system accountable for the sin. Schreiber's resilient, withdrawn acting option works like magic.<br/><br/>The Spotlight team quartet is headed by Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Keaton), with Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) and Matt Carroll (James), the investigative process is formulaic and daunting, indefatigably following the leads until one gets what he wants, or better, a new discovery. Meanwhile, McCarthy is extremely parsimonious to shed any light on his characters' personal lives, as if he is making a point that journalists barely have anything else apart from their work, in hindsight, it is probably the safest way to avoid any lawsuit due to poetic licence, since most of the characters are still alive-and-kicking, no level-headed individual wants his or her own private hurdles being exposed for exploitation. On the other hand, McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer is level-headed enough to not over-hype their activities either (since it is obvious that vested interest is always a collateral byproduct in the journalism against their altruistic motivation), thus, no individual heroism pops out stridently, and what we see, is a conscientious teamwork steadily dredges up scandalous evidences, and a understated minor twist reveals a lamentable remiss which could have changed the status quo decades earlier.<br/><br/>Ruffalo, bags his third Oscar-nomination amongst all the male cast, while McAdams is the lucky gal honoured with a coattail nomination being the only woman in the ensemble. That is not to say that their performances are inferior, on the contrary, everyone is well-deserved for their ensemble win in the SAG, since their interpretation is closely complying with their respective character, and it happens to be, those journalists don't possess the larger-than-life persona, the only time, a remotely over-the-top moment belongs to Ruffalo's Michael, that's why he is the pick by the academy, but Keaton, Schreiber, Tucci, even Crudup portray their roles in a more accomplished flair, plus, in my book, Ruffalo should be shifted to a borderline leading role (he has the most screen time and his contribution to the project is most minutely detailed), to save some space for his co-stars.<br/><br/>Unarguably, SPOTLIGHT is an important film exposé depicting a rotten underbelly of our society and what we should heed is its aftermath, since the Boston discovery is merely a tip of the iceberg, if one can lucidly imagine the whole ugly picture, it is not difficult to picture the colossal disillusion it inflicts on religious devotees who has a conscience, whom we deem as the pillar of a healthy society and perhaps, something positive could happen from within, for that reason alone, SPOTLIGHT should win BEST PICTURE this year, not that Oscar really matters these days, it is just a do-the-right-thing testimony for the sake of its own reputation."

","Spotlight tells the story of a team at the Boston Globe who uncovered a sex abuse scandal involving Catholic priests in Boston, and this would eventually lead to a much wider scandal. Spotlight is a very minimalistic film; dialogue driven, subtly directed and almost documentary style. Most of the film is just people talking, but it's a ruthlessly absorbing film more thrilling than many thrillers and more horrifying than most horror films. Although it's very low key, it's a strong, hard-hitting and deeply powerful tale, brought to life with excellent acting and Tom McCarthy's superbly stripped down direction. Spotlight is not just a movie. It's life. It's a real event, populated with human characters which doesn't resort to manipulation, pyrotechnics, emotional breakdowns or a load of shouting. A very worthy, engrossing and fittingly affecting drama, this actually lives up to the Oscar hype for once. It's probably too low key to win Best Picture, but I'd have no complaints if it did.<br/><br/>9/10"
"CineMuseFilms","8","2","4","11 February 2016"," A fine tribute to ethical journalism and its power to do good.
","This film is a David and Goliath style investigative drama wherein brave journalism exposes evil, which in this case is the systemic corruption found in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston in the early 2000s. While stories about child abuse are not designed for entertainment, this one is a highly engaging thriller about the Boston Globe's specialist team called Spotlight that challenged one of the most powerful institutions on earth. Its linear plot-line unfolds gradually to let you share the discovery of the tip of a corruption iceberg that kept getting bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>The story itself is now global knowledge and countries around the world are still coming to terms with child abuse scandals that will take generations to remediate, forgive, and forget. Spotlight uses the cinematic device of dramatic understatement to give viewers the emotional space in which to confront the enormity of the facts as they become known. This understatement includes a slow narrative, a crisp factual script with little melodrama, actor authenticity with none of the five investigators stealing any limelight, and muted de-saturated colours to convey the rat-hole nature of investigative journalism. Its a small group of tenacious foot-sloggers in an old-fashioned hunt for truth, but they bring down the house of god armed with just facts and faith.<br/><br/>The larger moral tale beyond the film points to a primal human weakness seen repeatedly on a grand scale throughout the history of mankind: shamefully knowing but not acting. The passing mention of ""good Germans"" is one hint of this bigger message. When the evidence piles up about offending priests, corrupt senior clergy, official cover ups, victim pay offs, hidden or re-assigned offenders who were free to re-offend, it becomes clear that entire communities turned a blind eye to what was happening. The church, schools, local government, and perhaps saddest of all, parents, chose silence to protect their faith. When good people ignore evil, everyone is morally culpable. This film tells the story without dramatics and with respect for victims needing a voice. The revelations of Spotlight led to 600 cases being exposed and triggered hundreds of similar investigations that continue around the world. This film is a fine tribute to ethical journalism and its power to do good."
"Mireille-3","7","2","4","29 January 2016"," Solid movie
","A solid movie, though I was not fully captivated. The story emphasizes on the importance of a strong independent press. A very important story of course. The story of abuse in the Catholic church serves more as a vehicle to highlight this. The actors did a great job but to me they did not blend in as much as I would like them. Mark Ruffalo is just too much Mark Ruffalo as is Michael Keaton very much Michael Keaton. I would have added a few less known actors to the cast to make it more natural. To me Liev Schreiber was the most credible, Stanley Tucci (with hair!) did also a great job. Watching the movie it had a bit of a old fashioned feel of the 70ths, any moment Robert Redford could show up, and I think that is the reason I was not completely convinced. I was constantly reminded of All the president's men and that was just a better movie."
"virek213","10","2","4","22 January 2016"," ""They knew about it, and they let it happen""
","There are times when God can be used by people who ought to know better to justify doing horrible things to others. The sex abuse scandal inside the Catholic church, which may very well have been going on for decades under the table, was one of those things; and it was exposed perhaps for the first time in one of the most heavily Catholic cities in the world, namely Boston. And it was reporters from the Boston Globe who, undeterred by threats, both implied and overt, conducted a year-long investigation into the pattern of pedophilia and the subsequent cover-up of it by religious and government figures in their city and made it public, causing a worldwide firestorm that in many ways damaged the Catholic church irreparably. That is the story told in director Tom McCarthy's brilliant film SPOTLIGHT.<br/><br/>SPOTLIGHT takes its name from that special investigations division of the Boston Globe that tended to uncover the less savory aspects of Boston's higher places of power; and it was that division uncovered the Boston sex abuse scandal. Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Ruffalo portray the three real-life reporters who, bit by bit, gather all the facts about this story, one that Boston's Catholic archdiocese knew about for decades but had successfully buried for an equally long time. What they find out, in ways and through situations that have fairly modest but nevertheless noticeable parallels to the Watergate scandal depicted in ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, is that the pattern of priest abuse wasn't just limited to ""a few bad apples"", but which involved at least ninety of the Boston archdiocese's 1500 priests, and hundreds, if indeed not thousands, of young children dating as far back as the early 1960s. At the end, once their story hits the front pages of the Globe, which happened just a week or so into 2002, thousands of victims come forth with their own horror stories of encounters with Catholic priests having done decidedly unholy things to them as kids and getting away with it. What had been a local story, and more importantly one that had been kept under wraps forever, would now explode with financially and spiritually catastrophic results for the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>There are no ""big scenes"", in the strictest conventional Hollywood sense, here in SPOTLIGHT; indeed, much of the story unfolds so methodically. Moreover, none of the three principals outshines the others, which gives the film a decidedly ensemble feel with Keaton, Ruffalo, and McAdams. Liev Schreiber and John Slattery portray the real-life editors at the Globe who urged a press-forward until the paper got a story that was solid and would stand up to any kind of scrutiny. But besides being a great film about an important and still timely issue in American life, SPOTLIGHT is also something of a tragedy, in that these kids continued to bear the scars as adults; and in a faith where God is everything, and priests are looked upon almost as Jesus Himself, those scars and the betrayal that came from them are permanent and damaging.<br/><br/>The final victory for SPOTLIGHT is showing what a huge difference free and independent media in America, one beholden only to the news and the truth and not corporate and financial dictates, can make when it does its job. McCarthy and his cast should be roundly and loudly applauded for this film."
"ctowyi","10","2","4","21 January 2016"," A journalistic procedural as good as All the President's Men
","At one point in my life I was seriously considering becoming a journalist, hoping to write hard-hitting stories that would break down walls and change lives. There is something so captivating and singular about the job - sniffing out good news and not letting it go until it becomes public information. That love for the printed page remains strong with me through the years. Coincidentally, I am teaching journalism in a school now and I am loving it. Teaching it and watching this latest journalistic procedural are the closest I will ever get to it. <br/><br/>The spotlight is on Spotlight, the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States and its investigation into the widespread child sex abuse cases in the Boston area. It is based on a series of stories by the real Spotlight Team that earned The Boston Globe the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. The investigative unit uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core. <br/><br/>There is a moment when John Slattery exclaimed ""90 fcuking priests!"" I suspect the f-word is used in equal weightage as a verb, an adjective and as a spontaneous intensifier of shock, horror, or anger. This is a story that is so insanely criminal that it has to be told but how it is told is the bright spot. <br/><br/>The ensemble acting is pitch-perfect. The talent on hand is amazing. No one one-ups another in any scene and I didn't get the feeling these are accomplished actors doing a job. They look and feel like real journalists. Armed with a keen and focused mind, a trusty pen and a notepad, the close-knit group of four reporters ""gegenpress"" all the way to the ugly truth. For slightly more than two solid hours we are treated to a showcase of some incredible work ethics - setting aside every stick of hay in the stack till they get to the needle. There isn't a need to preach about the sacrifices they have made but we know it intrinsically when we see Mark Ruffalo boiling two sausages for dinner or Liev Schreiber leaving the office when the sky is pitch black. There is something so intoxicating about watching professionals born on earth to do one job and to do it exceptionally well. I was riveted. The acting is nuanced and restrained with no fanfare and a jolly pat on the back for a job well done. What a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>Going after a systemic expose of the Catholic Archdiocese, director Tom McCarthy never paints the priests as villains the size of mountains. But there wasn't any doubt in my mind they are monsters, spiritually lost monsters. There was never any need to preach a 3-point sermon but yet the message hits my raw nerve. This is extremely assured filmmaking which gives us the respect we crave for and seldom see in movies. <br/><br/>The film may be a talkie but it has the rhythm and pacing of an intelligent thriller. The dialogue cuts right down to the bone and I am surprised there is no fluff and zero fats lined the bone. Every scene serves an important purpose and if you take anyone of them out I have a feeling the movie will lose its momentum. <br/><br/>Spotlight is a tour de force and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Alan J. Pakula's All the President's Men (1996) as one of the best journalistic procedurals ever. Every element of the film is flawless and the sum of all its parts gave me a tingling feeling underneath my skin. Surely this has Best Picture written all over it (I have yet to see The Revenant and Brooklyn though). <br/><br/>PS - I had a hoot seeing Liev Schreiber here and can't help feeling this movie works like a sorta revenge sequel in an alternate universe to Ray Donovan in which his character was abused by a priest."
"Screen_Blitz","10","2","4","18 January 2016"," Spotlight is deeply engrossing and gripping from start to finish
","This film, directed and written by Tom McCarthy and co-written by Josh Singer, follows an engrossing retelling of the Boston Globe and their attempt to expose a massive scandal in 2001 that shocked the entire nation as well as the Catholic Church to its core. With a powerful screenplay and direction, this film based on true events, deals with newly hired news editor Marty Baron of the Boston Globe (played by Liev Schreiber) who assembles a team of journalists to uncover the massive child molestation scandal by committed priests of Catholic Churches that has run rampant throughout the nation, and to matters worse, has been kept a secret for many decades. This team includes Michael Rezendez (played by Mark Ruffalo), Sasha Pfeiffer (played by Rachel McAdams), Matt Carroll (played by Brian D'Arcy James), Ben Bradlee Jr. (played by John Slattery), and their leader Walter Robinson (played by Michael Keaton). This movie dramatizes the team's investigation into these child sex abuse cases occurring and their attempt to shine their light on them to the public.<br/><br/>This film touches a very heavy subject as far as the plot goes, and Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer bring powerful appeal to the horrifying story this film revolves around. Telling the story in a fact-based manner, this film grips audiences into a dark and dramatic story, hitting the major key points of the events that were going on at the time; and doesn't attempt to over dramatize nor sugarcoat the events that made both national and international headlines. It is doesn't portray the story in a sense of heroism. What comes of this is a story that operates on a honest, solid level as well as an authentic inside look of what goes on behind the newsroom. McCarthy and Singer bless with this film with such incredible writing, and the story moves at an even pace. The entire story behind the Boston Globe as well as the stories dealing with the child abuse cases are both intriguing, yet deeply affecting. The emotional intensity is conveyed not just by the story or the actors' performances, but the thoughts it leaves viewers with of how people were going to Church to hear these priests preach the gospel but were unaware of the harrowing activity going on behind the stage. There is plenty of emotional and heart-tapping scenes throughout the picture, most of which take place when the characters are interviewing the various victims and discussing in explicit detail of their experiences, but nonetheless strengthens the interest in the story for viewers, whether they are familiar with the events or not. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo really hits home with his performance, by far his most powerful performance he has given in his career. Rachel McAdams and Michael Keaton are also very creditable here too. McAdams who gave diligence to her role in sports drama 'Southpaw' earlier in the year, and Michael Keaton who impressed audiences and critics everywhere in last year's Oscar winning picture 'Birdman', are both very natural in their roles and are definitely Oscar-worthy for their performances. The rest of the cast including Stanley Tucci and Billy Cruddup who play the attorneys also deserve a round of applause for their acting here. <br/><br/>Spotlight is one of the best films of 2015, and something to definitely watch for during this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Many films based on true events do not come as superb and interesting as this one. It is deeply engrossing and gripping from the start, and utterly thought- provoking that it will likely lead to serious discussions after viewing."

","When this movie starts out, you could be forgiven for thinking that you are seeing *All the President's Men* or some other classic newspaper movie. Very much unlike *The Big Short*, for example, another of this year's feature-length films recounting a recent true story, there are no really innovative new approaches to movie making here.<br/><br/>But that is not to say that this movie holds no interest. Not at all. Unlike any of the classic newspaper movies I know, this one gets complicated when you start to suspect that there are people in the paper itself who are working against the journalists covering the big story.<br/><br/>You also start to wonder what involvement the journalists in question themselves may have had with similar situations, since they are all Boston Catholics themselves. Lots of old-fashioned close-ups of their faces, faces that are expressing anguished thoughts not put into words, leave you wondering. This is not like covering the Watergate break-in, you come to realize. These reporters are in fact discovering things about themselves, their upbringing, their community, as they probe ever more leads into cases of child abuse by Boston Catholic priests.<br/><br/>There is nothing innovative about the film making here, perhaps. But the script is written for intelligent adults, and demands your full attention, which it amply rewards.<br/><br/>This is not an easy movie to watch, frankly, because you end up viewing the case through the anguish of the reporters. In that sense, it takes the ability to see all this as new and horrifying, despite all we have learned since.<br/><br/>But it is very much a movie that is worth the effort, and the discomfort, to watch."

And to top it off, the movie very closely adhered to the facts of this amazing true story (check Google for verification).<br/><br/>This flick is what movie-making SHOULD be about, but seldom is. And it also is a reminder to the press to carry out their investigative obligation -- a function that today seems to be atrophying."
"ryan-bfd","9","2","4","5 January 2016"," A beautifully crafted true story
","It doesn't seem right to review this film. It actually feels like some sort of moral infringement. This is because I feel like ""Spotlight"" is one of the most important non-documentary films ever made. This story had to be told and Nicole Rocklin and Blye Faust (the film's producers) couldn't have hired a better cast to tell it. Given that I was looking for film-editing that flowed together more smoothly and cinematography that was darker and more shadowy to represent the shadiness of the Catholic Church at the time. But I can easily overlook all of this films flaws because of how intense this story is. Not to mention how well all of the lead actors fit their parts. My favorite performance has to be Mark Ruffulo's. His character is so awkward and twitchy is a very subtle sense that is pretty hard to get down for any less of an actor. It didn't seem that any of the other actors had to really try to nail any impressions or anything like that. The worst thing that they could have done really is overact and that didn't happen. As a result of how most of these characters being pretty much just average, every day type people, there weren't really any performances that were really Oscar-worthy to me but again the story that this movie tells just overshadows so many flaws for me and just turns this film into an eye-opening masterpiece. I love this film's tone. It doesn't really try to glorify anyone. It doesn't try to make anyone look like a hero. It just tells the truth about what happened, which is everyone was just doing their jobs. As a result, the Catholic church was allowed to get away with a lot of sexual molestation of minors. But, ironically, it also prompted their downfall. If the journalists of the Spotlight team portrayed hadn't done their jobs correctly, who knows how long it would have taken for all of this to unfold. 'Spotlight' does not sugar- coat or over dramatize. It is a film encapsulated by realistic dialog and an attempt to tell this a true event exactly as it happen. It is in no way a film that has some sort of deep social commentary against organized religion. It doesn't try to encourage the audience to deviate from the Catholic fate or tell them what to believe. It is just a film about exposing the deepest and darkest side of supposedly one of the most holy and morally just institutions in the world."
"TheRenegadeTaoist","9","2","4","2 January 2016"," Right On Target
","In spite of all of the derailment attempts, this film is very important, and therefore may find itself buried. Subject matter that makes people feel comfortable very frequently finds itself with the cult following or relegated to late-night showing on cable television things of that nature. <br/><br/>We all know the subject matter, the cast turned in stellar performances and may find themselves snubbed at the Oscars. It's happened to better movies in the past. This film peels scabs off some very nasty psychological injuries that we as society may not want to revisit, but need to, very much so. History repeats itself until the lessons are learned.<br/><br/>I am very appreciative of the reality that there is an interrelatedness and consideration that happens the matter of the gravity of the story when larger more global affairs do transpire. How often are very important events lost behind even larger events? <br/><br/>I was impressed by the depiction that integrity does exist in some arenas still to this day and there are people who are more than willing to accept responsibility for the error of their past judgments or dismissal of less than savory possibilities.<br/><br/>This is a solid film about real people, with real issues that need to be at the forefront of how we govern ourselves. This whole season of Oscar contenders and SAG award nominees are field of reminders to the general public that films can tell great stories of facts as well as fantasy And often times the fantasies are not as horrifying nor as fantastic as fact.<br/><br/>Thank you for phenomenal, simple storytelling, thank you for reminding us that the cinema can be a powerful instrument beyond being a vehicle to sell shiny, undigestable popcorn and Scooby snacks.<br/><br/>Thank you for bringing back post credit dialogue between viewers.<br/><br/>Watch this film and talk about it afterward... a lot."
"philthegreatone-786-63058","9","2","4","26 December 2015"," Great drama
","This is a great movie and hard movie to watch. It follows the Boston Globes investigation into the Catholic church molestation allegations. What they uncover is widespread across not just Boston but all of America. The journalism side of the film is really well done. You really get to understand how they build such a big story and uncover it in great detail. All the actors who play the journalists working for the globe are great. Michael Keaton leads the team and he does a great job of getting to the truth of the story. You can really feel he's a real person in the story and not just acting. Rachel McAdams is also very effective as an investigative journalist who goes and interviews a lot of the victims getting to hear their stories. Mark Ruffalo is also great as a man who is desperate for the truth and his character does let his emotions get the better of him at a certain moment. But you can't blame him this is a serious issue that has plagued the Catholic church for decades. Its not a subject matter that's easy to take. But if you love a great film that is really well written on investigative journalism, then this is the film for you. Its one of the best films of the year. I highly recommend it."
"slydon13","9","2","4","24 December 2015"," In the tradition of 'All the Presidents Men'
","The story begins when a new editor, who isn't Boston Catholic, joins the Boston Globe and suggests looking deeper into one case of child rape. Indeed he is reading up the Red Sox, which is perhaps the second religious organisation in Boston. The culture is not to question authority figures - not the Church, not the lawyers who colluded, not judges who helped suppress information, not the police who didn't resist and the journalists hesitate to make enemies. The intimidation is sinister because these men have been confident in their seat of power.<br/><br/>'Spotlight' is the title of a 4 person team of investigative reporters in the Globe and perhaps beyond the basic story, the movie underlines the importance of the Fourth Estate. If all reporting was based on Twitter or Instagram, important news that people want under the carpet will never see the light of day. This kind of reporting is expensive but is a social good we NEED.<br/><br/>Once the team began to really investigate, the scale of the problem was slowly revealed. 6% of priests abuse children. People who knew (nurses, physicians, police etc) kept their families safe but it was the children of innocent parents, who couldn't imagine depravity, who suffered. The story looks at the pathology and the system the church employed.<br/><br/>These characters are not fleshed out, partly because there are 6+ while we felt we knew Woodsein and Ben Bradley after 'All the Presidents Men'. The story also addresses how the journalists might rebuild relationships with friends, family, their church, their confidence as professionals, having missed the story for so long. Stanley Tucci has perhaps the best lines 'The Church thinks in centuries' and that's right. In Ireland the even argued they were in the right, based on Cannon Law !!!<br/><br/>Richard O'Rourke has a small but significant role as a shockingly, disturbed and creepy priest. Great casting! He takes his few lines and turns them into gold, demonstrating the horror, without actual graphics.<br/><br/>This movie is not a thriller - there are no meetings in garages, no fear that the CIA or FBI would take them out (although there is a concern about other papers getting a scoop). The church didn't need to resort to those excesses. They knew the threats to reputations and financial security carried weight.<br/><br/>The Catholic Church has establishments all over the world and what happened in Boston was one of hundreds of stories. 'Mea Culpa' is the documentary that looks deeper into the Vatican. Nobody is fooled - these priests are now in Haiti and other countries where children are vulnerable."

","a wonderfully told, well shot and acted movie. Gets to the inner workings of doing real journalism in a way that is super rare these days, save for pro publica, the intercept and the sometimes good NY Times reporting (which is completely countered by their horrible foreign reporting, particularly on the middle east). To continue, the director takes the viewer through a very thorough procedural approach towards what happened, who was involved, the manner in which the reporting needed to be carried out and it was involving although there was no real ""action"" on screen, the implications were enormous and very well conveyed. The editing, in particular, stood out. The ensemble acting was great although Marc Ruffalo, who I love!, was a little too much into character, a bit too much of the moak, Live Schriber and Keaton were great, they really kept it battened down. Go see it, love it."
"yousidine","9","2","4","16 December 2015"," Transfer to Reality
","Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthy, and this film stars Mark Ruffalo , Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and pretty much many great actors. And this movie is about a scandal that involves the Catholic church, and there are these reporters played by Ruffalo, and the rest of the actors who are trying to write a story about the scandal, tracking people down. But there are obstacles in the way. When I first heard about this movie, I had a feeling that this movie has some potential. The trailer looks good, and all I knew is that there is this scandal, and there are these reporters trying to put it together and expose the truth. That was all I knew. So I knew this movie was going to be good. And it is. I'm very impressed. This is one of the best movies I have seen this year. And it's all done by its incredible acting, incredible script, and incredible directing. <br/><br/>This movie deals with a subject matter involving priests and children. There are victims. And these reporters are just out there collecting information from the people who were involved with it. And some of the victims and their siblings have different reactions, and it could be pretty heart breaking too, because these are people who had to put up with it. And it messes them up psychologically. And to make matters worse, this issue has been going on for a long time, and people already knew about it. But they didn't take the time to speak about it. and throughout the entire movie, you are just watching these reporters, doing their jobs like real people, collecting information. And we as an audience are finding some shocking information that we don't see coming. Some information that makes us cringe, because this is based on a true story. And you just want our reporters to get this clear out of the way, and expose the people involved in this scandal. And then it gets to a point where you feel like that this is not a movie. Sometimes when we watch movies based on true events, we know that it happened. But in the end, you think to yourself, it was just a movie. But in Spotlight, you feel like you are transported into the year of 2001 and 2002, where the movie takes place, and you see our reporters doing what they have to do. And it all helps with our characters. <br/><br/>Everyone did a flawless job in this movie. All of the characters felt very realistic. There wasn't a scene where I felt like I was just watching an actor. You feel like these people are just real life reporters. Michael Keaton,. First you got Birdman, and now this? You just love seeing him on screen. And you just love some of his scenes. and then you got Mark Ruffalo , who did a mind blowing job. He is the one in the group who wants to get this story out there the most. he is running around, going into buildings, getting documents, writing down information, and you just feel the passion of his job. He is the one affected the most about this case. There was this scene, where he and Michael Keaton has this argument, and Ruffalo and his performance was very outstanding. <br/><br/>This movie is about mystery, and it really really works. Guys, go and check this movie out. It has outstanding and great performances, and great direction. It's one of the best of the year. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out. This movie is pretty flawless...for the most part. There were a few times where the story drags, but you are going to enjoy watching this film."
"tjgoalie13","9","2","4","28 November 2015"," A Scary Story, Because it's True.
","This is easily one of the best live action films of 2015. At the end of the year this movie will likely get a lot of Oscar attention, and it truly deserves it. Spotlight holds nothing back, features an ensemble of amazing performances, and tells a haunting true story. This story is recent enough that many people probably still remember, but old enough that many people will probably find it educational.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film's greatest strength is it's story, which is incredibly dense with information. Not to spoil the film, but to give context the film is about a large scandal involving the Boston Catholic Priests in 2001. The story is so dense that it would have been easy to hold back information or gloss over plot elements, but somehow the filmmakers behind this film were able to fit it all into the film, in just over 2 hours. The film is unapologetically real, despite the occasional moments of theatricality, which all films have.<br/><br/>The entire cast is magnificent in this film, lead by Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Both of which will probably receive Oscar nominations for back-to-back years. In a film that relies on a slow-burn approach, with a more emotional grip on the audience, the acting was paramount, and the entire cast delivered. It's most impressive, because they are able to every moment and make it feel important through their portrayals. These performances also help to make the characters feel more real, and relatable.<br/><br/>The performances support one other major strength of the film, which is the haunting tone of the film. The film is scary in an very real way, as the film showcases that even in large hubs with millions of people, massive secrets can be hidden. At a time with drones, and widespread public mistrust it makes the film even scarier. It's the haunting story and tone that helps elevate the acting, to form a truly great film.<br/><br/>In the end the film tells a relevant story that every American should know, without compromising its source material. Spotlight is a film so good that even the churches it condemned had to admit that it was great. The film will likely receive a lot of award recognition, and rightfully so, as it stands as one of the best movies of 2015. It's a haunting film that tells a story so compelling and unbelievable it becomes a must see film."
"natalierosen","10","2","4","27 November 2015"," ""Spotlight"": Why a free press matters
","I saw the film ""Spotlight"" which is, as most likely know, a film about the Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team's exposé of systemic pedophile sexual abuse of children by priests in the Catholic Church in Boston and the Church's cover-up complicity of it. Viewing it took courage as, quite frankly, some things despite the worldly horrors we are privy to each day, are so noxious, hypocritical and sickening that it takes fortitude to view the stories about it in detail.<br/><br/>The film itself starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams was expertly crafted and the acting was without flaw. Happily, it did not reenact the many sickening crimes. Through a few adults re-telling their horrific experiences one could, I thought, cope with the retelling of their trauma. It was a seamless and truth-telling reenactment of the ""Spotlight"" team's investigation of the Catholic Church's most impactful and nearly self-immolative destruction not only in Boston but ultimately all over the nation and even the world. The Globe's exposé was an earthquake indictment of an institution many thought sat next to God himself.<br/><br/>Sadly, most institutions whether the Church or money-driven power-crazed government will sell their soul for a price and the Church paid a heavy price for doing just that transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish and ""treatment"" centers to ""treatment"" centers without a whisper to the authorities of the priestly crime of sexual abuse of minors lest it cast aspersions on a sacrosanct institution. The church remained in silent cover-up of itself despite its rape of so many young souls.<br/><br/>I viewed it because I thought it important to do so much as I think it important to view the history of the Holocaust though it is difficult to do. We view these things so that light can be shown on silent darkness and so others may never know such crushing experiences again. ""Spotlight"" is spotless in its focus and makes crystal clear why a free press matters. Without the exposure of these indelible crimes by the press they might never have seen the light of truthful day and nothing would ever change from one generation to the next."

Most notably the ""turn the other way"" attitudes of people in decades gone buy who could have exposed what was going on many years before.

","Newsrooms are often prime settings for gripping dramas. Whether about a political scandal like in 'All the President's Men,' a war scandal like in 'The Post' or a religious scandal like in 'Spotlight,' these films have the ingredients needed to keep audiences on the edge of their seats. 'Spotlight' in particular is a standout thanks to the A-list cast and the difficult storytelling required given the somber subject matter.<br/><br/>A best picture and best original screenplay winner, 'Spotlight' truly earned these accolades thanks to Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer for outstanding writing. As we've seen many times before, a film can have a great ensemble, but they can easily fall flat if the writing isn't top-notch. Here, we see the likes of Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci build on each others' talents as the Boston Globe Spotlight team does its best to get to the bottom of the Boston Archdiocese's decades-long coverup of priest sexual abuse.<br/><br/>Again, this is heavy stuff, but the way the pieces come together is really remarkable. Ruffalo's no-BS portrayal of reporter Mike Rezendes is a particular highlight, as he clearly will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of the story. Keaton also does an admirable job as the spotlight team leader - his background making things more complicated as he tries to navigate the tangled web that is the ""system"" in place between Boston politics and the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>There are some films that just stand on their own two feet without needing explanation for their brilliance. 'Spotlight' is definitely one of those."

","The film roughly roams around the investigative journalism about the child molestation and sexual abuse of children linked with the Catholic Churches. This type of bold topics are always tricky because depicting some religious scandals and controversies always generates criticism which sometimes goes beyond the expectations which might halt the release of the movie or may turn into total disaster. However despite of its bold theme in nature based on true events this film somehow got lucky as the film was not only got positive reception from Catholic community but also got praises from them acknowledging the accuracy of events and how originally the story and journalists helped them to identify this sinful act. The screenplay of the movie is one of the tightest and best I've come a crossed supported by crunch direction and some fine work by the seasoned actors including Michael Keaton."

","Had I researched ""Spotlight"" in advance, it would have been the last thing I would have wanted to watch. Browsing through the range on offer on Netflix, I had recently watched two quite lengthy series, one a documentary about an attempt to cover up sexual abuse by a priest, the other a fictional murder investigation. ""Spotlight"" should have seemed like deja vu, but the absolute excellence of this production soon captured me. There are plenty of interesting characters depicted by some really excellent actors, but nothing at all distracts from the progress of the investigation. I can't say how much I admire the avoidance of subplots, and fact that no character is allowed to command attention more than briefly. The story is the thing, and it grows and grows in dimension as the unbelievable scale of the criminal activity and related coverups by church authorities is revealed, not letting up until the last minutes of the movie. I found the way church sympathisers were shown trying to silence the investigators, very convincing. The seekers after truth are not self-righteous do-gooders, they are ordinary people who are horrified and appalled by what they discover. The whole thing has the ring of truth, and I'm glad I watched it. I am deducting a point to rate it 9/10 because I found the action and dialogue at the start a bit messy and all over the place, til it gets really going. Some of the dialogue is hard to catch as it is slurred with words half swallowed. But this is a fleabite in an otherwise admirable production. Highly recommended."

","Spotlight centers around eponymous investigative journalism team working for The Boston Globe, which in the early 00s revealed an ongoing campaign of cover-ups by the Catholic Church, aimed to keep the scandal of sexual child abuse conducted by their priests hidden.<br/><br/>It is an important moment in history, but where this movie truly shines is in its portrayal of journalism and the role it plays in our society. The movie is told almost purely from the point of view of the journalists. You could exchange the scandal for something else entirely and the movie would play out pretty much unchanged. Its purpose is not to mock or downplay religion, but rather shine a light on the importance of journalism and its capacity to uncover truths. Even those that we've agreed as a society to keep hidden.<br/><br/>An important film and an important story, but also a really well-made film as a whole. The acting is topnotch, as is the script. Visually the film is the very opposite of flashy, but this does not in any way hinder the film. Quite the opposite. The subject matter in question demands a serious and solemn approach. It demands the clinical touch of realism. The discussions and the issues have to be on the forefront instead of creative camera movements and elaborate sets.<br/><br/>Go watch the film and then at least consider getting a newspaper subscription, so that the journalists of the future can keep doing the good work that they do."
"Carrzinho","8","0","0","1 August 2019"," Gravity of the story, key to the movie success.
","Spotlight (2015)
This kind of movie probably lives or dies by the power of the story the reporters are trying to tell. In that respect they are unearthing a massive and shocking cover-up by the Catholic Church. It's where this movie and All the Presidents Men succeed and the broadly similar The Post fails.
The performances are hard to comment on other than they are competent and are passive to the story. This isn't about flamboyant characters.
The story itself is well structured and well paced. It's probably 20 minutes too long but then every frame that's left in gives a pathos to the labour of the journalists and so rightfully remains.
There is perhaps no real triumphant ""we got 'em"" moment or crescendo like in (the inferior) The Post as we know it will be written and while damaging it won't exactly shut down the Church.
It could perhaps have dealt with some of the fallout more directly and been more prolonged than a pre credits line about the cardinal but it is the frames after that that cause the biggest intake of breath.
So perhaps because of its gravity. EIGHT"

"tbuchalski","9","0","0","10 June 2019"," Spotlight: My Good, Bad, and Ugly
","The Good:
Spotlight excellently sets the stage for the shocking stories that the quartet of Boston Globe reporters sometimes seem only to stumble into. As the film unfolds, the world around them foreshadows both the giant revelations that they uncover, and the sweeping network of moral horrors perpetrated by The Catholic Church in Boston. A character goes so far even to point out a church, and playground, in the background as he tells the story of his repeated molestations as a child and how that further confused his already delicate sense of sexuality. In that moment, while unnecessarily obvious, The Church's stranglehold of a city and its people is made clear so in every other sequence the hidden symbolism of the same becomes more ominous and slowly bubbles to the surface as the moment of The Globe's publication approaches.<br/><br/>The Bad:
The film is unnecessarily preachy at times. Each principal actor is given a moment where they expound on the grave moral compromises made by those involved both inside and outside the Church. The film assumes an audience that's unaware of the controversy that The Boston Globe helped to uncover, or that has already sided with the film's antagonist. To combat the naïveté or predeterminations of that assumed audience the film gives us lapsed Catholics outraged as they realize the scope of what the priests of their community have been doing for decades. The outrage on its own is to be expected given the subject matter, but when the script explicitly calls attention to it, it does a disservice to its audience by not allowing it to come to those same conclusions naturally through the investigations and exposés built into the narrative.<br/><br/>The Ugly:
Spotlight superbly re-introduces the potential of journalism ride-along films. A genre best introduced by All the President's Men (Alan J. Pakula, 1976). Like Spotlight, Pakula's film elaborates on a recent controversy by chronicling the actions of investigative journalists and their editors that stumble upon the greatest contemporary scandal of modern America. Rather than telling the story of Watergate and the ensuing scandal, the audience uncovers the truth through an interrogation of the facts much like Woodward and Bernstein did throughout 1972 and 1973. Most significantly this film does the job of retelling the investigative uncovering of a major scandal better than its 2015 counterpart chiefly by refraining from any opinionated commentary. The audience of the day understood the gravity of the scandal having experienced it in real-time only three years prior - much like Spotlight - and the filmmakers understood their responsibility to present a narrative grounded in the truth without a diegetic commentary that would push an individual interpretation one way or another regarding the consequences of Watergate."

","Great Acting, great direction, great story, great screenplay. Well-deserved motion picture of the year, transfers you to America's late 90's and early 2000's. An absolutely necessary movie to watch, and what a great job is done making this movie. I feel there is not enough emphasize on what an incredibly perfect movie this is. Easily, it can be put among the best-ever-made movies.
The only reason I didn't gave a full score was the fact that I have seen better movies, maybe lack of score and music as great as the movie itself, that's all.<br/><br/>The way Tom McCarthy tells the story of a team of journalists shedding light on of the most controversial topics of the world is, in one word, brilliant. The scenes are perfectly juxtaposed. No surprises in this movie, just pure shock! If there's a bit of humanity in you, you'll be blown away watching this story.
With regard to production, 6-Oscar nominee has done a great deal of work, creating tangible atmosphere. No unnecessary scenes in this movie. Everything is fit!<br/><br/>Acting as I've mentioned before, is just how I love it: realistic, bold and adequate. What performances by Marc Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams. I've always thought of these two as OK actors, but, they have shown a vastly higher class of acting in this one. Micheal Keaton, is as good as ever, and Liev Schrieber plays a very different character than his Ray Donovan, yet as strong and bold. And can we applaud the most underrated actor in this movie:
Brian d'Arcy James
I am mesmerized by his performance, yet he didn't receive the attention he deserved.<br/><br/>Please watch this movie and be shocked by it. Then, really think about what it's trying to tell you. And, then, you'll realize how important this movie is."
"meeshoffmanns","9","0","0","27 March 2019"," A Fascinating and Shocking Look into the Reporting of Horrific Events
","After I had watched this movie, I immediately understood why this was chosen as Best Picture. Beside the favouritism for relevant real-life stories at the Academy, this movie was actually meticulously written and acted, and still has a lasting impact on me today. I also regard it as one of the best crafted movies of 2015.<br/><br/>Acting:
Michael Keaton as ""Robbie"" Robertson gives a subtle and very realistic performance as the self-proclaimed coach of the Spotlight team. He is so good that what he does can actually easily be overlooked: simply portraying a real and humble reporter who gets things done and is not afraid to ask harsh things when needed. Besides that he is very charismatic and quite funny occasionally, and a strong force of acting in this ensemble.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes is the definition of what a more cynical person would describe as an oscar-bait actor. Ruffalo throws everything he has all at once into this performance: an excentric, passionate and nosy reporter with a lot of energy and work ethic. He nails every mannerism and quirky aspect, and gives by far the best performance in the entire movie, definitely deserving the oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer is by far the most leavel-headed and empathetic of the team, exuding warmth and compassion, yet also determination and efficiency when it comes to her job. McAdams gives a strong and realistic performance, and while not as good as Keaton and Ruffalo, she is still a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Liev Schreiber as Marty Baron has a more plot-driven role. As an introvert yet warm new editor at the Globe, he does the best he can to steer everyone in the right direction, and is the first to suggest to tackle the scandal. Schreiber gives a good and realistic performance. but no more than servicable instead of really giving much dept.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci as Mitch Garabedian is another highlight. He plays a strict and no-nonsense attorney in Boston, as one of the first people who decided to take major action against the church. Tucci gives an excellent performance, providing a surprising amount of likability to the harsh and mistrusting man.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast consists mostly of people being questioned/grilled by the Spotlight team, and most of them are doing great considering the little amount of time they get. Their scenes provide most of the emotional core of the story, and that is a testament to how well they do their job.<br/><br/>Direction:
Tom McCarthy chose to go for an efficient yet humane approach to this heavy and dense subject, providing a lot of exposition-filled scenes with grounding aspects and strong emotion. This firm grip is noticable throughout most of the movie, and works incredibly well. His work with actors is nothing short of excellent.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
Nothing really special, but you feel pretty quick as though you are searching to dozens of papers and computer files with the rest of the team thanks to the color pallet of grey and brown. It reflects the atmosphere of a work-space and an office building, and aids into respecting the tremendous amount of work that the Spotlight team has done.<br/><br/>Plot:
It is not easy to hassle so many names and dates cohesively into a movie and portraying the extend of the scandal accurately at the same time. McCarthy and Josh Singer passed with flying colors: while careful attention is needed most of the time to memorize the right names, everything fits carefully into place as the runtime goes on, and by the end all the relevations are so shocking and disgusting that you feel just like the reporters at that moment.<br/><br/>Music:
Coming from the man who composed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, this is a whole step back in regards to complexity. It works however, and the simple piano tunes evoke a sadness and emptiness that quite well portrays the shock how this all could go on for years unpunished.<br/><br/>Editing:
Just like the cinematography, nothing special, but it does the job. All the events feel very streamlined and efficiently put together, avoiding the danger of this movie becoming stale and dragging. That is quality editing.<br/><br/>Production Design:
The interior of the globe and the homes of Boston feel real and lived in, without seemingly much effort. You could walk right in and never notice that a movie would be shot here in a few minutes. The best design is paradoxically the one that doesn't draw your attention.<br/><br/>Tone:
While a lot of the time it can feel dry and heavy due to the enormous amount of information and characters, the actors and emotional story-threads help a lot to give the necessary humanity and feelings that come with such a shocking scandal. By the third act, you are simply filled with disgust and grief.<br/><br/>Overal Consensus:
With the aid of a great cast, writing and subject material, this is a movie that needs to be seen and remembered, especially since the scandal is far from over more than 15 years later. 8.5/10"

The issue of the Catholic Church consistently and constantly covering up child abuse by priests has been with us since the first Catholic school was established in the US. I went to a Catholic elementary school, and our priests were as clean as a whistle. But a lot of other schools and priests were not. That is why this film is so important.

"proud_luddite","7","0","0","2 September 2018"," A Courageous Film
","Based on a true story: In the early 2000s, a team of reporters at the Boston Globe investigate several incidents of Catholic priests sexually abusing children.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" works well on many levels and not just for its main story of finding the shocking facts. It also reveals that universal and timeless evil known as the 'conspiracy of silence' that occurs within establishments. In this particular story, the conspiracy is not only within the Catholic Church but also within the upper echelons of Boston society. Another fact of human nature is also revealed: in any closed society, it often takes outsiders to make necessary changes.<br/><br/>The film also sheds light on a group of people rarely exposed in movies: lapsed Catholics i.e. those raised in the religion but who became discouraged by grave misconduct at higher levels of the church hierarchy. It turns out that all of the reporters are in this situation and there is a fascinating scene in which they discuss their backgrounds and how this might affect their approach to their investigation.<br/><br/>The first half is filled with energy with much inter-cutting among scenes. The highlight is a cross-cut of two scenes involving interviews with abuse survivors - one straight, one gay. In these scenes, the language is refreshingly blunt and revealing. A later scene involving an interview with a priest is even more shocking. The actors playing the survivors and the priest are also powerful in their brief roles.<br/><br/>The second half is still good but it tends to lag a bit. It seems like time to wrap up but more issues keep getting piled on. One is a scene involving a conflict on the newspaper team. The benefit of this scene is that it shows the best of Mark Ruffalo who gives the most passionate performance among a very fine cast. The downside is that the scene feels like an unnecessary extension to the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is rightly being compared to ""All the President's Men"" as a great journalist story. It can also be compared to the superb Canadian film ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" (1992) for exposing clergy child abuse. ""Spotlight"" is a fine film that may not meet all expectations; but it must be given credit for its courage and boldness."

","There are two films to see if you are studying to be a journalist. Spotlight is one and then there is ""All The Presidents' Men"" about the abuse of power in the highest offices. Spotlight recounts how the Boston Globe uncovered not only the abuse but the massive cover-up to the Cardinal to protect their pedophile priests which became the first story in a worldwide scandal about abusive priests. We are now hearing about nuns being abused by priests. As a lifelong Catholic, I was fortunate that I wasn't a victim of such abuse. This film isn't about the abuse although horrible and massive to have thousands of survivors come forward but it is about the institution of the Catholic Church who abused their power in failing to protect vulnerable, innocent children from such horrific abuse. I know that the Catholic Church is not infallible. They are at fault for allowing such heinous but crimes but they are not alone. There are other religious organizations who have survivors coming forward about their own abuse. I hope that they don't stop coming forward. Boston was a heavily Catholic city with a strong Catholic influence in its politics and history. Boston was the hometown of the Kennedys and other Irish Catholics. The Catholic Church's power was finally brought down by a newspaper named the Boston Globe who I pray never goes out of business. This is why the press is so important.

"combs-84487","9","0","0","31 July 2018"," Which story do you want us to write...because we are writing one of them...
","In 2001, The Boston Globe worked to provide proof regarding the cover-up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church. Editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) assigned the team of journalists to investigate the allegations against the priests for molesting boys. Editor Robby (Michael Keaton), reporters Michael (Mark Ruffalo), Matty (Brian d'Arcy James) and Sacha (Rachel McAdams) interview the victims and try to obtain the documents from the court. This team at The Boston Globe were referred to as Spotlight. The movie Spotlight is a drama/crime film based on a true story.<br/><br/>This film really brings to light what went on in the Roman Catholic Church and still goes on today. It is shocking how the Church could have the power to keep this a secret. It's even more surprising that government officials and attorneys have been controlled by the church to turn a blind eye. It's heartbreaking how so many families with children were affected.<br/><br/>All the actors did a great job in this film. They each brought something unique to their characters that brought them together as a great team for The Boston Globe. One of my favorite lines in the movie was by Michael Keaton when he says, ""Which story do you want us to write? Because we are writing one of them."" Loved the power in this statement. <br/><br/>There are several other scenes that bring the feeling of intensity to this story. One is when Peter (Paul Guilfoyle) is talking to Robby (Keaton) in the bar telling him that a lot of people need the church, basically telling him he needs to leave this alone. Then when Mike comes running out of the courthouse after getting proof of the sensitive documents disclosing everything about the Church. This scene goes through a passage of time of Mike reading what he found to being present in front of his colleagues, sharing this information from the documents. The scene gets intense between Robby and Mike because Mike wants to print this now, but Robby says no because Marty told them to get the ""system.""<br/><br/>If you like movies based on a true-story, this is a must-see. The story line along with the added sound and lighting will keep you in suspense rooting for this newspaper team to get the answers needed to uncover the truth. In my opinion, the film bears a close comparison to A Few Good Men with Tom Cruise as a military lawyer defending two U.S. Marines charged with killing a fellow Marine at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.<br/><br/>Both of these great movies are similar in that they are searching for the truth to uncover a conspiracy."

This film really deserved its Oscars!<br/><br/>Very subtle and credible acting and character development of all the stars, and there were some of them, and the supporting actors and actresses as well. The script was really impressing and the directing as well. <br/><br/>Would i recommend this film? Absolutely YES! And certainly not only but especially to roman-catholics but to more or less everyone as this film broaches out the massive sexual abuse of children for decades if not centuries by priests of all levels of the roman-catholic church and, what's even more important: The attempts of the church and its representatives and also external ""very important high-level"" persons to cover things up and to drive the victims into suicide and lots of mental and social problems ...<br/><br/>A really very important film and luckily really very well done in every aspect! Thanks a lot to all involved in the making of this masterpiece! :-)"

","'Spotlight' is wonderful edge on your seat fact based drama. Prime example who to make thrilling procedure films. Strong script, magnificent cast and almost anonymous directing makes it entertaining yet thoughtful film. With it's smoothly fast pace 'Spotlight' is much more entertaining than most modern action thrillers. The cast is probably one of the best ensembles in any movie from recent years - no stand alone shining performance. All actors supported each other with such dedication that it was as powerful as stage play. The director (Tom McCarthy with whom I'm not familiar with) managed to keep focus unlike many other such dramas that have failed because they just can't stay true on tone or pace. There are no fancy cinematography or stylized takes, and in this case it is good, because otherwise it could get distracting.<br/><br/>A film done right about journalism done right."

","When I watched this movie it was like watching myself. The survivor of such horrendous abuse, to then being silenced like it was nothing. I watched and nodded along to the actors portraying the survivors. <br/><br/>But for me it was not the Catholic church that covered up my abuse. It was another religious group. What got me in this story was, that it was not just me it happened to. This is OUR story. It has been going on for decades. Probably even before media was a thing in a world where children were meant to be seen and not heard. <br/><br/>I believe that children should be seen and equally heard. The monster for me was not meant to be my leader or my father (biological father sad but true) The monster was meant to be the imaginary being under my bed. <br/><br/>The movie itself was fantastic, and maybe it's because I am a survivor I don't know, but felt connected to the story. It is rare for movies to do that to me. The actors playing these roles were absolutely amazing. I like Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams anyway. I like Michael Keaton and remember him in the movies that I was not allowed to watch as a child through the 80's-90's, because of magic and the cult rules I was forced into, yet caught up with them in my adulthood. Michael is a phenomenal actor. He takes the serious role in this well and plays it well, in direct contrast to Beetlejuice. <br/><br/>If anyone is thinking of watching Spotlight and has not done so yet, I highly recommend it. As a survivor just be prepared for possible triggers along the way, but know that you can also say #ME Too and that we are not alone."

","Above being a superb movie, it's a very necessary movie. The story needed to be broadcast to the word and there was no better way to do so than this. This movie had me from the begining. Cinematography didn't really bring anything new and exciting but it definitely wasn't a fluke. Direction was great but the overall biggest and most compelling aspect as the acting. This movie had them all. Micheal Keaton and Mark Rufallo's performances gave me chills. They made me believe that they were the ones actually reporting on this story. I'm glad this movie was brought to the screen, not only as an outstanding movie, but as a testament against time that the good in people will prevail when the evil in people try to hide the truth. It deserved best picture for sure. 8.9 out of 10 stars! What a great movie."

The value of the film demonstrates the procedures and policies that true investigative reporters will follow in order to find facts that can be revealed in order to assure accuracy that cannot be mitigated.

","As a Roman Catholic, I can safely say that these abusive men are pieces of garbage, and have no place anywhere but Hell. It is also tough to see this type of scandal and take hatred from others that like to group you with these monsters and not be shaken spiritually. That being said, in order for me to get anything out of this movie, I realized that I needed to put myself, and my beliefs, out of the picture. <br/><br/>So, as far as unbiased feelings about the film, I thought it was an interesting and different perspective on crime films. Taken from a newspaper's point of view, this has the potential to inspire other artists to create a similar premise in the future. The acting is also very strong, and the screenplay is another solid aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I felt the camerawork, although not bad, was boring and lifeless at times. The film also dragged at points making it feel longer than it actually is. <br/><br/>Overall, it has a strong message that can be applied to anybody. That message being to realize that there are bad apples in all organization, and that those we may trust have secrets that could be dangerous to others. Not a mind-blowing film for me, but strong overall. Highly recommend viewing to gain a message from the movie yourself."

","'Spotlight' and 'The Big Short' will forever be linked, which speaks to their quality - both based on true stories that effected lots of people, both great dramas, both Oscar-nominated films out within weeks of each other. 'Spotlight' has some laughs, but not as many as 'The Big Short', mostly due to the dark nature of the material - the uncovering of Catholic priests molesting and raping young children, for over four decades.<br/><br/>The Boston Globe investigative journalism team (""Spotlight"") - from when newspapers were still relevant, in 2001 - consisting of Mike (Ruffalo), Sacha (McAdams), Matt (d'Arcy James) and their editor, Robby (Keaton) are tasked with finding out if an accused priest is in fact guilty of child molestation. This comes about when their bosses, Marty (Schreiber, still looking like Sabretooth) - new at the newspaper - & Ben (Slattery) try to shake things up when they smell a cover up. It turns out there's far more than one priest and one victim - some of the true stories told by the victims as the reporters uncover the facts are truly horrendous and gut-wrenching. Definitely not easy to hear, as you know it has happened in real life, and probably hundreds of thousands of times over the last century.<br/><br/>How Ruffalo is only up for Best Supporting Actor, and not Best Actor, is past me! McAdams, on the other hand, is not that utilised - both due to the ensemble cast, I guess. Keaton and Schreiber are good, as is Tucci as the crusading small-time lawyer, but Ruffalo really steals the show, with his heart on the line and it shows in his performance. It's really a great film about newspaper reporting, but is told so well and deals with such an important topic that it is actually enjoyable to watch everyone excel - including director McCarthy, who already has form with 'Win Win'. Certainly not ""fun"", but a great film."

","The truth is always stranger than fiction and that's why it makes for the best movies. Spotlight is the 2016 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture and it was well deserved. This star studded cast comes together to tell the true story of how the Boston Globe was finally able to breakthrough the decades long wall of silence, and expose the Catholic Church's child molestation scandal. Michael Keaton headlines this all-star cast and shows that while he's been out of the spotlight (pun intended) for some time now, he hasn't lost a beat. As the enigmatic leader of the newspaper's Spotlight section, Walter Robinson (Keaton) will not give up the fight for the truth, no matter the personal cost. Even when his own bosses tell him the story is dead and to give up, he refuses to let it go and he shows that one man with a mission really can change the world. This film doesn't simply shine a light on the Catholic Church in a way it would rather nobody ever had, but it also gives views an in depth, inside look at all the intricacies that go into investigative journalism. With all the reports of fake news and all of us who simply get our news from staring at a screen, it's hard to think about all the effort that goes into getting that information from real life to print and I personally found the process fascinating. This film has a lot going for it, from an inside look at a long forgotten industry to the mysteries behind a long hidden secret. It features some terrific writing and more than one outstanding performance. You don't get six Oscar nominations by accident. This is a great film and a great addition to our list of can't miss movies!"

","Spotlight. Nominated for best motion picture (won), supporting actor (Mark Ruffalo), supporting actress (Rachel McAdams), original screenplay (Johs Singer and Tom McCarthy- won), best direction (Tom McCarthy), and best editing (Tom McArdle). Remarkable film, with great directing work. Everyone in the cast is well, and Rachel's performance, and especially Ruffalo's, are great. Honorable mention must be made for Michael Keaton, who although belatedly consolidates himself as a great actor, after an irregular beginning and a half career; and also to Liev Schreiber, who plays with surgical precision the role of editor Marty Baron. Every supporting cast is strictly embedded, which is undoubtedly merit of the director. The editing of the film is accurate, a difficult job, in view of the excellent but intricate script. The plot tells the true story of an investigation into sexual abuse of children by Catholic church fathers. A group of journalists from the Boston Globe were charged with raising the accusations. The deepening of the evidence brought the case to gigantic proportions. The script is unraveled so that the viewer is taken aback, to the same extent that journalists find, terrified, that sexual abuse in the Catholic Church is systemic, methodical and diabolically obscured by the highest echelons of the institution. Whoever sees the film becomes part of the team, and it is impossible not to be moved at various times. Spotlight is an excellent film, which does not seek to deepen the discussion about religion, but rather what institutions like the Catholic Church make of it. 8 out 10."

","I watched this film with high expectations, as the warmly favourable criticisms published on the media together with the viewers' ratings in IMDb seemed to unanimously commend it as one of the best films of the year. Overall I was rather disappointed. Not that I did not enjoy the film, but I thought that its making was kind of perfunctionary, not as gripping and involving as its subject allowed for. What I mean is that there was no suspense at all. Its documentary style simply displayed and unfolded the facts in a kind of smooth monotonous way. Indeed the real story which it tells is terribly shocking and heart-wrenching by itself, but it was dealt with without much passion or cinematic warmth. I think that the film is sustained only by two elements, which at least are strong enough to make it enjoyable: the story and the cast. The performances of all the actors are outstanding in this film, the best on my view being those by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci. Apart from that, not a specially remarkable movie. sorry to disagree with the majority opinion."

","Spotlight is one of the best films I have ever seen. The story/plot, which is based off of true events is a deeply disturbing one. This movie centers around Spotlight, which is an investigative journalist group of reporters at The Boston Globe, and how they investigate the Catholic Church turning a blind eye and ultimately covering up many many priests physically molesting children. The movie does a wonderful job telling this very eye opening shocking story. The actors are a big factor in how powerful and effective the movie is. Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schriver, and Stanley Tucci all turn in great performances. It's my personal opinion that Ruffalo shines the brightest hear and his Oscar nomination is well deserved. Also what makes the film so moving and well made is the writing. The script for the film is very well put together/thought out and it does a great job at doing the true story justice, it takes you to a place of deep emotion. It's just the right runtime too, it's not an overly long film, it's just at two hours, any shorter and it wouldn't be doing the whole story justice, and too much longer would have been stretching it. I thought hearing the victims explain their stories in sometimes graphic detail was absolutely necessary, as McAdams says in one scene: ""the language is going to be very important"". Also the film clearly states and makes it clear that this has nothing to do with being gay, I loved that the filmmakers stated that because molestation can and is often used by overly conservative people as for a reason why people are gay. The very serious and heartbreaking issue that the film tackles is a story that everyone needs to hear and be educated about. This isn't fluff entertainment but it's a powerful important well made film. 10/10."

But that's the best thing about this film the fact that it stays with you, all the disturbing things you see or hear off in this film leaves an impression on its viewer that makes you realise the importance of the story these journalists are trying to tell. The Spotlight team themselves are very well realised, there not put on a pedestal as heroes but instead as people trying to tell a story and there subtle reactions to the horrors they are investigating fell real not just like it was done to add to the horrors. This film is an ensemble piece there's no one main character in this film but instead they all bounce of each other and work together well as a unit and there is not a bad performance in sight. Mark Ruffalo is proving to me more and more that he is becoming one of today's best actors, he has such a great character arc to him and when his scene where he explodes with anger feels very well earned. Rachel McAdams was also very good in this film, she had some truly hard to watch scenes where she interviews some of the victims and she keeps her vulnerability yet cool head at all times that make her a more believable character. Up until the year before with Birdman, Michael Keaton has never really impressed me outside of his Batman movies but here he was fantastic, very convincing as are the rest of the cast, through his performance we understand that's he more experienced in this field than most. Tom McCarthy directed this film beautifully, he has a very specific style about him where he keeps the camera in the same position for long periods of time and direction like this in my experience usually makes the film bland, but because of the brilliant performances and story I was never anything less than intrigued, the best shot in this film though was a long tracking shot that followed the reporters down the street to discover one of the people they are investigating lives nearby and it added a more personal touch to the main characters. But my biggest and really only issue with this movie is it conclusion, the film just ends so abruptly and I wanted to see more of the after effects of such a story. <br/><br/>Spotlight is a brilliant movie, it's not always easy to watch but it's got a very gripping and powerful story behind it and has got amazing performances and will relate to more people than anyone would care to admit. <br/><br/>92%/A"

","""Spotlight"" shines a light on the soul and soullessness of journalism.<br/><br/>There is a scene in ""Spotlight"" where one of the lead characters who is investigating the child sexual abuse in the Boston Catholic Church admits to having received information about the abuse years earlier and didn't do anything about it. He admits this failure to his colleagues, and there is some shock and understanding, but it is forgiven quickly. There are victims who scream at the Boston Globe: ""I sent you all of this before!"" And, the reporters stare blankly back at them not knowing what to say. These scenes are emblematic of how well ""Spotlight"" depicts the level of the news media's own failures as it points out the failures in others. Life is about choices, and news professionals make choices based on conscious and subconscious bias every day that readers or viewers may not see or understand. (News media bias is a hobby of mine. I am a co-author with UCLA Political Science Professor John Zaller on this subject in academic journals, including a book.)<br/><br/>Writer/Director Tom McCarthy (""The Station Agent""; one of the writers of Pixar's ""Up"") makes the right choices in ""Spotlight"". Rather than take on too much, considering the victims, the families, the priests, the archdiocese, Mr. McCarthy selectively focuses the film's point of view exclusively from that of the Boston Globe reporters. Using this narrow a focus brought criticism from many, who sought to find more villains. One of the points that the film makes is that almost no one is blameless in the Boston area, because so many stood by and did nothing.<br/><br/>While the general knowledge of the abuse-scandal denies this film any surprises, Mr. McCarthy is still able to generate genuine interest in the characters as they uncover how the system of abuse worked and who gave the orders. An extraordinary cast is assembled. Mark Ruffalo (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""); Michael Keaton (""Batman""; ""Birdman""); Rachel McAdams (""Midnight in Paris""; ""The Family Stone""); and Stanley Tucci (""The Devil Wears Prada""; ""Road to Perdition"") shine in particular.<br/><br/>The film is tightly edited, yet none of the scenes felt rushed, and the cinematography is carefully inconspicuous so the story is allowed to play out on screen very clearly. Howard Shore's score is pitch perfect as usual.<br/><br/>In the end, I found this film to be worthy Best Picture winner, and I strongly recommend it to your attention."

"brando647","9","0","0","4 November 2016"," Engrossing Procedural Drama on the Catholic Abuse Scandal
","I had no real interest in SPOTLIGHT. I wasn't even really aware of it until it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. I have been making more of an effort to watch the Best Picture nominees over the past few years because I figure I needed more exposure to whatever Hollywood considered the crème de la crème of the year's releases. Plus it's a nice break from the summer blockbusters and occasional indie film my local stores decide to keep on hand. Now that I've seen SPOTLIGHT, I can vouch that it's a fantastically interesting movie. I don't know that I would've gone so far as to award it Best Picture at the biggest of movie award shows, especially over some of the other options, but it's certainly good. It's the story of the Spotlight team, a small crew of investigative journalists at the Boston Globe, and how they ran the article exposing years of child sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic priests and, more importantly, how the Church was aware and actively covered it up in a massive conspiracy. Based on the true story, it begins with a new editor assuming command of the Globe in 2001 and requesting that the Spotlight team run a follow-up on the case of a local Boston priest who'd been busted as a pedophile. The reporters quickly discover that this situation is far more extensive and disturbing than anticipated, and they drive forward to see just how deep this scandal goes.<br/><br/>SPOTLIGHT is a talking-heads movie. Scene to scene, it goes from one conversation to another. Each scene delivers another tidbit of information or dramatizes the struggle to get confirmation from sources. We're watching two people chat in an office, then a handful of people in a boardroom, and then two people in a diner. What I'm saying is that SPOTLIGHT isn't exactly visually stimulating. It's a two-hour procedural that would've been just as at home serving as a (high quality) two-part episode on some primetime network drama. This is a movie about the importance of the story it's recapping and the performances that bring it to life. I was not raised religious and my family certainly wasn't Catholic so I never had one of those ""It could've been me"" moments that really drive the point home, but this is a powerfully told story that really emphasizes the plight of the victims. As the movie unfolds, the team makes contact with more and more victims who reluctantly share stories they've never told anyone. It's heartbreaking, all the more so because it's true. The more the Spotlight team uncovers, the more we learn of the scandal, the more engaged I became in the film. SPOTLIGHT is a talking-heads movie in which I found it impossible to be bored. By the time the film ends on those final title cards that remind us which cities have noted priest abuse scandals, I was at terrified of the scope and proud of the reporters' accomplishments.<br/><br/>As is usually the case for films of this caliber, it's loaded with talent. Kudos to Michael Keaton for being involved in the Best Picture winner two years in a row with this and last year's amazing BIRDMAN. Keaton portrays the Spotlight team's editor, Robby. He's joined by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James in filling out the team. The new editor in charge of the Globe, Marty Baron, is played to low-key perfection by Liev Schreiber and the team's primary point of contact on the priest investigation is a small-time lawyer processing multiple suits against the Church played by Stanley Tucci. Top notch all around. So no matter what's going on, you're getting a performance that, were it not part of an ensemble piece, probably would've garnered more accolades. Writer/director Tom McCarthy packs an enormous amount of drama into these two hours and it's mesmerizing to watch the Spotlight crew but heads with the powerful elite. Boston, as I've discovered, is a very Catholic city and the concept of taking on the Church in such a location meant a lot of pressurenot just from the local religious figureheads, but from the residents themselves. Oh, there you go: it's a David vs. Goliath scenario. See, I managed to shoehorn a religious analogy in there. Anyway, go watch SPOTLIGHT. It deserved to be a top contender (perhaps not a winner) of the year and it's most exciting film you'll watch where the weapons are notepads, pens, and tape recorders."

","I had heard about the Globe story -- I had no idea about the grind and drama that went into working these horrific actions. Anyway I hired the movie on a recommendation, if this was a book, I'd be writing ""page turner"" -- I have children and my hat is off to the cast, the writers and the actual reporters who have shown us some of the true horror in this world.<br/><br/>I don't know how factual the information was in the movie. We've been hearing news reports here about child abuse in all kinds of institutions, women and men, all social areas, etc. I just dread that the ""6%"" number used in the film, might just be 6% of everyone. That's more than 1 in 20 if ""people are people""."

There's so many traps you can go into making a movie like this, I and salute those who managed to stay clear of them.<br/><br/>I don't know enough about the case itself or the people involved in it to say anything about how authentic it is, but it all feels very close to the truth. None of the characters feels forced, or put there only to keep the story together. It does not seem like they try to squeeze the most out of certain characters that they suspect will be popular with the audience. It's all a dynamic, natural story being told.<br/><br/>And the story is good. All the president's men proved that investigative journalist can be exciting without any love stories or action scenes. The thrill of the search, the leads and the clues, it all adds up together to a great story (pun intended).<br/><br/>And it's told in such a roundabout way. This is what happened. These were the people involved, and here they are doing their job. The movie is intense when they situation is intense, and not due to any audience manipulation.<br/><br/>It is a great movie. I am not sure why I am not scoring it higher, because I am not good enough at this to diagnose the flaws. But when the movie was over, I felt that something was missing. And I hope it's not because I want the things I'm praising the movie for avoiding."

","Spotlight is a biographical drama directed by Tom McCarthy and stars Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Brian d'Arcy James, Liev Schreiber, and Billy Crudup. The film follows Boston Globe's Spotlight team and its investigation into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Roman Catholic priests. This is a masterpiece of a film, with incredible acting and a great true story to go along with it. The director Tom McCarthy totally got the story right and paid tribute to the amazing journalists while never making them look like people with superpowers or anything other than normal people tackling a story with weight for the good of everyone. Everybody does a fantastic job here, but Mark Ruffalo stood out to me the most from the bunch. He was amazing and was fully committed to the role from beginning to the end. Also the soundtrack by Howard Shore was Oscar worthy even though it wasn't even nominated on the category for some reason. Everything from the cinematography to the music and the editing builds up to an absolute masterpiece of a film that is created superbly for our eyes to enjoy and our minds to think."

","Part docudrama, part social record, Spotlight highlights the crusading efforts by one group of journalists to bring to public awareness the massive scale of child abuse perpetrated by Catholic priests over decades in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Slowly, not only the scale of the abuse, but the cruel indifference of church hierarchy and laity to children's suffering, historical collusion of Boston authorities, and the willful turning of a blind eye by the journalists themselves comes to the fore. This film is compelling and highly uncomfortable in equal measure. The investigation is carefully revealed without ever feeling heavy in exposition. Keaton is superb, and Ruffalo's pugnacious determination becomes the lightning rod for the rising fury of the audience. I came to this film wary of a dialogue-heavy, slightly preachy event. Instead, I left deeply affected, moved, curious, enraged, and humbled by the efforts of these journalists to shine a light on the unspeakable, and reveal the amorality of power. Possibly the best film about investigative journalism since All The President's Men, and a classic in its own right."

Acting: SPOTLIGHT is phenomenally acted film.Michael Keaton has nailed a second performance in a row after Riggan Thompson in last year's phenomenal 'BIRDMAN'.His role in SPOTLIGHT is a complete contrast.While in BIRDMAN,Keaton got to unleash his inner wildside and go completely crazy,in SPOTLIGHT,he is subtle and he plays,or rather,underplays his role to perfection.Rachel McAdams,John Slattery,Brian D'Arcy James and Liev Scrieber have comparatively smaller roles but they too have played their roles well and they have also made their presence felt.But,the standout mention goes to,take a bow,none other than,Mark Ruffalo.Ruffalo has nailed it as Mike Rezendes.His character in this film is a complete contrast to anything he has done till date!Watch out for his monologue in the end of the second act!He tugs your heart-strings as well as makes you root for him even more! Direction: SPOTLIGHT is a direction masterclass!Tom McCarthy's direction is subtle yet perfect!He maintains the film at a languid(relaxed) pace which is important for films which deal with a lot of facts at once.But,McCarthy's masterful direction and the taut screenplay ensures that you are seldom bored.McCarthy also ensures that the film is well edited and not even a single scene feels out of place or unnecessary. Background Score: The background score of SPOTLIGHT is done by three-time ACADEMY AWARD winner Howard Shore and it clearly shows!The background score is evocative as well as emotional and does a bang on job on helping the audience to emotionally connect with the film and also sympathise with the film's characters and feel the ordeal that they have been through.<br/><br/>Cinematography: SPOTLIGHT is not a scenic film or a stunning visual extravaganza where I can write a thesis about it's cinematography or visuals.But,the cinematography by Japanese cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi does a perfect job in capturing the visually minimalist look and feel of the film. Final Verdict:<br/><br/>Of all the BEST PICTURE nominations in this year's ACADEMY AWARDS,SPOTLIGHT is my favorite film!It is shocking,bold,disturbing,but at the same time,it is an important film as well as it is one of the most socially relevant films ever made!My final verdict for SPOTLIGHT is a glowing:<br/><br/>10/10(MASTERPIECE)"

","HAVE YOU EVER DANCED WITH THE DEVIL IN THE PALE SPOTLIGHT?<br/><br/>WITH 6 Oscar NOMINATIONS, SPOTLIGHT IS OBVIOUSLY A MUST SEE FLICK! <br/><br/>SPOTLIGHT is about how in 2001, editor Marty Baron, played by Liev Schreiber (X – Men Origins: Wolverine, Salt) of The Boston Globe assigns a team of journalists to investigate John Geoghan, a priest accused of molesting more than 80 boys. The team of journalist are led by editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, played by Michael Keaton (""I'm Batman."") , reporters Michael Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo (13 Going On 30, The Avengers). The reporters make it their mission to provide proof of a cover up of sexual abuse within the Roman Catholic Church. <br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer to this movie, I didn't know what to really expect. It came off like a drama, likeness of an independent film, and the type of film a big budget studio wouldn't really make. Especially with the subject matter, and the real life story they want to show on the big screen. <br/><br/>The problem with many movies based on real life stories, crime, dramas, and cover-ups is you get the feeling as if you are watching that genre. With Spotlight, you really don't know. As the movie unfolds, you learn more; are exposed to more, and see more of what goes on in this world. The writing was phenomenal. I really like how as the story goes along, we see what really goes on behind closed doors. Both legally and with our characters. A ton of real life stories turned into films also suffer from the same format of we need the hero. In this film, the journalists do not really come off as heroes, but everyday people. Meaning, people who do their job, report well, care about justice, and people who simply come off like real individuals. <br/><br/>In addition, the acting is toned down, but in a good way. The actors and actresses come across like everyday people. No one in this film over acts or seems as if they are acting to win an award. For instance, when you receive bad news, do you act like Samuel L. Jackson in the movie Changing Lanes? Meaning, do you pick up a computer and throw into a glass wall? Or do you shake your head, raise your eyebrows and maybe use profanity under your breath? In my opinion, Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers, About Time) does an amazing job! I believe that this is Rachel McAdams best movie in a very long time. She acts well, comes off like a good person, helpful, has a purpose, and she really stepped it up with her performance.<br/><br/>BATMAN AND THE HULK ARE ON SCREEN TOGETHER! Says the one nerd in the theater (me).<br/><br/>Once again, I'm glad to see Michael Keaton back in an Oscar worthy film. Mark Ruffalo also is delivering a good performance, and is easily getting better with every movie that comes up. <br/><br/>So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Spotlight. It's very well written, informative, well acted performances from everyone, disturbing at times, and overall a film that is at least worth checking out at least once in your lifetime. I believe Spotlight earns a<br/><br/>8/10!<br/><br/>This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)"
"CriticGirl91","10","0","0","3 August 2016"," An Experience
","I am so grateful to have had an opportunity to view this film. I simply Googled for the best film of 2015 and its name came up. It became obvious to me why this is the top ranked film once I watched it. <br/><br/>Spotlight takes up a very sensitive and attention demanding issue, and then deals with it with the perfect momentum. I need not narrate the script here, so I'll go into my appreciation of the thoughtfulness in every feature of the film. <br/><br/>The first feature is the mundane realism of the film. It does not make a single attempt at glamour. I felt I was looking into an actual magazine office, with real journalists and editors. Yet, the film is not a boring, slow paced documentary. It keeps elements of discovery intact, and right along with the journalists, the viewers keep experiencing the unfolding of the plot. <br/><br/>The next commendable feature is the story itself, which is given weightage to by the new editor of Spotlight in the film, and by the makers in reality. A bitter truth is at the helm of this film, one that should have never been ignored to begin with. A mass denial is the focus here, exemplary of society's reluctance to come to terms with its disorder , no matter how prevalent it is. Spotlight is not simply about the abuse of young children, it represents every humane issue that deserves spotlight. <br/><br/>The next noteworthy feature is that the characterization is true to life. Nobody is a protagonist or an antagonist. Nobody has ulterior motives. The victims are frustrated and shaken, but have moved on in life, the perpetrators are guiltless, and the journalists are distanced yet affected. They are up against competition while determined to aid the victims at the same time. <br/><br/>Performers are splendid, with a flow to them. None of the actors make their characters seem unfamiliar. There are no emotions that are unseen in real life. There are no personalities that we haven't met before. The editor is very contained like the work focused, no nonsense managers we meet. The senior journalist is farsighted while the field journalists have a difficult time relaxing their emotions. All very believable. <br/><br/>I can keep on admiring this film, for it is an experience more than an expression. As a psychology student, I recommend this film to every sensitive soul out there. Finally a film made for us."

","I have been interested in the pedophilia that was caused by the Catholic Church since I watched ""Philomena Lee"" movie. For those who don't know who she is, she was a young woman who was sent into the Magdalene laundries in Ireland because she fell pregnant without being married and she disgust the catholic church for that reason. Unfortunately her son was giving up for adoption and they were not able to find each other until after his death. Very disgusting of the Catholic Church to be covering up situations like this especially for poor Philomena Lee. I hope they rot in the ground for what they did to her and her son!<br/><br/>Anyways back to the film, I thought it was excellent. It actually remind me of ""The Presidents Men"" movie I've seen recently and I have to say, Michael Keaton did a good job on acting as a reporter. It goes to show how there were so many cases out there of sexual abuse in the catholic church in which it involved victims like altar boys, teenage girls, young women,men,etc. There are still cases today and this does not have to be found out in 2001 because its found out every year, day, month and time. Mark Ruffalo was great too, he really did a spot on job as one of the reporters of the Spotlight team. Even though I tried not to get emotional in scenes where they interviewed the victims on these cases, however I found it good that the movie made us all aware of child sexual abuse and being careful of what creeps are out there which doesn't have to be priests!

","""They knew and they let it happen! It could've been you, it could've been me, it could've been any of us."" <br/><br/>After watching ""Concussion"", I wondered how former NFL players would react to this film. After seeing ""Spotlight"", I asked myself whether the clergy had the courage to see this film or not. And also if lessons were drawn from this. Would the Church restore his original role in society? A haven for believers. Its function as middleman between the divine and the Christians. An institution created as a service for the needy, poor and pious. Or would abuses such as addressed in ""Spotlight"" simply continue to exist? Because lets admit it. The credits at the end of the film are more horrible than the actual film. It shows that the cited case is only a tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>What's more frightening? Being pursued by a deranged maniac who's wearing a hockey mask and carries a chainsaw? Or being abused by a perverted priest who can't restrain his lust because of a self-imposed celibacy? Perhaps the first is extremely deadly. But the second one causes such a trauma, the victim wishes to encounter such a nut with a chainsaw to release him from his suffering. The things I thoroughly hate are abuse of power, inviolability, breach of trust and covering up criminal offenses by powerful authorities. And that's something common within the church. A little bit too much fooling around with little choirboys? No problem. We'll put you in another parish where you can play shepherd again and watch over some tame sheep. Disgusting.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" reminded me of ""All the President's Men"" with a young Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford playing Carl Bernstein's and Bob Woodward, two Washington Post journalists who published articles about the Watergate scandal. Also a cover-up. But this one happened on a political level. The only result there was the resignation of president Nixon. The ecclesiastical cover-up made lots of victims. ""Spotlight"" is a dead serious film with a dead serious, nauseating topic. It's admirable that they didn't let it degenerate into an accusatory film that would unleash a veritable witch-hunt. Needless to say, the main roles are played impressively by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber.

","This could be the 1000th time that a movie of the drama-genre assimilated into the positivity of critical reactions and film awards. But why these films attracted critics and seemingly experienced judges throughout decades? Perhaps doing 'drama' is the most reliable approach to the fundamentals of filmmaking: Acting, storyline, writing, cinematography, editing and directing. Flashy stunts and special effects are not necessary. Surely, movies which gain leverage on the elements mentioned above would compel people of film awards to nod in agreement. ""Spotlight"", like other admired drama pictures, revered by professionals although I think that it is not the most powerful movie I have ever seen or the best of the year. But still, ""Spotlight"" is a compelling and straightforward picture which addresses an important story.<br/><br/>'Spotlight' from the 'The Boston Globe' is a team consists of individuals that act as investigative journalists. The film is based on real stories told by the team, which have reporting works for the case of sexual abuse of children by different Catholic priests being stitched together.<br/><br/>The mighty Mark Rufallo handed in the best performance of the cast. Whenever he was on-screen, he was so well- connected to the character until his own-self temporarily subdued. Other performances from stars like Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Stattery and Stanley Tucci were great too. Acting is the film's forte; so its triumph at SAG awards was not surprising.<br/><br/>Everyone can be stumped by Rezendes's (Mark Rufallo) (a member of the 'spotlight' team) obsession in wanting to get his work done. All we could see of Rezendes was him working, working and working. If Rezendes is a workaholic of the highest order, he might have disregarded personal matters, even if this is not shown anywhere in the movie. But still, one or two that we can learn from the character is his capability to be steadfast for his objectives.<br/><br/>This is the kind of show which informs us on how powerful journalism can be, and how much free press can contribute if it remains incorruptible, and popular in the eyes of the public. Whatever the film was trying to deliver, I guess it succeeded. ""Spotlight"" fulfilled what good drama movies required. On a pedestal of strong acting performances, writing and directing, ""Spotlight"" managed to earn Oscars' choice for the best movie of 2015 notwithstanding a group or a few that will think otherwise.<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"

","It is beyond cliché at this point to say this film is the 'All the President's Men' of this generation, but that is because the comparison is so readily apparent. If you're learned in any way about cinema, it's the first thing that pops into your head. I noticed in five minutes into the film, and I was continually reminded of that throughout its 130 minute runtime.<br/><br/>While they're not so similar as to make Spotlight a ripoff, I could see these films being part of the same series. Wouldn't that be a strange series- a set of similar films of excellence in investigative journalism. I'd be all for that, but in the current Hollywood climate, the possibility of that happening hovers around zero.<br/><br/>No matter what you think about this film's relationship to ATPM, it is certainly not a ripoff in terms of quality. It won Best Picture at the Oscars, and while I would not call it the best film of 2015 under any circumstances, it is a stellar piece of old-school filmmaking.<br/><br/>I find it quite humorous that both what this film is about- high-quality print journalism - and what it is- a mid-budget grounded drama driven by its story and cast instead of special effects- are in the same boat; they are gradually fading away but are capable of producing great work.<br/><br/>However, that same sense of obsolescence is why this film is not getting a perfect score from me. All the President's Men seemed titanic. It starred two of the biggest names in the world and was cutting-edge for its time. This film, with minor alterations, could pass for a film from 1975. It doesn't want to accept full-on modern filmmaking, which would be all right if everything from then hadn't shrank since then, thus making this film seem less important than it otherwise would be. Journalism and these types of movies are two things that don't matter as much as they once did, and this film acting otherwise without providing any additions to the formula stops it from being truly great. It is drawing from a well that isn't as deep as it once was.<br/><br/>Even the subject matter reflects its lack of grandiosity compared to its spiritual predecessor. While I ardently refuse to take anything away from this very important story that affected many lives, it is no Watergate. There is only one Watergate. ATPM was lightning in a bottle in that regard. How we get our information has also changed over the last four decades. While everyone knew about Watergate, they didn't know the nitty-gritty, the details of the story. Now, with the internet, any random Joe could find out everything he needs to know about the Catholic Church abuse scandal in minutes.<br/><br/>But that's enough points against this film. It really is one of the most insightful, hardhitting, entertaining films of the last six years. I would put it up with and maybe even above Michael Mann's The Insider, another film that is often compared with ATPM. A killer cast, led by Michael Keaton (leading his second Best Picture-winning film in two years), Edward Norton (putting in the best work of his career), and Rachel McAdams (same deal), engage you in this narrative, and the Academy Award-winning screenplay chipped in a great assist. The few modern touches of the film do help it out, making it feel old-fashioned in a good way instead of old-fashioned in a bad way. Though not unprecedented, this film is sharp and unflinching, a true instant classic.<br/><br/>By: Joshua Fagan"

Michael Keaton is the pick of the bunch but Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci put in solid performances too.<br/><br/>Another factor the movie has in its favour is timing: (alleged) abuse of children by priests of the Catholic church is a highly charged, highly publicized, internationally widespread, current issue. While I do not think Spotlight was the best film of 2015 (for me, that honour goes to Room), Spotlight isn't far behind the best in terms of pure cinematic quality plus it taps into a highly topical issue. <br/><br/>I thus think it is the contemporary nature of its subject matter that saw it edge out the competition for the Best Picture Oscar in 2016, and I don't see a problem in that (despite my preference for Room). One of the purposes of art is to capture the look, feel and issues of the times and preserve them for posterity. Spotlight fulfils this function very well."
"CinematicInceptions","9","0","0","3 May 2016"," Well paced and interesting, even if it's not overly entertaining.
","This is a movie that pretty much everyone of high school age or older should see. For some who know or are victims of the abuse investigated, I know it might bring up some bad memories and emotions, so I respect if you don't want to see it. Regardless, it's definitely a noteworthy story even if it isn't the pinnacle of entertainment. Showing it from the perspective of the Boston Globe was definitely a good idea because the nature of the research the reporters have to do allows all aspects of the problem to be examined. And as shown, there are a lot of aspects to it.<br/><br/>I was very young when the actual story was published so I can't speak for how things were then, but it seems like most people knew that this sort of sexual abuse was going on and just didn't want to acknowledge it. The Spotlight team in the movie tries to get people to talk about it by removing some of the myths surrounding the issue. Throughout the movie we see how they disprove the myth that the incidents of abuse are isolated, that they are infrequent, that it is only the fault of the individual priests, and that the incidents should be swept under the rug because of the good that the Catholic Church does. This last one seems to be the most persistent of the myths today and the one that the movie is trying to disprove. It is true that the Church has made some amazing positive changes to the lives of billions of people since its beginning, but the fact is that it is run by imperfect people. Spotlight seems to be saying that by showing these imperfections and by the Church admitting to them, the Church can better do its job and bring hope to people.<br/><br/>The couple of victims that are interviewed show what happens when nothing is done about the issue. The team recognizes the seriousness of this in their insistence that the victims not use general terms like ""molested"" when telling their stories because that sort of thing won't get their readers' attention. The first victim interview with ""survivor"" Phil Saviano was the point where the issue sort of became real to me and I think the same goes for the characters. He and the other survivors talk about how they were spiritually scarred by their experiences. All the priests mostly abused poor, fatherless kids, which probably meant that faith was pretty much all the kid had. So molesting them destroyed what was probably their only remaining source of hope.<br/><br/>I know that there are probably some concerns about certain institutions or people being portrayed offensively. I didn't find that this happened much. It certainly doesn't target the Church as the sole cause, giving lots of time to the lawyers and even Globe employees that helped keep the stories silenced. All of the reporters are shown as hardworking, but not heroic. I suppose the priests that we actually see are shown as sanctimoniously deceptive, but that is sort of the issue. We aren't as shocked when we hear about cops or coaches raping innocents because they aren't breaking vows of celibacy or expected to be a model of morality to everyone they meet. The lawyers are probably the most demonized group, probably because their excuse that they were just ""doing their job"" seems rather cowardly. The only thing that I saw as offensive was a line from the gay victim that Sacha interviews. He's not portrayed as inferior or weird or anything like in some comedies, but there's one point where he comments on a lawyer being handsome. This line might have been fine if it were a clue to his being gay, but it comes long after that point is established.<br/><br/>The acting is quite solid from everyone. The actors keep the focus on the story, but the characters still feel like real and distinct people with a little depth to them. The script had a lot of strong points especially in keeping a good pace to what could have been a very boring story and helping the audience remember all of the characters. There are several points where a character is mentioned while they aren't on screen, and then shown in the very next scene, which I found very helpful in keeping track of the numerous characters. Even setting up one scene in a dark and smelly basement was a great way of showing how much work went into covering up the scandals. The dialogue feels realistic, but also holds tangible conflict and tension.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to all Catholics, though I know some will feel that the existence of this movie and the events it portrays are sinful. That aside, it has some great commentaries on how all of us in America do our jobs as opposed to how we maybe should. I know I might get some hate for saying this, but I think there are more solid messages here than in most of the media that promotes Catholicism. Just to dissuade a couple more possible deterrents, this hardly ever gets slowed down by its basis on a true event and does not have many of the drawbacks that most biopics and event based movies do. Also, do not go into this with a ""kick back and relax"" mentality or expect to be entertained. Overall Rating: 8.5/10."

","The story to this movie is disturbing, and what makes it so disturbing is that it is base on true events that happened. It revolved around child molestation from priests who preyed on vulnerable children. These children came form households that carried conflict.There were numerous priests involved, and it was throughout the entire religious organization.<br/><br/>The Boston Globe, a newspaper company, was the one that investigated the misconduct of the priests in Boston. Just in that city, there were almost 90 priests that were involved in child molestation. Many knew of what was going on, but no criminal charges were pressed against any of the priests. Settlements were made between the involved parties and lawyers, and a disclosure would be signed so that it could never be spoken of again.<br/><br/>After consistent digging to find the truth, The Boston Globe was able to unravel something bigger than what they were searching for. Their publications of the actions of the church, priests, and lawyers had been introduced to the greater public.<br/><br/>The worst part of this is that it is true. Prior to the credits of the movie, there was a list of all the cities where similar acts were occurring, and there were close to 100 cities listed. The system is truly messed up, and all of those child molesters should be in prison."

","I have never been so moved by a movie in my entire life, that I had to sign up for IMDb just so I could write this one review. As a past Catholic, I knew as a teenager this organization had too much power. They run like a corporation, and prey on those who are vulnerable and lacking hope. This movie is a great depiction of how much we as a society have let the 'church' get away with so many hidden truths. To think that this is a global event sickens me to the core, and that hundreds, maybe even thousands of innocent children suffered so much that they couldn't live on. What a feeling it must be for the thousands of kids who survived this ordeal to know that the truth has been exposed; that they are not alone in the fight. <br/><br/>The entire cast for this movie did such a great job. When they got angry, I felt that same anger from across the screen. Well done to the entire cast and crew for taking on a subject that most are to afraid to admit is a reality. Bravo."
"sreethered","8","0","0","22 April 2016"," Shocking revelations can bring accolades indeed...
","The story, or incident to be precise, of Spotlight was an ideal material for a documentary. It follows through the news team and their work which eventually cracked open a behemoth of conspiracy under the Christian monarchy. With a formidable cast and an eventful script, Spotlight became an instant cinematic classic, bagging the best picture Oscar this year. It also shows how strong Micheal Keaton's comeback is, as he is now part of two consecutive best picture winners.<br/><br/>There was a time when there were no supreme force in the western world other that Christianity. They took the holy book as the eternal truth and crushed everyone who opposed the idea. They burned Bruno alive for suggesting a vast, infinite universe. They almost killed Galileo for his scientific curiosity. Now, they protected pedophile priests from law, fearing that it will affect their reputation, and god, it happened worldwide, including Ollur!!! Now that was a shocker.<br/><br/>Spotlight gained its place under spotlight due to this shock value, other than anything else it forwards. When one scrutinize it, it is evident that Spotlight is a procedural story happening inside a newspaper. Much like All the Presidents Man, that matter it holds makes it noteworthy. The courage it shown to put it in film shows the dedication of the whole cast and crew and the accolades were in fact for that courage..."
"tomgillespie2002","7","0","0","1 April 2016"," Riveting procedural hampered by an emotional distance
","This years Academy Award Best Picture line-up was one of the most underwhelming in recent memory, but there was a little cheer when director Tom McCarthy's underdog Spotlight took home the top prize. My personal favourite of the nominees, The Big Short, lost out, and the stand-out film of the year, Inside Out, wasn't even on the list (although it took home the Best Animated Feature), but the lack of truly great films this year doesn't take anything away from Spotlight, which is a riveting little procedural hampered by a surprising emotional distance from the disturbing subject matter.<br/><br/>Like most films set amongst the huddled office meetings, desk- thumping and pen-chewing of the newspaper room, Spotlight takes its inspiration from Alan J. Pakula's seminal All the President's Men (1976), and concerns itself solely on the noble efforts of the staff trying to piece together that big story that will change everything. Here, we're at the Boston Globe in 2001, and the newspapers new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and almost instantly notices the importance of delving deeper into eccentric lawyer Mitchel Garabedian's (Stanley Tucci) accusation that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) has covered up the molestation of various children by a priest in their very city.<br/><br/>Baron hands the task to Spotlight, a team consisting of 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian D'Arcy James), who takes months exhaustively researching their subject matter before publishing their findings. What they uncovered were hundreds of cases in Boston alone of child molestation by priests, and the fact that this was ignored by people in a position to do much more. In fact, some of the most powerful moments come from the revelations that some of the Boston Globe staff sat on the story for years without taking notice of the extent of the abuse. With Operation Yewtree still hitting the headlines here in the UK, the subject of sweeping these kinds of cases under the rug couldn't be more relevant.<br/><br/>Spotlight depicts, in breathtaking detail, the work carried out by Robinson and his team to uncover the truth and to obtain the required evidence. Keaton, after last years Birdman, gives another assured performance, and Ruffalo is routinely terrific as the pit- bull Rezendes. Aesthetically, the film cannot be faulted, and McCarthy sticks strictly to the facts. However, the lack of an emotional connection means the film does not induce the kind of anger it really should. Without doubt the movies stand-out scene is Pfeiffer's reaction to a priests blunt response to her equally blunt questioning, and the film should maintain the sort of power and shock this moment inspires, but keeps itself frustratingly distant. Spotlight is still an accomplished piece of work with some sparkling dialogue, and McCarthy hints that he may have found the same form he had with his terrific debut The Station Agent (2003)."

","Having lived in Boston, and having been raised Catholic, there were many elements of ""Spotlight"" that were impressive. <br/><br/>The story concerns the Boston Globe's 2001 investigation into sexual abuse of minors committed by priests, and how the Catholic church covered up the crimes by moving the priests from parish to parish.<br/><br/>The reporters are members of the Spotlight team, which work on important, investigative stories. They are are Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). Their boss is Walter V. Robinson (Michael Keaton), and his boss is the new guy in town, editor Martin ""Marty"" Baron (Leiv Schreiber). Above all of them is Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery).<br/><br/>For many years prior to the sexual abuse scandal, Spotlight had investigated and reported on many other ground-breaking stories.<br/><br/>When an attorney, Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) claims that the Archbishop of Boston knew that Father John Geoghan, a priest in the diocese was sexually abusing children, the bishop did nothing.<br/><br/>Baron wants the Spotlight reporters to find out whether it's true, whether if it's an isolated incident, or if it is a common practice. When 9/11 hits, they have to put the story on hold, but pick it up again.<br/><br/>Fascinating story, and we see the investigation grow from the beginning, from trying to interview victims, then priests, getting sealed documents from court, and the shock of learning how widespread the problem is. <br/><br/>The film also focuses on the pressure and lack of cooperation from outside sources, the reverence with which people hold the Church, and the tremendous influence and hold that it has on the city. When one boy was abused, the Cardinal visited his home to calm the waters, and ""my mother served freakin' cookies."" For someone in my mother's generation, it is a devastating story.<br/><br/>Seeing the Boston locations was amazing -- including exactly where I once worked in Government Center. The acting, including the accents, was excellent, but nothing overwhelmed the story. The emphasis seemed to be on ensemble performance and keeping the story up front.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" tells a sobering, sad tale. As one of the sources says, ""The church is an institution of men, and even well-meaning men fail."" One questions how well-meaning men were who decided to keep this quiet. And the point is made in the film that spirituality and faith are separate from formalized religion."
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","0","0","22 March 2016"," This should not appear like a pamphlet against the Catholic Church
","I will try to be short because the subject of this film is so important, so dramatic, so horrific that we do not need many words to speak of it.<br/><br/>My first remark is that it concerns Catholic priests in the area of Boston, but it could – and probably does – concern the whole world, and not only the Catholic church, and not only churches or teachers and schools; or UN troops in the Central African Republic. It is all the more shocking when it deals with an ethical institution like a church or a peace-keeping corps of the United Nations or an educational institution because these three institutions have an ethical definition and the respect of the integrity of children is one basic principle of these institutions. You could add the medical institution with orphanages, psychiatric wards or hospitals, retirement homes (because sexual abuse MUST NOT be only considered when the victims are children), etc. Sexual abuse, of children particularly but not only, is a crime against humanity.<br/><br/>My second remark is that in any society at large, in any social group in particular some abuses are often hidden under the carpet and even at times tolerated not to stain the reputation or the identity of this society or these social groups. There is in all social community an identity dimension for the members and they may feel negated in this identity of theirs if the public image of the community were criticized in a way or another. Such criticism leads in certain cases to racism, segregation, discrimination and of course exploitation, rejection and victimization. Better keep the ""small"" defects secret so that it would not leak out in the public around. And the members become silent, blind, deaf, and a few other sensual impairments. And the family is such a social community.<br/><br/>The third remark is very well explained in the film by some victims. Children, often, but not only, from disrupted families with marital violence, with parental violence, with poverty and even divorce, if not divorces, and casual male or female partners going through the home, not mentioning drugs, alcoholism and a few other intoxications, children, boys as well as girls, in such situations from 6 to 14, at times later, look for some parental model, be it a man or a woman, a substitute father or mother. When they have some adults who are close and as such have a high level of prestige, a priest, a teacher, a coach, or at times simple neighbors or even relatives, they can fall into the trap of sexual attraction or sexual abuse. But even if sexual attraction there is, in the child the experience of abuse, the sexual experience with an adult, will be traumatic and will leave serious damage behind at the mental, psychological or ethical levels. <br/><br/>The film did not try to explore what the strategies of children in such situations are or can be. Some are protective and enable the children to suffer the abuse as it it were something from another world than their own, the one they build in their psyche. Note this is very difficult when the abuser is a priest, a teacher, a father, a brother, a mother, a sister, that is to say people who are essential for the growth, development and maturation of the children. The film was in fact too short on one issue. They insisted on the number of surviving victims (without specifying the mode of this survival). But what about those that did not survive? How many, how bad they ended, at what age, etc.? <br/><br/>The film is essential to show a vast problem but the concentration onto only the victims of Catholic priests may appear as a way to avoid speaking of pedophilia in our countries, and in the world. There might not be 6% of pedophiles in our societies, male or female, but it is indispensible to understand our modern rejection of pedophilia is a very recent evolution in the West, that is to say mostly among Western Christians and Jews. It sure is a crime against humanity but this is recent. Marriage was set at the age of 13 for girls in England by a law in Parliament in the 18th century. We would not even think of it today, though some studies do say a fair proportion (40%?) of people between 14 and 16 have had or regularly have some sexual activity. Nothing is said before 14, except in doctors' offices. It would be fair to consider that sexual activities between young people at the early age of 14 leading quite often to teenage pregnancies are also a form of pedophilia. That is to say there is quite a long road ahead if we want to get rid of sexual activities among minors. Is it abuse? Not all the time, but quite often yes, with some drug use, some alcohol and just some carelessness. I would suggest to read my own poetical fiction on the subject: ""AN UNTELLABLE STORY; A dramatic Confession, THE NINETEEN STATIONS OF SARAPHIC LOVE,"" Kindle B00UP4CX88.<br/><br/>A fascinating film that has to be widened in scope not to appear like a pamphlet against the Catholic Church that neither deserves it nor is able to avoid the ""problem"" because it is simply the predator nature of any man or woman that actually comes out in any situation and may come out in any person when circumstances permit, like UN peace keeping soldiers of French citizenship in the Central African Republic.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","This movie tried to tell the horrors catholic church has allowed their priests to do to children. Rapes, sexual abuses by their priests, heavily covered and even approved by the church itself. However, it is told in extremely civilized and correct manner. It is like series of facts are listed and showed in your face. The movie goes in such extreme with this approach, that it becomes bit boring to follow even though the subject and content itself are beyond fascinating. Some would list this to the movie's pros, but I mostly view it as a so-so.<br/><br/>I can see what they did, though. It is utter lack of propaganda and party. Total neutral approach where the movie doesn't want to do the thinking and judging for you, but leaves that job as a whole to the viewer. The opposite of what media does. I admire how they could execute all of this without any bits of provoking been seen in the piece itself, the piece we call Spotlight. <br/><br/>The problem from my part being, and reason why I don't think any higher about this movie (which I already think is good, but not great), is simply the lack of shock. There is not much anything new this movie has to offer to a person from the ""internet generation"" such as myself. Besides the neutral approach that can rarely be seen these days, the movies ""evil"", and all the f*cked up s*it in the world, all are something that we all know about already. <br/><br/>Surely, we got to see how hard it sometimes is to deliver the facts to public knowledge, and I guess we all can appreciate the effort. I know I appreciate this. In fact, I think this is the bigger, though-provoking message this movie had to offer. What we are told and what is the truth. Two different things. It is pretty much a timeless subject. Thinking about the immigrant crisis and wars we are having in the modern world now in 2016, you know, just to name the ""hottest"" subjects. We can only wonder how many years it takes before all the crazy mad s*it around these subjects get revealed by some form of media and later made into a movie. It is no surprise if something as dark as child abuse by church is revealed regarding our current crisis.<br/><br/>The truths of present are often lies in the future. Sometimes, people, such as the Spotlight team, can question even such an admired and loved organization as the church, and find the grey between all the black and white we are taught to see, and, just maybe, make the world a bit better place."

But then the Academy Awards passed up The Revenant, The Martian and Bridge of Spies for Best Picture and I was determined to see what the fuss was about. <br/><br/>I had thought the subject was the molestation of kids by priests. That's not something I was interested in. But actually the subject is much more how does the world learn about something as difficult to talk about? There's no denying the Catholic church gets its just deserts in the process, but the real lesson here is in story telling under difficult circumstances. And boy do they exhibit brilliance and sensitivity.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes where church officials are talking with editors from the Boston Globe are eerily realistic in that they will conjure up memories of similar real events. The way church officials work to protect its priests is disturbingly plausible.<br/><br/>There's almost no action or suspense but both my wife and I were riveted to the screen and barely fussed the entire movie.<br/><br/>It's hard to single out one actor as best out of this group. Ruffalo and Keaton clearly give it their all and have the most screen time. But then there's brilliance in even the fairly minor parts. I'd reluctantly give MVP to Liev Schreiber. I love his Ray Donovan but I had no idea he was capable of becoming a bookish editor of such quiet appeal. Every minute he's on screen he tends to steal the show.<br/><br/>If there were ever a movie that illustrated how the art of movie making is one of collaboration and ensemble, this is it. I'm stunned how the screen writers managed such territory, but then without the complete understanding and commitment of director and actors, it could have sat there like a deflated balloon.

","Best thing about Spotlight is that at no point of time during its 120 odd minutes, does it give the impression that you are watching a movie. You just want to lean forward and try to take in what is unraveled thick and fast. You are sucked in and made part of the investigation quartet at Boston Globe. Spotlight, the intrepid inquiry team at Boston Globe, exposes the rampant pedophilia in Catholic Church. Spotlight, the movie, tells us how they pursue this project with single-minded doggedness.<br/><br/>Spotlight is not a very visual film. It takes the plot forward through conversations – brainstorming discussions and one to one interviews, accompanied by quicksilver editing. So convincing and intense are these interviews that you absolutely empathize with the victims. It is also a sort of thriller, sans blood and bodies. The sinister machinations of the Church are chilling to the bone. Though the film limits its exposé to the archdiocese of Boston, it drops a bombshell that the system is rotten right up to the doors of the Pope.<br/><br/>As good as the content of the film, are the performances; oozing with sensitivity and sincerity and utterly credible. It makes you fall in love with newspapers all over again; a huge achievement in this impatient age of social media."

","Spotlight throws spotlight on the ugly side of faith. An issue lodged so profusely in the streams of religion that it goes either unnoticed or remains unlit. Plot: A team of reporters work conscientiously to bring child abuse by priests into the forefront by illuminating the dark hollows of the ugly tactics of the church.<br/><br/>The movie addresses the issue slyly and then dives into it fully fledged owing to the inclusion of a new concerned editor Marty Baron, played superbly by Liev Schreiber whose words make a difference and reignite the died out flame of Walter Robby Robinson (Michael Keaton) who along with his meticulous and diligent team rush in to address the elephant in the room. Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James) are both outstanding. They look forever engaged in their pursuit, whilst Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes can't be ignored. Mark gets into the skin of Mike and creates a new persona altogether, an earnest committed fella who would stop at nothing to nail the molesters. It is almost as he disappears into that stream of acting. Watch him lose it like a maniac! There are other brilliant characters in the movie that can't be left uncredited owing to their enthralling acting. Like that of John Slattery as Ben Bradlee, Jr. who fits into the bossy shoes pretty great. Also, Billy Crudup, Stanley Tucci and Jamey Sheridan who were all mesmerizing in their little fleeting acts.<br/><br/>Screenplay of the movie is well written. Becomes very thoughtful at times. The work the people do in the flick will make you feel worthless. So, crucial bringing issues in the dark to the front page! They deserve an ovation.<br/><br/>""That's why I never got married. I am too busy. What I do is too important."" The aforementioned is said by Mitchell Garabedian played brilliantly by Stanley Tucci. You could almost read how concerned and thoughtful the guy is from his looks.<br/><br/>Spotlight comes up with a beautiful plot of mind-boggling revelations that will make you hate the religious conventions that hide the truth. It is a dead on collision between the media and the system, which remarkably addresses the church functioning snags. To say that the issue just circles around church would be an understatement. It is a global phenomena, something so ugly that it hardly makes news. This flick beats the odds to come up a victor. Kudos to the thoughtful media on this one! SPOILERS AHEAD: Spotlight begins with a hushed conversation and a free priest getting away with a horrendous crime. The prologue is reflective of how untouched and unscathed they feel under the aegis of their religious fallacy. How unfazed they feel around the law! Believing they are closer to God they could get away with anything! The perpetrator walks on to his car, escorted by a bigger authority from the Church as the helpless law (a policeman) watches their car drive through a mist of smoke into the oblivion.<br/><br/>It delves deep into some outstanding reporting too which is well captured by Tom McCarthy that shows us how extraordinary the efforts of Boston Globe reporters really were in bringing out the issue at hand into the limelight. The final result will gratify you and if you are the empathizing kind, you will feel the cold yet comforting gaze of justice from the end credits.<br/><br/>The world's full of sexual predators. They could be masked as priests too. To look the other way is not the solution. If it is happening in your corridors, speak up. Crime's after all a crime.

All of these are symbols of brand, escape, loyalty, hope and belonging. When you feel a connection to a club then it is all the more shocking if you discover it is corrupt. If that corruption translates to deviance how can you ever trust or believe in that institution again? Do you choose to challenge, defend or ignore?<br/><br/>We are transported to Boston in the 1990's. Spotlight is an investigative branch of the Globe newspaper. These are a team of journalists who work on the big cases. No major deadlines, time to find the truth, reporting when (and if) they have tangible information. We join the narrative when a new out of town editor from Florida (Marty Baron) takes the reigns. A true story of scandal, child abuse and cover ups unravel which is truly shocking.<br/><br/>The cast performances are to be commended. Whether you are a paid actor or not this must have been an emotional project to be involved in. The whole movie is from the perspective of the reporters and the subsequent investigation.

","Spotlight is directed by Tom McCarthy and is the true story of the Boston Globe news reporters that uncovered the scandal of Catholic priests molesting children throughout Boston, and the entire world even. If I had to label this film a genre, I would most likely call it a psychological thriller. I would name it this because of the major character arcs that take place with each and every one of the characters. All of the characters slowly become obsessed with the story, and struggle with maintaining their personal life, due to their entire lives being wrapped up with the case. This element is what makes Spotlight so great.<br/><br/>The second best thing about Spotlight has to be the acting, starting with Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo easily gives his best performance to date, portraying and average guy that learns about these horrible things. He doesn't take the news like a movie character, however. He accepts the story just how a normal person would, by just being down about it. He doesn't flip out and start punching people, he just reacts in such a way that gives the film such a realism factor, that the viewer feels like they're watching a documentary, rather that a feature length film.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton also gives one of the best performances of his career. It's so nice to see him in another good role, showing that Birdman (2014) wasn't just a one time fluke. Keaton plays a higher up official in the Boston Globe, and seems to be stalling on when the story should be released, and butts heads with Ruffalo's character due to their disagreement on this subject. Rachel McAdams also does great, especially in scenes in which she is interviewing specific victims of the priest molestation. She almost seems like a nurse or a mother figure, letting these people know that it's okay that this happened, and that they aren't responsible.<br/><br/>Tom McCarthy also does a great job behind that camera. I believe it's safe to say that this film is near perfectly directed, say for a few wide shots of characters running through the streets of Boston; these can look a bit sketchy at times. However, all other directing looks amazing, and very clean. There's a particular shot in the movie that is of a character walking through a neighborhood, looking for a certain house. One on going shot lasts about 30 seconds, and captures the entire walk he goes for, and this is just one example.<br/><br/>The last great thing I'll mention is the message this film puts across: this can't happen again. Much like a little 1993 film called Schindler's List, the entire theme of this film is the prevention of the circumstances shown throughout the movie. We simply can't allow these events to ever take place again, whether you be talking about the molestation, or the cover up of it.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with the film was a very small, nitpicky issue. The sour length of the second act. As the first act leads into the second, it does so smoothly, and feels like a clean transition. However, towards the end of the second act, the film begins to go a bit slower, and feels overlong. Once the third act kicks into play, this factor completely disappears, but was still present during the second act, making the film feel a bit longer than it is.<br/><br/>Overall, Spotlight is an amazing film, worthy of it's best picture win, thanks to it's great directs, hard-hitting theme, and the absolutely terrific acing. I'm going to give Spotlight an A, or a 9 out of 10."

","Spotlight is based off of the true story of when a newspaper company decides to take the story of a Catholic priest molesting children and investigates it to score a big story for their paper. It won best picture of 2015, and I'm happy to say that it was very deserving of that award. While I don't think it's the best movie of the year, I'm happy that a solid movie like this won. <br/><br/>The plot of Spotlight is very well-executed. I took a break while watching this movie to get something to eat, and I was preparing my food as quickly as possible. I wanted to get back to this movie so bad. Sure, it's a little bit slower at the beginning, but it's not boring at all or anything, and as soon as it takes off, it soars. The pacing in this movie is fantastic, made all the better by how good the story is. Part of the reason why it's so engaging is because of how crazy the story is. The fact that this all happened and probably still is is hard to believe, and that makes it all the more interesting. Tom McCarthy made the right choice in making a movie about this particular topic, otherwise it probably wouldn't have been as interesting. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty good. Through regular dialogue we get a good sense of who they are, without going too in-depth into their pasts and experiences and all that stuff. While it does work to do that, in a movie like this it really isn't important. Nobody cares what happened when you were a child, unless you were molested by a priest of course. The dialogue is realistic and the characters are realistic as well. <br/><br/>Overall Spotlight is a great movie. While I wouldn't say that it's perfect, it's very well done, and I can see anyone saying that this is a perfect movie. In the end I would certainly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone."

","A really great, slow-burn investigative piece that pays fealty to classics of the genre like All the President's Men. It's been a while since I've seen a picture with this much grit, restraint and respect for the story, and that makes the last half-hour feel transcendent, even if it's also strikingly bittersweet. Michael Keaton is excellent in another Best Picture winner, his second in as many years, and Mark Ruffalo shows tremendous passion and fire in a major ensemble effort. There's nothing flashy or indulgent about Spotlight, a rarity nowadays, and that vacancy leaves room for us to observe and appreciate the difficult, compounded, thankless efforts of these masters of their profession. It's also, often, a stark reminder that 2001 (where the movie is set) wasn't just yesterday. The world has changed fundamentally over the past fifteen years, and it's staggering how often this comes across, effectively, as a period piece. Essential viewing for a wide variety of reasons."

","Spotlight, the movie that won the academy award for best picture at The Oscars is an important film that focuses on a subject that needed to be addressed, The sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Based on a true story, the movie is about the Boston Globe newspaper's ""Spotlight"" team that broke the news story about the sex abuse scandal in the Boston Archdiocese. Since the story broke in 2002 the investigation led to the resignation of Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston as well as leading to reform in not only Boston, but the entire Catholic church as well. The actors in this film are first rate, led by Michael Keaton as editor Walter ""Robby"" Robertson, the story centers on the reporters working through sources and talking to abuse survivors. In an Ironic twist, the reporters investigating the story are catholic themselves and are disgusted by the story. One performance I really enjoyed was Mark Ruffalo as Mike Rezendes, Mark delivers a powerful performance and even though he was nominated for best supporting actor for the role, he tragically didn't win. Spotlight is a powerful movie. The true story not only exposed the scandal, but led to new standards in the church to reporting Priest abusers and new rules to protecting children. It was a dark time in the city of Boston but it was a story that needed to be told and here is hoping the Catholic church see to it that this never happens again 10/10 stars."

We gotta show people that nobody can get away with this; Not a priest, or a cardinal or a freaking pope!""<br/><br/>When Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) screams these lines to his boss Robby (Michael Keaton) you can almost feel the pain, anger and fear that is rushing through his veins at that moment. That is what happens when you are a true journalist who gets involved with the story he does, and especially when it is about 90 priests of the 'Holy' Catholic Church molesting hundreds of kids in Boston in the daylight.<br/><br/>Spotlight stands on the shoulders of its brilliant cast helmed by Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton, with flawless supporting stands from Rachel McAdams, Stanley Tucci, Liev Schreiber and Brian d'Arcy James.<br/><br/>The music and editing is impeccable. Tom McCarthy responsibly brings out the best from the entire team. I especially liked the way the ad hominem tone gradually transmutated into a single agenda to stand up against the entire institution. This is what the ethics of journalism should be all bout. The journalists of the 2001 Spotlight team are undoubtedly iconic figures in the field and Spotlight pays a humble tribute in letting the world know about what they did. It isn't surprising that many people are unaware of this movie before the Oscar win. I watched it just before Oscar and re-watched it again. There were simply too many moments to ponder upon. This is a movie with a limited scope in its locations and themes but every casual dialogue seems to remind you of the deep shadow lurking behind religion. <br/><br/>There is a scene where Brian d'Arcy James posts a warning notice on his fridge for his kids. It is haunting once you think what a father goes through amidst all this. Content in its compact yet powerful produce, Spotlight is the best film 2015 has produced. And I am sorry but I think that the Best Supporting Actor Oscar should have gone to Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>""How do you say no to God?"""

","What most journalistic movies have in common is a large number of characters and a lengthy chain of events which make the story really difficult to follow. And since the drama is mostly formed by dialogues, a boring movie is what audience expect from this genre. Take for instance a movie like Zodiac (2007) . It's all good and everything but at times I felt I needed a pen and a paper to make some notes of who is who in the movie. Luckily the writers of Spotlight have done a good job in this case.<br/><br/>It too has a lot of characters but we see most of them more than once and they are mostly introduced well so the audience will have a little problem with identifying the characters. Moreover, the story line is also fairly easy to follow; side stories are not too many and they contribute to the body of the drama. There are also smooth references to its own scenes detecting which can be really enjoyable for the audience. ' Rotten apple' is a good example of this. Or when we see Patrick playing with his kid in a playground.<br/><br/>The movie ends when the whole thing starts. All the work the characters were doing bears fruit and the moment the struggle is going the start, screen turns black and a list of cities in which the same phenomenon was observed appears. And it's an exhaustive list; as shocking as the long list of priests in the movie. I guess the makers of Spotlight hoped they started some sort of movement. When audience is sitting there with a light shining on a very sensitive issue and then they are given the torch to look around in darkness for themselves and gain the kind of awareness they had turned a blind eye on for years.<br/><br/>There is also a documentary called Deliver us from evil (2006) on the same topic which takes the audience to a new level of shock and devastation. See a priest confessing to molesting children nonchalantly and gives you an absolute chill. Having seen that and then this one I thought a documentary would have been a better medium to put the message of the movie across. In other words why dramatizing the whole thing when the reality is more dreadful than a feature film."

","In the DVD version of ""Spotlight,"" there is a fascinating bonus segment where we meet the actual Boston Globe reporters whose groundbreaking story of pedophilia within the Catholic church is the subject of this film.<br/><br/>It is not only interesting to learn more about these journalists, but also to hear their own accounts of their research into the case. At the close of the bonus clip, one of the reporters relates that he felt that their efforts were ""on the side of the angels"" in raising awareness and bringing the truth to light for so many of the victims.<br/><br/>As a film, ""Spotlight"" is comparable to the journalistic thriller ""All the President's Men,"" which tells the backstory of the two famous Washington Post reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, who broke the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. One of the strengths of ""Spotlight"" is how the characters of the reporters are individualized. From Liev Shreiber's mild-mannered, soft-spoken editor to Mark Ruffalo's driven, hyperkinetic reporter to Rachel McAdams's thoughtful, intelligent character to Michael Keaton's quirky head of the Spotlight group, the characters were fully realized.<br/><br/>It is especially Keaton's role of Robby Robinson that is integral to one of the film's most successful subplots: the incompetence and myopic work of the Boston Globe staff itself for failing to report the story when they essentially had all of the evidence in their possession for years. Without giving away the ending, it is Keaton's character who holds the key to this important strand of the film that deals with journalistic integrity.<br/><br/>For acting, directing, and screen writing, ""Spotlight"" is a remarkable collaborative effort. In viewing this film, one can only wonder how many other untold investigative stories never found their way to the light of the public. In one of the bonus segments, the film's director points out how journalism today is turning news into entertainment and that are not even reporters covering state legislatures today. The film focuses on the importance of journalism at the local level, which led to the successful efforts of the Boston Globe that discovered both the enormity of the child abuse cases, but the scope of the cover-up. <br/><br/>This was an extremely thoughtful and provocative film that is deserving of the recognition it has received. This film truly merits its place in the spotlight."

","Formidable representation of true facts recounted in a poignant manner. One of the few movies of the year that actually have a meaningful background that captivates the spectator and denounces major issues of society that are kept concealed by certain institutions.It is also made clear that these issues have a cause and can be dealt with and should not be normalized. The script also clears the fact that there is no link to the faith itself but is due to the irresponsibility of man-made institutions.The remarkable tenacity of the journalists is also underlined in their battle against an untouchable institution in the name of justice. A slight critic would be the strong accent which in some moments may be misunderstood, also the large number of names which are expressed are sometimes confusing.

The movie met expectations.<br/><br/>The direction in spotlight was really interesting. Throughout the film it provided a sturdy understanding of the right and the wrong. It really helped you understand that this whole thing was a political war and these weren't big city people they were normal families being defended. It left you impacted by what was happening. The camera angles in the film were great and different. The screenplay for this movie I thought was great and one of my favourites this year. The script for the film was very life like, had a lot of heavy moments and the story never had any spare boring time that could've been cut.<br/><br/>The soundtrack in the film was pretty good. It gave the emotions of the film more power specifically tension, big reveals, mystery and the characters thoughts.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was the right casting for Robby Robinson. Keaton played the subtle man of his character very well but also could be a leader really well. Rachel McAdams gave one of her best performances as Sasha Pfeiffer. McAdams played her determined character so well and I felt it got her out of her comfort zone to something new. Mark Ruffalo played Mike Rezendes very well and also gave one of his best performances ever. He transformed into this character so well with his physicality and speech for the whole film and never left character. Screiber brought an excellent performance that was constant and interesting, Slattery did well but not amazing, Tucci brought another great performance and brought the movie back sometimes and d'Arcy James gave another very good one too.

","Journalists around us a somewhat deluded epic film that we love to remember in times of discouragement. New Moon (1940) and The Front Page (1974) remind us, even now, how bright and cynics (kindhearted) we can become. All the President's Men tells us about the meaning of all this. Much of what we do not unmask presidents, no; but if he is honest and does the job, with that it is enough for us. Although, evoking films to boost the morale, nothing like the fourth power (1952), Richard Brooks. Especially when the rotary is put to work: the roar of truth. Well, that sound of printed paper machines and also resonates in the Spotlight effective. But when it comes we are not so innocent: we have a broader and less heroic vision of journalism.<br/><br/>In that sense, Spotlight, Tom McCarthy of which already talked about the same in the series The Wire- is superior to all the above films. A work to the glory of daily work. Would fail to reflect the many hours on the computer, but then it would be dirty realism, and Spotlight takes more air and judicial thriller film. It tells the story -based on real events of a group of journalists from the Boston Globe, which revealed how the church had covered pedophile cases. Yes, the Boston church is not the Mafia or send assassins. There is nothing of that; as nothing in the making of the film called exaggeration or excess. We are facing a proposal details resulting from a tremendous effectiveness. Nor we find any deep throat or secret dossiers. Only traces of a conspiracy involving many, and some journalists tired, played with conviction.<br/><br/>Although more than priests and journalists, speaks Spotlight something that corrodes the truth from within: the blind spots; the camel in the middle of the room that nobody sees, not even veteran journalists. The truth is out there, it is true, and Spotlight reminds us what it takes to conquer. And who, in the end, takes care of it ...<br/><br/>Another movie against discouragement"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 2001, the Boston Globe received a lead on a child sex abuse scandal that concerned priests in the Catholic church. The ensuing investigation revealed that the accusations weren't limited to just one or two individuals, but in fact spanned many victims over many years around many parts of the globe. Journalists Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfieffer (Rachel McAdams) and Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) and their editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery) risk the wrath of some very powerful people to bring the truth to light and expose an earth shattering truth.<br/><br/>Spotlight arrives at a time that is quite darkly fitting for its subject matter, certainly on these shores, with a recent report stating that sexual abuse of minors is widespread in a variety of different institutions, including schools, churches, the entertainment industry, care homes and political establishments, that has unmasked an horrific reality behind entities that we took for granted, and always assumed were beyond that sort of indecency. It also highlighted why investigative journalism is so important, and what consequences limiting freedom of the press could have.<br/><br/>An all star cast head up the production, including come-back kid Michael Keaton, as the more mature, middle aged member of the group, and Liev Schreiber in a similarly considered role. It's actually Ruffalo who takes centre stage, as one of the main reporters, that will probably divide some opinion. Maybe he's just a little too fixated, laying it on a little too thick and grabbing everything, doing things too intently and coming at people like he's about to attack them, that his performance seems a little hammy. But equally, you could say it's passionate and intense, what makes a role like this work.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem to have lasted long at UK cinemas, not surprising when you consider this is the sort of intelligent, considered fare that doesn't come out so much nowadays. But all the same, that's exactly what it is, on a similar theme to All The President's Men forty years ago and equally as shattering in its conclusion. ****"

"mrblacktip","9","0","0","17 February 2016"," Spotlight: Scariest Movie Not Labeled Horror
","A good one-word description for Spotlight would be ""unadulterated"". As with many films in the drama genre it is typical for some amount of ""crowd pleasing"" romance, action, side plot, or pacing/climatic build to be included that can have little to do with the actual plot as a means to entice the average minded audience member. That is not the case with this film: Spotlight appears to be very strict; holding to what actually happened with minimal embellishments and ""hollywoodizations"" to make it more ""fun"" for the viewers. It very straightforward like tells the story of how a team of journalists uncovered huge amounts of child molestation and cover up within the Catholic Church, and that's it. No clichéd montage that makes tedious work appear enticing, no stupid love triangle to make it more exciting, and no typical 3 Act screenplay in which you can predict the outcome of every scene with an exciting build in the last 30 minutes. Don't misunderstand me and think that this film is boring and approaches the story from an apathetic viewpoint. This film is very exciting and passionately and brings the story to life in a well-balanced and paced way that makes the viewers want to weep and question mankind's morality. <br/><br/>Everyone knows that the catholic church is famous for having priests getting to cozy with altar boys and such but few of us actually think about how awful that is, how awful it is that it is so widely covered up, and how awful the long term consequences (for the victim) of the actions are. Spotlight gets down to the nitty gritty with unabashedly frank sexual dialogue so as to not sugar coat the situations, impassioned performances by the cast, and incredible writing with character development that takes a turn into questioning human morality. <br/><br/>I grew up always hearing the cliché of Priests and Altar Boys but it was not until I saw this movie that I realized the extent too which this has occurred. Spotlight makes the viewer very aware of the systemic problem within the Catholic Church with a very gradual build in the plot. I never felt that any part of the movie was rushed; on the contrary it takes its time so as to not gloss over anything or to presume the audience knows the story already nor did it ever feel like it was dragging or moving to slow either. It is haunting and keeps you on the edge of your seat as you wait to see what next turned leaf will reveal making you feel like a detective or investigative journalist yourself by just watching the film. On a personal level, in one of my jobs we had to be trained in recognizing the signs of sexual abuse in children and the behaviors of predators and it was amazing how much the film got right when it comes to the behaviors of predators and ""grooming"" their victims which is said by one of the victims in the movie. When it comes to child abuse, it's not stranger danger you have to worry about so much, it is the friend you thought you could trust, and the movie presents just that situation. Who wouldn't trust a man of God to mentor their child? It is down right terrifying. <br/><br/>It is very difficult to say anything about this film from a technical standpoint because of the amount of emotion that it evokes and distracts you with. I honestly can't remember a darned thing about the camera work, the music, or the editing. I was completely absorbed in the recreation of the Boston Globe in the early 2000s as if I was there, and I hope that was the aim of the director and producers. In a sense it is the complete opposite of ""The Revenant"" and ""Mad Max"" which slap you in the face and command that you notice the technical aspects of their creation. Spotlight commands that you acknowledge the horrendous acts that have been committed and think deeply about what you as an individual can do to make the world a better place. A scene toward the end when Keaton's character starts asking ""Why didn't we do anything sooner, everyone knew?"" was hard hitting and makes you think about what situations you might be looking the other way. <br/><br/>Terrific film. Terrific Script. Great Acting. Scary as hell."

This piece is assigned to Spotlight, Boston Globe's investigative journalism team. The team is headed by Walter 'Robby' Robinson (Michael Keaton) along with team members Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams), and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy James). With the help of righteous attorney Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) and various other members of the judicial circle and forthcoming victims, Spotlight uncovers how the Boston Catholic church community has been systematically covering up child-molesting priests who intentionally target victims of disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The story unfolds as a trivial column on the Boston Globe catches the eye of the new editor. Step by step, we are invited to join this adventure by following the main characters. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding in this film. From make up to temperament, he nails the stubbornness and instability of a relentless reporter. Keaton's charm and sharp industry-sense as a seasoned team head and reporter are also mesmerizing. The scene where he confronts attorney and friend with tears glistening in his eyes is testament to his (and to a certain extent his team's) mixed feelings towards exposing the church. What does this say about them to let this story slip under their radars for so long? What does the exposure mean about them as Catholics? Rachael McAdams still feels very ""Rachael-y,"" compared to Ruffalo and Keaton who completely leave their personal identities and previous roles (Hulk and Birdman, respectively) behind. Tom McCarthy's directing and script writing bring life to the characters. Every frown to every ""fuck"" draws us closer to the struggles of these mortals.<br/><br/>The story is well crafted with an undercurrent of fear, insecurity and a feverous pursuit of justice. The cinematography is clean and simple -- which is perfect, to contrast the intensity effusing in the journalism industry. The only point that nags me is the pristine conditions of the props. Crisp folders, smooth booklets, unwrinkled sheets, glossy leather couches, lack of coffee stains... all speak against tear and wear that come naturally with time and the hecticness associated with the journalism industry.<br/><br/>Don't expect any plot twist or foreshadowing of events -- this movie is basically a slightly dramatized account of a true story. The movie owes its impact factor to convincing acting and captivating topic. Splendid. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a captivating true story. You'll have a great time watching how the events unfold!"

The team comes upon several obstacles, from the more or less disguised opposition of the Church members to occultation attempts by lawyers who took part in private and half secret settlements between some victims and the hierarchy, passing through occultation of important documentary evidence (not only by lawyers) and the resistance of some victims to talk about their cases. Everything is shown in this movie in an almost documentary style with great fluidity and dynamism and very elucidative of what has really happened since this was a real case."

","There really isn't anything bad about Spotlight. From top to bottom, this movie was done very well. There is an all star cast, the story is beyond interesting, and the feel is just right for this type of movie.<br/><br/>Its hard to point at one actor as the best since the entire cast worked well together. All of the performances were very authentic and real. Personally, I thought Mark Ruffalo was the best out of a great cast.<br/><br/>The story was great even though we all know the outcome. Most biographical movies tell the story we know, which can be boring. Spotlight finds a way to keep the viewers attention as it presents information during opportune times of the movie.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so good is the authenticity. Watching this movie didn't seem forced, as the storyline and acting came across like the viewer was actually there watching the events unfold. There was a very ""real"" feel to how Spotlight was put together.<br/><br/>This was a very good movie, as everything was done well. I didn't love Spotlight, but that doesn't mean it wasn't done really well. I'm not as interested in the subject matter as some. Spotlight is definitely one of the better movies of the year, and is worth a watch. 7/10"
"dsody","9","0","0","9 February 2016"," A great film, that focuses on the story!
","This was a good movie, but I agree with other reviewers that it's not for everyone.<br/><br/>First of all, it may be boring if you aren't interested in the actual story. Some movies focus on acting, an amazing soundtrack, special effects, drama, action, comedy, etc. This film didn't really have any one particular thing that stood out to make it fantastic. The main focus was on telling a true story. Don't get me wrong, the acting was great, but it wasn't a film like Birdman where Keaton did an outstanding character performance. Spotlight didn't have any amazing special effects or action scenes, you didn't actually get to see any of the crimes taking place either. It was a movie about reporters unravelling facts that happen years ago. So I can understand how some people would be really bored watching this movie, because it is slow moving. But it's a good movie because it's story that needs to be told.<br/><br/>One important point that I wanted to make is that I felt the movie didn't have an anti-Catholic agenda. I have read some of the other reviews on this site and I didn't feel that the movie was trying to discredit the Catholic faith in anyway. It was just trying to show the tragedy of what happened. I didn't leave the theatre thinking, ""I hate the Catholic faith,"" or whatever. If you are interested in the story, give the film a shot. It's a good movie and worth watching."

","There's no slowing down with the excellent films out in the early part of 2016 and here we have an Oscar Nominated film based on the true story of the Boston Global discovering the huge cover up of child molestation within the Catholic Church, a hugely controversial and sobering subject.<br/><br/>After a brief scene from 1974 the film takes us to 2001 where the Boston Globe's Spotlight team are charged with investigating the allegation of historical sexual abuse by a Catholic priest on a minor. The whole story is gripping but you can't help feeling saddened that this could have been allowed to go on and worse still denied, covered up and families paid off by the Catholic Church. It's unbelievably flabbergasting.<br/><br/>The actors here are superbly cast, each delivering a sterling performance but a special nod has to go to Michael Keaton who, since his resurgence in Birdman, has found his former glory and is on outstanding form here. I'm also a big fan of Mark Ruffalo and whilst initially finding his performance uncomfortable it grew on me and by the end appreciated how much individuality and passion he brings to his role. Also worth mentioning Liev Schreiber (playing Marty Baron, the editor) who whilst isn't that well known delivers an brilliant performance, I'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his future roles.<br/><br/>Overall it's a superb film covering an extremely saddening topic and as the credits role you do feel somewhat shocked at the extent of the abuse and the lengths the Catholic Church have gone to cover it up. It's not going to be for everyone, I imagine some people would rather just not know, but if you're remotely interested then it's definitely worth seeing."

","The classic investigative journalism story isn't an easy sell. By necessity, they're talky, dense as molasses, and too subdued to make for any splashy awards-bait performances - even your average courtroom drama allows for some passionate Oscar-clip shoutiness. And yet, there are cases where the story itself is the headliner, too important to exploit or trivialize for any gains other than its own integrity. Naturally, it's a message that Tom McCarthy's Spotlight takes to heart, and the film's performance in the awards circuit shows that - more often than not - trimmings or not, hard to watch or not, people can handle the truth. <br/><br/>This is all not to say that Spotlight is a dull, thanklessly dour watch. Of course, the horrifically grim subject matter colours the timbre of the story, and McCarthy treads carefully in neither drifting into tacky, unwarranted tangential church-bashing or fetishizing the suffering of the victims (no tasteless, feverish rape flashbacks here, a- la The Lovely Bones, thank goodness). Instead, he is wise enough to take a page out of his reporter protagonists' notebooks, and stick to the immediate, pressing facts. The result is a lean, taut potboiler, which clips along at a brisk pace without a lick of fat on it. Tangents? Expansive character backstories? Cinematic flourishes, or passionate monologuing? All ruthlessly trimmed with the same dismissive grunt of ""adjectives"" Liev Schreiber's editor mutters while reviewing the final story. It's a bold and entirely appropriate tactic to functionally ride along with the Boston Globe Spotlight team step by painstaking step of the investigation, keeping even the most mundane activities pulsing with urgency (never before have interludes of archival library research been so gripping). Crucially, McCarthy understands that his piece, like the Spotlight team's, is an educational exposé first and foremost, and the script is immaculately laid out and crisply comprehensible, spelling out the facts, fears, and controversies of the case as indisputable rhetorical whammy. Comparisons to All the President's Men are inevitable, and far from unwarranted. <br/><br/>What is a shame, upon reflection, are the occasional downsides to being confined by McCarthy's 'we know what they know' mantra. Spotlight consciously avoids the bloat of cinematic diatribes like Oliver Stone's JFK by ruthlessly paring down, but the cutting room trimmings are fascinating and rich enough cobble together an entire other film out of. The psychological dimension of the social epidemic of pedophiliac priests is hit the hardest. Root causes are alluded to through phone interviews with a 'Deep Throat' style clergy psychologist, but ultimately dropped, just as our glimpses of survivor stories are included only insofar as they provide quantifiable testimonies for the feature. Particularly uncanny is McAdams' reporter unexpectedly ending up face-to-face with an abusive priest, who nonchalantly admits his misdemeanours, and begins to explain his paradoxical rational before he is shooed offscreen, his plot thread never to be rekindled. McCarthy's firm artistic mandate validates these exclusions by concentrating on starting, rather than completing, a conversation on such crucial social issues, but clipping exhibitions of trauma for more clinical evidence occasionally threatens to sideline the human resonance of the story. It's telling that Spotlight's high point is when Stanley Tucci's bulldog of a human rights lawyer actually, for the first time in the film, interacts with children, his energy radically transforming from grim to jubilant and charismatic. It's a beautifully tragic moment, and is crucial in reinforcing the hard realities of why the story is so abominable in the first place. <br/><br/>The ensemble cast work as an impressively cohesive, subdued unit. All are utterly spectacular, with nary a wobbly or excessively showboating link among them. Of course, each bring their own flavour - the scientifically impossible-to-dislike Mark Ruffalo's twitchy peppiness turned passionate dogmatism contributes the affable emotional heart, the endlessly nuanced Michael Keaton's contemplatively stoic editor brings the calm centre, while Rachel McAdams' persistently meticulous fact-checker inwardly aches without a single crack forming. Impressively, no named characters outside of the clergy are superficially coloured as 'bad' - Schreiber - magnetic as always - propels the plot through quiet, resolute persistence as John Slattery cathartically fusses and curses around him, while the perennially wonderful Tucci sneakily, grumpily toils in the background and threatens to walk away with the picture. Even Billy Crudup's oily lawyer furtively admits surprising, sympathetic depth. You know you're in comparatively objective territory when<br/><br/>Spotlight is vital viewing not only for its thorough coverage of its subject matter, but for how respectfully it avoids emotionally fetishizing or obfuscating the integrity of its story. If the only major complaint pertains to the questions McCarthy leaves unanswered, the film should be considered equally commendable for lighting the fire under viewers to undertake their own side investigations appropriately, and thereby preventing the still distressingly common abuse in the church from again drifting into uncomfortable, shameful silence. If nothing else, in an era where cinema and news media alike constantly run the threat of being swamped by sensationalism, the triumphant revitalization of such meticulously gripping, no-nonsense storytelling, let alone such an enjoyably old-fashioned-y newspaper drama, should be championed and cherished. Never before has a room full of haggard people frenziedly answering their phones served as such a triumphant parable to dogged persistence, or quality, meticulous reporting. <br/><br/>-9/10"

","Another watch on my journey through the Oscar nominees. Spotlight according to IMDb is about:<br/><br/>""The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.""<br/><br/>This movie is stunning. Plain and simple. It's a very simple film, focusing primarily around the journalists at the Boston Globe, but it is still a movie that, more than once, knocked the wind out of me. The story is disturbing and occasionally unfathomable, and yet the film handles it with a surprising level of tact and restraint, while still communicating the story without being ""safe"".<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo is the shining star of the movie, there is no doubt in my mind that he deserves his Oscar for the performance he gives. The man is so much more than The Hulk, and this proves it. The rest of the cast do fantastic jobs throughout, perhaps the most surprising (at least for me) was Liev Schreiber. I sometimes forget what a strong performer he is, and this movie reminded me. While those two stood out, there's no denying that the entire cast delivers strong, and genuine performances throughout. You feel some genuine anger and heartbreak coming through, and given the subject matter that's no surprise.<br/><br/>Again the movie is simple, but effective and extremely well paced. It doesn't feel like a two hour movie, and it delivers an incredible and deep story from start to finish.<br/><br/>There's not much more that I want to say about this, except to recommend it wholeheartedly. The performances are great, the story is fascinating and infuriating, and it's not one to be missed this year.<br/><br/>The movie is nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Editing, Best Directing, Best Supporting Actor (Mark Ruffalo), and Best Supporting Actress (Rachael McAdams).<br/><br/>As well, in the interest of consistency, I kept an eye on the total number of speaking characters in this movie who are not cisgendered, white, straight men, who offer any kind of significant plot progression. In the case of Spotlight sits at one, being Rachael McAdams, though her character has the smallest presence in the film. Something to think about."

All these child molestation cases with the church involved. Sure this brought to me a lot of psychological questions regarding clergy and the reasons why such acts happened actually. Anyway the writing was very good, powered by good performances of the main characters especially Mark Ruffalo and Micheal Keaton. The movie was a moving one. The pace was quite good but after all I think there's more much work that could have been done especially in directing. The drama needed to be more deep. We needed more focus on the victims and their feelings. We needed more focus on the main characters reactions to the whole thing, we saw every one is rushing to get some evidence or meet some one but not sufficient time was given to focus on the idea itself of the story. The idea of the church supporting these acts and also the idea of how can a good journalism work help people and society.

","Spotlight is a film about how journalists at The Boston Globe uncovered the harrowing abuse of young boys and girls by Catholic priests. This shocking film represents storytelling at its finest. Nothing is glorified in this film. These journalists are not some sort of just action-figures that go around locking up bad people. They are portrayed as very real individuals, from their workplace attire to their emotions when dealing with various people. Everything is presented in deplorable realism, which really emphasises how appalling this story really is. This film contains an all-star cast, and it is safe to say that all of the performances are very good. They all understood the importance of a realistic portrayal when dealing with a story like this. Mark Ruffalo's performance was a personal favourite, but in this ensemble cast, there were no performances that triumphed another's. This film may not be for everyone. It is basically 2-hours of conversation between various people, and so it may not meet the standards of those expecting Michael Bay-esque explosions and car chases between the Boston Globe and the Church. This film really shocked me, and will be very controversial for many. A lot of characters in the film put importance on 'telling the story right'. The same goes for this film, it needed to be told right if the message was to be given across effectively and I have no doubt in my mind that this story was told in a faultless manner, securing this film as one of my 2015 favourites."

","There's a fine long tradition of films centred around newspaper investigations, going all the way back to THE FRONT PAGE in 1931 (which started as a stage play in the 1920s). SPOTLIGHT is at least as good as 1976's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, the film most of us remember. The Boston Globe's revelations were clearly the Catholic Church's 'Watergate moment'.The script makes the Boston diocese and its archbishop the chief 'villains' in removing (and re-assigning) the offending priests; I wondered why there wasn't more speculation about just how high in the clerical food-chain the decisions to protect the Church's 'good name' were taken.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton get top honours in the credits, but this is very much an 'ensemble' piece and I'm not sure any of the actors deserve to be singled out. Rachel McAdams is particularly good as the one dogged female in the team of Boston Globe journalists, and Billy Crudup is very convincing as a sleazy lawyer who's made a killing from out-of-court settlements between the diocese and some of the victims. Although their appearances are brief I would also applaud the men who play the victims, now adults but all still haunted by the abuse they suffered as children and teenagers (many were driven to alcohol, drugs, some even to suicide). <br/><br/>Top marks to the writers and the director who have turned this grim and sordid story into a nail-biting thriller; I hope the awards season doesn't overlook them in favour of movies with big-name star turns. This is definitely my favourite of the pictures nominated for gongs this winter."

","The opening is flat and not well paced. It came to life ten or fifteen minutes in with the first appearance of Billy Crudup as the trial lawyer Eric Macleish, who gave this film a much-needed jolt of energy.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the film does build, and the more the story unfolds, the more gripping it becomes, and seemingly, Tom McCarthy's direction improves, too. The performances are all very good, the writing is solid, and the production design is admirable. I don't see Mark Ruffalo's work as Oscar-worthy, which is not to knock it. I thoroughly appreciate the way the performances are underplayed--a performance cannot be more underplayed than Liev Schreiber's, yet that seems right for a character who never shows his cards. It's easy to imagine an approach that has all the reporters emoting heavily as they come to realize the horror of the situation.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson, John Slattery as Ben Bradlee, Billy Crudup as Macleish, Stanley Tucci as Garabidian, Jamey Sheridan as Sullivan, and Len Cariou as Cardinal Law are all outstanding, as are others I'm probably forgetting to mention. The minor parts are cast with actors with faces who look like they belong in Boston, such as Rachel McAdams' grandmother or the woman who plays the priest's sister.<br/><br/>The story is so compelling that I was very glad I had seen it, though a crispness of approach from the beginning, establishing characters from the get-go, would have made the movie even better."

","A controversial message handled in an explicit way that put the audience in a position of full disclosure and believability. I believe it was Rachel McAdams in this film who said 'We're going to tell this story and tell it right'. Well Spotlight, you sure did.<br/><br/>Spotlight's actors were casted extremely well to say the least. Keaton, Ruffalo and Schreiber all provided believable and intense characters that each had very distinct personas and had me invested in the story. McAdams played her role well and provided a high level of refreshment as a female character who isn't fuelling the audience through sexual desire or relying on the power of a man. She's a professional in business clothing with an intellectual job and an admirable level of confidence. Hopefully her Oscar nomination will give some well needed exposure to a character who is an excellent female role mode.. I'm not going to be sour and cry about the fact that Keaton was snubbed, however. Keaton was snubbed. Dammit. <br/><br/>Spotlight is not just a story played out by actors, it's a 'film'. The subject matter at hand is extremely controversial in itself, so it wouldn't have been a hard task to take the screenplay and turn it into movie that didn't require much film making. Luckily, Tom McCarthy is a lot better than Adam Sandler and this wasn't the case. <br/><br/>As I could write an entire dissertation on the film making in question, I will boil it down to three simple points. Cinematography, editing and score. The cinematography, though no major scoping landscapes fits perfectly with the film, contrasted the chaotic investigative scenes with hand-held camera-work and the concrete efficient work environment's with static documentary style setups. The editing keeps up a great pace for a movie that could easily have turned into a blur of information without the right creative choices; edits were not done for the sake of it, they enhanced the elements of each scene. Finally, the movies score, composed by the ever brilliant Howard Shore, is both energetic and intense, keeping the audience's senses in tune with whats happening in each scene. <br/><br/>I loved Spotlight.

","Based on the true story of how reporters at the Boston Globe shone a light on a culture of covering up child abuse in the Catholic Church, 'Spotlight' tells an interesting slice of modern history. It is remarkably riveting given that the outcome is well known as the film places us in the shoes of the reporters, unaware of just how a big a story they have. The film shows the emotional toll that the investigation has on the reporters; one wrestles with whether to tell his neighbours after discovering a possible predator priest living in his neighbourhood. Mark Ruffalo has the flashiest performance as the angriest reporter on the team, and the film gets some good thrills out of his struggles against bureaucracy to obtain incriminating public documents, yet Michael Keaton delivers the film's finest performance. As a born and bred Boston citizen, he finds himself internally divided and has some excellent moments near the end as he reveals a shocking twist about himself. The choice to focus on the reporters to almost the exclusion of the victims renders the film an odd experience though; the reporters seem more disgusted by the corruption of the Church than the actions of their priests and the psychological impact of child abuse. Never to mind, the characters are interesting enough that the film works as a tale of the power of a few motivated individuals to take on an institution and make a difference. Director Tom McCarthy uses gradual zooms in and out in all the office scenes to smartly prevent the film from feeling static and Howard Shore places the icing on the cake with yet another powerful score."

","I grew up fully aware of priests praying on children, which is probably why I've always seen priests as human beings not gods. They are men who are priests, like other men are writers, teachers, or scientists. But I was still dumbfounded by Spotlight. The scale of it might be small, if you take into account that Boston is just one city, but the size of what was going is impressive. So many people, boys and girls, our cousins, brothers, or aunts were molested as kids and paid off for their trouble. Left to live with a burden and a secret that could eat them alive. Like they've made a point of doing in the movie it's a systemic thing. They protect their own and actually have the guts to cover crimes if that keeps their image clean.<br/><br/>Six years ago, I met two priests who I knew full well were having sex - with adults obviously - and it didn't phase me one bit. I even kept their secrets, heck I'm still keeping their secret. So I'm asking myself if I'd be capable of keeping it secret if I knew of a priest or anyone molesting children? I'd like to think I would never but the truth is I don't know. I haven't been put in that situation. I'm talking about this because in the film they didn't vilify the people who knew but kept it a secret. It could have been easy to tear down those lawyers, cops, and parents who kept their mouth shut. Spotlight basically shows how the church and everyone involved let down, the victims and protecting, while not making an argument against religion. It's a movie about people and their actions, not an anti-religion piece.<br/><br/>Spotlight is a great example of what investigative journalism is. The story and the journalists' work is present in a clear and understandable way, it's a lot of information but nothing is dumb down. You're engaged in the investigation, in the work that goes into it, and on the effects it has on the characters. The performances are on point, as good as the script is, you easily believe the authenticity of each character. You see them as real people. A couple of performances stands out, mainly Mark Ruffalo's because his character has some great moments. He seems to be the most affected by their investigation, whereas the other characters look more impartial in contrast.<br/><br/>Like I've tweeted before, Spotlight is the best 2hours I've spent in a theater in the last 6months.<br/><br/>By @garcwrites"

In Spotlight's case it was a group of dedicated reporters that blew the lid off of the Boston Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal that rocked an entire institution to its core. Michael Rezendes (Ruffalo), Walter Robinson (Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer (McAdams) and Matt Carol (d'Arcy) were those reporters and Spotlight is their story to bring the scandal to press.<br/><br/>The story is not altogether a very glamorous one. The offices of the Spotlight team (the oldest investigative journalism team in the country) resembles the opaque basement bullpen of a third rate claims adjustment outfit. There are mountains of paper scattered atop shrinking desks anchored by outdated computers. All the reporters who call this office home are locals, well versed in Red Sox trivia, where to get the best pizza, and have had experiences growing up with the Church's influence. So when new Head Editor, and admitted outsider Marty Baron (Schreiber) asks Spotlight to investigate allegations of sexual abuse in the church, you can imagine their apprehension. That apprehension is overstated at first by Assistant Managing Editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (Slattery), then the victims start coming in and the Church starts to take notice.<br/><br/>Many movies about large conspiracies unravel in a hyperbolic web of conceits. This is immediately followed by the perfunctory veiled threat on the part of the conspirators. Yet here, the plot is deliberate and very interested in the small salient details that define newspaper journalism at its best. ""This strikes me as an essential story for a local paper,"" says the pensive Baron as he finally convinces Robinson to take the story and run with it. It is at that moment we as the audience feel the necessity of their actions and their ink; they write the story because locals are in the best position to do so and if they don't no one else will.<br/><br/>There are also no veiled threats on the part of the church yet we still feel their looming influence in nearly every scene. Every time one of the Globes reporters is gumshoeing on the streets we always see a steeple somewhere in the background. When Baron meets the infamous Cardinal Law (Cariou) in his estate office you feel the man's affluence as everything is tinged with an auburn hue and seemingly dipped in gold. The offices of the Globe is filled with lapsed Catholics yet everywhere in their personal lives there are hints of the Church's influence on their upbringing. Pfeiffer makes a habit of going to Church on Sunday with her mother, Rezendes always assumed he could go back to the fold and be accepted with open arms, Robinson himself was the product of a Catholic School education, a fact that is thrown in his face when the story's deadline looms. All have a crisis of faith not just in Catholicism but faith in humanity. When Carol realizes one the psychology centers for wayward priests resides in his neighborhood he walks down the street and stares down the house with suspicion and contempt.<br/><br/>Then there are the victims. In one pivotal scene Bradlee, is shocked to find there are thirteen innocents that were abused by priests, all of which are still in circulation. It is only later that we even begin to understand the full extent of the damage done lest to say it is far more than thirteen in Boston alone. Besieged Lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Tucci) who specializes in these kinds of unfortunate cases said it best when asked how something like this was allowed to go on for so long. ""If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse them. That's the truth of it.""<br/><br/>Probably the biggest victim in this movie is journalism itself. In a handful of not-so-subtle scenes, director Tom McCarthy hints that the kind of journalism Spotlight does is no longer a fundamental part of journalism today. The Boston Church scandal was the first national news story to break and be covered widely after 9/11 and in the film it feels like a final triumph before investigative reporting packs up and slinks away; replaced by sensationalism and political vitriol. There are still outfits like Spotlight who work silently and make big waves when the time comes yet as paper media dies a slow death, these teams are asked to do twice as much with three times less. We have more means of communication than we ever had in history, yet the sources for the kind of system changing, disruptive information we crave or lacking that need, have become sparse. Here's to hoping change is made soon."

","Such mixed emotions when I saw this film. With incredible performances, the storyline of the movie was incredibly sad. The discussion of sexual misconduct in the Catholic church has really become mainstream the past couple years and this movie really portrayed that. It was really incredible to learn the lengths that the church went to to protect their reputation. It was shocking to me! Stunning performances by Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo, well deserving of their Oscar nominations, really did this challenging story justice. This film was wonderfully well done and eye opening to an important topic.I encourage everyone to see it."

Great cast who in every scene seem to be raising their hand like ""i've got something"", ""i've got something"". On top of that it's an incredible rewrite of the facts. Google it yourself. It was well known long before this that some priests, everywhere, were abusing kids and the church knew about it. The only thing that came out of this investigation was the fact that this one particular diocese had an official policy of covering up the issue. There's no watergate story here. Besides the misrepresentation, there's no movie here. The acting is bland, bland, bland, details hard to follow and no suspense, or conclusion. Like a long out joke with a confusing punchline."

"howard.schumann","9","3","8","22 November 2015"," Reminds us of what investigative journalism used to be
","Except for unrelenting bulldogs like Seymour Hersh (who had to publish his latest article outside of the U.S.), true investigative journalism seems to have become as obsolete as the 8-Track Tape. Tom McCarthy's (""The Cobbler"") Spotlight, however, reminds us of what it was and what it still could be. Set in Boston, the film is named after the Pulitzer Prize winning investigative unit of The Boston Globe which, in the years following 9/11, investigated the abuse of children by parish priests and the link of silence that existed between the Catholic Church and the Boston political and business community. It was a silence that allowed offending priests off the hook for their crimes, being transferred from parish to parish where they often re-offended.<br/><br/>In the film which follows the journalistic procedural style of such classics as ""All the President's Men,"" Michael Keaton (""Birdman"") is Globe Unit Editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson. When the story circulates about the church's kid gloves treatment of molester Father John Goeghan, the paper's editor-in-chief Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber, ""Pawn Sacrifice""), newly arrived from The Miami Herald and not bound by local ""traditions"" or religious loyalties, assigns the Spotlight unit to dig into the story. Robby and his team that consists of reporters Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo, ""Foxcatcher""), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams, ""Southpaw"") and Marty Campbell (Brian d'Arcy James, ""Time Out of Mind""), overseen by deputy managing editor Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery, ""Ant-Man"") set about the nitty-gritty work of tracking down the offending clerics. <br/><br/>Baron, however, wants to expose the systemic corruption in the church, not just individual priests and guns for top church officials such as Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law (Len Cariou, ""Prisoners""). While the case is being built step-by-step, the film shows how some leads go nowhere while others uncover a wider net than imagined. Coming up against the church's stonewalling, documents that have been made unavailable or have strangely disappeared, and a sleazy attorney in the D.A's office (Billy Crudup, ""The Stanford Prison Experiment""), the team reaches out to Phil Saviano (Neal Huff, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") who heads an organization dedicated to supporting abuse victims as well as attorney Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci, ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1"") who represents victims that are suing the church in a class-action lawsuit and is an important source of information. <br/><br/>It is the interviews with the victims arranged by Garabedian that constitute some of the film's most moving moments. Especially touching is the story of Joe, beautifully performed by Michael Cyril Creighton (""Sleeping With Other People""), an openly gay man who looked up to the priest as the representative of God and felt flattered by the cleric's attention and the realization that it was okay to be gay but only later realized the priest's culpable behavior. <br/><br/>One of the film's best lines is when Garabedian, speaking of the agreement within the church to maintain their silence, says, ""If it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a village to abuse one."" Another impactful scene delves into the mindset of one of the offenders. In Pfeiffer's interview of ex-priest Father Ronald Paquin (Richard O'Rourke, ""Ghost Town""), he admits to ""fooling around"" with the boys but says he never derived any pleasure from it.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the boys did not derive much pleasure either. One psychologist claims the priests have remained emotional preadolescence, but this over-generalized speculation does not add much clarity to the debate. As the head of an outstanding ensemble cast, Michael Keaton performance has depth and sensitivity, Ruffalo brilliantly captures the almost obsessively focused dedication of Rezendes, and McAdams is able to astutely demonstrate empathy, allowing the subjects of her interviews to feel safe in expressing their feelings. <br/><br/>McCarthy delivers the story with restraint and a balanced approach, showing the indifference of Globe reporters who sat on pertinent information they had about the scandal many years ago. While Spotlight does not have much style and can drag, the strength of its performances and the clear presentation of its subject matter has a strong impact, allowing us to feel the pain of the children who still suffer the effects of abuse and reminds us that, as Kahlil Gibran put it, ""Safeguarding the rights of others is the most noble and beautiful end of a human being."""

","It seems probable the people with a surname McCarthy are highly not indifferent to any kind of hunting. American director Tom McCarthy, who has the same surname as a U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy, whose notions provoked a whole series of persecution of politicians in 50th, concerned with communism, well-known in history as a «witch- hunt», also arranged a «hunt» together with the collective of his new work, but this time a «priest-hunt».<br/><br/>The film «Spotlight» shows the story of child sexual abuse by catholic priests from the Archdiocese of Boston investigation by journalists of «The Boston Globe» newspaper.<br/><br/>The main task of the film lies in its name «Spotlight» – to light up facts to public. That's exactly how the column what the collective of journalists together with their new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) published the investigation in is called, provoked the immense scandal round the Catholic Church. This story really had a place in the beginning of 2000th and the prepared report brought the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for the newspaper. Some of the journalists who had taken part in the investigation joined to making of the film helping the actors to show their characters better.<br/><br/>But it's not worth while expecting from «Spotlight» the energetic pace braided with feelings boiling and the characters' persuasions. Superfluous runtime and sluggish process of the plot, especially the first 30 minutes, induce in audience only drowse and loss of interest. Pale colors of the editor's office and not much bright journalists' shirts only intensify this process to the Howard Shore's soothing music. Even tears and anger of victims of violence telling their stories to the finders of truth don't take off the fatigue from the quite monotonous dialogs and the characters' emotions.<br/><br/>The only one thing that can give a little impetus to the film is the journalist Michael Rezendes' (Mark Ruffalo) heartfelt cry to his colleagues. Actually the picture doesn't spark interest in the process of developing its events and instead of making the audience root for the «Spotlight» collective success the film only draws a spectator into slow swimming between the lines of clippings and the monotonous dialogs.<br/><br/>The director Tom McCarthy also acted as a journalist given the possibility to audience to learn the element of truth about modern problems of Church. But if you follow the slogan of this picture and really «read between the lines», you may ask yourself: is it right thing that the director had revealed this subject? If Tom McCarthy used material about the sins of some company, as in the Michael Mann's film «The Insider», instead of the story about sinned priests, or materials about common maniacs seducing minors, the film «Spotlight» would look only more colorless and even be more devoid of actuality yet.<br/><br/>The problem of the priests who really perpetrated child abuse is a heavy cross for the whole Catholic Church and rated as a mortal sin and a crime. Such actions of any kind that leave non-vanishing sign in victim's life must be punished. But you shouldn't forget that the Church consists of the same people as any other institution what all the people are also sinned and infirm in. And unfortunately none of us is insured from sins and temptations.<br/><br/>After watching the film a spectator may get the impression about deep viciousness of the whole Church and its hypocritical screen by God's Commandments for the sake of hatching its own interests. Each spectator can endure such a feeling that a journalist Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo) felt, relied on coming some day to church, but after hearing about some clergymen twisted actions, his hope was cracked. That's why exactly this picture can do much harm to audience's faith if it's understood wrong.<br/><br/>You shouldn't brand the whole Church because of some stray sheep. The fact that there are a lot of murderers and maniacs in the world doesn't mean the world lost good people. The director Tom McCarthy spotlighted only the painful wound of the Church. But despite of it I'd like the audience knows and doesn't forget all good actions of clergymen, their ministration to the poor and the needy and the fact that many people got the hope and got rid of many vices thanks to priests and monks."

As I look at it from a cinematic angle, it is rather run of the mill and doesn't seem to take advantage or be inspired by the medium of film. Sure, the acting is solid but the film doesn't make following reporters covering the story or even the couple of in depth interviews feel very engrossing. Most of the drama comes from reporters arriving minutes after closing time and being frustrated. If the story really isn't visually dynamic then make the cinematography more intriguing to compliment certain plot points or emotional moments to make them more impactful. There is better cinematography on Law & Order. This is far from comparable to All the President's Men as many have compared it to.

The title of the movie Spotlight refers to the name of the investigative team of reporters that worked for the Boston Globe. Michael is the team leader, with Mark and Rachel as a couple of his teammates. Liev is the new Editor in charge that gets the investigation going. Previously, no one had any luck in proving anything against the pedophileing priests because the Catholic church was so powerful. They had teams of lawyers and they had relocated the bad boy priests to different branches of the church after they would get caught and then continue business as if nothing ever happened. The Spotlight team uncovers more than even they were expecting; over 90 of the offending clergymen. And that is just in the Boston area! The actors are all good in their roles and the story is captivating, although a little unsettling because of the subject matter.

"Icedooitle","8","2","5","7 December 2015"," Past the Punchline
","When Stanley Kubrick was asked what he thought of the Holocaust epic ""Schindler's List"", he responded ""Schindler's List is not the story of 6 million Jews who died; it's the story of 600 Jews who didn't."" You can't tell the story of millions or even thousands of victims in a single picture. Schindler's List took a sample that acted as a small consolation for the largest atrocity of the last century. Likewise, the largest religious scandal of the last century can't be told in a single story. Spotlight takes a similar approach to subject matter of this scale and limits the scope to a single but crucial city, Boston. <br/><br/>There isn't much of this story that isn't common knowledge by now. More than a notable scar on the Church's legacy, it has been diluted to a punchline for comedy writers for the last decade. What we never realized is how compelling the inception of this story was. At the Boston Globe in 2000 a 30 year-old division of the paper called Spotlight was dealing with budget cuts, reader dropout and huge competition with the internet as a medium. Fresh blood was pumped into the organization by way of a new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Shreiber). In any fictional story this new Jewish editor at a dominantly Catholic media outlet would cause an unnecessary amount of drama to the conflict. As is true at real newspapers, employees don't respond emotionally to even huge changes, they've seen it all before. This new producer is greeted with passivity and few misgivings. His first meeting with the head of Spotlight (Michael Keaton), comes with a suggestion that would be easy to misconstrue as a personal agenda, look into the local Catholic Church's sexual abuse cases. The rest of Keaton's team Mike (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha (Rachael McAdams), and Matt (Brian James) make little fuss over this suggestion and begin professionally.<br/><br/>The authenticity of the dynamic between these journalists shouldn't be taken for granted. There is enthusiasm in their work, but how it develops into personal passion in the subject matter is kept in check for a growing emotional effect. Journalists grow a thick skin for horrible subjects. Breaks in this story chip away at their impartial involvement until the impact on their hometown becomes too large to cope with. It is hard to dramatize children recounting their tales of sexual abuse. What is harder yet is seeing the end result, decades after the fact. Victims, now adults, remain victims for the rest of their lives. Few have adjusted successfully to their lives with this boulder on their shoulders, and the journalists take on the burden of looking under the stones. What they find implicates more than the church.<br/><br/>This film has the luxury of portraying a truly impartial account of these developments. Backing up the integrity of these characters is complimented with a remarkable pacing that doesn't turn an important account formulaic. The cast was not given a platform for Oscar- worthy range, but Mark Ruffalo exaggerated ticks and physical mannerisms into distractions that luckily made everyone else seam more disciplined. McAdams, James and Keaton connect the Boston Globe to the personal implications of the city. Their past apathy in the name of keeping the peace extends blame beyond the church into a ripple effect that leaves few definitively innocent bystanders. It is now 15 years later and if this film is making a case for anything it's that the legacy of shedding light on shame shouldn't dim due to guilt. This legacy is a burden that can't be carried by a punchline alone."

","Spotlight deals with an incredibly important and recent current event-- the Boston Globe's uncovering of the Catholic priest sex scandal. Throughout the film the characters uncover layers of conspiracy, as well as new twists in the story, and deal with the inherent corruption and guilt in Boston's ""small town"" atmosphere in that the institutions and people seem to protect each other for the sake of community.<br/><br/>However, none of these plot twists come to full fruition, and the film didn't seem to be able to choose any single theme, instead vying to take on too many.<br/><br/>A good deal of the middle acts are spent with a moral struggle over what story to publish-- whether to quickly publish attacks at specific offenders, or wait to find the story about corruption at the highest levels of the church-- and also the struggle of dealing with guilt over having buried the story years before. However, these struggles are both brushed off or faded out with simple dialogue resolutions in single scenes.<br/><br/>Additionally, early on in the film, the script takes a strong start in dealing with the pain felt by the victims, and humanizing and individualizing them; however, after a few scenes of dealing with the victims, the film pats itself on the back for a job well done and moves on from them altogether.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast had fair performances across the board; Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams seemed altogether understated, and Mark Ruffalo felt more like a young actor experimenting with stylized performance than the seasoned and ranged film veteran that he is.<br/><br/>That being said, the script succeeds in keeping the viewer's attention throughout the film, and managed to do some justice to the importance of the story and the difficult job that investigative journalists hold. The film was also visually pleasing; there was nothing groundbreaking or breathtaking about the cinematography or mise-én-scene, but the muted colors and well- composed shots made for an accessible and easy to watch experience."

","The story of this film needs no explanation. It is a very powerful subject and sometimes it makes me wonder how these subjects are allowed in Hollywood. Corruption is everywhere. With the internet expanding and our view of the news changing, as depicted in the film, we have been discovering such stories more and more. The film's execution of its serious subject was not as powerful as it needed it to be. There was only subtle criticism of the Church and the subject of sexual abuse. There should have been more vivid and effective ways of criticizing the behaviour and the cover-up. I don't know if this is even possible considering the power of religious institutions; it might not have been possible to do much more, so we can't blame without knowing the truth. This is not the only reason why I found the film underperformed. The acting was weak, excluding Mark Ruffalo. And I couldn't find myself getting into the story as much as I would've expected to. The story and the subject along with Ruffalo's performance saved this film to be above average. Still, I would recommend it for the story."

","Tom McCarthy, an actor who's scrounged around for roles in both movies and TV for a good number of years, appears to have found his mettle as a director. Known principally for a couple of mediocre efforts (""The Visitor"" and ""Win, Win""), he now has taken on more heady material in Spotlight, which chronicles the 2001 Boston Globe investigation into pedophile priests and subsequent cover-up by the Archdiocese of Boston.<br/><br/>Spotolight begins with the arrival of a new editor at the Globe, Marty Baron, played by a rather taciturn Lev Schreiber. Baron is Jewish and finds himself a bit of an outsider in the majority Catholic city. Nonetheless he is determined that the Globe's crackerjack ""Spotlight"" squad of reporters dig deeper into this potential blockbuster crime story. <br/><br/>The two standouts amongst the reporters who investigate the minions and higher-ups within the Boston archdiocese are Michael Keaton as editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson and reporter Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo). Keaton, proves after his pretentious role in the unfortunately acclaimed ""Birdman,"" that he can still really act. And Rufallo is nicely quirky as the ace reporter who uncovers the critical documents that prove that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou of Blue Bloods fame) shielded pedophile priests on his watch.<br/><br/>Keaton and Ruffalo appear to have the best roles in this ensemble cast, as they play off two other characters throughout most of the narrative. Keaton's Robinson faces off against an old friend, Jim Sullivan (Jamey Sheridan), an attorney who represents the Church, who seeks to stymie his inquiries at every turn. And Rufallo's Rezendes is constantly trying to pry information out of attorney Mitchell Garabedian (played by a most believable Stanley Tucci) who seeks the protect his clients, victims of sexual abuse by parish priests.<br/><br/>The other members of the Spotlight team don't have as much to do: Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll has his most memorable moment when he discovers the Catholic Church's annual reports that list all the priests who have been given special leave, suggesting that most of them have been involved in the sexual abuse scandal. Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer has a non-descript part tracking down victims of abuse as well as briefly discovering one pedophile priest who is willing to admit to nefarious acts. There's also John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr., the section chief, who appears reluctant at first to delve deep into the church's conduct but eventually comes on board as his crew makes headway into their investigation.<br/><br/>The actors in lesser roles in the film do quite well. A particular standout is Neal Huff as Phil Saviano, the head of a church victims sex abuse organization as well as Billy Crudup who plays Eric Macleish, an attorney who brokered deals with the Church to hush up victims' complaints. Macleish has the shocking last word after being accused of orchestrating the cover-up by claiming he had sent names of victims to the Globe years earlier and nothing was done. Robinson confirms this at the end in a mea culpa, admitting he was the reporter who sat on the story.<br/><br/>Spotlight in many ways is all narrative and there is little focus on developing the internal arcs of the principal characters. It's also overloaded with expository dialogue—at one point director McCarthy holds the camera static as one of the reporters collects information from an expert on pedophile priests who lives in another city and is someone we never get to see on screen. <br/><br/>With all that dialogue, Spotlight might have been better on television. Nonetheless, Tom McCarthy has taken a great leap forward as a director, putting together a story that doesn't lend itself to great visuals but remains fascinating in the vein of any well done police procedural."
"graupepillard","8","2","6","25 November 2015"," Docudrama of The Boston Globe's The Boston Globe's Investigation of Catholic Church's Clergy pedophile scandal and the cover-up.
","if you want to understand the process by which four investigative reporters - each with his/her own expertise - function as a team working for the ""Spotlight"" unit of The Boston Globe's newspaper in 2001, exposing what will become a Pulitzer Prize (2003) winning probe of the Catholic Church's furtive silence and the Boston Archdiocese's cover up of pedophile priests who molested guileless young boys and girls in their Massachusetts' parishes, see the movie SPOTLIGHT, a docudrama written and directed by Tom McCarthy. A film that is not histrionic in its presentation, but slowly and methodically builds a case which unearths the horrific breach of trust between ""believers"" and those who are anointed as their spiritual sentinels in the secular world. The aftermath of the newspaper's disclosures reverberated beyond its local sphere of examination into an international autopsy exhuming shame and dishonor upon the Church and its leaders.<br/><br/>SPOTLIGHT opens with a feeling of tension; we sense the apprehension of a close-knit circle of reporters - the Spotlight investigative division of The Boston Globe - a small corps of journalists who focus on one important story oftentimes for over a year - when an ""outsider"", Marty Baron (a self-possessed, beautifully understated performance by Liev Schreiber) is recruited from The Miami Herald to become their new Editor. Baron realizes the potential of Spotlight to substantially examine an issue and shifts their target unto a story that over the years had been buried deep into the paper, occasionally surfacing to be interred again - eruptions of accusations appearing in print expeditiously extinguished. Marty Baron understands the need to look at the Institution itself - not just pinpointing individual perpetrators and victims, but examining the Catholic Church and its powerful influence on other authoritative organizations in predominantly Irish Catholic Boston, well aware that there will be attempts to stifle any exploration that cuts deeper into the skin of corruption.<br/><br/>The meticulous and disciplined search for the ""truth"" of a story involves interviewing victims now in adulthood, who reveal lacerating facts on their loss of innocence at the hands of the very people they trusted most to protect them - a spiritual shock as well as a physical one. Sacha Pfeiffer (a non-glamorous Rachel McAdams who is turning into a wonderful actor) conducts many of the painful interviews excavating devastating memories - her empathy and concern are both convincing and authoritative. One weeps for the hidden secrets that are divulged and the overwhelming feeling of powerlessness that these young people must covertly endure. <br/><br/>Michael Keaton, who stars as Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, communicates through expressive facial nuance, and the hunch of his shoulders, the conflicted burden and courage that being leader of the Globe's coverage exacts on his innate view of himself - an Irish Catholic member of the church; a man who rubbed shoulders with the Cardinal and other politically connected elite Church officials; a person who despite the distressing revelation that while he was Editor of the Metro Section years before - the glimmerings of this scandal were literally kicked underground into files gathering dust in the storage bins of the newspaper.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo, another terrific actor is frenetic as Mike Rezendes - a Spotlight columnist who is in constant motion, a whirlwind of physical movement - ascetic in his dedication to spending long hours following leads, questioning defense attorneys, ferreting out important documents, petitioning court papers, and at the same time imbued with an equally impassioned integrity in lifting the lid on this pressure cooker of deceit. I responded to his innate decency and inexorable belief in the need for Spotlight to yield a scalpel of precision in cleansing the fetid decades old duplicity of the Church.<br/><br/>The fourth participant of Spotlight is the numbers man, Matt Carroll, (Brian d'Arcy James,) an individual who makes sense of the mounds of accumulated data, once the stick has pierced the hornet's nest. Carroll intuitively makes necessary connections and has the tough ""unglamorous"" job of putting fact to ""fiction."" <br/><br/>SPOTLIGHT has an ensemble cast ie: Ben Bradlee Jr. (played by John Slattery of Mad Men fame), son of Ben Bradlee of The Washington Post Watergate scandal fame) supervises the Spotlight team; Stanley Tucci excellent as Mitchell Garabedian who is portrayed as a querulous, cantankerous attorney whose firm to date has represented more than 1000 victims and survivors of clergy abuse. In 2001 Garabedian played a pivotal part in The Boston Globe's explosive revelations. <br/><br/>What sets SPOTLIGHT apart from other movies that dramatize political ""cover-ups"" is the directness and restrained tone of its presentation. There are no ""deep throats"", midnight trysts lurking in the background, but rather a deliberate, efficient system of operation which slowly yields results that withstand legal scrutiny - conclusions backed by strong research that will detonate Institutional complicity and dissimulation - echoing around the globe generating further investigations like a chain of illuminations in a tunnel of obfuscation, lighting up the shrouds of darkness."

","The front-runner for Best Original Screenplay in just about every award show this year is Spotlight. the riveting, frighteningly accurate story about the cover-up and exposure of the pedophilia scandal that nearly destroyed the Catholic Church during the 2000's. As the statistic was at that time, nearly 6% off all catholic priests in the world were accused of sexual assault. Yes, it's far too painful to want to believe, but this is true. A noticeable amount Catholic priests were guilty of this, and many more may exist to this day. The truth is, these things happened, and the Church did next to nothing to stop it. It caused many people, like myself, to become lapsed Catholics, and some became not religious at all. Thus, Spotlight, a film about journalism, is a microcosm of journalism in itself. It's the truth that you don't want to hear, but you really should hear. Tom McCarthy brings the story to life with an unbeatable cast. The standout star is Mark Ruffalo, who in this, gives a raging monologue that has easily sealed him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The best scenes are, without a doubt, the interviews with the survivors. You'll be left stunned, that's all I have to say right now. There's not a moment of drag in this picture. Spotlight hooks you in to the very last frame. It's screenplay is the heart of it all. It reaffirms you how intelligent a film can truly be. If this doesn't win any awards for Best Original Screenplay in the coming season, I'd be flabbergasted. Spotlight absolutely delivers as an engaging drama, a loud advocate of free speech and a relentless call for criminal justice everywhere."
"rumery-70955","10","1","2","15 February 2020"," 5 Years Later Spotlight is Still Great and Relevant
","I just watched the movie again, in 2020. The message is perhaps more relevant now: the need for searching, patient, in depth journalistic research and stories, especially when challenging authority, powerful institutions and ingrained assumptions. The film is fascinating, low key but suspenseful even though you know the story...and the fact that, almost two decades after the Boston Globe published its series on the cover-up by the highest levels of the Boston Catholic diocese of decades of sexual abuse of children by nearly 100 priests, it is still reverberating worldwide today. The script, direction and acting are excellent. Can't wait to see a film soon about how dogged, moral, heroic journalists bring down the current corrupt presiden and his enablers."

","Journalists primarily exist behind their keyboards. They poke holes in politician's lies, expose corruption, and in 2001, the Catholic Church's child molestation cover ups. Spotlight shakes the viewer to his core, providing an edge of your seat retelling of the Boston Globe investigative journalists who defied all odds to bring the truth to light. The cast is littered with powerful actors including Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, and Liev Schreiber. Keaton plays the internally conflicted Spotlight team leader ""Robby"" Robinson. Director Tom McCarthy has a troubled past artistically. But he proves his merit with Spotlight, casting aside all previous blunders like 2012. Tom McCarthy not only directed, but he wrote the original screenplay alongside Josh Singer. Spotlight's dialogue is clever and slightly combative. The story alone slowly burns and delivers a payoff worthy its Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>From a strict entertainment perspective, Spotlight hits the mark. It accomplishes this without using pulpy details or flashbacks to the crimes Catholic priests had committed. It instead invites you to feel the psychological pain endured by the now adult victims. There truly is nothing I can suggest to the creative team. If anything, I wished it were even longer so that I could savor the catharsis."

","This won the Best Film at the Oscars 2016 over The Revenant, The Big Short, and Mad Max: Fury Road. That got me interested because I loved every one of those movies that year. ""Man this has to be a great movie if it won over the movie that Leo finally got his Oscar in,"" I thought to myself as I selected it from Netflix.<br/><br/>Spotlight follows the story of the Boston Globe special reporting team of the same name as they uncover child molestation and abuse in the catholic church. The story itself is really an interesting story. The pacing of the movie is fluid and it never bored me. Every time there was a break in the case, a rush of excitement hit me. I'm glad they didn't focus too much time on 9/11, as I was afraid it would just kill all the momentum it had been rolling up the whole way. The performances of everyone, especially Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton, were great. Liev Schreiber was a commanding presence in the movie as well, with his quiet, but almost intimidating role as the main editor.<br/><br/>But other than the great acting and an interesting plot, nothing really is special about the movie. The movie is boring to just look at visually. No colors stand out in a wash of grey, white, and black. I get that maybe it's because duh newspaper, but it is not a movie for spectacle. The camera work was really boring as well. No interesting shots or composition were to be seen in the whole film. I watched it maybe 3 days ago and I can't, for the life of me, remember any scene vividly. Nothing was noteworthy of my memory.<br/><br/>It's an interesting story, an important story, but shot in the most boring and drab way.

We've been hiding for so many years a lot of topics worth knowing, but this, is a very shocking one. Child abuse is not only a crime but an abomination. It doesn't matter who or when, nor even why. 
For a long time I've heard from family and friends a wide set of justifications: ''well, it's something that happens'', ''don't worry, they take those priests out of church'' but it doesn't happen. 
We shouldn't expect this from any citizen, especially from the religious people who are supposed to spread love and good values. That's why we are so afraid to accuse them, it's a challenge even to ourselves.

"Imdbidia","9","1","2","18 February 2017"," Sensitive intriguing approach to a sad story
","Spotlight is a sad and fascinating movie to watch. Sad because it deals with the systematic abuse of children by ministers of the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, this story is nothing that happened just in Boston long ago. Just a couple of weeks ago, an Australian royal commission revealed the same systemic abuse in Australian Catholic churches and boys schools, with higher levels of pedophilia, and similar polices of cover-up and/or disregard for some of the children's complaints. As one of the victims says in the film, ""we were not only raped physically, but also spiritually"".<br/><br/>The movie is really intriguing because the focus is mostly on the research carried about by the five people of the Spotlight section in the Boston Globe. This is not an anti-Catholic film at all, or a film against Catholics, but an exposé on how the high spheres of the Catholic Church didn't get rid of the abusers and did nothing to protect and support the children and families abused, ignoring the most vulnerable among the community when they were most in need. <br/><br/>I found the whole research process absolutely thrilling. I'm a historical researcher and I know how laborious and demanding research is, but also how rewarding and mind blowing it can be. I loved the fact that the film shows the impact that the investigation had on three of the journos involved, as they were raised Catholic.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job and are convincing in their respective roles. I especially liked McAdams, Ruffalo, Crudrup and Tucci. However, this is a choral movie, and the chorus sings wonderfully in tune. <br/><br/>The cinematography and atmosphere are excellent, and the music is absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>The main downside of Spotlight is that the research story becomes a bit flat at moments. A bit of more narrative digging would have lifted up the tone of the movie. 1/ I would have liked more victims' voices being included in the film, and also the details mentioned in the letter of a mother to Cardinal Law being brought out more prominently into the story. 2/ I would have liked having a few of the abusers profiled; we are just hinted the case of Ronald Paquin. 3/ I would have liked to dig into why ""Tempo"" decided not to follow lawyer Mcleish's letter fifteen years before, and why nothing was done when a victims association provided the newspaper with tons of material, way before Baron took the newspaper over; was it lack of interest? He didn't believe the claim? There were more pressing editorial matters? Why specifically such a horrendous case was just ignored for fifteen years or so?<br/><br/>Overall, Spotlight is a very good movie, with very good performances, great atmosphere, and very balanced in the way it approaches such a delicate and horrible subject."

I didn't have many hopes about it, but a friend recommended it to me and I couldn't pass the opportunity. The cast is just great, the Spotlight team in particular, but they're all just perfect, the performances, the characters themselves, everything. First of all, we get Michael ""Mike"" Rezendes, played by Mark Ruffalo; an American-born Portuguese and just a very likable guy, then, we get Walter ""Robby"" Robinson, played by the king of Hollywood Michael Keaton; who is a natural born leader and a very resourceful investigator, then we get Sacha Pfeiffer, played by Rachel McAdams; a girl who's, actually really pretty, but not as pretty as she is smart and intelligent, later, we get Benjamin ""Ben"" Bradlee, Jr., played by John Slattery, a secondary character in the story and the real leader of the ""Spotlight"" team, Marty Baron, played by Liev Schreiber, a conspicuous lead editor of the Boston Globe, and finally, we get Matthew ""Matt"" Carroll, played by on-stage Shrek actor Brian d'Arcy James, who's kinda underrated and underused, James has proved to be a wonderful actor, I suggest him if he ever reads this, not to give up and to aspire bigger roles in movies. Well, we've had a great ""Inciting Incident"" with the prologue and a proper introduction to our characters, so what's next? The story development is just spectacular, the way the elements come together, the mystery behind the Geoghan case and many other situations of pederasty all over the world are intriguing and, dare to say it, mysterious, this was real terror, and it happened in real life. Billy Crudup as Eric MacLeish is despicable, and for me, he did his job perfectly, Stanley Tucci as Mitchell ""Mitch"" Garabedian was a pure curmudgeon and that fitted the character like a glove, so as you can tell, I think every single performance in the movie is great, and what's behind those performances that's great as well? Outstanding writing by Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy that actually made me feel real time was passing by, I mean, if 2 months passed in the movie, I felt like I've been watching for 2 months, and so on and so forth. I also loved McCarthy's directing and Howard Shore's score. So what's not to love about this movie? Do they solve the case? That's just to big of a spoiler to give on this review. If you haven't, go give ""Spotlight"" (2015) at least one viewing, it deserves more, but if you give just one, that's good."

","With so many movies about investigative journalism elevating their protagonists to near-godlike status, to the detriment of the film's credibility, ""Spotlight"" is a welcome relief. Focusing on the Boston Globe's investigation into pedophile priests' abuses and the shameful effort on the part of the Catholic Church's leadership - and a fair amount of the congregation - to avoid the problem rather than fix it, contributing to the life-shattering abuse of countless children.<br/><br/>The reporters and their bosses are portrayed as skilled, determined, and dogged, but still human, struggling with their own backgrounds and concerns about their sources. More surprisingly, the managing editors and senior reporters are NOT portrayed as spineless, risk-averse roadblocks so common in journalism movies. Instead, the clear villain is the leadership of the Catholic Church and the lawyers for clients that profited from settling cases ad nauseum for decades, contributing to the abuse.<br/><br/>As someone raised Catholic, this scandal didn't shake my faith in Catholicism but it certainly shook my faith in the institution. This movie is unsentimental, avoiding subplots that would have been needless distraction. In essence, this is a template for movies about investigative journalism.<br/><br/>Also, this is the movie that ""Kill the Messenger"" wanted to be but instead fell into the normal, drama-enhancing traps (stereotyping the reporter's editors, stretching the facts, making the reporter a martyr, etc)."

","Spotlight is a gem, a must-see film. Spotlight was a special group of Boston Globe reporters tasked with taking on deep investigative stories that took a lot of effort. Boy did they hit the jackpot with the Catholic priest scandal.<br/><br/>In the early 2000's, it was discovered that, the greater Boston Diocese knowingly allowed pedophile priests to continue working, transferring them from one parish to another, and putting them in places for ""rehabilitation"", right in neighborhoods. This movie depicts the steps taken by the reporting team, led by Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams, to get to the truth. <br/><br/>Liev Schreiver also delivers as the new managing editor who comes in to direct Spotlight's work when he smells the story that no one else goes near. In Boston, the Catholic church is sacrosanct. But Schreiver is not from Boston, so he feels no compunction to handle this story any differently than any other story of corruption and abuse of power.<br/><br/>Bit by bit, the reporters, working with the lawyer played by Stanley Tucci, peel off the layers of the onion to discover the sordid, bitter truth. The trail of corruption leads to the highest levels of the church, sending shock waves still felt to this day.<br/><br/>This is a no-nonsense film that will stick with you long afterwards. You will feel disgusted and saddened by the horrible things done by people who supposedly represent God on Earth. I don't think any of the reporters knew what they were getting into, but at the end, they were all emotionally shaken to get the facts.<br/><br/>Excellent acting by all, and wonderful, taut direction was rewarded with the Best Picture Academy award, and 6 Academy nominations.<br/><br/>If you want to see a gripping, moving, and emotional true story, go see Spotlight, which sheds light on the darkest parts of the shameful, hidden Catholic church's behavior."

Again I have respect for this film not bringing false parts to sell tickets but try to stick very close to the source materials. Kind of like what honest journalist would do, instead of faking a story to get the news across while exaggerating the whole ordeal. This is the opposite of a exaggerated film, most of the actors doesn't try to outshine others or try their best to act out more than others. They try to convey the characters in a very genuine manner. The plot is about a group of journalist going after the truth of what went down with the Catholic priests in secrecy. And it goes in a realistic direction throughout the whole process. There isn't any life threatening moments or secret societies or any of that stuff.

","If there is one thing this brilliantly-crafted film reinforces, it is that freedom of the press is essential for the democratic way of life. It shows that no organisation, even one claiming spiritual high ground, is immune from the law.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is very similar to ""All the Presidents Men"" in the way that a small group of reporters pick up the strand of a story and follow it relentlessly until they uncover a larger, uglier truth.<br/><br/>At around the same time as the 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre, the Boston Globe's four strong Spotlight team exposed how the highest levels of the Catholic Church in Boston covered up and protected priests who had molested children. The number of priests involved was disturbing. The Spotlight reporters eventually proved that the senior cardinal had known about these crimes for more than a decade and allowed the moving of the offending priests from parish to parish – where many of them continued to prey on children.<br/><br/>The story is all business, not much about the character's personal lives are shown, except a brief glimpse of Sasha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdam) with her devout Nana. However each character has a well-defined personality from Michael Keaton's low-key, but considered Robbie Robinson to Mark Ruffalo's passionate Michael Renendez. Their reactions vary as they speak to victims and uncover facts that also effect them personally as most of the team were brought up Catholic.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of tension as the reporters follow up each lead and overcome many barriers. The film avoids a sensational approach, letting the facts speak for themselves. It deals with some raw issues in a subtle but effective manner, especially when some of the church hierarchy attempt to convince the reporters that their out of town Jewish editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), has an agenda for self-advancement and a desire to undermine the church.<br/><br/>The details within the film are still shocking.

","The movie is a great disclosure of what is happening for a long time inside of Catholic Church. The picture in this case is the systematic concealment by the Catholic Church in Boston of its decades-long, state-wide dealings with almost 100 paedophile priests. I hope that this movie will give more courage to the people who were molested to step up. When I first saw Spotlight , I couldn't resist picking favourites from its capable cast. And it was Ruffalo who jumped out, all but literally: his Rezendes is like a humanoid West Highland terrier, scampering into rooms to quickly get the measure of them, ears pricked, nose twitching and wet. He gives a brilliantly calibrated physical portrayal of a born investigator – in one scene, when he arrives in a lawyer's office, he even scrutinises the chair in the foyer before warily taking a seat."

","No question that this Academy Award winning film Spotlight is one of the best films not only during the year it was released but for many years to come. This Oscar winner which features the Boston Globe's ""Spotlight"" team tells us us how the oldest continuously operating newspaper's group of investigative journalist unit in the United States came up with its investigation of the cases of pederasty that committed by numerous Roman Catholic priests at Boston,Massachusetts.It stars a talented ensemble of actors and actresses in Mark Ruffalo,Michael Keaton,Rachel McAdams,Liev Schreiber,John Slattery,Brian d'Arcy James and Stanley Tucci. It was based on a series of stories by the said team that enabled the newspaper to win the Pulitzer Prize back in 2003.<br/><br/>What makes the film is great is numerous.First,we get to see great performances from its ensemble cast.They portrayed the real-life characters sincerely and accurately.The film did not fall into the trap of trying to maximize the good qualities nor magnify their achievements as well as the hard work they put forth into the newspaper unit.Second,the subject of investigation wasn't really an abomination of the Catholic Church as other films with similar themes do portray.It only reflected the priests who were assigned at Boston.Third,it provides the viewer of what a newspaper should be all about in reporting news and doing investigation like the ""Spotlight"" team.It was obviously not created to sensationalize topics they are investigating for better profit reports but rather for moral urgency and their responsibility to report the truth to the reading public.It also tried to stay away from what most newspapers have become these days and how the team remained true to their identity.In summary,this would make us appreciate them better and it gives investigative journalists a good name."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","29 May 2016"," Dramatization of journalists in Boston exposing the clerical sex abuse scandal.
","We saw this movie on DVD from our local public library. ""Spotlight"" was the most recent Oscar winner for ""Best Picture.""<br/><br/>It is important to keep in mind that the title ""Spotlight"" refers to a group of 4 or 5 journalists in the Boston Globe newspaper office who go by that designation, they find and research difficult stories then report on them. Unlike a typical news report which may take a day or two to investigate, theirs may take months.<br/><br/>The cast is super, no weak spots, but I will only mention one. It is early 2001 and the new top editor is Liev Schreiber as Marty Baron, coming to Boston from Miami. He was a true outsider for several reasons, not only had he never been to Boston, where there is a strong Catholic presence, he was Jewish. But he was a true newspaperman, he felt strongly that their job was to uncover and report the truth.<br/><br/>So this hint of a story came up, a priest in the Boston Archdiocese being a pedophile, and having abused children. To Baron it seemed there was a deeper story there and he encouraged ""Spotlight"" to dig into it. As it turns out this was not a new piece of information but partly because it seemed that the Archdiocese was all-powerful in Boston no one ever wanted to dig further.<br/><br/>Along the investigative route the team came upon a former priest who had studied the issue on his own and estimated across the board, not just Boston, roughly 6% of priests are practicing some sort of sexual misbehavior. That would be about 90 among the 1500 Boston area priests.<br/><br/>All of this was happening right before and right after our ""9/11"" attacks, and culminates in early 2002. When it was shown, using old unsealed documents, that Archbishop Law was a party to the covering up abuse, which included moving guilty priests to different Parishes, he resigned later that year.<br/><br/>The movie has received generally very positive reception by the Catholic Church in general. One priest wrote: "" Every seminarian should see this movie. The USCCB should spend an evening watching it together and discussing it. The only disinfectant that will really lead to cleansing is the bright light of truth. The Archdiocese of Boston would never have reformed without the Globe stories. ""<br/><br/>One Bishop wrote, ""All bishops and cardinals must see this film, because they must understand that it is reporting abuse that will save the Church. ""<br/><br/>As a viewer and also a Catholic I must wonder, if the Jewish newspaperman had not gone into Boston when he did, would this have ever been exposed?"

","Spotlight 2015 2hr. 8 min.<br/><br/>Childhood molestation and the Catholic Church has been a hot button issue since the early 2000's. With scandals of Priests molesting young children and the Cardinal's all around the world sweeping these issues under the rug by reassigning priests to other churches to wreak more havoc among other young children at other churches. Pope Francis visited America, this past fall and several survivors of molestation's have been very critical of the Catholic Church and wanted justice for the victims of this tragic failure of the church to take responsibility for various priests' actions by arresting and convicting these so called priests. In the city of Boston Massachusetts, a newspaper and 4 investigators that are called ""Spotlight"" decided to focus on the church scandal following the hiring of the Jewish editor Marty Baron (Liv Schreiber) of the newspaper called The Boston Globe. The head of the Spotlight team is a man called Walter Robinson (well played by Michael Keaton) who leads the charge of getting to the bottom of these allegations and another spotlight investigator, Mike Renzende ( Mark Ruffalo) attempts to talk to the leading attorney, who represented some thirty victims of the scandals. Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who wants justice even though the settlement sum for the victims is very low. Garabedian, professes to Renzende that he tells his clients that what they are doing coming forward, was the right thing to do. There is the defense attorney, who represents the church, who tells Robinson that the Boston Globe had this case 5 years earlier, but choose not to follow up. The other two reporters Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carrol (Brian d'Arcy James) attempt to track down various Priests and victims and to hear their stories. One person who talks to Pfeiffer is a gay man, who kept his secret for years, because the Priest said performing sexual acts on him was a good thing. The priest also says to the victim that he should approves of same sex love, and the victim struggles with shame and guilt over his own internal feelings of trusting a man of faith. Another startling scene, is when Pfeiffer talks to a Priest, who freely admits to molesting young boys and defends his actions because he confesses that he was molested as a child. The conversation ends when the former priest sister come in and abruptly ending the interview. There is a scene when Renzende wants to publish the story of at least 30 victims of the abuse with Robinson contending that the case is so much bigger than they spotlight gang can handle. Rendenze wants to investigate more victims and the Catholic Church. The two people get into a shouting match and both characters make legitimate points and the resolution of their conflict is convincing and leads to a conclusion that is just and accurate in its depiction of investigative journalism. The performances are first rate especially by Ruffalo, who is a lapsed Catholic, who was considering rejoining the Catholic church until the he begins to investigate the story. John Slattery, is also good who is the commander in chief of the Boston Globe and Keaton is supreme as the man who doesn't realize until the end that the story could have been investigated sooner than he realizes. The film reminds me of the great 1976 film ""All the President Men"" about two writers from the Washington Post Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward (played by actors Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford) covering Watergate and investigating Nixon crimes while he was in office. A character named Deep throat exposes Nixon corruption and irresponsibility that leads to his downfall. The two films have one great thing in common, they are about justice and seeking truth among the people who hold a high regard for. These two films are about truth, justice and how we need to call out the deceit and betrayal that our leaders where albeit a clergyman, to the President of the United States. We as citizens of the world need to call out hypocrisy in society and to hold those responsible accountable for their illicit actions."

","Brace yourselves for one of the most intense and dismaying films of 2015. This film takes the audience on a journey of real life events uncovered by ordinary people. The director masters the craft of consuming its audience into the images on screen making this film one of a kind. Its ability to solely focus on the content and deny attention towards the cinematic extras solidifies its title as a masterpiece. Directed by Tom McCarthy and Open Road Films, Spotlight is an incredible motion picture about a team of journalists known as ""Spotlight"" stationed at the Boston Globe. These cutting edge journalists uncover the hidden secrets held under the Catholic Church system and its neglect upon punishing priests accused of molesting and abusing innocent young children. What started off as an isolated matter in the city of Boston with thirteen priests later evolves into a worldwide phenomenon. With any reporting job, one must decipher the basis of the story and progress from there. Beginning with very little information and slowly collecting information and tips along the way until a full blown story has been uncovered. This act is demanding and time-consuming as the film portrays through its incredible team including actors Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Michael Keaton as Walter Robinson also known as Robby, Rachel McAdams as Sasha Pfeiffer , and Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll. With other incredible actors including Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian, Live Schreiber as Marty Baron, and John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr. The team along with outside help embark on this dramatic journey to expose the identity and skeletons, which lie within the church and its priests, as well as the tear down of the system and destruction of law. With limited to no use of special effects, Spotlight utilizes the strength of its narrative and characters consuming audience members to become part of the story creating this unexpected performance. A coveting film leaving many decisive about the Church, honesty, and above all faith.<br/><br/>This motion picture displays outstanding work defining true art.

","Spotlight is the true story about how the newspaper Boston Globe revealed child molestation within the Catholic Church and how they tried to cover it up. As a student of journalism, I find this film to be particularly interesting, especially the investigative journalism. I mentioned Spotlight in a post last summer and said that I thought it could be Oscar material. Spotlight did win two Oscars on this years show, best screenplay and best picture. Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams does a fantastic job with great acting.<br/><br/>Spotlight never leaves anything for chance. It is a well played drama and as the journalists digs up new clues, the film itself always moves one step closer to the truth. Even if we already know how it will end and just how bad it actually was, I still get pulled into the excitement. Films like Spotlight has a dramaturgy with a constant forward motion and rewards for the audience in form of small clues we gradually figure out. These films seldom feel boring and the same goes for Spotlight.<br/><br/>The relatively unknown director Tom McCarthy has in Spotlight found a good balance between unwrapping the story with dialogue and by telling it in images. There's a lot of intense talkative conversations but they break away from them with longer montages of home visits and investigative journalism. Spotlight is definitely one of 2015's best films and a must see. I grade it a four.<br/><br/>David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se"
"avik-basu1889","9","1","2","6 April 2016"," A tribute to all the hard working and dedicated journalists !!!
","'Spotlight' co-written by Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer and directed by McCarthy is based on a real life story where The Boston Globe's Spotlight team of investigative journalists made investigations into cases of widespread and systemic child sex abuse in the Boston area by numerous Catholic priests.<br/><br/>The acting and style of direction of the film go hand in hand and complement each other. McCarthy gets the most understated, nuanced and restrained performances from each and every one of the members of his amazing cast. Every actor cranks the subtlety up to 11 which along with McCarthy and Singer's naturalistic dialogue makes the characters as realistic as possible. All the actors work together and put the story above their own personal moments to shine on screen. The teamwork of the characters in the film gets beautifully portrayed by the actors. Ruffalo, Keaton, McAdams, Schreiber, Slattery, Tucci, etc. all are at the top of their game.<br/><br/>The style of direction, just like the acting is very unflashy. Just like the other McCarthy films that I have watched like 'The Station Agent' and 'Win Win', he gives the story and the characters all the importance without feeling the need to be too stylistic with camera movement. He uses minimalism to maximum effect and respects the subject matter and its importance and expects the viewer to do the same without feeling the need to see exciting edge of the seat moments. Having said that there are subtle directorial decisions like slow zoom-outs or slightly extended shots that are sparingly used by him. The procedural nature of the film is very reminiscent of 'All the President's Men' and 'Zodiac', although it is no way near as dark in its style of storytelling as Zodiac even though the subject matter is equally disturbing.<br/><br/>The city of Boston also plays a big role in the film. Even though it is a big city, the fact that it still has a very cosy and local feel to it is underlined by McCarthy. The huge role that the church and the catholic church played/plays in the lives of the Boston dwellers also gets depicted. The timeline of 2001 also gets utilised well. We see the occurrence of 9/11 and the attention of the Boston Globe gets quickly shifted to that story and the persistence and dedication of the Spotlight team on the sex abuse story gets tested temporarily which felt very believable.<br/><br/>'Spotlight' is at the basic level a tribute to the hard working and dedicated journalists who love their work and care about the subjects and the people that they write for. This film is an account of a time when internet was starting to expand its horizons and the print media's significance was starting to decline, but that decline had not completely taken place yet. This is a film about a group of investigative journalists who toiled hard without any assistance from the internet. They manually researched, read books and put in the hours to do what they thought needed to be done. 'Spotlight' is a nod of the hat to all of the those hard working journalists of yesteryears. They are heroic not because of the lines that they say in the film, they are heroic because of their work."

","""Spotlight"" is based on a real-life story surrounding the scandalous reveals of decade-long hushed-up affairs of sexual abuse in the Boston bishopric conducted by the reporters of the Boston Globe. The hot-potato-topic is an important addition to the already global critical discourse regarding pedophilia in the Catholic Church and a condemnation of its practice of merely removing child molesting priests to other parishes. The portraits of victims, already formed adults with families or single, gay or straight, but with the common characteristic of suffering badly under the suppressed trauma of the abuse, are both touching and revealing. It shows how deep you need to dig to find the source of suffering in a person, and how a fear of stigmatization can turn a person into a psychological mess, whereas the real culprits remain unpunished. In many communities, the Church plays a central role in terms of social life or can even be the only way out of peril for destitute people and children from troubled backgrounds. Which makes exposing the very people who help you as monsters in disguise even harder, bordering on unbearable. Coming from a country heavily influenced by religious institutions, I know how it feels to try to speak up against them and to feel the herds of their brainwashed flock coming at you.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo and Liev Shreiber did a great job here, and quite unexpectedly, the movie earned a best pic Oscar. An upside of the film could be that, similarly like in Burnt, we see a very accurate description of work dynamics in a newspaper HQ, with the difference of the former happening in a restaurant kitchen. If there's anything one could point at as a flaw, it's the fact that the film borders on documentary in terms of style and you can't help thinking it could be reduced to a 45-minute long doc on sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic church, with no losses in terms of its effect on the viewer."

","A true story told from the point of view of a gumshoe group of investigative reporters, Spotlight is a film that needed to be made, deserves to be seen, and was composed with a grace and maturity toward its subject that is hard to come by. An exploration of the child molestation scandal that rocked Boston and later the entire world, Spotlight covers an uncomfortable subject.<br/><br/>Good journalistic films in the vein of All the Presidents Men (though overrated) are hard to come by, and one wonders how much this has to do with Hollywood or how much it has to do with the state of journalism in America. For ounce, what the Spotlight team uncovered, though far too late, was an example of what journalism should be. Unrelenting, focused, and guided by the public interest. <br/><br/>The film captures this and evokes the enormity, depravity, and emotion of the time. It accomplishes this through mature direction, a phenomenal ensemble cast, and intelligent dialogue. It's not always easy to watch, yet something that gains in appreciation as we confront what we don't want to.<br/><br/>4.5/5 Stars"

A man who knew what was going on for years and was complicit in perpetuating the crimes and protecting his turf. In a fair and equitable world, he would be in jail. But in this world, the church rewarded him with one of the most powerful parishes in Rome.<br/><br/>The acting was tight and the directing crisp making a very complex story easily broken down into pieces while maintaining a quick and interesting pace that was consistent. It flowed nicely.<br/><br/>I grew up in Boston so a lot of this was familiar to me with regard to the Catholic church never being questioned and the Irish omerta. In fact, I was lucky enough at the time of my youth to not know anything about these goings on even though it was happening in some of the neighborhoods I lived in and the churches I attended. So it seems that the church and many of its supporters did the job of keeping this abomination quiet.<br/><br/>If you are a thinking person, you will enjoy Spotlight."

It's a very powerful story as it documents the tale of how a newspaper organisation uncovered the Cathaolic priests actions of child molestation, it was not afraid to tell this story, one that I feel anyone over the age of 16 should be aware of. It's truly shocking to watch, of course we are all aware of these scandals, but it was only when I saw the victims talk about their unpleasant experiences that I finally began to see the realness of the situation, it makes you question your own faith, in both society and religion, have to love movies that do that to you. However, I felt the film did not entirely rise to the heights of its true story, there were times where it felt like they were holding back, as if the real thing was too much for audience goers, this easily could have been a ten for me if they had struck that level of power all the way through and did not hold back for the sake of being too surreal. The performances are phenomenal and will be well appreciated for years to come, Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams deliver some of their very best work, they are also joined by talented actors such as Liev Schreiber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci who all manage to convey the passion of these people for their work. The highlight has to be Mark Ruffalo, an actor who only seems to improve every time I see him, he is completely engrossed in to the role of Mike Rezendes, he understood the characters struggles and felt them, ending up with a heart wrenching, very effective performance.

","*****May contain spoilers******<br/><br/>Spotlight follows the reporters of the ""Spotlight team"" on the Boston Globe in their uncovering of the scandal regarding the Catholic churches cover up of their priests molesting children in the Boston area. The main characters in this movie are Mark Ruffalo as Michael Rezendes, Michael Keaton as Robby Robinson, Rachel McAdams as Sacha Pfeiffer, Live Schreiber as Marty Baron, John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr., and Brian d'Arcy as Matt Carroll. <br/><br/>This movie was outstanding. Even though we all know of the story and the awful ending of the story, this movie had me pulled in from the beginning. The story begins with Marty Baron starting as the new editor of the Boston Globe. It seems Marty wants to make a name for himself as the new editor and cover stories that matter. He mentions a case regarding a lawsuit against the Catholic Church for their priests molesting children. He does not understand why this is not being covered by The Globe. Robby Robinson and his team at Spotlight start to investigate this further. While this story is extremely sad and heartbreaking, the writer/director/producer did an excellent job of drawing in the viewer right away and keeping them drawn in. <br/><br/>Spotlight was incredible at compressing time. The director and editor used montages at different times during the movie to make the movie much shorter. Instead of spending an extreme amount of time following the reporters interview people around the community and the victims, they showed us quick little shots of them knocking on doors and speaking to people with a little more time spent on important moments. It made the movie that much more riveting. The same when there was more detailed interviewed, the swapped scenes between one interview and another, it kept you drawn in and made me movie seem to go quicker. <br/><br/>The editing made the movie. It seemed like most of the movie was made with a hand-held camera. I think you can tell that by the shaky cam technique used in the movie. That definitely makes the viewer feel that they are with the actors in the movie. It was definitely a more intense movie watching experience feeling like you are walking with the reporter while they are interviewing people, searching for files, and so on. The sound editor and the Foley artist also did an amazing job. The music behind the scenes with no dialogue was well placed. At the end of the movie when they had a children's choir singing Silent Night and carefully then cutting to each main actor to see where they were in their journey in the movie. The sound effects that were added to the scenes when the reporters were deep in their research really also added to the feeling of being connected with the story. All in all, this movie was editing was flawless.<br/><br/>In the end, I would definitely recommend this movie. It ended with a heartbreaking update of how far spread this scandal was. Even if you are aware of the scandal and the churches knowledge of the scandal, seeing the investigative reporting background of the whole story is fascinating."

Allowing for each victim affected to tell there story in a way that never feels forced but instead like real people talking to each other. There are very few Oscar bait scenes as every character here feels like a real human being. Making this one truly amazing script. <br/><br/>Sadly the film can't help because of the nature and the choices they have made in not showing a lot of flashbacks or grotesque sex scenes that there are times when the characters are all just talking to each other and trying to uncover things that it can feel dull and there are just so many politics and things that stop the characters from going all in and making this story a reality and letting the people know. <br/><br/>Because of this I feel like this film did get some backlash from its Oscar wins because of all of these things. As powerful as the film is to some it may seem like a failure in there eyes, but it most certainly isn't. <br/><br/>Spotlight might not be my favorite film of 2015, but it defiantly deserves to be up there because of its powerful dialogue and script that makes it all the more interesting to see it unfold before our eyes."

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 5/5 stars<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is an exemplary film that shows us the staggering amount of hypocrisy, religious pandering, and face-saving that goes on in the world, from the bedrock of our society right to its highest echelons. More than just an account of ghastly occurrences, ""Spotlight"" is a mind-numbing, blood-boiling portrait of the pain and suffering experienced by scores of innocent kids around the world at the hands of the pseudo-moral custodians of society. The film tells the riveting true story of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Boston Globe investigative team that shook the city to its core and created a crisis in one of the world's oldest and most-trusted institutions.<br/><br/>When the Boston Globe's unyielding ""Spotlight"" team of journalists probes accusations of pedophilia against the Catholic Church, their year-long investigation unveils a decades-long subterfuge at the highest levels of Boston's religious, legal, and government establishments, all to preserve a hypocritical, almost criminal pious façade, eventually leading to a plethora of revelations around the world. The way the team go about doing their job compels us to genuinely admire journalists, who work tirelessly to unveil the facts concealing grave issues plaguing modern society, even if those issues bring forth the wrath and clout of powerful, populist institutions like the Catholic Church. Another extremely pertinent thing it manages to achieve is in being a blueprint for journalistic ethics and impartiality, especially in times of subjective news reporting as these.<br/><br/>Tom McCarthy's Direction and his screenplay – co-written with Josh Singer – shrewdly and effectively balances some much-needed wit along with the movie's harsh truths. But where ""Spotlight"" hits a whole home run is in placing the audience alongside the reporters, enabling us to partake in their disbelief, repugnance, and frustration. The breathless, tense, highly intense performances from a top-notch, fully absorbed, and wholly dedicated all-star cast are almost tangible from the cushy upholstery of out theater seats. Each actor portrays an indefatigable fortitude (Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Liev Schreiber – in that order – just do it a tad more than the others) to uncover the length and breadth of decadence unfolding on screen.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is an intricate web, but, when it's finally untangled, a remarkable and striking picture emerges."

It is true story and a very good damn... the director has guts to bring movie which is about priest.... many people from my country maybe won't realize how much guts you need to tell this story..this is like you are suing IMAM from our mosque because he is guilty.. in my eyes this is Mark Ruffalo's best acting... he came out from mambo jumbo style which I saw in avengers and now you see me.

However, the unfurling-tension of the truth and the shocking facts about the hush-hush negligence by law and the church especially, make a rueful impact and at the same time, are equally urging for the long-delayed justice's deliverance. <br/><br/>Not losing pace once, surprisingly, with bundles of information flowing around and distinctively develops around its characters, and from the journalistic POV; though, not boring for a second. Needless to say the direction, editing, casting are all done right and more than well, but what is outstanding is its score (Howard Shore, ""The Lord of the Rings trilogy"") - the theme of somber, careful unfolding to a widespread impact.<br/><br/>The film is ""highly-recommended"" for its simplest of depictions, defining why the press is called the ""fourth pillar of democracy"" and the very reason of its necessity in a modern day society and the citizens to not just think but to live responsibly as well.<br/><br/>Rating - 8/10; Verdict - Worthy of remembering, and its 6 Oscar nominations"

","Spotlight is a movie, based on true events. The Boston Globe is an extremely well renowned & popular paper, for the people of Boston. The Spotlight team of The Boston Globe, consisting of Mike Rezendes(Mark Ruffalo), Walter 'Robby' Robinson(Michael Keaton), Sacha Pfeiffer(Rachel McAdams) & Matt Carroll(Brian d'Arcy James), is the investigative journalism section of The Boston Globe. They are searching for the next story they are going to report. Enter new editor, Marty Baron(Liev Schreiber). He tells team Spotlight, to thoroughly research the major scandal of child molestation within the Boston Catholic Archdiocese. Baron also asks them to find out how the Catholic Church covered this up & why no major newspaper publication got a wind of this thoroughly disturbing story. What the Spotlight team discovers, is extremely shocking. The truth that comes out, rocks the Catholic Church & the whole city of Boston to its very core. <br/><br/>Spotlight is an extremely engaging & mind blowing film! The masterful direction by Tom McCarthy & the script by Josh Singer & McCarthy flawlessly depicts the struggle that the Spotlight team went through, to publish this story. What's absolutely wonderful & unique about this film is that, the entire 2 hours of its run-time, is just the characters researching & discussing the scandal & the victims narrating their harrowing experiences. Its commendable that in spite of not showing us anything that the victims go through, via flashbacks & what not, when the viewer listens to their story, you can't help but feel emotional. This movie just tells the story as it is. No comedic set pieces, melodramatic set pieces or, unnecessary subplots focusing on each individual reporter. The highlight of the film, is the performances. How else can you intently watch a film, that only has people interacting with each other. Mark Ruffalo is outstanding as Mike Rezendes. He truly deserves his Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Michael Keaton is brilliant as Walter 'Robby' Robinson. Keaton's subtle yet nuanced portrayal as the leader of team Spotlight, is vastly different from his previous role, as the protagonist in Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)(2014). Rachel McAdams is amazing as Sacha Pfeiffer. McAdams definitely deserves her first ever Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, as the strong willed reporter. Liev Schreiber is great as Marty Baron. John Slattery is awesome as Ben Bradlee Jr. Brian d'Arcy James is impressive as Matt Carroll. Stanley Tucci is spectacular as Mitchell Garabedian. The supporting characters are great as well. The cast of Spotlight truly deserve their Best Acting Ensemble triumphs, at the Critics' Choice Awards & the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Spotlight is a must watch for everyone, whether you like dramas or not. A masterpiece!"
"bbewnylorac","7","1","2","12 February 2016"," Solid film, but lacks tension
","The acting is great in this well-executed account of the Boston Globe's award winning expose of the Catholic church's cover-up of widespread sexual abuse. But the film is a bit anaemic. The cinematography is seemingly deliberately drab and doesn't show much imagination. The film shows how important it is that journalists are given the time to make contacts, build trust and gather evidence. Also, I guess, how their work can be banal and far from glamorous and requires persistence in the face of rejection. The film is almost slavish in not depicting the journalists as heroes -- in fact several times they are asked by victims and contacts why they overlooked obvious evidence of rampant pedophilia many times in the past. The acting is good -- the film is well cast, with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams and Stanley Tucci all possessing plenty of restrained intelligence. As editor Marty Baron, Liev Schreiber is so laidback he's almost comatose, but it does show that not all editors are fiery extroverts. It would have been improper, given the subject matter, if the film had have been too lively and dramatic, but drama needs tension, and in the script, too often dilemmas resolve themselves quickly and neatly. It's not an outstanding film, but quite a good one, and its themes, such as the need to have courage to expose painful truths, are worth portraying."

","Spotlight is a very powerful drama, featuring a very important subject.<br/><br/>The film has a fast pace, where the story moves forward rapidly, always with a great atmosphere of suspense and mystery. It's very climatic, as you keep finding new information and revelations until the very end.<br/><br/>To say the cast is outstanding is an understatement. Everyone gives perfect performances, but Mark Ruffalo shines just a bit brighter, his performance is truly amazing with phenomenal attention to detail, from the way he speaks to way he moves. And all of them are perfect to represent these real outstanding, brave characters that against the system and everyone fights for the truth. Only if the world had more of this people. <br/><br/>The script shines a light on the most important things, the victims, the perpetrators and the investigators. As you get a clear sense of everything that happened, and shows one very important conclusion, that the church isn't the only one to blame, in fact i think that the people that support their way of dealing with the subject, just because they're the church, and so they must be above the law, are even worse.<br/><br/>This is a very hard and delicate subject, and the film deals amazingly with it, showing you everything thats most important, thought i wouldn't mind to see more of the main characters and their personal lives, how they deal with everything, but i understand why the director focus on whats most important the investigation and their work.

It is very logical that Ruffalo and McAdams got their nominations because they're among the best actors in movies this year. However Keaton, Schreiber, Slattery, Tucci and others are also great. Just for the performances alone it's worth the watch.<br/><br/>The way they handled the source material is also very well done I think and it's a very compelling and moving story.

The movie is very well directed and edited to become one of the year's best.<br/><br/>The only reason you may not like it is because it's a movie with a lot of talk and not much actions. It's very much dialog driven so if you don't like that, you may not enjoy the movie.

"kieranbattams","9","1","2","31 January 2016"," shocking.. yet captivating
","Spotlight follows a team of reporters as they unravel a string of accusations against priests and how they have been accused of molesting children. Now a film like this runs the risk of leaving a bad taste in the mouth or even being tedious and boring. The film we get does neither of this, it opened up a number of doors and captivated me as well as equally making me feel disgusted, but none the less is a solid and very good film. <br/><br/>The main cast give it there all. Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton take centre stage and play really well together, almost as opposites, but they both have such a strong presence in scenes that you really feel like you are right there with them unravelling this string of clues, it feels almost harrowing to be in the situation but at the same time you can't help but take in the story and it is almost impossible to think about anything else. If a film like this can do that for me, then kudos because it really succeeds in making a film which could have been drab and gloomy into something you are incredibly interested in. Rachel Mcadams also stars and does a brilliant job, she is the person in the film that i think i connected with most because she is so likable but at the same time so genuine and real in the role and it was refreshing to see her do something so different because she is a wonderful actress. Liev Schrieber also gives a strong performance, but isn't as easy to connect to because he isn't in the film a huge deal.<br/><br/>I'm really glad to see Michael Keaton is back for good, i didn't really see him in much since Birdman, but he proves he is still as brilliant as ever here. The fact this film is based on a true story is extraordinary. The events that take place here are set in one location but by the end it is shocking when we are told how many places in the world actually had these allegations. It is unbelievable and the film does a brilliant job at spreading awareness for such a tragic subject. I highly recommend you see this film. I mean the last two films i saw before this were Ride Along 2 and Dirty Grandpa. It is safe to say i am relieved to see a film with actual quality and i hope this one cleans up at the Oscars, it is well deserved."

Some people have criticised for the lack of action or show stopping wow factor but the reality is, that is not how it went down and bravo to Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy for not bowing to industry expectation and over dramatizing the truth. It is also worth a mention, to those who have yet to see it, there are no over the top costumes or eye catching make up, no romance or pointless sex scenes, the set is a basic office and a small diner and nothing blows up, shocking I know. <br/><br/>Tom McCarthy goes up against everything 'Hollywood' and should hopefully come out on top.<br/><br/>As for the acting, brilliant by this all star cast, each one brighter than the next.

The script is the backbone of this movie. The sole focus of unearthing the wrong-doings at the local Boston Church does not deviate a bit from the plot and the scope of the movie.

"semery56","9","1","2","21 January 2016"," A Graceful Presentation of Important History, and of an Important Profession
","Spotlight is a model for the cinematic presentation of a story based on actual events. It is particularly effective at conveying the importance of a truly independent press, an institution whose mission must always be dedicated to the exposition of information that serves the public interest, difficult as that information is for the public to acknowledge. The film does not attempt to take any credit for the significance of the work that was done by the journalistic team whose efforts it is recreating, but rather wishes to remind us of the importance of that story while honoring those who had the courage and skills to uncover it - even as the prospect of fractured long-term relationships became more likely. <br/><br/>The actual Spotlight investigative team, working for the Boston Globe in the early 2000s, was well aware that the story they were investigating was worth the risk they were taking. They felt compelled to pursue the truth, even as it became possible that systemic moral corruption was endemic within an institution of the highest supposed moral authority. Spotlight is careful to demonstrate that the entire journalistic structure at the Globe, while true to its ethics in pursuing the story to its devastating conclusion, understood the potential risks involved in a massive moral indictment of the Boston Catholic hierarchy. This was not an investigation that was going to be easy to publish and due credit for calmly assessing that risk is given to editor Marty Baron (seen as a person of integrity and humility as quietly portrayed by Liev Schreiber). But they also knew that the implications of what they were uncovering was too grave for them not to pursue and present in all its horror.<br/><br/>The dramatic pace is finely-tuned, neither accelerating the action beyond the discussions, the doubts, the setbacks and the necessary subtext required to provide the audience with clear information more or less in real-time with the journalistic process, but also not slowing down to insert diatribes against particular members of the Boston clergy or the Catholic Church itself. Director Tom McCarthy rightly understands, at this point in time, that the facts provide more-than-sufficient dramatic weight, as they always will with regard to this devastating breakdown in moral judgment by all levels of the Catholic Church. <br/><br/>The acting by the ensemble is also respectful of the notion that these journalists, many raised Catholic though honestly depicted as having lapsed, were not zealots in their pursuit of damning the Church itself. Rather McCarthy and the entire acting team are quietly dedicated to the proposition that the truth-seeking work of the Fourth Estate can be - and in this case had to be - crucially important to the success of a free state. The journalists, at least as portrayed by these actors, understand - without ever preaching it - that even the most sacrosanct of institutions and respected of individuals must bear responsibility before the court of public opinion and sometimes before a court of law for the harms - emotional, spiritual, physical, financial, whatever - that they have caused. <br/><br/>Spotlight's camera work is also effective, plying use of close and medium shots to suitably convey the gravity of the facts being uncovered in the faces and actions of the journalists and those involved in the cover-up of the scandal, and in depicting the burdens of the journalistic process, while also providing the cozy feel of the Boston community, tied so closely in so many important ways to the Catholic Archdiocese. The cinematography is subtly effective without being obtrusive, consistent with the rest of this superbly crafted effort by Tom McCarthy.<br/><br/>All of this is not to say that Spotlight does not slowly build to an end that fully measures the devastation to children and families across the world and over many years that has been promulgated by a Catholic Church - all the way to its top ranks - that purports to guide the moral struggles of over 1.2 billion human beings. This film is a strongly presented reminder of that mind-boggling and head-bowing truth, but also an equally powerful salute to the importance of a free and honest press to bring that truth to the public, and by so doing, helping societies to grapple with the implications of such truths, and to demand justice and reforms from the institutions they hold most dear."
"sportello29","8","1","2","18 January 2016"," People who shine from within don't need a spotlight
","Spotlight tells a story of the reporters of the Boston Globe, where the 'Spotlight' team uncovered a huge, global scandal of child molestation within the local Catholic Church. Spotlight is at its foremost a story about humans, communicating the sides of victims, layers, priests, clerks and reporters, as well as the one of true determination, honor and persistence. <br/><br/>Spotlight at its core is a great, detailed investigative reporting piece. It deeply analyzes the human against the bureaucratic and political aspects of being a reporter, righteously glorifying the seemingly boring parts of the profession, which in the end all play an integral role in the resolution. <br/><br/>The nature of the piece that is being investigated is so surreal and unbelievable that it adds an incredible aura of mystery and suspense into scenes that otherwise would have not stood out. The dialogues are sharp and smart. They show not just the reporting side, but carefully convey the human emotions of these reporters. <br/><br/>Tom McCarthy's style is very fitting to the picture he paints. He is very direct and honest with his shots, giving us many close ups of the characters, helping further analyze the emotions that they are going through. The cast made this kind of directing possible by perfectly blending in with the characters; no one in particular stood out because no one needed to. There is no single hero here.<br/><br/>At first glance Spotlight might seem like another story of underdogs against a blind, soulless, corrupted system, yet the involvement of the Church significantly changes how the story is perceived. It makes these terrible events seem so much more appalling and significant that even the most eventless scenes become incredibly tense and thought provoking.<br/><br/>Yet the point of Spotlight is not to glorify the underlying story or bring the guilty to justice. We get none of that. Spotlight is about showing the process of true, detailed reporting. The 'Catholic Church' story of 2001 was most likely picked due to it's relevance. In essence, this movie could have been about any story, and it still would have succeeded on all the notes that it had. This might make Spotlight one the best films about investigative reporting, the one that fully communicates the demanding, punishing and grueling aspects of the profession.<br/><br/>As such the conclusion of Spotlight is not a victory of the justice system, it is not even a human victory where the victims can finally rest assured. It is the victory of the Spotlight team as reporters, echoed by the storm of incoming calls from victims all across America - their piece has made a difference."
"Gordon-11","Null","1","2","15 January 2016"," A very powerful film
","This film tells the story of a group of journalists in a Boston newspaper, who worked tirelessly to expose a big scandal on the Catholic church covering up a scandal involving a priest sexually abusing children. As they did deeper, even them could not have imagined the huge scale of monstrosity that is covered up.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of the plot, ""Spotlight"" is very engaging. It engrossed my attention from the first minute right up to the very last. It repeatedly made my eyes tear up, as each monstrosity that unfolds is bigger than the previous one. When Rachel McAdam's character interviews the priest on his front door, I found myself holding my breath in shock, synchronous with the reaction of McAdam's character. The film makes me respect these investigative journalists so much, for uncovering the unimaginable crimes. The film leaves me stunned and ruminative even after finishing it. It is super powerful, and its effects lingers on even after watching it."
"gnix1979","8","1","2","13 January 2016"," Outstanding movie
","First of all I would like to comment on the dreadful negative troll comments that have been said about this film. They have no place on websites like IMDb. Troll comments are part of the reason why hidden gems like Spotlight never get he time of day they deserve. Too many people are still hyped up over Star Wars that they never want to return to reality.<br/><br/>Now my thoughts on the movie.<br/><br/>I remember the day almost when stories about abuse in the church were starting to come out in the UK. In so many ways this story isn't new as abuse goes back further than the highlighted piece in this movie, follow up on abuse in Ireland with women and young girls dating back to the 1800s.<br/><br/>The film is in most parts unrelenting and when you hear the stories, horrific. Certain parts of the film take time to really spout but with superb performances from the as always reliable Stanley Tucci as well as Ruffalo and Keaton things move along well. I felt Live Schreiber was under used but his role was pivotal.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams character in some ways was the soul of the team, as we see her as a church goer with her nan, to her showing the printed article about the abuse. She covered things very well.<br/><br/>This movie deserves peoples attention but I must admit its not for everyone. The movie is well acted but not entertaining due to its subject line, and in some ways that makes this movie very important. In some ways without direct comparison this is like watching Schindler's List for the very first time, we knew about the holocaust but learning about the graphic details brought home the reality. Spotlight doesn't need to show the graphic details of what went on, but listening to the stories of the victims makes you sit up and remember that this is based on a true story.<br/><br/>Well done to team who made this movie."

Big credit to whole team that did not hesitate to make/produce/work on this film. Everyone who saw it must admit this is one of the most sensitive theme around for a few years. <br/><br/>In my opinion, this was the best acting by Mark Ruffalo so far, his accent, his moves, his speech, everything was top notch. Big credits goes to Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams and last but not least Liev Shreiber who wasn't on screen that much, however he still made a huge impact on whole story in many ways - he was like a shark, silent killer.<br/><br/>I can't express enough how important this movie is, how it can change the look on those who were abused, how it can and hopefully will change the life of those who were molested, their families, friends... You got to watch this, it's nearly a masterpiece."

","Spotlight takes on the story of the Catholic Church's cover up of pedophile priests in Boston in 2001. A new editor, Marty Baron(Liev Schreiber), hears of what looks at first to be a small news item of a priest molesting a young boy, and decides to have the Boston Globe's Spotlight team dig deeper to see if there is a bigger story to be uncovered. Robby Robinson(Michael Keaton) leads the team of journalists in the investigation which uncovers the now well known scandal of Cardinal Law and other leaders of the church ignoring the exploding criminal activities of a shockingly large number of priests being protected and moved from parish to parish. Spotlight focuses mainly on the dogged pursuit by the hard working reporters who keep on despite the atmosphere of intimidation of the Archdiocese of Boston. Director Tom McCarthy keeps the film moving and has an excellent cast led by Michael Keaton, who is ably supported by Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as fellow Globe reporters.

","If someone were to sit me down and ask me what my most anticipated films of 2015 were. I would say that Mad Max was it, beginning and end of list. Then I saw a trailer for a film called Spotlight. My list immediately grew to two. <br/><br/>A new editor-in-chief from Miami comes to work at the Boston Globe. His first big action while there is to question why no one has investigated the claims of a priest molesting kids. After some pushback, he finally decides to hand it to 'Spotlight', a team of four journalists who tackle in depth investigative projects. They make it their mission to expose not only the disgraceful actions of a few priests in their neighbourhood, but the system that tried to cover it all up. <br/><br/>For some reason, films that deal with newsprint appeals to me. I don't get why, they just do. One of the more underrated films that falls into this category, is coincidentally another Keaton film, The Paper. Maybe I had that in the back of my mind when I decided I needed to see this film, but I'm glad I saw it because it deserves to be seen. <br/><br/>Spotlight isn't afraid to tackle a serious and touchy subject matter and it does so with careful precision and thought. What makes the film relatable is that is never leaves the current situation of the neighbourhood. We see the story through the eyes of the journalists and the streets of that neighbourhood. We don't get these grand aerial shots of the city of Boston, because we are confined to the horrors that live on those neighbourhood streets. Spotlight isn't a showy film, save for one scene; it's mostly static shots of people talking. Yet I was glued to the screen.<br/><br/>One of the biggest things going for Spotlight is how well the cast works together. There are some heavy hitters here: Michael Keaton, straight off his career high with Birdman, delivers another knockout performance of Spotlight team leader Walter Robinson. The real Robinson would go on to say that it feels as is Keaton has ""stolen his identity, that's how weird it was to watch him become me"". Mark Ruffalo is reporter Michael Rezendes, who goes to great lengths to make sure the story is told, no matter what the consequences are to them. Ruffalo has the grandiose scene where he breaks down about wanting to print the story immediately, but is being told no. He conveys the right amount of emotion without going over the top. The lone female of the group, Sacha Pfeiffer is played by Rachel McAdams. She is able to hold her own against more heavyweights and has one of the most uncomfortable scenes in the entire film when she confronts a priest who admits that he molested children, but sees no wrongdoings in it. That scene in the film took place in real life. <br/><br/>I could go on and on about how excellent the cast is here, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James, Stanley Tucci are all excellent, with Tucci having the more underrated performance of the film. He's a lawyer trying to fight the good fight, being the voice of the victims, when others looked away. He has a line that he delivers to Ruffalo about being an outsider, which strikes everything home. <br/><br/>I did find myself being a little emotional towards the end of the film. There are some emotional moments scattered throughout, specifically one involving victims recounting the abuse. Spotlight is a magnificently crafted film that soars due to the cast and the horrific nature of the content. Seeing the names of the cities at the end of the film left me in shock as to how close some of them are to me. One of the best of the year."
"LaurieMann","9","1","2","9 January 2016"," Spotlight - Spot on!
","I had a feeling when I first saw Spotlight that it would be my favorite movie of the year, and it is. Exceptionally intelligently written, one of the best ensemble casts ever, it brilliantly portrayed how difficult dealing with child abuse in general is and how very difficult it was to deal with it in Boston when the biggest perpetrators were employees of the Catholic Church. It's a powerful and painful movie that never lost track of the importance of the past in dealing with horrors of the present.<br/><br/>I lived in Massachusetts in the '80s and '90s. I was horrified by the former Father James Porter case and utterly dismayed by how little things changed after that case became oh so public. Spotlight insightfully portrayed why things failed to change after former Father Porter went to jail.<br/><br/>The writers, Tom McCarthy & Josh Singer deserve all best original screenplay awards for 2015 hands down. I didn't see another movie all last year that was as solid as this movie. McCarthy also previously wrote & directed The Station Agent (Peter Dinklage, Patricia Clarkson & Bobby Carnivale) and The Visitor (Richard Jenkins) and wrote the story for one of the best animated features ever, Up. Almost everything he touches portrays real people like real people on camera and I love that (yes, even in Up).<br/><br/>I'd long been a fan of Michael Keaton and I'm very pleased that he's been in each of my favorite movies of the last two years (Birdman and Spotlight). Mark Ruffalo gave both a passionate and compassionate performance. And the actors who played the abuse survivors, particularly Neal Huff (Phil Saviano), Michael Cyril Creighton (Joe Crowley), and Jimmy LeBlanc (Patrick McSorely) captured the difficulties of telling their stories.<br/><br/>While much of this movie may come off as religion-bashing and a love letter to The Boston Globe, watch carefully because there were times when the Globe failed and other times when individuals in the Catholic Church tried to help and were rebuffed as no one (including the Globe) believed them.<br/><br/>When I look back at so many movies this year, I've seen many with great performances (like The Danish Girl and Concussion) but they seem to be lacking something in the storytelling. Spotlight lacks for nothing."
"BlackLemonTea","8","1","2","1 January 2016"," Use your voice
","I felt goosebumps all over my skin when the credits began. ""Spotlight"" is a spectacular movie with an important message.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that this movie perfectly illustrates why it is important to act and to not look away. People have to use their voices, express their opinions and inform other people if they want to make a change in society. In this case, a group of journalists from ""The Boston Globe"" called ""Spotlight"" try to solve the case of priests who raped children throughout decades and simultaneously start a war against the church.<br/><br/>The motion picture is well-shot. Although the movie is coined by its message, plot and dialogues, director Tom McCarthy still managed it to find opportunities to impress visually. There are some beautiful shots captured. Furthermore, the score (by Howard Shore) is simply spectacular. I'm currently listening to it while writing this. I feel joy, motivation and sadness at the same time. It is a world-class piece of music. As I said, the movie relies on its plot. The writing is simply great. There is a clear structure, we cut back and forth in scenes, the dialogues are superb and it is all well-paced thus one does not lose any interest in following the story. Acting-wise the movie does not disappoint. Everyone knows their role. The standouts are Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton in my opinion, although Rachel McAdams and Liev Schreiber did a terrific job as well. Moreover, the supporting cast (meaning little roles that only have less than 10 minutes of screen time) was phenomenal. Cheers to the casting director. By the way, I enjoyed how the life of a journalist was depicted. I was intrigued by how much effort many people put in these stories.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I highly recommend ""Spotlight"". It is an inspiring motion picture and delivers important values and tells a crucial story. Currently I rate it as a 8 of 10, because of minor reasons. But as far as I know myself, I'll probably give it a higher rating after reading the script and watching the movie for a second time."
"miss-snoozy","8","1","2","29 December 2015"," An important movie, very well executed.
","Spotlight is the story about how the spotlight team, a research team connected to the Boston Globe uncovers a great scandal in 2001; the abuse of many children, mostly boys in the catholic church by priests. When further investigating they find that this is global and has been known higher up within the church but kept hidden. This was the start of the uncovering of many such scandals within the catholic church a.i. involving sexual abuse and the cover up of this abuse.<br/><br/>This story is a serious one and didn't need thrills and frills. So I am glad it was filmed and scripted in a very natural way. No Hollywood drama but real drama. An important and real story that was dealt with accordingly.<br/><br/>A very good job was done of writing it out in such a way that it feels natural, close to how it really must have gone at the time. The acting compliments this very well. This is an all star cast with people like Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams. They are well casted and work well together. Their acting is mostly subtle but this is good in my opinion. Like I said no Hollywood drama, this feels very real. Liev Schreiber a nice surprise, never a bad actor but this time rising above himself playing the best role he ever played.<br/><br/>In turn the filming, sets and cinematography compliment the story and acting giving it even more of a real feel. The messy desks, the casual look the office has etc all feel very much natural.<br/><br/>With the award season coming up this movie could be one of the big winners. In my opinion Liev Schreiber should be nominated for best supporting actor. And the movie for best movie.<br/><br/>All in all a must watch movie."
"derekpku66","9","1","2","28 December 2015"," A riveting and educating movie
","Right after the movie two thoughts popped up in my mind. First, journalists are serious about their career. To work in the journalism is a strong commitment in a bumpy road. Second, to have faith in work is hard. Good journalists genuinely believe in the values of their job. It's safe to say many live to work rather than work to live. ------------------ Spotlight team unveils the world-shaking scandal of the catholic church community in Boston. Investigation starts with an allegation of one priest and then the scandal got just more complex as the team dug deeper. Eventually nearly 90 priests in Boston were found to have a history of child molestation. The storyline unfolds into a revelation of the ugly protection of the convicts from the church. Before this movie, I rarely thought into the life of victims when I read about them in newspapers. Spotlight did a great job in showing the audience how much trauma the victims went through as their self-esteem, religious faith and sex views collapsed and twisted. The lawyer commented the survivors as the fortunate ones, as they at least survived. The cast of the movie had a natural and engaging delivery. The unnoticeable acting constructs people that are made of flesh-and-blood. No dramatic or heroic behaviour, but just busy, hard-working and emotional journalists who live on a good deal of junk food. The movie ends flat out as well. No campy music or special close-up of any character. Rapidly printing of the newspapers quietly celebrated the triumph."

Although Rachel McAdams is outnumbered to men she holds her own in her strong performance. <br/><br/>After watching this film I felt disgusted, but pleased with the work of investigative journalists that want to get down to the dark truths that lurk among humanity.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this one."

To expose such evil is necessary but to hesitate sacrifices so many. That it didn't come out sooner is why it lost a star. Mark Ruffalo's determination to do good and Michael Keaton's pain at waiting so long to do so were as real and tangible as their voices, set to smooth, neo-noir pieces by Howard Shore.

","Paedophiles use Christianity as a cover and a prop to manipulate others into thinking they are trustworthy people,they don't appreciate the institution of the Church; they use their position to manipulate people, for impression management purposes.<br/><br/>This film failed to impress at the box office $$ and those awards it received were based on the worthiness subject matter.The population is now in a state of mass hysteria about paedophile priests & the Roman Catholic church is terrified of being accused of protecting paedophiles.Many of the finger pointers are not even motivated by concerns of child safety they are just keen to see the destruction of the Church.<br/><br/>""It took a Jewish newspaper editor to expose the scourge of abuse in the Catholic Church""<br/><br/>Bringing this message into the public sphere and subsequently giving it massive acclaim (Two Oscar wins and several Oscar nominations) and prominence could make a mind wonder if this film is deliberately demonstrating a bias and is operating in favour of those who seek the degradation & devaluation of Christian people.The question needs to be asked,is film media being used as a way of doing harm to the Christian church and expressing hatred toward Christian people.<br/><br/>David Pierre published a book entitled 'Sins of the Press: The Untold Story of the Boston Globe's reporting on Child Abuse in the Catholic Church' which provides examples of distortions,omissions and inaccuracies in the Globe's reporting.This does tend to suggest that anti-Catholicism could have been a driving motivation behind the Boston Globe's campaign rather than the pure altruism of child protection.The Globe newspaper has also been accused of serious hypocrisy due to the fact it it had previously downplayed and minimised child abuse and had even promoted the careers of known paedophiles who were homosexual rights activists.<br/><br/>Child abusing sociopaths are attracted to positions in the community where they are granted an instant authority and there is no evidence that the number of abusers in the Catholic church is higher than clergy from any other religious organisation.The abuse figure is thought to be lower than school teachers and significantly less than offenders in the general population of men.At the risk of getting into a statistical argument about a highly emotive issue .... child abuse is usually perpetrated within the immediate and extended family & if you were to only look at children who were sexually abused by non familial exceptionally trusted professionals, the actual prevalence of such abuse is tiny in relation to the amount of contact they have with vulnerable children.<br/><br/>The Christian Church is being cast as the refuge of paedos when in fact, priests abuse children at the same rate as everyone else-about 2%. If you allowed yourself to be influenced by the mainstream media and films like this, you would naturally assume it was 99% of the clergy that were paedophiles. It is common knowledge that Hollywood is controlled by some very warped and unprincipled people,it has a very serious problem with paedophilia and so the posturing of this film is slightly laughable in my opinion."

Moreover, he's saying this to a reporter of Portuguese descent, Mike Rezendas (Mark Ruffalo). These two outsiders and new editor Marty Baron (Lieve Schreiber) are the lethal combination for an investigation at the turn of this century of Catholic priests' child abuse in the diocese and by extension, the world.<br/><br/>Spotlight, a title referring to the name of the special Boston Globe long-term investigative team, is as much a thriller as a docudrama. To watch these professional journalists develop the case against the pedophiles and the church hierarchy is to see more clearly the mistakes made by the broadcast journalists of Truth, which chronicles the sourcing of the story about then President Bush's military performance.<br/><br/>Dan Rather and his team would have done well to learn from the Globe reporters' dogged pursuit of sources, with supporting evidence against more than 70 priests. With the year's most under acting but most universally great acing, Spotlight is a delight to see. The dialogue, of which the film is mostly composed, by director Tom McCarthy and Josh Singer, is full of smart observations and an energy that keeps the film moving at a pace commensurate with the rapid unfolding of the investigation.<br/><br/>One of the film's strengths is its unwillingness to overplay its points. Because the Globe had this crime information 20 years before and buried it in the Metro section, the case has been unfolding glacially, and the film respects the slow pace of the disclosure by providing no smoking gun or moment of epiphany—just clues strewn in its own paper ages ago. Reclaiming those stories and adding to them are the basis for the case against the Church, best represented by Archbishop Law, who notoriously reassigned his errant priests when they were caught.<br/><br/>Spotlight will have an Oscar spotlight if only for the best ensemble of the year together with unparalleled spot-on writing.

It feels like a slickly produced HBO movie at times.<br/><br/>I would expect this movie to bash Catholic religion, but it's more restrained. But why this story needed to be told in movie form is a bit strange, given the topic. <br/><br/>I enjoyed Zodiac and The Insider, based on true stories, and these are far superior compared to this movie that plays like a ""TV-M"" Hallmark movie. <br/><br/>The reason why I mention this movie to you is two reasons: the rare topics that relate to lawyering and journalism. <br/><br/>But given the precedents like the aforementioned favorite movies I cited above, Spotlight isn't that fantastic.<br/><br/>Spotlight won Oscars for Best Picture and Best original Screenplay, and I think Best Picture is unwarranted, but I also thought script was very good that held the movie well for two hours instead of three long, almost drab hours.<br/><br/>I recommend the movie just for brief lawyer ""mumbo jumbo"" if that will pique your interest how movie depict lawyering.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Spotlight is overrated but a tad respectful in its sensitive treatment on the controversial topic involving sex abuse within Catholic church. <br/><br/>One thing I disagree with is the given MPAA rating that gave this movie an R rating. It should be PG-13, but the MPAA thought the subject is too mature, so they automatically gave it an R rating, for adult themes alone, besides brief language and relevant sexual abuse references.<br/><br/>MPAA is really out of touch. In my opinion, for example, The Insider should have gotten a PG13 rating, despite some language. It's a relatively ""bloodless"" movie but still great."

","As I'm writing this review, Spotlight has already won two academy awards this year including an Oscar for the Best Picture. Although released in November 2015 but in India it is releasing this week. In this era of sensational journalism Spotlight emerges as a ray of fresh light. The movie boasts an ensemble of great cast that includes Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schrieber, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a short 1976 Police station scene and quickly jumps to 2001 into the office of The Boston Globe. The newspaper hires a new editor Baron (Liev Schrieber downplaying with finesse, whom many Indians remember as the person who presented Oscar with Priyanka). After reading a news piece about a lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, who says that Cardinal Bernard Law (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that the priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children and did nothing to stop him, Baron asks the Spotlight team (which takes months in researching a case) to follow this case. Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton) leads the team and is very convincing in his portrayal of a leading from the front boss. He assigns Michael Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo will make you forget Hulk) to pursue Garabedian (Stanley Tucci), a very busy and reluctant to help lawyer. Ruffalo plays an adamant, sensitive and impeccably observant reporter. Rachel McAdams plays Sasha pfeiffer who along with Eric MacLeish played by a theater actor Brian d'Arcy James go door to door asking uncomfortable questions.<br/><br/>Spotlight shows what true journalism is all about. It's about following a story with sheer honesty and utter conviction. Everybody follows a different path and researches the case in their own manner and slowly and steadily pieces start falling in place. It's about even going against the mighty Church which may potentially endanger the future prospects of a newspaper. We live in a time where newspapers are filled with news of child abuse all around the country. Spotlight goes on to show that this isn't a local phenomenon but a global one and even an authority as high as Church can also get involved. There is a scene in the movie where Sasha interviews a Father and he accepts molesting children and sees nothing wrong in it and in fact terms it as fooling around with boys. This gets you thinking how safe are we with such ignorant god man around.<br/><br/>It was high time a movie on Journalism made and Spotlight not just ticks this box but with the help of great acting and crisp screenplay delivers a beautiful movie. I'm going with 4 stars out of 5 for spotlight.<br/><br/>A new high for Journalism. This review is also available on http://www.wibble.in/2016/03/lights-camera-spotlight/ by the same author"

But if a story is there to be uncovered...<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that what the team discovers – including even the way the press was happy to leave things hidden – is both astonishing and disturbing. Having said that, let's move on and consider how the film conveys this story.<br/><br/>Clearly presented as a drama, there is almost a documentary feel to how the movie lays out the relevant key points as the story of the investigation (this doesn't always work: the investigation is interrupted by 9/11, yet this has no impact on it of any great significance, and could have been easily written around if the film had been presented as pure drama: as it is, it presents an irrelevant 10-minute detour).<br/><br/>The performances are all low key, and all excellent. The script is quietly efficient with little in the way of verbal pyrotechnics. There is always narrative movement onwards, but not much action in the sense one understands it in movies.

Although I am a life-long atheist I grew up in a Catholic family and was forced to go to mass every Sunday. Of course, the priests wouldn't have preyed on a kid like me because my father would have beat them to death with a bible had he found out. This film describes how priests chose children from broken families and on boys who showed signs of homosexuality. This isn't about some priests smoking pot or betting on football games; this is about men using their exalted status as servants of their church to rape children. Catholics who deny this horrible abuse are accessories in these horrible of crimes, a crime which even among prison inmates is the lowest, vilest act.<br/><br/>Spotlight does the job that the press has largely been unable to do in recent years: bring an important story to light. Since the days when the story first broke in the Boston Globe the print media has been ripped to pieces by budget cuts and only a couple of truly good newspapers exist in America today. So who will do this sort of investigation in the future? More than likely it just won't be done because TV news doesn't have the patience to investigate anything other than a terrorist bombing or a celebrity sighting.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton was the big surprise for me in this film.

","The rumors about ""Spotlight"" are true — a journalism film hasn't been this effective, clean and compelling since ""All the President's Men"" in 1976. Considering it is a story built largely around the investigative reporting process, it must seize its audience from start to finish and that's exactly what director Tom McCarthy ensures that it does.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" tells of the titular team of Boston Globe reporters who in 2001-2002 revealed the unimaginable extent of the Catholic Church's decades-long cover up of priests molesting and abusing children. When the Globe gets a new editor in outsider Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), he senses a bigger story in a recent Globe column about a priest who molested children in several parishes over 30 years and the victims' lawyer who said Boston's esteemed cardinal knew about it and did nothing. He puts the Spotlight team, led by Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton) on the story and they soon discover the unbelievable truth.<br/><br/>The film is an interesting choice for McCarthy, whose prior work, including ""The Station Agent,"" ""The Visitor"" and ""Win Win"" were much more focused on characters and personal relationships between unlikely companions. Yet perhaps it is his specialization in interpersonal dynamics that brings out the humanity at the core of this exposition-heavy script he wrote with Josh Singer (""The Fifth Estate"").<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is a top-shelf procedural that glues you from start to finish despite the tall task of having to thread together countless scenes of reporters digging and asking questions of each other and various interview subjects from lawyers and experts to the victims of abuse. Much of the scenes are composed of two actors having a conversation, which is where McCarthy's strengths and the stellar cast come into play.<br/><br/>In addition to Schreiber and Keaton, performances from Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci and Brian d'Arcy James are authentic and give the film its drama. There's not much overarching conflict and emotional highs and lows in the material, so it's incumbent of these actors to bring out the tensions in the small one-on-one conversations and to mirror the emotions the audience is experiencing as this stark and unnerving story continues to reveal its full extent. McCarthy really gives his cast the time and space to be real and let the emotions speak for themselves without shoehorning in more inherently dramatic content.<br/><br/>What also makes ""Spotlight"" so successful is how it doesn't lose sight of the big picture and how determined McCarthy is to convey the context of the story. The film is as much about Boston and the Catholic-dominated, Red Sox-loving culture there as it is about investigative reporting that matters.

"ReelBrew","7","1","3","27 November 2015"," A Boston Globe investigative team uncovers sexual abuse and misconduct in the Catholic Archdiocese that rocked Boston back in 2001.
","""What do you know?"" It's a simple question that is asked nonchalantly in the beginning of the film, but a question that holds heavy over us as we begin to question who knows what. In 2001, the Boston Globe began a piece on the countless uncovered molestation cases within the local Catholic Archdiocese. Using the papers Spotlight investigative team, the Globe would go on to expose and reveal the immense corruption that riddled the churches, rocking the foundation of the entire Catholic community. Heading the Spotlight team is Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), who with fellow journalists Mike Rezendes (Mark Ruffalo), Sacha Pfeiffer (Rachel McAdams) and Matt Carroll (Brian d'Arcy Robinson) begin unfolding the layers of sexual abuse that have gone ignored and unheeded for almost thirty years. Director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent) creates a meditative film with dark roots that builds up a steady pulse, knowing when to pace itself as to keep from exhausting its subject matter. The offices of the Boston Globe lay thick with a soft, pastel hue that hearkens a commonality within the paper, prominently citing the latest Red Sox game with no real focus on journalistic content. It's a view that runs parallel to the Catholic Churches flippant behavior, tossing aside anything paramount that might disrupt the nature of things. Howard Shore (A History of Violence) works to emphasize the immediacy within each scene, as he creates what becomes background noise; it's a score that glides rather than soars, which is exactly what our focus needs. We witness what is only important to the story, to what's being investigated as we follow in front of our journalists; when they move the story we move. <br/><br/>Unwrapping each layer of the investigation brings a different shade to the Spotlight team, with the sympathetic core stemming from Mark Ruffalo's Mike, who presses matters with an urgent and motivated hand that stands out amongst saltine performances from the rest of the Spotlight team. Ruffalo makes Mike his own, embodying a demeanor and emotion that helps shed light into the heart of the scandals while fidgeting and insisting his way around the city. There's a sense of flaccidness that permeates within the remaining Spotlight team, as findings are read and reports are exclaimed, though the only sense is urgency and necessity. The pace is urgent thanks in part to Tom McArdle (Station Agent), who never quite rests on a scene too long before cutting to the streets, then back to the office. It's an arrangement that spotlights the necessity of bringing this scandal to light, but along the way refuses to shine much focus on the grief, a choice that is both mindful of its perpetrators yet neglectful of its victims. Spotlight is a small film posturing as something bigger, highlighting a momentous period in journalism and the Catholic community that can't quite reach the pinnacle of cinematic storytelling, leaving us knowing a lot yet feeling little."

The movie has a lot of indoor scenes and a lot of conversation, which makes you think they would have no trouble turning it into a theater piece. The movie is nominated to the Oscars and that always puts a bit of extra pressure on it. After watching it, I don't feel it deserves an Oscar. However, it's full of good actors, it's a social case, a true story, and it's for all audiences.These elements are normally appreciated by the jury. So, can it win and steal the accolades? who knows?

","Pretty much everything I expected it to be. Taut, riveting, very refined in its writing and filmmaking. The film chooses not tell its story in an overly dramatic, broad, sentimental way and it works wonders. It's also able to develop its ensemble cast of characters without having to dive deeply into their lives to force more sentimentality, which I think is always a strength with a film like this. Like many others have said, there isn't one performance that screams ""award winning!', but it's a great ensemble cast. I had heard some complaints about Ruffalo acting with a capital A like he did in The Normal Heart, but thankfully he was fantastic and very much in line with the rest of the film. It's very much a journalism film, it's clinical without being overly so, which I do think will be a reason the Academy goes for it. Best Picture winner though? Hard to say. It may certainly be a consensus choice, but I do feel like it's a film that doesn't garner such a rabid, intense passion. It's a great film, but one that will stand to be very memorable in the eyes of most? I don't really think so, certainly not like Birdman. Still, it's a fine, fine film no doubt."

","Where the cast shines brightest, however, are the moments in between when there is no center attention. Writer (and Director) Tom McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer have each one of these reporters contributing to the investigation in some meaningful way—be it interviewing traumatized victims or unearthing sensitive documents there's an evident feeling of cooperation and balance. Though the same can't be said in terms of character, McAdams and d' Arcy James allotted significantly simpler means of development, the visits to the duo's respected arcs are kept brief—illustrating these moments as personal glimpses rather than forced sympathy. Schreiber embodied this aspect in his underused performance, where a couple of the film's handful of memorable scenes sees the Jewish editor opposite to the Cardinal, Schreiber donning a weary expression with a firm tone of voice to craft a motivated but emotionally suppressed performance that only began to bud.<br/><br/>FULL REVIEW HERE: www.borrowingtape.com/latest-reviews/spotlight-2015"

"jboothmillard","9","1","5","7 February 2016"," Spotlight
","I saw the trailer for this film at least five times in the cinema, I was impressed firstly by the impressive cast, then of course awards season came along and this was getting attention, so I was definitely going to see it, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Tom McCarthy (The Station Agent). Based on the true story, Spotlight is a small group of journalists writing investigative articles, for The Boston Globe, that take months to research and publish, in existence since the 1970s, and they have a rule, they are not to discuss their work with anyone else - family, friends or other staff at the newspaper. In 2001, The Boston Globe has hired new editor Marty Baron (Scream's Liev Schreiber), he meets with Spotlight editor Walter ""Robby"" Robinson (Michael Keaton), Baron has read an article about lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci) who says that Cardinal Law (Len Cariou) (the Archbishop of Boston) knew that priest John Geoghan was sexually abusing children but did nothing to stop it. Baron urges the Spotlight team to investigate, Garabedian initially declines an interview after being contacted by journalist Michael ""Mike"" Rezendes (Oscar BAFTA nominated Mark Ruffalo), but Garabedian is persuaded to talk when Rezendes reveals he is on the Spotlight team, despite being told not to. The Spotlight journalists, including Sacha Pfeiffer (Oscar nominated Rachel McAdams), interview victims who bravely come forward, the team initially believe they have been following the molestation crimes of one priest who has been moved around several times, but the team slowly uncover a pattern of sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests in Massachusetts, and an ongoing cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese. A man who heads a victim's rights organisation comes forward claiming to know thirteen priests have committed abuse crimes, the search is widened, they also look through annual directories showing all priests in Boston, the recordings show many names as leaving on ""sick leave"" and ""emergency response"", it is an official designation by the church when someone is moved after being caught molesting children. An ex-priest, who worked trying to rehabilitate paedophile priests, also gives them information that reveals that there should be approximately ninety abusive priests in Boston alone, through the research they have uncovered of priests leaving parishes for specific reasons they develop a list of eighty-seven names, and they find their victims to back up their suspicions. The September 11 attacks force the team to deprioritise the story, but weeks later they regain momentum when Garabedian reveals to Rezendes that documents, confirming Cardinal Law was aware of the priest child abuse problem and ignored it, are available to the public, he is eventually able to access them. The Boston Globe wins a legal case to have even more legal documents unsealed, and the Spotlight team finally start writing the story that will expose this massive conspiracy, publication is planned for early 2002. Robby confesses to the team, as they are about to go to print, that he was sent a list of twenty paedophile priests in 1993 in a story he never followed up on, Baron nevertheless tells him and the rest of Spotlight that they are doing important work. The story goes to print in The Boston Globe, with a link leading to the documents that expose Cardinal Law and a phone number requesting victims of paedophile priests to come forward, the following day the Spotlight team is flooded with phone calls from victims wanting to tell their stories, of course this conspiracy has also been exposed in other parts of the world. Also starring The Adjustment Bureau's John Slattery as Ben Bradlee Jr., Brian d'Arcy James as Matt Carroll, Big Fish's Billy Crudup as Eric Macleish, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's Paul Guilfoyle as Pete Conley, Law & Order: Criminal Intent's Jamey Sheridan as Jim Sullivan and The Cabin in the Woods' Richard Jenkins as Richard Sipe. The performances of Keaton, Ruffalo (who deserved his nominations), McAdams, Shreiber and Tucci are all fantastic, in Britain we were rocked by the paedophile revelations of sexual offenders and ""predators"" like Lost Prophets singer Ian Wakins, TV presenter Rolf Harris and especially the monster that is TV presenter, DJ and charity worker Jimmy Savile, so a film like this was always going to come around. This film is directed and written brilliantly, it works well to show us the power of modern journalism and investigation, it is shocking of how a story of one offending priest turned into dozens and the seriousness of hiding these facts from the public, it is utterly engrossing from start to finish, a must see biographical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"svorva","7","1","6","4 December 2015"," And No ""i"" Was Left Dotted
","Spotlight has immediately jumped to the forefront of the Best Picture race. Who could have possibly expected otherwise? Late November biopic, relevant topic with just enough controversy, last year's best actor winner Michael Keaton, Spotlight is certainly a perfect storm. On paper. In actuality, we got something messier, less refined. Spotlight lives to expectations, but is fraught with non-stand decisions. Whether these deviations were effective or not is unclear. Be warned, Spotlight strives for uncertainty rather than emotional fulfillment.<br/><br/>Let me clarify via contrast. Argo is comparable in its Oscar-baitness, but opposite in decision making. The best picture 2012 dotted its ""I""s and crossed its ""T""s so thoroughly it was practically shameless. Absolutely not groundbreaking, but a solid film nevertheless. Spotlight is deviatory, although not in a pretentious way. There is no central protagonist. The narrative is frayed with loose ends. Most importantly, Spotlight denies basic expectations. This is not criticism, but calling the film well-made or rewarding bonus points for being on the right side of an issue this easy is not productive. My first claim might be the most controversial. It conflicts with the broader Keaton reborn star spin. There are multiple scenes observed from the perspective of alternate character while Walter Robinson (Keaton) simply exists in the background. Often Robinson defers to his assistant and lets her do the talking. There is a historical connection that is not explored. Keaton is effective, but what a bizarre way to use his abilities. Ruffalo as Rezendes, despite top billing, is also not the central focus. I love the acting with his hands, but these are not the mannerism of a protagonist, nor is his arc. This does create more space for the story, but I am unconvinced it is fully used. This is a procedural, but it is certainly not wrought with technical detail. Plot threads are completely abandoned. There is an extremely mesmerizing sequence were a priest offhandedly confesses. Keaton's character literally promises to return to this topic, but fails to. Rufflao has late night meetings that go nowhere. I half expected a greater conspiracy to be afoot from interactions I could only interpret as cryptic hints. Maybe this is a personal failing. Maybe this is a method of supporting the thesis of ambiguity. Maybe this is Spotlights' failing. This effect never creates frustration, but it can be distracting. The ending is also perfectly in line with this motif. The finale barely exists despite the constant building tension. A message: the struggle continues, is unarguably in touch with reality. Just not as satisfying.<br/><br/>Once again I catch myself being overly critical. High expectations and all. Spotlight demands and receives your investment. I could not imagine anyone possibly responding with indifference. What a gut wrenching tales. If this film has flaws, they are hard to pin down. One of the best if the year.<br/><br/>But it would be a subpar year if it was THE best."

I would've liked a consideration of more perspectives, as it was just from the Globe's perspective and didn't really get into the conflict they dealt with, just the straightforward pursuit of information and proof. The pacing was also a bit strange, with lots of build and then an oddly rushed third act that made it feel like there wasn't really a climax.

They even have a Ben Bradley but it is junior the son of the great editor of The Washington Post. McCarthy treats the film as a procedural. It starts off as a weak story, most of the journalists are not interested in investigating the Catholic church that still has a big foothold in Boston.<br/><br/>However as the team probes they uncover more layers, more victims, more deviant priests and the newspapers own failings. Several people tell the journalists that information and documents was sent to them in the past and they did nothing.<br/><br/>The film benefits from the acting of its ensemble cast ranging from Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo to Billy Crudup. Liev Schreiber is very restrained here, unusually for a newspaper editor bought in to shake things up. Ruffalo has the more showy role.

This movie is a great gritty crime drama that is much better than that other picture. It is nice that it was named best in 2016, but by awarding the underserving Birdman in 2015 instead of this movie, the academy chose a flaky comedy film over an excellent film in 2015.<br/><br/>It also robbed The Revenant and Denzell Washington's Fences more deserved attention than they films got.

The emotional side effects this investigation would have caused them is hard to think about, but exposing the truth must have been very worthwhile. <br/><br/>Watching the film I found it hard at first to understand how this could happen and how a priest could abuse a child within a parish. But the film follows the investigation very carefully and answered every question going around in my head at the time of watching it and revealed everything I wanted to know and more. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much in my review, but I will say this. If you are like me and think that you know what had happened in the child abuse scandal I would urge you to think again and watch this film. That's all I will say. <br/><br/>With regards to the actual film? Well its fantastic. The camera work, the acting, the script...everything about this film is compelling and is sure to glue your eyes to that TV screen (or what ever device you happen to watch on). In the end I am happy that I took the time to watch this, it was very informative and has educated me greatly on the situation and made me think about a lot of things, not regarding my faith, it is still as strong as ever, but regarding the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy etc. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm going to stop talking, give it a watch, be informed and enjoy every minute of this chilling, compelling and informative thriller/drama. 10/10"

","I enjoyed 'Spotlight'. It's a nicely-paced character driven ensemble drama: a slow-burn investigative tale which heaps outrage upon outrage, and builds to an indignant peak before asking the audience a few stern questions about culpability and individual moral responsibility. 'If you tolerate this...', and all that jazz! <br/><br/>It also gives Michael Keaton his best role in years, reaps a rare understated but powerful power from Liev Schrieber, and enjoys fine supporting turns from Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdam and John Slattery.<br/><br/>A satisfying piece, and Tom McCarthy's best since the excellent 'The Station Agent': the guy knows how to get the best from his cast. <br/><br/>Yup, I enjoyed it. Would probably have enjoyed it more, mind you, if I hadn't been distracted – just a little – by an elderly lady two rows in front of me, complaining loudly that it was 'All lies!' every five minutes! I'm sorry, dear lady, if you are offended by the film, but even the Boston Diocese admitted that this stuff went down, pretty much as represented on-screen. <br/><br/>Still, even in provoking such a rare and adverse reaction – the lady was asked to leave – 'Spotlight' appears to have been very successful in ENGAGING the attention of its audience. Which is, perhaps, the point."

","Spotlight is the best film of its kind I have ever seen. All the President's Men was the gold standard for this kind of film about investigative journalism, along with Absence of Malice, but this film was better in several respects:<br/><br/>First, it did a superior job talking about the multiple levels at which the story could be presented by the journalists: about the victims, the priest/pedophiles, Cardinal Law, or the Catholic Church cover-up;<br/><br/>Second, it laid out the conflict among the journalists about when to run with the story and why better than any film of its kind.<br/><br/>Third, it presented the notion that the story could have a very different effect if it ran in one part of the paper than another. The idea that a story could be ""buried,"" even though it was published, because it was presented in the Metropolitan section, instead of the front page was well presented.<br/><br/>Fourth, the conflict among the journalists seemed real, not staged, as far as how to proceed with the story.<br/><br/>Fifth, the reasons people chose not to cooperate were well presented. People who had genuinely positive feelings about the Catholic Church were well-rounded characters, and the tension about threatening a Catholic high school with allegations about one of its faculty members was great. Stories like this have unintended consequences, and this film did a superb job laying them out.<br/><br/>Finally, the visuals were superb. The juxtaposition of the horrific events being presented and the ordinary working and middle class neighborhoods in which they were happening was presented without being overemphasized.<br/><br/>All in all, a wonderful movie, which, I predict, will be a classic like All the President's Men for people who want to watch intelligent films."

","Review: Although I found the subject matter touching and pretty upsetting at times, and all of the actors put in a great performance, from an entertainment point of view, it seemed more like a documentary than a cinematic extravaganza, and I really wanted to see the priest's get punished for all of there nasty acts. I'm glad that the director used top actors to portray such a touching story, about a group of journalist, who work for the Boston Globe, and go to extreme lengths to undercover the terrible true story about priest who rape young kids. The fact that the important documents were hidden away, was truly disgusting, and the poor victims, who were mostly damaged for life, also touched me. You do have to be in the right mood to watch this film because it is very one toned and it is one of those movies that will leave you feeling angry and pretty emotional. As for the performances, all of the actors gave this delicate subject, there all, and it shows journalist in a different light, by proving that they also can do good without uncovering a scoop, just for profit. Personally, I don't think that it's one of those films that you can watch time and time again but it's still a well made movie, which brings an untold story to light. Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I'm not sure that this film deserved a Best Picture Academy Award, especially with Mad Max and the Revenant in the same category but you can't fault the film for emotion, and the script is well written. Personally I don't think that it needed to be 2 hours long and I did find some of the scenes repetitive but with that aside, it's still one to watch and it's great to see Keaton back on top form. The movie was directed and written by Tom McCarthy, 49, who also brought you the Station Agent, The Visitor, Win Win and the disappointing, the Cobbler, so this movie was a complete change of directed for the actor/director, who recently starred in Pixels with Adam Sandler. He was brave to make a movie about a subject matter which has been kept under the radar for some time, and I'm sure that there are still people out there that won't accept the truth but I personally think that there was room for Tom to go deeper, from the punishment perspective. Its still a decent film which deserved recognition but I did see better films in 2015/2016.<br/><br/>Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $88.3million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their biography/history/dramas starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Stanley Tucci, Billy Crudup, Elena Wohl and Brian D'Arcy James. 6/10"

Th film feels more like a documentary rather than a film as the whole film consists of Ruffalo,McAdams,Schreiber,and Keaton trying to come up with an article for the Catholic Church and to find as many pedo priests as possible resulting in a shocking amount of priests who have ruined the lives of many people. What I liked about this film was the cast now I always liked Micheal Keaton,Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo as I seen them in A lot of films,Liev Schreiber I only seen him in X Men Orgins Wolverine and Kate & Leopold and I thought Schreiber was hilarious in Kate & Leopold.<br/><br/>My only downside to this film is that it feels like it drags on and on and I was surprised there wasn't any scenes where we actually see the priests doing the shocking things that they did to the people many years ago as this film is set in the year 2001 since the scandal occurred,and for a whooping 123 minutes it certainly drags A lot. <br/><br/>But sure I thought it was a pretty good flick,did it deserve to in Best Picture? Well it is a good movie but im sure there were plenty of other films that surpass this one.<br/><br/>My overall rating is a 8 and a half out of 10 and 4/5 stars.<br/><br/>Very good film if you are into these true stories and you want to find out more on the Catholic Church scandal.

","Spotlight focuses on a devastating turn of events which were ripe for melodrama, and instead turns out to be a spare, minimalistic entry that knows how to keep things close to the chest and still be deeply affecting. Director Tom McCarthy takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to his technique, showing us an intimate glimpse at what it no doubt must have been like for these Boston reporters as they brought to light one of the most sickening and heinous atrocities of our time, the sexual abuse scandal of the Catholic Church, which rotted through many a priest, parish and law firm who insidiously kept their mouths shut about the whole deal. For the reporters, ignorance was just not on the table, no matter what the consequences. Rachel McAdams is tender and fearless as Sacha Pfeiffer, a keen operative who is first to smoke out a lead, bringing it to her boss, the legendary Walter 'Robby' Robinson, (Michael Keaton), and the executive in charge of the paper, Ben Bradlee Jr. (John Slattery). The matter is brought to further attention by Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), who arrives from out of state. It's Mike Rezendes though, played by a stunning Mark Ruffalo, who drives the point home, refusing to give up and shoving loads of empathy down the throats of those who would look the other way. Ruffalo is note perfect, his determined sentiment delivered with compassion and impact that lingers. He hounds diamond in the rough lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Stanley Tucci hides the sympathy behind the sass) to allow him access to the victims, giving him something concrete to go on. The bitter side of the lawyer coin comes in the form of Eric McLeish (underrated Billy Crudup), a passively belligerent guy who is anything but cooperative until the hammer comes down. Richard Jenkins proves that he can turn in excellent work with nothing but his voice, playing a source who is heard only via phone calls. Keaton is brilliant, bringing the laid back nature and giving the character an easy listening style Boston accent. McAdams mirrors the hurt in those she interviews with eyes that echo years of suffering. Tucci comes the closest the film gets to comic relief, and then veers into dead serious mode as he realizes his character is in control of lives with the info he has, snapping to rigid attention. Watch for work from Jamey Sheridan, Len Cariou, Brian D'Arcy James and Paul Guilfoyle as well. The film arrives at its destination free from obvious emotional fireworks, on screen text or sensationalism, elements which often permeate true life stories. It's simple, to the point, grounded and diligent to story, character and truth. That approach makes it all the more shattering."

","I was gutted to have missed this at its original UK release back in January, especially when it received some attention at this year's Academy Awards winning two Oscars, Best Picture and Best Screenplay, and nominated for four others I really wanted to see this. So, a bit of a throwback Thursday I fortunately managed to catch a silver screening at my local. <br/><br/>I knew this film was going to be good but didn't know it was going to be that good. The film is about the Spotlight journalists writing for the Boston Globe at the turn of the millennium, before, and after 9/11. A tight team of thorough investigators that chase controversy and when new editor Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber) takes the helm, he politely, yet assertively tasks the team to do a follow up story on the Catholic child molestation scandal that seems to be swept under the rug. <br/><br/>It's a great portrayal of corruption and how it seeps into everywhere, especially where some can make a gain and how a whole population can turn a blind eye and pretend nothing is happening. It displays social responsibility, honesty, guilt and torment as you follow the paper trail spanning what I think is two years long. <br/><br/>Tom McCarthy directs and does an amazing job of recreating a quiet monster, a battle of office forces that reminded me of Michael Mann's The Insider (1999) and Alan J. Pakula's All The Presidents Men. (1976) I loved McCarthy film, The Visitor (2007) with Richards Jenkins, who I think provides a voice for this film, and McCarthy gives that same gracefulness, realism and subtly in his filmmaking. <br/><br/>It's an incredible cast with Michael Keaton at the lead, who, spent time with the real Walter Robinson and researched him prior to meeting him. Walter Robinson reporting on several occasions that Keaton does a true and scary account of himself; which is a shame for the general audience such as myself because most of us don't know how Walter 'Robby' Robinson behaves so it's difficult to judge Keaton's acting. It's good nonetheless. <br/><br/>You can see why Mark Ruffalo got Oscar nominated for his role as abrasive, passionate and frustrated Mike Rezendes, but I can now also understand why the Oscar went to Mark Rylance for Bridge of Spies. That awkward moment when your first name is called at the awards but it's the other Mark. Still, Ruffalo gives a great performance and deserves all the credit, and pizza. <br/><br/>Not sure about Rachel McAdams; she's does great, don't get me wrong but I didn't think it was worthy of the Oscar nomination unlike Ruffalo's. Tony Stark's Dad, John Slattery and Stanley Tucci play great charismatic parts as does CSI's Paul Guilfoyle and Watchman, Dr. Manhattan Eric Crudup. Liev Schreiber has always been one of my favourite co-stars and he quietly makes his presence known even among all the drama and shouting. He almost sounds like Dustin Hoffman. <br/><br/>The film is a superb testament to good, honest reporting and shows us that truth and power is controlled by the people sitting on high and depends solely on how good and true those people are if something is to be done. The meek will inherit the Earth. I can see fans of Money Ball and The Big Short taking to this film greatly, films about people who take on the system and win, a true 'David and Goliath' of a story. <br/><br/>Running Time: 9 The Cast: 10 Performance: 10 Direction: 9 Story: 10 Script: 9 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for a brilliant masterpiece, great storytelling and a superb cast performance. <br/><br/>94% 9/10"

Spotlight is a team of four in The Boston Globe newspaper working on investigative articles. This leisurely paced movie based on true events set in 2001 has Mark Ruffalo playing Mike Rezendes (the real Mike was present in Oscars ceremony) along with Michael Keaton as editor of Spotlight and Rachel McAdams and two others as members of Spotlight. When new editor Marty Baron played Liev Schreiber asks the Spotlight team to work on the left over case of Priest Geoghan case which is investigating a church cover-up of child abuse by Catholic priests. Spotlight team piece together the missing pieces, which turn out to be a global case which takes them against Cardinal law of the church. Director Tom McCarthy who wrote along with Josh Singer has given impeccable work in writing the screenplay with powerful dialogues aided by adequate cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi. This movie is recommended for serious movie lovers only."
"dromasca","9","0","1","7 May 2016"," requiem for true journalism
","Director Tom McCarthy authored a very interesting first film in 2003 (The Station Agent) and then his career seemed to go adrift into 'OK movies'. Now he hits gold with Spotlight which does not differ much in directing style from his other films, but just gathers a number of very favorable factors into proving that you can get a Best Film Academy Award even taking the 'OK approach' (in a 'dry' year as 2015 was).<br/><br/>Let me start with the positive things, and there are many of these. One first condition to hit gold at the Academy Awards is to run one of those big American stories, that play well with the concepts and heroes of the nation. Investigative journalism and people who make the news are the main theme and the heroes of the film, and on this respect 'Spotlight' follows a tradition that starts with 'Citizen Kane' and continues with films like All President's Men and Zodiac. The story that is investigated by the 'Boston Globe' 'Spotlight' team in the movie is the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests and the cover-up of the phenomenon and of its dimensions by the Church institutions but also by the town authorities, judicial system, community leaders. It's an explosive subject which to some extent continues until today. The 'based on real events' factor works well here because we know that the implications and ramifications of the problem continue until today. The writers and producers of this film chose to use the real names and tried to remake the true story as close as possible to the facts, places, characters.<br/><br/>The other strong attribute of this film is the accurate rendition of the 'yesterday' atmosphere to the smallest detail. The story happens between 2000 and 2002, this was so close and yet so far from many points of view. Acting is also very precise, although the homogeneity of the team makes the characters indistinguishable from a moral stand point of view. It's like I missed an element of hesitation, of fear of consequences - the story looks not like what it happened but like the way the heroes told the world it happened. Sure, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, and Liev Schreiber do all fine jobs, and I also liked how many of the supporting actors entered into their smaller parts.<br/><br/>I do not believe however that 'Spotlight' would have won the Best Film Award in another year. It lacks the sparkle that make the big movies we remember over the years. It may also be the last important movie in his genre. As printed journalism melts down and the multi-channel TV news and the Internet take over, the public relies less and less on this kind of journalism. People have easy access to much more information, they can change easily allegiance to any channel of news on TV or Internet, they need to make the choices by themselves. 'Spotlight' may be the cinematographic requiem for the kind of journalism it describes."

","The only reason my rating of this film isn't the maximum ten stars is that it presents a Jewish guy as a white knight leading Christians in a crusade against themselves. The problem actually is two systems, one being the hypocrisy of the Roman Catholic Church hiding hedonism beneath its claim to celibacy, and the other being the hypocrisy of our mass media hiding other hypocrisy when revealing it doesn't sell advertising. Note that the anchors of CNN's show The Lead and MSNBC's show Meet the Press and Fox News' show Media Buzz are all Jewish, and that those are 100 percent of the top three television shows focusing on mass media, while noting that less than a quarter of a percent of humanity is Jewish.

The performances were great as well, so the only thing that remains is the direction.<br/><br/>It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, but it felt bland most of the time, yet peppered with some mildly irritating moments that pumped the dramatic. You know, children appearing in the shot randomly and long shots on the frowns of the reporters, heroic overtime working and watching the morning edition leaving in the trucks in the night and so on and so on. One other thing that bothered me was that John Slattery was cast in the role of a red herring, but otherwise minor. I like the guy, he deserves good meaty roles!<br/><br/>Bottom line: I liked The Big Short a lot more. I can't tell you exactly why, since both movies are using the same kind of recipe: ordinary people investigating something unbelievable, but true, the old ""get an Oscar"" formula, yet I liked only one of them.

","There are spoilers herein, but anyone who followed this story in the news knows the outcome. <br/><br/>""Spotlight,"" about the Boston Globe's Spotlight division investigating the sexual abuse within the Catholic church, is worth seeing for many reasons. It's well made and well acted, but it's primarily a story that needs to get out there in as big a way as possible. A newspaper can break major stories, but a movie is for the masses and the masses would do well to get a 2 hour life lesson about the backside of spirituality and the power of the church.<br/><br/>That lesson is really about a basic misunderstanding the Catholic church had, and maybe still has, about humanity. Yes, the church can demand that their priests take an oath of celibacy, but that very oath is what created this international systemic horror of child abuse that ruined so many lives. Priests are not saints or gods, they are human beings. Whether they are bartenders or clergy, people are in that regard, the same. Sexuality is a strong force, and when members of the church break a sacred oath, the strict discipline of the church naturally forces them to keep secrets. Hence the problem becomes systemic, as the film so perfectly shows. <br/><br/>Spirituality, combined with innocence, make young believers easy prey. This is the nature of the power of religion and belief. Once a person puts their God above all else, laws don't necessarily get in their way. After all, God's law is the supreme law, and this film shows how a priest might justify his own actions of sexual abuse by using a misguided interpretation of God's law to keep his transgressions a secret.<br/><br/>This movie shows how the simple lack of understanding of the nature of humanity can backfire within a strict religious discipline. The problem of child abuse within the Catholic church was not just a result of some bad apples, but became systemic because of a narrow world view. Mark Ruffalo, who gives the most emotionally charged performance, speaks for the humanity of the church when he says at one point that he gave up going to church, but always felt that one day he might want to go back. This systemic abuse in the church, and hidden by the church itself, made him rethink that intention, and sadly so.<br/><br/>The very understated score by Howard Shore, lead primary by piano, adds a sense of solemnity and weight that gives the film a strong conscience. Ruffalo is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors, but the rest of the cast as also effective, including Michael Keaton giving a powerfully restrained performance, with Rachel McAdams, Liv Schreiber and Stanley Tucci also standouts.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is not a filmmaker's film like ""The Revenant,"" and there's a lot of talk, but it does have some nice visuals, and the sense of time and place is simply, but effectively created. Director Tom McCarthy has the same sure hand first on display in 2003's ""The Station Agent."" <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","Spotlight is an interesting film about how the Boston Globe uncovered the cover up by the Catholic church of dozens and dozens of priest who systematically molested children . This subject makes me really angry when I think of what these perverts are getting<br/><br/>got away with all in the name of religion and I expected Spotlight to heighten my anger but it didn't really. I found this to be a little sterile despite the fact that his had people like Mark Ruffalo , Michael Keaton and Rachel McAdams in the cast. Perhaps they were just a little bit too "" Hollywood"" to be playing the parts of these reporters because I never really bought into their performances. John Slattery was the best thing in this because I actually believed he was Ben Bradlee Jr. This is another film that surprises me that it got nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards because there are better films than this that missed out."

","That's the most impressive drama I've watched nowadays. Gradually increasing tension keeps you under pressure almost all the time. There are no words to describe the role play of the actors especially Mark Ruffalo who is logically nominated for best supporting role from the academy. Great job for the screenplay as well! Those kind of problems directly linked to the catholic church, media, court and other public institutions are very existential these days. And there is the thin moment , the movie doesn't offense only one part of system, but exactly the opposite! It shows that every part of it has rotten apples and in the same time people with moral values."

","Journalism can be a hard topic to cover in film without adding a bunch of unnecessary drama to make it interesting. But Spotlight has the benefit of a great script with very natural dialogue. Nothing here feels forced of feigned. It immersively chronicles the Boston Globe's long-time investigation into the Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal.<br/><br/>As a guy who grew up in the Catholic Church, it isn't easy watching this film and knowing that it's the Catholic Church who is to blame. But like any place where you have people in a position of power, you're going to have those who abuse that power. The Church is no different. And just like not every cop is racist and not every black person plays basketball, not every priest is a child molester. Although I was an alter server as a child and luckily never experienced or heard of anyone personally who suffered through this tragedy, I do shake my head at those who tried to cover it up.<br/><br/>Although the sex-abuse issues were nationwide, the film focuses mostly on the staggering numbers in the Boston Archdiocese. Catholicism in Boston has been known to be more of a culture in that city than most other places in the country. Their dependence and wholehearted belief in the Church made for a much easier target for predators. It's one thing to idolize God and hold true to your religious beliefs, but it's another to idolize other human beings. To idolize is to believe that one is not capable of fault. Well, the people of Boston held true, more than anyone, that these priests were godlike figures who could do no wrong. It was a sentiment that exuded from everywhere in that city. In California, where I live, I've never experienced anything quite like that in the 26 years I've spent as a practicing member of the Catholic faith. Not to say that these priests aren't expected to lead a holier life than most of our own, but then we look back to that whole abuse of power thing.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it's very well done. The acting is superb. Director, Tom McCarthy, gets the very best performance out of each of his actors. Especially Liev Schreiber, who does his best Steven Wright impression, always remaining soft spoken, yet intimidating. He never overplays his character, which isn't necessarily easy for an actor to do.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo is perhaps the biggest standout. He's an absolute phenomenon here. He commits so much to every one of his character's idiosyncrasies that it's truly hypnotizing.<br/><br/>The script is also great, doing well to explain and give background on a lot of the more convoluted details of the story. It can, however, be hard to follow all the names that are being spewed at you, remembering who everyone is. The story moves along briskly with only a slight thinning out for about 10 minutes towards the end.<br/><br/>But the one thing that Spotlight does pretty poorly at is depth, almost as if it's deliberately trying not to have any. It's anything but a character study. There's a lot of implied background for the characters, but you can't help but want a little more. Even in the macro sense, it has several perfect opportunities to explore the psychology behind these child molesters, but the film never really takes advantage of them, thus leaving a few scenes feeling unnecessary.<br/><br/>Despite making unbiased claims, the film does have a bit of an agenda of its own. It tells of certain characters' stated struggles with their faith, although they had already admitted to being lapsed. While it never shows how the Church's scandal would affect actual churchgoers.<br/><br/>Although I'm not commending any of it, I know why Cardinal Law chose to cover up all of those scandals. When you have a society that is full of ignorant people who constantly generalize everything, then you are going to have other people who try and cover up these instances in fear that the general public will, indeed, generalize. And so it happened anyway. Those who aren't Catholic go into this movie and may look at the Church in a negative light. But like I said, people love to think in absolutes. I, myself, don't idolize anyone, but can totally recognize that these are definitely horrible tragedies to be ashamed of.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 94"

","In this Academy Award-nominated film, Spotlight (on my Top Ten Films for 2015) reveals the 2002 expose into the Catholic Church's scandal of child molestation and rape by priests taking place at least over two decades. A team of Boston Globe reporters begins to investigate the history of keeping these reports of sexual assault under the radar.<br/><br/>""Spotlight"" is based on the true story behind the 2002 exposé into the Catholic Church's cover-up of decades of sexual abuse. Unflinching in its focus, ""Spotlight"" underscores a subtle outrage and sense of resignation about our institutions' power. We watch as the ""Spotlight "" team—named for undercover exposés of difficult-to-prove cases-- chases down leads; goes through archives with missing documents; and interviews priests, judges, and victims.

","The construction of this film is so traditional that at times it feels old-fashioned, having an almost ""I've seen this all before"" quality. Clearly the objective is to deliver the story in as efficient a manner as possible. No fireworks. No soundtrack that grabs you by the throat. No chewing of the scenery allowed. Remember ""Erin Brockovich""? Julie Roberts wouldn't have known what to do with herself on this set. But somehow it all works. By some strange alchemy ""Spotlight"" is one of the three most soulful films I've seen this year. (The two others - ""Love & Mercy"" and ""Time Out of Mind"".) Much attention has been given to the performance of the ""good guys"", Keaton & Company, and deservedly so. But I thought ""Spotlight"" did a brilliant job of showing the venality of the kind of corruption that allowed the sins of the priests to go unchecked: The performances of Billy Crudup and Paul Guilfoyle were pitch-black perfect."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","0","1","30 December 2015"," Spotlight's passionate but humble story is served exceptionally by its stellar cast, direction and writing
","Tom McCarthey's Spotlight has barely an ounce of unnecessary fat on it. The very first scene tells us everything we need to know about the egregious miscarriage of justice that the team is about to discover. A young police officer asks how the priest will go at his arraignment, to which his older, more veteran counterpart snorts ""what arraignment?""<br/><br/>The Catholic Church and its pedophile priests is likely the biggest story of the 21st century. Spotlight does an incredible job exploring the team who broke the story, but avoids the temptation of films like ""Kill the Messenger"" and ""Truth"" in painting its journalists as heroes. In Spotlight, the truth is the hero. Right into the final credits, where McCarthey omits the fact that Spotlight won a Pulitzer Prize for their investigation, McCarthey isn't interested in heroes, just truth.<br/><br/>The ensemble of Spotlight is absolutely incredible, with each Spotlight cast member (Ruffalo, McAdams, James and Keaton), supporting characters in John Slattery, Liev Schreiber and Stanley Tucci and even the film's minor characters having their moment to shine. Those who were given the small but vital task of playing the abuse victims absolutely nail each of their scenes, but no less impressive is a priest who openly admits to molesting kids but is also a destroyed shell having been raped himself. McCarthey (and Singer) gives all characters a sense of depth and importance, often showing us enough so that we can perceive more than the screenplay can include. As the script gives us pieces of information, we remember bits from previous scenes that we don't realise that we've absorbed, which says so much about how subtle the acting is. Ben (Slattery), we are told could have been eligible for Marty (Schreiber)'s job, but didn't get there fast enough. Its very easy then to remember minor behaviours and facial expressions that Ben has had in previous scenes, and suddenly his behaviour makes sense. Spotlight is a movie that can impress you on the surface, and awe you when you look deeper into it.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo is firmly best in show as Mike Rezendes, one of the Spotlight investigators. Imitating Rezendes' mannerisms and vocal patterns to a T, its incredible how different this performance is from his equally amazing work in Foxcatcher, The Kids Are All Right and even the MCU. He gets likely the best scene in the movie, blowing your hair back as he shouts that their story can't wait. The impact of Ruffalo's performance is helped because everyone else is incredible but subtle. Liev Schreiber is a very quiet and dignified, slightly out of his depth but a very strong leader despite it, and Spotlight likely numbers in his best work. Slattery is terrific (and probably the most underrated performance in the film) as the ""old guard"" kind of guy. He could easily have been antagonistic and out of touch, but in the hands of Slattery he's a much more subtle character. You can see discomfort in his eyes at Marty's behaviour, because he wants to avoid offending the Boston readership who he doesn't think Marty cares much about. One night, he turns up at Rezendes' house and you can see on the tip of his tongue he wants to ask him to back off.<br/><br/>Keaton isn't nearly as good as he was in Birdman last year, but he does a solid job anchoring the Spotlight team and bouncing off his subordinates and his superiors. Tucci does a great job with the role of Mitch, the lawyer representing the abuse victims. McAdams likely gets an amazing scene in the movie when she speaks to a startlingly open and honest pedophile priest, the look of horror and disgust bubbling behind her eyes. As she walks away, she sees young boys riding past this pedophile's house. Her face simply makes the scene. <br/><br/>Singer and McCarthey's screenplay, as I've already said, impresses shallowly and deeply. Their words translate to pictures - when a young man tells McAdams that he couldn't even finish his ice-cream, we can actually imagine the young boy paralysed in fear as this disgusting priest fondles him. Even when the words don't seek to create images, they still break your heart, like the gay victim who says the priest was the first person ever to say it was okay. It does much to help us understand how the priests get to their victims.<br/><br/>McCarthey's direction of this film is incredible, helped in no small amount by editor Tom McArdle. The camera lingers on needle damage in an abuse victim for barely a second, but it says so much. I've already mentioned the best scenes and how they are made to be so perfect, but also worth noting is how flawlessly Spotlight pulls off the publication day. The decision to have Matt Carroll drop the paper personally on his neighbours' doorstep is perfect, and its heartbreaking to watch Sacha's grandmother read the article when the movie has told us how faithful she is. McCarthey lets us feel the character's emotions - Sacha's horror, Mike's fury, Robby's guilt and Ben's bitterness - a feat worthy of a Best Director nod in and of itself. <br/><br/>Twist my arm for a flaw, and I'll say that the 9/11 stuff was even more forced than it was in American Sniper last year. I understand it was necessary to show that it coincided and set the story back, but the film breezes past it in about 4 minutes and then we're back on track. ""It's been six weeks"" complains a character, when barely two minutes have passed since Schreiber and Slattery ordered all hands on deck. <br/><br/>McCarthey's film is so much more than that. It's an experience. The cast are utterly brilliant, the writing is flawless and its a directorial masterpiece. One of the best of 2015."

","I watched the trailer to this film and instantly wanted to watch it, spotlight is a film about a small group of journalists that finds stories and researches them to death. a new head editor comes to Boston Globe and gives a certain story to spotlight. this story isn't what people really want to read. this story is the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese. as the film goes on they have many cold leads but finally get a steady lead of victims and find more information about the whole situation. finally they find 87 priests that have molested and raped hundreds of children, trying to get the evidence and the victims in the film was shown hard as all the cases were handled in secret and no one was allowed to know. the film goes on and they finally get everything they need to write the story and finally the story is ran. the spotlight team come in after the paper went out and there phones don't stop ringing and they are mostly victims that they didn't even know about. at the end of the film the heavy length list of countries or states that have found out there are priest that are doing it there too.<br/><br/>the film is truly eye opening. I didn't know anything about this before I watched this film and they didn't sugarcoat it, they made it real and true because it was. they made sure they kept the truth in the film. the actors and actress were so perfect for the roles. over all I love this film and just shows and informs so many people what really happened. give it a watch!"

","This movie is outstanding. Everything about it is good. I saw it a second time just 48 hours after seeing it the first time. I'm not sure I ever have done that before. I easily could sit through it again, only 24 hours after having seen it the second time.<br/><br/>I was a little concerned that it would be a routine Hollywood left-wing bash of the Catholic Church, but instead it was very well written and presented. Nothing excessive, overdone, or overstated. Nothing understated or whitewashed, either. The two writers have a clear understanding of how Catholics view the clergy and why this scandal was devastating for so many of them. The movie illustrates the difference between the Catholic faith and the Catholic Church.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Not one weak performance. I had the feeling that these were people I might know, very real people.<br/><br/>This movie is one that anyone might find interesting. Those raised as Catholics are likely to find it so and should see it."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","28 December 2015"," A Compelling Examination Of The Inquiry That Uncovered The Faith-Shattering Scandal Of The 21st Century.
","An extensively researched, skilfully crafted, brilliantly directed, deftly written, tightly edited & outstandingly performed cinema, Spotlight attempts to re-enact the investigation process that led to the uncovering of what became the faith-shattering scandal of the 21st century when it exposed the decades-long history of child molestation incidents within the confinements of the Catholic Church and its continuous cover-up by the Holy institution.<br/><br/>Set in Boston around 2001, Spotlight tells the story of the members of The Boston Globe's titular team which comprises of a small group of journalists whose articles are investigative in nature & popular in public. When their new editor asks them to dig more into the column about a pedophile priest & the allegations that the Church was aware of everything yet did nothing, the team begins its research and unearths a pattern of sexual abuses perpetrated by Roman Catholic priests of an unexpected magnitude.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Tom McCarthy, Spotlight has a clear, concise idea of the direction it's supposed to be headed in and takes a very methodical approach to bring its tale to life by keeping it as close to its real-life source. Although few liberties are taken to enhance the drama, the movie never steps over the line & keeps its characters in check by not glorifying their contribution. The screenplay packs in a gripping plot that grabs the viewers' attention much earlier than expected & never lets go from that point onwards.<br/><br/>Production design team does a terrific job with the set pieces by keeping it as authentic as possible, Cinematography exhibits controlled use of the camera to capture all the unfolding set of events, Editing is one of its strongest aspects for there isn't a single dull sequence in the picture plus it's briskly paced, the investigation retains a considerable level of accuracy with the real-life process, Howard Shore contributes with a stimulating score, and all twists n turns are expertly executed plus only end up working in the film's favour.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Spotlight features a very dependable cast in Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, John Slattery, Brian d'Arcy James & others, and every one of them chip in with convincing performances with Keaton & Ruffalo standing out. Keaton delivers yet another top-notch performance after his career was revitalised last year, McAdams also shines in her given role while Ruffalo pretty much steals the show and whether it's the leading or supporting cast, everyone's input is wonderfully balanced.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Spotlight is a highly informative, comprehensively detailed & thoroughly captivating cinema that scores high marks in all departments of filmmaking and manages to work solely on the strength of its script & calibre of its cast, all of which work out amazingly well under McCarthy's direction. An undiluted, uncompromising & honest illustration of the inquiry that brought to light the massive scandal that shook the foundations of the Catholic Church community, Spotlight is undeniably amongst the strongest films of this year, and comes essentially recommended."
