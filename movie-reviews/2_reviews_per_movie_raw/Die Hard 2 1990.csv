","Die Hard 2 in my opinion is my third favorite decent action flick in a ""Die Hard"" series and a good movie to watch. It is one of my personal favorite action movies. It is one of the most underrated ""Die Hard"" films in the series and that not a bad one. His wife again a hostage, Christmas again, the same reporter from the 1st film, now a janitor Marvin is a helper instead of Argyle and so on. As far as sequels go, Die Hard 2 is excellent. Of course it isn't better than the first, but sequels rarely are. This film is like going to a circus: you sit back and watch crazy stuff happen, laugh, cheer, joke, and just have a good time. Bruce Willis gives a great performance in the lead, we have some solid villains, and some brilliant action set pieces. I say check it out. <br/><br/>I'm not one to subtract points for a lack of realism, or ""real world believability"" in films. Because of that, Die Hard 2 poses a very interesting case study for me. Real world believability is very difficult to not think about when watching this film. Why wouldn't the planes just reroute to other nearby airports? There are a bunch less than an hour's flight away, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, the three New York City-area airports, and so on. Why wouldn't they be able to call another close airport, or the Pentagon, or somewhere else nearby to have them contact the planes? They're near Washington, D.C., after all (don't forget that Dulles is 26 miles away from D.C., in Virginia, making it unlikely that planes out of fuel would begin ""dropping on the White House lawn""). It seems like maybe this film should have been set somewhere like Salt Lake City, Utah instead. Why wouldn't they be able to show the runways through some other means, like a line of emergency or police vehicles with their sirens on? If the ""terrorists"" started shooting at the vehicles, or trying to blow them up, at least they'd be given an indication where the fire is coming from/given their location. Just how likely would it be that there's a big storm in the area on the day when General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) is being extradited? How likely is it that he'd be extradited on Christmas Eve? Why the hell is John standing out on the runway in the snow waving a couple of flaming poles--just what does he think that will do? <br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is still awesome movie and sequel to the first one for me and I don't know why people are saying it is the worst one or why they hate it. I don't, I love it, more than the first one I love it. In 2005 was my first best action movie than the first one. What I love about this film is they show John McClain more as a human being. In the beginning at the airport when his car was taken away at the airport, the whole movie show's an actual terror the villains are more of a threat cause they're actual terrorists! The Action sequences are awesome, there is barely any Cgi in it, John McClane is again in another elevator shafts. I love the plot twist that was wonderful, the snow in the film, the mobile snow chase whit McClane was awesome. This film is not perfect It is good, it has some problems in it. Always enjoyed watching it. The problems for the airport I already mentioned, the most annoying to me was after McClane kills the henchman when he was saving Leslie Barnes he pushed a terrorist of the latter and that latter tower falls on a terrorist you can see that it is a dummy from close that should not been seen from close camera.<br/><br/>It is still It is one of my personal favorite action movies mostly in the winter when it is snowing. The first movie was hug success, Renny Harlin's job by making this movie make it even harder for him, to find a good story, and make a snow because they didn't had any actual snow at the time it was really hard. <br/><br/>I love it. The facts I love: Chase with the Snowmobile, shooting with blanks on Carmine Lorenzo, fights on an airplane, double cross, John's jokes... The General Esperanza on airplane from Val Verde the same country was named in Schwarzenegger's movie Commando, John's shooting with snowmobile, than John's fight by the church. Movie to me is really awesome. I enjoy watching Die Hard 2. 10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval It is my second favorite Die Hard film in the series."
"ReelCheese","9","64","78","10 March 2007"," A Total Thrill Ride
","Bruce Willis takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin', nearly outdoing himself in one of the great actioneers of our time. DIE HARD 2 has everything a true action fan could ever want: explosions, chases, plot twists, suspense, drama and all that other good stuff.<br/><br/>Just two years after his last near-death adventure, John McClane (what a great action hero name) battles bad guys who take over an airport's communication system around the holidays. Unless their demands are met, they will unceremoniously plummet planes to the ground one by one -- including one on which Mrs. McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) is a passenger. Of course Johnny, he of wise-cracking ways, is the only one who can save the day.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, set almost entirely in a skyscraper, DIE HARD 2 makes the most out of its setting. McClane is as multi-purpose as can be, chasing mercenaries through luggage conveyors, grasping onto aircraft wings, running out onto the runway and, in a truly awesome scene, ejecting from a plane a split second before it bursts into flames. Throw in a snowmobile chase, the standard trip through the air ducts and a legitimate, interesting motivation for the crooks and you have a total thrill ride guaranteed to recharge your batteries.<br/><br/>Efforts like DIE HARD 2 won't win any major awards, but they'll do what films are supposed to do: thrust us into another world and entertain us. This is truly Willis and director Renny Harlin at their best."
"trevor-41","Null","101","136","5 March 2001"," You can't get too much of a good thing
","For those who argue that Die Hard 2 is a desperate re-hash of the original... So what?  I didn't expect a companion piece like The Godfather Part II.  Die Hard was about a really cool guy in a really bad situation, and the result was probably the greatest action movie ever made.  Die Hard 2 achieves status on its own just by being about the same thing. When so many movies want to be Die Hard but fail, why not just make another Die Hard? Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger)realized that because it's a sequel, there had to be more stunts and explosions. So there is.  Die Hard 2 (appropriately called Die Harder) ups the ante a bit and has fun with a flurry of furious action scenarios.  The fight on the wing of the plane is a classic in its own right, and Die Hard 2 stands alone as one of the best of the genre."
"Old Joe","9","84","114","6 March 2001"," Dying Just Got That Little Harder!
","I have watched many movies where they have had a sequel which left me disappointed and uneasy, but the sequel to the smash, Die Hard, Die Hard 2 (Die Harder) was what think a sequel should be - more of what made the first film so successful. So its all out war for unlucky Police Detective named McClane, in a heart-stopping, jet-propelled journey through excitement and terror.<br/><br/>On a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation's capital, a team of terrorist have seized a major international airport, and now holds thousands of holiday travellers hostage. The terrorists, a renegade band of crack military commandos led by murderous rogue officer, have come to rescue a drug lord from justice. They've prepared for every contingency, except one: John McClane, an off-duty cop seized by a feeling of deadly deja vu. The heroic cop not only has to battle terrorists, but also an incompetent airport police chief, the hard headed commander of the army's anti-terrorist squad and a deadly winter snowstorm. The runways are littered with death and destruction, and McClane is in a race against time. His wife is trapped on one of the planes circling somewhere overhead, desperately low on fuel!<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 makes Bruce Willis look better and better. The role of John McClane is one filled with the fight for right and to trying to stop the bad guys. Again a lot of the stunts would have been done by Willis considering the professionalism of the man. Running all over an airport in a fierce snowstorm, fighting scenes on the wing of a real 747 jet and trying to save lives he has no attachment to, L.A. cop John McClane puts his body on the line, so justice is served and so did the actor Bruce Willis in my view to bring a great action movie back for a second time. Willis is one of my favourite actors, but I have only started to watch his movies in about the last 2-3 years and what a mistake that has been.   <br/><br/>This film has more freedom as it is held at an airport. McClane is like I have said all over the place. The freedom and space this story has makes this film much easier to watch. Another thing which is impressive about Die Hard 2 is the effort to put more thrills in the movie. The snow (which of course is man made) has a major role, so do all the planes making quite a crisis on their hands. Not only do they fight on the wing of a 747, but also fly a real helicopter on the wing of the plane also. The scene where McClane ejects himself from the exploding plane is another favourite scene of mine. Other parts of this movie which stunned me I wont tell you about as it will give too much away, but trust me they are exceptionally done.<br/><br/>Again the bad guys have a major role in this one. William Saddler is Colonial Stuart, a heartless leader, who only cares that a drug lord escapes and can get in on all the money making scheme. I loved his role in this. Another face that I remember in Die hard 2 who was a bad guy is Robert Patrick. I loved his role in Terminator 2. But the conflict between the good guys is extremely tense. Especially between McClane and Police Officer Lorenzo played by L.A law star Dennis Franz. It is hard to understand if this character is on the side for good or not. <br/><br/>Here comes another analogy on Die Hard 2, do you ever know who is on the side of good or bad? Well for at least three quarters of the film it is unsure. The storywriters need to be commended because the story left me intrigued and when you think you know what is about to happen, the circumstances change. Also having a different director, gave this sequel new prospective. Director Renny Harlin threw his hand into the ring. What a gamble? An unknown director, but to my surprise I say that it worked. His other films worth mentioning include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and Cliffhanger. <br/><br/>So overall Die Hard 2 was extremely enjoyable sequel to watch. The story, the characters and the situation are all of a great tension, which I love in a movie. So one cop who is so vulnerable and emotional ends up being the one person who you would most like to have save your life. Like Willis said in an interview Die Hard 2 - Die Harder - it's bigger, badder and louder. I will leave you with one question, the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die, can you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn around!<br/><br/>Rating: 4/5 or 9/10"
"Gislef","8","68","105","18 December 1998"," It's No Die Hard 1...
","...but other than that, there's very little going against the second in the series.  It helps (but not enough) that the character realizes he's basically in a sequel.  There are some minor variations in the formula, but basically the movie relies on the Bruce Willis' charisma and humor, and elaborate action sequences.  William Sadler is okay, but no Alan Rickman (or Jeremy Irons in #3).  It's still enjoyable, though."

","Bruce Willis returns as John McClane who this time faces off against mercenaries who have taken over an airport and are threatening to have all the plane crashes, McClane's wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia) is on one such plane and so it's McClane back in action as he ponders how the same thing can happen to the same guy twice. Die Hard 2 to tell you the truth was a mixed bag. On one hand it had lots of action and a brutal edge to the action but also lacks the suspense of the first. In either case though Die Hard 2 is not bad as sequels go. Indeed even though it's directed by Renny Harlin, Die Hard 2 works in-spite of itself. The only flaw is that the movie is feels too much like a carbon copy of the first film only with a bigger is better approach to the stunts. That being said this is a minor flaw to behold and one really doesn't understand the mixed reaction to this film, when the movie is overall very entertaining.<br/><br/>* * * out of 4-(Good)"
"Agent10","7","54","83","15 May 2002"," A strong follow-up to the original
","I was expecting the worse when I saw this film, but this movie seemed to escape the curse of the cheesy sequel. Just as action packed and enthralling as the original, the wit displayed in this film saved it from being a mediocre follow-up. Bruce Willis was once again a great hero, showing how little being considered a hero means to him. A good film with a great plot twist, this is one of those action films which is just as good as the original."
"virek213","7","29","42","2 October 2002"," Die Harder--And More Violently
","The 1988 action thriller DIE HARD was such a huge critical, commercial, and artistic success that it was probably inevitable, given Hollywood's mentality that there is never too much of a good thing, that a sequel would follow.  The result, thus, is DIE HARD 2.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, who on this Christmas Eve is at Dulles International Airport in Washington awaiting the arrival of his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) from Los Angeles.  Flights, however, are being delayed all across the board into D.C. by one of the biggest blizzards on record.  And when Willis spots Army mercenaries in sensitive areas of the airport where nobody is supposed to go, his cop instincts take hold.  As it turns out, these mercenaries are led by a hard-nosed right-wing colonel (William Sadler) whose aim is to snatch a known Latin-American drug dealer (Franco Nero) from the hands of U.S. justice agents.  Their reason, as Sadler puts it, is because he had ""the guts to stand up against Communist aggression.""  To prove his point, Sadler and his minions shut the entire airport down, putting all those planes in the snowbound skies over the nation's capital in mortal peril, until Nero's military plane arrives.  The result is a battle in more ways than one, as Willis must not only tangle with Sadler's gang, but also with an incompetent airport cop (Dennis Franz) who thinks Willis is a lunatic.<br/><br/>Very solid acting from Willis, as well as Fred Dalton Thompson and Art Evans, who portray the two sympathetic airport officials, helps DIE HARD 2 remain leagues ahead of the majority of testosterone-laden action flicks. But many of the same flaws that were in DIE HARD 1 creep up here again.  To paint the airport cops as incompetent buffoons just so that Willis can be the hero of the piece is grossly inaccurate and offensive.  Even the media, in the guise of the ultra-obnoxious Dick Thornberg (William Atherton), gets slammed, and not in a very fair or accurate fashion.  And the violence and language in DIE HARD 2 are far more pervasive than the original, with at least two scenes (the icepick to the eye; and Sadler's ex-commander [John Amos] getting sucked into the engine of the getaway 747 at the end) approaching extreme in terms of bloodshed, and the use of the 'F' word approaching SCARFACE in terms of occasions when it is used.<br/><br/>Still, there is plenty of suspense and tension to be had here, with the direction of Renny Harlin evincing, at times, the feel of a Spielberg or Peckinpah at their edge-of-the-seat best.  Michael Kamen's score, which interpolates Jean Sibelius' ""Finlandia"" at the end, is also a plus.<br/><br/>The verdict is that DIE HARD 2: DIE HARDER is not an unflawed film, but one can certainly do much worse."
"OFG-Movie","5","80","133","26 March 2006"," Exciting Action Film with a Totally Unbelievable Premise
","I have no problems with the action in this movie. The acting is fine and the characters are interesting. Add the plot twists and you have a watchable entertaining movie that is worth your time.<br/><br/>What caused me to rate this film a couple of stars lower that I would have otherwise is an idiotic part of the plot. Airliners are stacked up over Dulles and the tower can't communicate with them. Their radio engineer comes up with the idea of rigging the outer marker beacon to transmit a voice communication to all of the aircraft apprising them of the situation. Meanwhile the Army is being called by phone, TV news crews are transmitting back to their stations and ground vehicles are moving in and out of the airport. If one can communicate by phone, TV link and ground, why not just get hold of the regional traffic center to alert the airliners and divert them to other airports. Meanwhile John McClane's wife is on board one of these planes and it has 90 min of fuel on-board. Hmmm, 90 minutes at 500 mph. gives one lots of time and distance to find some kind of alternate destination. But alas, that would ruin the plot line of John trying to save his wife once more from certain death. This hole in the plot is big enough to fly an Airbus A380 through."
"axlrhodes","8","6","7","28 September 2008"," A solid sequel
","Like the Lethal Weapon films of the late 80's and early 90's i found the Die Hard films to be very satisfying action entertainment.Much seems to be made of this sequel being inferior to its predecessor but i thought that it matched Die Hard for scale and has some breathtaking moments of action.Bruce Willis is still on top form as our hero and the airport setting during the busy Christmas period gives the film a positive buzz and a certain sense of hyperactivity.Although the film is missing a villain as much fun as Alan Rickmans Hans Gruber,William Sadler is nonetheless bad enough to hate and actually turns out a lot more ruthless than Gruber.In summary director Renny Harlin has succeeded in making a quick paced film that retains the sense of scale felt in the first film whilst making the most of Bruce Willis comic timing and action man charisma. 8/10"

Bruce has lots of funny moments in this one, he has to be sort of like McGyver in this one,, trying to come up with different ways to outwit the street smart terrorists, and o yeah there is a twist in this movie,, but i can't ruin it ,, in good conscience."

","""Die Hard 2"" is the first sequel to one of the best and iconic action films from Hollywood, returning Bruce Willis as NYPD Officer John McClane, who tries to go a ruthless band of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (William Sadler). They are taking the entire airport hostage and have seized control of all its electrical equipment, meaning planes couldn't land and runways have no lights (McClane's wife Holly is on one of the planes). The terrorists' mission is to rescue drug lord Gen. Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) from justice.<br/><br/>Willis' witty and deadpan delivery personality continue in this movie, along with his never-say-die attitude and relentless attacks on the bad guys. Sadler gave a ""love-to-hate-him"" performance of the main villain, making the audience root against him. I think he and his terrorist group are even more cruel than the villains from the previous film; ***spoiler ahead*** just the part where they bring down one of the jet-liners with dozens of innocent civilians on board is one of the most disturbing scenes I have seen in action movies ***spoiler ends***.<br/><br/>Bonnie Bedelia did a great job as Holly Gennaro. Even though her role is secluded in an airplane, she gave a fearless and witty performance. And, albeit in a cameo role, Reginald VelJohnson gave a memorable performance as Sgt. Al Powell.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great sequel full of suspense, thrills and twists and turns. The special and sound effects were awesome and the solids plot made this another edge-of-your-seat ride that is perfect for any action movie fans! <br/><br/>Grade A"
"amwcsu","2","22","37","2 February 2005"," Logic and intelligence from the first film is gone!
","The plot of the terrorists reeking havoc at Dulles International Ariport seems to be a challenging, yet interesting plot. Action sequences are definitely ""Die Hard""...well authentically to say the least. It wasn't as intelligent and intense as the original. This movie in general had a: ""Seen it! Been there, Done that!"" feel to it.<br/><br/>Spoilers Detected!!! The only intense moments in the entire movie was when the plane full of holiday travelers crashed, exploding on impact and McClane ejects from the plane set to explode within seconds. THAT'S IT! Other than that it's has no more action than Airport disaster films of the 1970's!<br/><br/>What really doesn't make any sense is the middle to the end of the film. The planes have no other option except circle the airport until they run out of fuel. Are you kidding me? There has to be dozens of alternative airports to land at from Logan in Boston to Charlotte, North Carolina! Did this director fail geography as a kid or something, because he seems to be very ignorant of eastern seaboard. Why must they all land at Dulles; was there a law? No it was Hollywood Logic: ""They must have something to tie the movie together"" Seriously dude, you've could have done a lot better! Get this! The jumbo jets land in a field big enough for a number of them. What? How? Without crashing into one another or collapsing the landing gear? Impossible! What kind of narcotic was Renny Harlin huffing, snorting, and/or drinking when he directed this? Was he drunk or in La La Land? Another weird moment is when some of the evacuated passengers are not wearing any shoes! You're in a snow field and it's cold enough to form deadly icicles(below 32F) why would you be without any shoes and protection from a coat? Ever heard of frostbite and hypothermia ?! Give me a break! The planes weren't in any danger surely they would have time to grab a coat or something, Jeez!<br/><br/>Sadly, Die Harder joins the universal hall of fame for cheesy airport disaster melodramas that only a mediocre Hollywood director like this bozo and a ratings hungry bastard of a 24-hour news network can only fantasize about. I can't believe that I actually wanted to buy this movie on VHS!"
"BrandtSponseller","8","13","20","16 May 2005"," Die Silly
","Series note: It is not necessary to watch Die Hard (1988) before this film. However, that is the better film and it will give you a better introduction to the continuing characters, so it is still recommendable to watch the first film before this one.<br/><br/>Set an unspecified number of years after Die Hard (I'll call it ""Die Hard 1""), Die Hard 2 has John McClane (Bruce Willis) just outside of Washington, D.C. on Christmas Eve, where he is waiting for his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), to arrive at Dulles International Airport from Los Angeles so they can visit her mother for the holidays. Holly calls John from the plane to tell him that they're a half-hour behind schedule. While he's waiting in the crowded airport, he first sees a man he recognizes but can't place (it turns out to be one of the villains), then sees a couple other suspicious men heading into the restricted baggage area. He follows them in, has a confrontation, and eventually learns that one is a special ops military guy whose records say he's been dead for two years. That cues him in to the fact that something big is going to go down (as if he couldn't tell based on the fact that he's in another Die Hard film). Since a bigwig cocaine dealer from Latin America is on his way to Washington for extradition, that's a pretty big clue regarding what is about to go down. Shortly after chaos ensues, as ""terrorists"" take control of Dulles with dozens of planes in the air and no place to land--they're not able to talk to the tower, use their instruments properly or conduct a visual landing. How will they resolve the situation? <br/><br/>I'm not one to subtract points for a lack of realism, or ""real world believability"" in films. Because of that, Die Hard 2 poses a very interesting case study for me. Real world believability is very difficult to not think about when watching this film. Why wouldn't the planes just reroute to other nearby airports? There are a bunch less than an hour's flight away, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, the three New York City-area airports, and so on. Why wouldn't they be able to call another close airport, or the Pentagon, or somewhere else nearby to have them contact the planes? They're near Washington, D.C., after all (don't forget that Dulles is 26 miles away from D.C., in Virginia, making it unlikely that planes out of fuel would begin ""dropping on the White House lawn""). It seems like maybe this film should have been set somewhere like Salt Lake City, Utah instead. Why wouldn't they be able to show the runways through some other means, like a line of emergency or police vehicles with their sirens on? If the ""terrorists"" started shooting at the vehicles, or trying to blow them up, at least they'd be given an indication where the fire is coming from/given their location. Just how likely would it be that there's a big storm in the area on the day when General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) is being extradited? How likely is it that he'd be extradited on Christmas Eve? Why the hell is John standing out on the runway in the snow waving a couple of flaming poles--just what does he think that will do? And we can go on and on.<br/><br/>In the above, it becomes clear that maybe the problem isn't real-world believability but internal logic, although to an extent, some of the internal logic is extremely difficult to separate from facts we know about the real world that aren't mentioned in the film. But Die Hard 1 was an extremely taut film that had impeccable internal logic. The film itself gave reasons for the dilemmas that arose, and they were justifications that made the dilemmas inevitable. It doesn't matter that some of the ""facts"" or situations in Die Hard 1 were contrary to our beliefs about the real world. The film defined things to be the fictional way it defined them, and the logic was consistent and valid (in the formal sense) from within the film.<br/><br/>However, it becomes clear, not too far into Die Hard 2, that perhaps looking at it for things like real-world believability and logical consistency/validity is misconceiving it. My belief is that this film is meant to be a spoof of action films as much as it is meant to be a serious action film. _That's_ why John is standing out on the runway waving around flaming poles like a maniac. That's why baddies can easily shoot and kill 20 or so highly trained, highly armed S.W.A.T. team members wearing bulletproof vests but can't hit John, who is wearing street clothes and rolling around on the floor with a pistol. That's why the planes are stuck over D.C. with no options and the film doesn't even try to justify this. That's why there are scenes of John ""riding explosions"" like a cowboy (yippee-ki-yay mf'er indeed). That's why there are a number of ""wink-wink"" cracks about being in another Die Hard film. That's why there are a few scenes that look oddly similar to Airplane! (1980). That's why the film so frequently, joyously embraces silliness.<br/><br/>Director Renny Harlin and his bulletproof vested army of scriptwriters and producers apparently set out to make a cartoonish satire of action films, while still making a serious action film. In 1990, action films were just at the tail end of their domination of the U.S. box office, so it was a ripe time to spoof them. Harlin and company succeed fairly well. It might have been even more artistically successful if they had more firmly committed to one angle (cartoonish satire) or the other (serious actioner), but the performances are pretty good, the fistfights, gunfights, explosions and chases are very good, and the film is frequently funny if you have a taste for the absurd."
"scubergmu","6","29","52","13 September 2004"," Not Enough Respect for the Audience
","Okay, I have one big problem with this sequel to Die Hard. The movie was entertaining at times with McClain taking on more bad-ass terrorists and their ultra-elaborate plan. But unlike the first film in this series, this particular entry was utterly preposterous. Sure, the action of the first was huge and explosive itself, but in the scheme of the movie it always basically made sense. In Die Hard 2 though, there were individual scenes that made no sense, and a plot with holes so big you could fly a 747 through them. I do not mean to be the overly discriminating film reviewer who knit-picks at technical details and writes the movie off as a result. No, if you see one or even a handful of discrepancies, things that violate reality, you dismiss them. But this movie is just a series of them, over and over and over. I mean, how can you shut your brain off that much and just sit back and enjoy the action, when the movie couldn't happen in a million years for reasons that you don't even have to be some kind of expert to be conscious of. For example, at the beginning of the movie, National Airport is shut down because of the snow and you hear airport controllers discussing how they will be taking over its flight load. So my question is, if the terrorists disable Dulles, couldn't the reverse occur? How could the terrorists have counted on National being shut down for a snowstorm when they'd been planning for months? And then of course there is Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI), which was never even mentioned of course, that may have come in handy for people trying to land planes circling over DC. Also, how can they expect us to believe that the planes circling overhead are doomed to crash in two hours when they run out of fuel, when a flight from DC to Memphis, Philly, New York, or Atlanta takes less than that. And of course, why couldn't the controllers have transmitted to the planes using radios in planes that were already on the ground? My point is, you just can't sidestep reality in such a plethora of ways and expect an audience to follow you through the whole plot. If you have to do that so much to make your movie work then perhaps it never should have been made. Oh yeah, and having John McClain simply say at one point, 'How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?', doesn't successfully negate the fact the odds on that are too infinitesimal to even be contemplated. So, bottom line, it had too many holes to be enjoyable, even though it was only trying to entertain with a series of explosions. The first movie was so much more plausible, and that's why people actually buy the first one by itself. I have a feeling the vast majority of Die Hard 2 owners bought it as part of the trilogy set, mostly as a means of seeing the other two.<br/><br/>P.S. I almost forgot about the grenades that took 20+ seconds to explode. Riiiiigghhht."

","After the terrifying events in LA, John McClane is about to go through it all again. A team of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart is holding the entire airport hostage. The terrorists are planning to rescue a drug lord from justice. In order to do so, they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes. With no runway lights available, all aircraft have to remain in the air, with fuel running low, McClane will need to be fast.<br/><br/>This is a Die Hard film so it must be entertaining, right? You are correct! Am I afraid to say this film is even better than the first film? No way! I'm going to say it right now! THIS FILM IS BETTER THAN THE FIRST!<br/><br/>Now getting that out of the way, this is what you expect from a sequel: Bigger set pieces, more body counts, more and bigger explosions, many more people, and the same old McClane! However, it does surprise me that the film doesn't have as much action as the first film. If I look back correctly, McClane isn't an action hero until the last 10 minutes of the film!<br/><br/>Now that isn't a bad thing. I'm kind of glad that it's different. This is an entertaining summer movie! Now changing my attitude, this film suffers from what the first one did: A long runtime. The movie overstays its welcome for about 30 minutes, and I mean it. I would've liked it to be a tight packed, fast-paced, action movie but whatever.<br/><br/>Now what can I say about the performances? Bruce Willis plays the same character, flawlessly. It's really good! William Sadler, I guess, is a decent antagonist. Nothing really stands out for me except for him practicing to fight naked.<br/><br/>What can you expect from this? Well, not necessarily more action scenes from Bruce Willis. Still, this film is a lot of fun to watch, although it overstayed its welcome. There are also some memorable lines. With everything mostly bigger, although not better, but in this case it is, this film is better than the first film but not the fourth."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","24","44","2 August 2004"," There is no comparison to the first Die Hard, but this was still a fun sequel!
","John McClane is back! I had heard a few bad things about Die Hard 2, I was a bit nervous to see this film just because of that. But I think it was just because of the fact that a lot of people really compare it to the first Die Hard, like I said there really is no comparison, the first Die Hard was an absolute blast and can't be beat. However, Die Hard 2 is a little looked over, it's still a great sequel in my opinion. It has great action, the same fun characters, and an awesome story. While it was somewhat bland compared to the first Die Hard, this was a fun movie to watch I think.<br/><br/>John McClane is back to square one in life, his wife doesn't like him very much right now since he hasn't kept his promises. But she is coming into town for a report and John is there to pick her up. But things are quickly interrupted when Col. Stuart takes control of the airport with high demands of money and power. Unfortunately he doesn't realize who he's messing with when he is aware of John's wife being aboard of one of the planes. Since the airport's power is now out, the planes cannot land and are quickly running out of gas to keep them going. John is on the case though and isn't going to let Col. Stuart get away with this.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is a cool movie in my books. William Sadler made a good villain, he's really intense looking and got into character very well. I loved how this movie ended, Holly really kicked more butt in this film. But it is Bruce who really wins the movie over, he's even more bad than ever before, he's just so awesome, you can't help but to keep rooting for him. Not to mention one of the most memorable lines ever ""Yippe-Kia-Mother-"", you get it, but he's the only one that could deliver that line right. I would recommend this movie for anyone, just give it a shot, it's pretty good.<br/><br/>7/10"
"TheDarkKnghtIsSoCrap","10","7","10","8 June 2009"," An unmissable relic of the superb 1990...
","Like any big budget action movie made with a strict summer release deadline,Die Hard 2 is by no means flawless. It is rife with appalling continuity and colossal factual inaccuracy,but to me at least,it is nonetheless one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces in existence and yes,I'm afraid I really do mean that!(meant to be a new paragraph here but IMDb processor won't let me separate it) In Die Hard 2,John Mclane(Bruce Willis) is in Dulles international airport on a snowy Christmas eve,awaiting the arrival of his wife Holly(Bonnie Bedellia) by airplane. Trouble is afoot as a group of terrorists,lead by the Nefarious Colonel Stuart(William Saddler,The Shawshank Redemption),take up position in a nearby church and hack into the airport's control tower,switching off the runway lights. All the incoming planes have no place to land. The terrorists objective is to free a Political prisoner,a deposed dictator of a fictitious Latin American country and a drug-lord,who is on his way to Dulles. The terrorists refuse to release their grip on the airport until they are provided with a fully fueled plane to take them and their drug-lord friend to freedom and threaten to misguide the planes into a fiery demise if the airport authorities try to interfere with their plans. Mclane stumbles upon the bad guys' operation and with hundreds of lives at stake,including that of his wife and with an inept airport police chief that doesn't buy his analysis of the situation,it turns out to be more or less up to Mclane himself to save the day.<br/><br/>In his role as the iconic action hero John Mclane,Bruce Willis shoots and brawls his perilous way through an all out battle against a band of ruthless mercenaries. From a technical standpoint,Die Hard 2 is a breakthrough piece of work that should not be missed by special effects enthusiasts. The standout set pieces include three nail biting plane explosions,one in which you get to see Mclane narrowly escape a plane full of frag grenades just seconds before it explodes by using an ejector seat with a parachute. Also on display is an insane practical stunt in which Bruce Willis actually jumps onto the wing of an airplane from a helicopter,followed by a brutal melee fight and...well I won't spoil it. Last but not least is the amazingly lifelike matte painting at the end of the movie depicting the chaotic emergency landing site of half a dozen jet airliners,filled with ambulances and firetrucks and with hundreds of people seamlessly inserted into the picture. This is one state of the art effects movie,even more so considering the time it was made.<br/><br/>The many supporting characters of Die Hard 2 are effectively brought to life thanks to good casting and dialog. Perhaps most worthy of mention is the slimy,selfish TV news reporter Dick Thornburg)William Atherton, Ghostbusters) who returns from the first Die Hard movie only to show us that he is still entirely lacking any morals or decency. Another positive performance is that of John Amos as the no nonsense,battle hardened leader of the Army Special Forces team sent in to bring down the bad guys.<br/><br/>After the first Die Hard became a substantial hit in 1988,fans were expecting the sequel to be just as violent and adult orientated, so the creators of Die Hard 2 comfortably threw in a few particularly nasty death scenes here and there. It's not just people getting shot this time around. Die Hard 2 is certainly a more mean spirited movie than it's predecessor.<br/><br/>As the plot of the movie unfolds,each revelation leads to a new deadly action scenario. The middle of the film is very dark and and sobering and things really do keep getting worse from then on until the time comes for Mclane's joyfully absurd final showdown with the baddies. While it's pretty obvious by now that the film ends victoriously for good guys,the crisis is not solved en masse like many other such films. More cleverly, the loose ends fall into place one by one,which triples the suspense and relief.<br/><br/>Most movie enthusiasts with good knowledge of the genre would probably agree that the 80s and 90s were the golden years of action cinema. Things just aren't the way they used to be nowadays. The PG-13 rating has defaced the Alien, Predator, Die Hard and now the Terminator series. If you don't mind it that way then good for you. Your majority held opinion is in control of the movie industry,but if like me you prefer to have your blood and your F words,your in for one damn good treat if you've not seen Die Hard 2."
"hnt_dnl","3","14","24","19 June 2009"," Severely unequal sequel!
","DIE HARD 2 is a prime example that, in terms of film-making, in general, you can't top the original. Resistance is essentially futile! Hindsight and retrospect is a son of a gun! There have been many cases where I was immediately fooled by a sequel that had more packed in it (longer, bigger, more characters, more effects, more action, etc.) thinking with something other than my common sense! When I first saw DIE HARD 2 back in 1990 (the year it came out), I thought:<br/><br/>""Oh, it's not confined to that building and is instead in a big airport (Dulles), so it's got to be better! <br/><br/>""McClane gets to move around more, doesn't have to walk around barefoot, gets to interact with a lot of people, so it will be less uncomfortable.""<br/><br/>""The action can be more spread out and is not restrictive. So it's got to be better.""<br/><br/>Wrong, wrong, and wrong!<br/><br/>Again, with hindsight and repeated viewing, DIE HARD 2 continually gets downgraded by me as what is wrong with most Hollywood action movies, especially nowadays.<br/><br/>What I realize is that part of the brilliance of the original DIE HARD was it's claustrophobic nature and that by limiting the action to that one skyscraper, it allows everything to be more personal, centrally located, and focused. You had to have everything happen in that one building, so you couldn't cheat or fool the audience. By design, the filmmakers had to come up with original ideas. In a situation like DIE HARD 2, there is action HERE, THERE, and EVERYWHERE to the point of just a bunch of the same action scenes, each with non-quotable, stupid dialogue and one-liners. The action in DIE HARD 2 is not unique, nor are any of the situations scary or tense, as they were in DIE HARD.<br/><br/>Our hero is once again John McClane (played by the reliable action hero Bruce Willis, but this time in a thankless situation) and as previously stated, he is at Dulles Airport in D.C. waiting his wife Holly's (Bonnie Bedelia again) arriving plane so they can meet her parents for Christmas. A bad snowstorm has caused so that even planes at nearby airports must re-route to Dulles. This time, as opposed to in the original DIE HARD, these terrorists are actual terrorists, a group of U.S. military expatriates who plan to seize control of Dulles and force them to have the plane of a political prisoner routed to a special runway. This group is led by Col. Stuart (played by William Sadler). This is another huge problem with DIE HARD 2. The main villain is not effective. While in DIE HARD, Hans Gruber was truly diabolical, smart, charming, and relentless, Stuart in DIE HARD 2 is pretty much just a stock villain who has an eternal scowl on his face with no distinguishing characteristics. Very monotone character. Also, Stuart strangely doesn't seem to be fazed or surprised about McClane's involvement in trying to stop him, which I find unrealistic.<br/><br/>Another problem is that whereas DIE HARD had a core of memorable supporting characters (Holly, Hans, Karl, Powell, Robinson, Thornburg, etc.) each with some character believability and depth, DIE HARD 2 is populated with virtually all annoying characters (the airport personnel led by Fred Dalton Thompson and Dennis Franz are spectacularly idiotic; at least in DIE HARD, even though Robinson wasn't too bright, he had legitimate reason to believe that McClane might not be on the up and up; these airport guys had no excuse, so why waste the whole 2 hours arguing with him!). Also, I found most of the more minor characters like the flight attendants on Holly's plane, the female news reporter following McClane around like his pet, that creepy drunk guy working in the underground part of the airport, etc. all annoying.<br/><br/>Then you have John Amos (playing an Army major and a former colleague of Col. Stuart's) and his military squad pop in to save the day at the last minute, but again, it is not exciting or tense at all. In fact, with all the action in DIE HARD 2, none of it is thrilling, just by-the-numbers fare: fake-looking fights and machine guns going off all over the place, but without the style, flair, and, dare I say, ""realism"" of DIE HARD. The action situations in the original were more sparse, believable, and well-staged.<br/><br/>But the biggest offense of DIE HARD 2 is the cringe-inducing dialogue. It is really bad. One of the reasons many of the characters come off so bland, monotone, and annoying. I mean, it is unintentionally laughable. ALL characters are a victim to it. And finally, amazingly, although it came out only 2 years later, this sequel seems way more dated than the original. In fact, the original doesn't seem dated at all to me. DIE HARD 2 is just a mindless action flick."
"Tehmeh","5","13","22","9 December 2007"," Worst of the four.
","I got the DVD-box which contains all four Die Hard-movies. I watched them all again, leaving this one for the last. <br/><br/>There aren't many successful franchises around with 3rd and 4th movie being better than the second. Die Hard has made the exception.<br/><br/>I was entertained by the three other movies, being able to forgive some silliness and just enjoy the action and the characters. Die Hard 2 just made me uncomfortable several times.<br/><br/>The whole idea is good enough, and the settings aren't that bad. Some plot twists are decent. Some action scenes don't suck. That's it.<br/><br/>Main character McClane is handled poorly. He's too serious when he should crack some jokes, and tries to be funny at wrong times. It feels cheap after the first movie. At least the third one, ""Die Hard with a Vengeance"", took McClane back on track with a sense of self-irony. Dennis Franz probably hated his role, being a cliché-filled anti-McClane officer.<br/><br/>The plot holes and other stupid scenes don't help much. I'm not expecting a reality-fest from a Die Hard-movie, but come on. I didn't know crap about radio communication or grenades when I was twelve when I first saw this movie, but even then I managed to hang my head against a wall in shame for my fellow countryman Renny Harlin.<br/><br/>But who cares when you got action, right? Umm, yeah. You get explosions, frequent slo-mo deaths, bad fist-fights, dull chase scenes and McClane shooting as bad as the bad guys, just to break some lamps and decorate the walls. I didn't get the ""evil grin"" on my face, not once. In the first movie, that grin was on my face all the time.<br/><br/>But, when you got a character like McClane, you can't totally screw it up. I watched this one from the beginning to the end without getting drunk and R-rated violence is always better than PG13-pudding. I would still like to pretend that this sequel never existed (like the following sequels do), but I can't. It is part of the beloved Die Hard-franchise, and that alone makes this film better than it deserves to be. And I'm glad that I watched this movie again, now I'm sure that I won't have to do it again. <br/><br/>edit: Die Hard 5 doesn't count. That's not a Die Hard-movie."

I love the main villain much more than ""Hans Gruber"" in Die Hard, here we have the Brilliant William Sadler as a cold blooded killer named ""Col. Stuart"" & his performance is great as he plays it serious & sinister plus I've always been a big William Sadler fan & love his intense performances in films such as the urban survival Thriller ""Trespass"" from 1992 & the Tales from the Crypt Horror movie ""Demon Knight"" from 1995 & the crazy fantasy comedy sequel ""Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey"" from 1991, Sadler is a great underrated actor.<br/><br/>The Airport setting is exciting & atmospheric, the dead of winter plays a big special part with it's festive Christmas theme, the tone is fun & brutal action, this is a thrilling movie even more so than the Classic first film!!!
I also prefer the cool wisecracking tough ""John Mclane"" here played obviously by Bruce Willis, i like the Action set pieces best here & the edgd of the seat thriller elements like the planes running out of fuel idea & the double crossing of good guy soldiers are actually plotting terrorists, there's a great story here & more excitement this time around.<br/><br/>This is similar to other sequels that i genuinely like just as much if not more than the first films such as ""Robocop 2"" & ""Ghostbusters 2"" & ""Predator 2"" & ""Gremlins 2"" & ""Lethal weapon 2"" & ""Aliens"" & ""Mad Max 2"" & a few other's."

Good sequel that follows a similar style , humor and action . From the start to finish the action packed is unstopped and spectacular . Exciting screenplay that dispenses absurd excitement as well as amusement . Excellent thriller full of intrigue and tense, this is a fast-paced, stylized action-suspense film . The tension of this picture keeps snowballing as the clock ticks ever close for a groundbreaking as well as impressive final . As always , Bruce Willis is very fine as hilarious , sarcastic and intrepid cop . Secondary casting is frankly well , such as Franco Nero , William Atherton , Dennis Franz , Fred Dalton Thomson , Reginald VelJohnson , John Amos , Tom Bower , Sheila McCarthy , Don Harvey , a brief acting by John Leguizano and Robert Patick ; furthermore , William Sadler steals the show and takes honors as psychopath who attempts to turn the tables on the protagonist . Adequate and thrilling musical score accompanying the action by Michael Kamen . Inventively photographed by Oliver Wood ; most of the interior airport scenes were filmed in the Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International airport . In addition , some of the shots of the airport were filmed at the old Stapleton Airport in Denver, Colorado. <br/><br/>This big-budgeted motion picture was lavishly produced by Lawrence Binder and Joel Silver , being well directed by Renny Harlin . Renny edited this film and The adventures of Ford Fairlane at the same time because of the relatively short post-production period for both films and were then released one month apart . John McTiernan who directed ¨Die Hard¨ had planned to direct this film, but could not because of his commitment to directing Hunt for Red October . Renny Harlin is an expert on action genre such as ¨ Cliffhunger¨ , ¨Deep blue sea¨ , ¨Driven¨ , ¨Long kiss goodnight¨ , ¨12 rounds¨ and many others . Rating : Better than average thriller movie . The picture will appeal to frenetic action buffs and Bruce Willis fans ."

","*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS I don't understand the complains about ""Die hard 2 : Die harder"" . The first movie was almost a perfect action movie . It was obvious that sequel will be weaker , yet ""Die hard 2"" is a very satisfying sequel . It follows the formula that worked so well the first time : one hero - one place - many terrorists , wife in danger , nobody listens to him except a black guy and everything happens during Christmas . There is not a bit of new idea here . The only change is the new director – Renny Harlin , who took over John McTiernan (who was busy with ""The hunt for Red October"") . Harlin is a solid craftsman and he directs the movie professionally. The screenplay was once again written by Steven Souza and with a help from Doug Richardson.<br/><br/>I'm amazed by the complains about the violence and swearing . Look people , this is R rated movie . If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen. Maybe people who are obsessed with political correctness forgot about it , but in REAL LIFE people swear . A lot. And there isn't a single scene of unnecessary violence here . When you're fighting for life you don't exactly have time for subtlety. If you're looking for mindless violence watch one of those stupid ""Saw"" movies. And for god's sake there is no plot hole with the planes . You want to know why the airplanes didn't tried to land on other airports ? Because they had too little fuel and the weather was too bad. So , they had to stay in the air.<br/><br/>What I liked ? Bruce Willis is back as the wise cracking John McClane . So is Bonnie Bedelia as his wife. Reginald Veljohnson appears in a small episode as Al Powell. There are one dimensional , but fun characters : John Amos as the idiotic chef of airport security Carmine Lorenzo and Tom Bover as Marvin the wacky janitor. Souza has a sense of humor and there is a plenty of moments to laugh . The action scenes directed by Harlin are exciting and fun. The screenplay offers also some nice twists.<br/><br/>What I didn't liked ? I could live without the naked tai chi . There is one scene with the grenades that makes my head hurt. Those have to be the slowest grenades in the movie history. I don't understand why the airport crew cooperated with the terrorists , even after the terrorists lost their equipment and couldn't blackmail the airport anymore. Also , the movie lacks a really good main villain compared to Alan Rickman from ""Die hard"" or Jeremy Irons from ""Die hard 3"".<br/><br/>Anyway , it's a good continuation of McClane's story . There is nothing new here , but it's well executed. In the end it's one of those rare satisfying sequels. I give it 8/10."
"KG140NY","1","23","49","30 May 1999"," Easily the stupidest movie I've ever seen
","I've seen Ishtar.  I've seen Howard the Duck.  I've even seen Mortal Kombat II.  None of these hold a candle to the blatant stupidity of Die Hard II. The premise that you can hold planes hostage in the air over the area of the world with the MOST airports is pathetic.  Fer cryin' out loud Andrew's Airforce Base is a short drive from Dulles and that's where the president lands.<br/><br/>But what I love most about the movie is how the day that the day the terrorist uber-lord is going to land at Dulles??? the worst blizzard in the history of the world descends on the East Coast.  Good timing folks!  The terrorist plan involves millions of dollars in high-tech gear, a subverted American military unit, and enough ammunition to take down a third-world country.  My question:  why not spend $10,000 and bribe the pilot of the plane?  Doh!  Perhaps he would know how to aim a gun too!  For certain these highly trained terrorists didn't go to any NRA training camps.<br/><br/>To conclude my rant, I would just like to offer this:  What happens when a 200 lbs man in full combat gear is sucked into the engine of a jet-liner? You probably expect serious damage to the plane.  Maybe an explosion. After all, a 2 pound bird can take down a military jet.  Now what do you think happens in this movie?<br/><br/>Take a guess.  Perhaps you can enjoy this movie for humor value of the parallel universe physics.  Only Piccard saying 'end holodeck program' right before the credits could save this disaster of implausibility."

If those are your criteria for a good movie, then look no further.<br/><br/>But, my god, the movie is dumb. Nowhere is this more obvious than what passes for dialogue. If in doubt, curse. There's rarely a line of dialogue or an exchange that rings remotely true. I'm not looking for the Oxford debating society here; but this stuff is really embarrassing. What am I comparing it to? Since Fred Dalton is in DH2, let's compare it to Law & Order. A bad episode on L&O has more intelligent, human-sounding speech than this whole juvenile mess. And how about Dennis Franz. His role on NYPD Blue reminds us how compelling and intelligent a script can be. His lines here, indeed his entire role, are an embarrassment to his career. What have you done to my hero Andy Sipowicz? I understand that acting jobs like this pay the rent and this was probably a good gig for Franz. His role on the TV cop show is 3-dimensional and character driven. This is a cartoon. A 14-year old boy's fantasy of how a man sounds: loud, crude, bossy.<br/><br/>It's sad that this film made money. It's an indictment of the sophistication of movie audiences, and worse yet - it encourages the idiots who crank out this trash."

","The reins for the sequel to `Die Hard' are passed from John McTiernan to Renny Harlin and although Harlin is McTiernan's equal technically, he fails to bring McTiernan's subtlety to a project badly in need of it. Part of the problem, it should be noted, is with the script (written by Steven E. deSouza--who also co-wrote the original--and Doug Richardson) which ignores the element of chance that the first was predicated on; here, Detective John McClane uses his super-sleuth skills to uncover a plot to commandeer Washington's Dulles Airport by a soldier of fortune (William Sadler, no Alan Rickman, sorry to say) and the thing just kind of lumbers off from there. Harlin, though, concentrates far too heavily on gory situations and shocking premises (the destruction of a jetliner filled with passengers, for example) to make the ride enjoyable and though there is great satisfaction in the climax, there's simply too much to detest and not nearly enough audience involvement."

Switch channels and find Die Hard on, and you're likely to linger, even though you've seen it several times before.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is, by comparison, utter garbage. While the scenario in Die Hard was pretty unlikely, that didn't matter too much - here, the entire premise of the film (hijacking an entire airport, rather than a building) is fundamentally flawed. As if the pilots would continue to circle as their tanks ran dry, with three or four other airports within minutes; as if the folks on the ground couldn't use different radio frequencies to transmit to the planes; as if... well, you get the picture.<br/><br/>There were fewer characters to care about, either - the whole thing had a formulaic, going-through-the-motions feel about it. One to be avoided when flipping channels, unless you enjoy ranting at the TV."
"Adrian_G_Pop","1","13","26","27 May 1999"," Poetic license is one thing, the plot is so implausible as to go and see Jesus walk on water down on the duck pond!
","Frankly, this film was so pathetic, I feel that some comments need to be mentioned. Firstly, all the controllers had to do to avoid the entire situation was to use one of the radios on board any aircraft on the ground. This is very easy to accomplish. Regardless of what is happening on the ground, the aircraft commander is responsible for his aircraft, and as such is not going to circle/hold until he/she runs out of fuel. That is the main reason aviation regulations stipulates holding fuel and diversion fuel. Aircraft fuel Jet A1 is basically wide cut paraffin and as such in cold weather a bucket-full could be used to DOUSE a small fire. It needs to be atomised to combust properly. A two hundred pound man running through a jet engine would do a lot more than just make pretty colours on the fuselage. A coat trapped in the inboard ailerons could be freed from the flight deck by turning the control wheel in the opposite direction and let the airflow remove it. All ILS (Instrument Landing Procedures) have a check height over the marker at approximately three degree glideslope so two hundred feet low should be picked up very early during the approach. Even depicting a three engined tri-star L1011 externally and a B747 cockpit kills the realism. Need I say more! If one could turn back time, then I suggest that this film be removed from the bowels of the film vaults to never be shown again. It is a shame that Bruce willis was expected to carry this pathetic excuse for a film for almost two hours."

","This follow-up to the brilliant Die Hard could have been so much more. But once a British Airways plane had been crashed into the ground and 400-odd people had died, no victory of McClaine's could seem remotely satisfying. This moment may well be the biggest murder scene of the whole 80's/90's action film genre and gives the film one of the highest body counts of it.<br/><br/>The film has all the elements of a great hero/action movie but a rather hollow feel to the whole adventure. It's as if a list was made of what made Die Hard great and at least two of everything shoved into this script. If you don't get to see it, you might not be heartbroken."
"rmax304823","6","7","12","7 January 2007"," If you liked Die Hard, you'll love this.
","It's a reworking of ""Die Hard"" with a bigger budget and clumsier plot. The formula, in only its second appearance, is already entering its decadent stage.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays the same character and goes through the same motions and dresses in what appear to be the same clothes. He appears to be positively superhuman. Everybody shoots at him and misses. He can fall three stories to the asphalt with no more than a wince. He wears his blood in different places though. Bonny Bedalia could have been left out. <br/><br/>William Atherton duplicates his role as egomaniacal spoiler, almost word for word. William Sadler is the chief villain, with a face so ugly that if it were a building it would be condemned. Fred Dalton Thompson demonstrates his striking range of expressions. When he's sad, he looks unhappy. When he's happy, he also looks unhappy. He projects deep thought by looking unhappy. Whatever the thespian demands made on him he projects an overwhelming absorption with some deep inner condition, maybe a strangulated hernia.<br/><br/>The setting this time is Dulles, Washington's glamour airport. (Nobody of weight ever uses the other one.) The villains are terrorists again, only this time they are helping some kind of Latin American strong man to escape custody. At least THESE villains don't speak German with a Russian accent! They're the home-bred, good old-fashioned American variety, and some of them are not only heavies but traitorous members of the military elite.<br/><br/>The score substitutes Sibelius for Beethoven behind the climactic action. (Next time, Kenny G?) Some of the action scenes are better choreographed than in the original ""Die Hard"" and that's saying a lot, because the original had superb staging.<br/><br/>It has come to this. We must now begin to compare action movies to one another by ranking them in terms of how adroit their scenes of slaughter are, because after all, what else do they have to offer? At one point Willis beaten, bloody, and freezing, falls through a hole in the floor and looks around dazed. ""Another elevator! Another basement! How many times can the same THING happen to the same GUY?"" he wonders.<br/><br/>Well, Bruce, it can happen three times."

","John McClane is in Washington to meet his wife as she arrives at the airport.  However as he waits for her plane to come in terrorists seize control of the control equipment and keep the planes circling.  They plan to rescue captured dictator General Esperanza by landing his plane at the airport and making their escape.  However as the terrorists wait the circling planes get shorter and shorter on fuel, leading John McClane to take what action he can to regain control of the planes.<br/><br/>This second of the exciting die hard series has a hard act to follow.  The first film was amazing and broke the mould relating to action films, it showed that action could occur in everyday locations, caused English actors to get lots of work as bad guys and set many other copycat films in motion (die hard on a mountain, die hard on a bus etc).  However this is nothing special.  The plot tries to be similar to the original but it lacks as much originality as the first.  The terrorist plot is not quite as likely and it doesn't have the same flow as the first.  Story-wise the main flaw is in McClane's involvement - in the first film he was very much trapped and forced to take action, in fact his first instinct was to run away from the terrorists.  Here the same is not true, Willis tries to make it seem that he doesn't want all this again (""how can the same **** happen to the same guy"") but really he throws himself into the thick of the battle.  This takes away from the image of him as an ordinary guy put into a difficult situation.<br/><br/>The action scenes don't help this problem.  Yes all the action scenes are good and exciting, but many of them are too big.  In the first the action occurred in short standoffs, usually with McClane running away or sneaking around.  Here there's too many of one man v's the world style action with Willis running in against a large number of terrorists and winning.  Again this takes away from the tension and claustrophobia of the other film and makes it feel like a Arnie blockbuster.  That said the action is still good and won't disappoint action fans.<br/><br/>The main failing of the film is that it tries to be like the first film without success.  It retains the same set-up (McClane trying to rescue his wife from terrorists), brings back the same Christmas time setting and music, it even wheels back in as many repeat characters as it can (Veljohnson as Sergeant Powell, Atherton as Thornburg) but it loses the most important item - the set parameters of the action.  Die Hard was great because it had very tightly set locations for it's action in the office block.  Here the action can spread out all over so a lot of the tension and claustrophobia is lost.  The decision to make the second film so similar to the first can only lead us to comparing the two and seeing the inferiorities.<br/><br/>The performances are quite good generally.  Willis can almost do this type of thing in his sleep while the other repeat characters simply redo their roles.  Unfortunately many of the repeat characters don't have much to do and seem out of place.  The 'new' characters fill the stereotyped shoes of previous actors.  Dennis Franz takes on the mantle of incompetent cop standing in McClane's way by going by the book, Sheila McCarthy takes on the story hungry journalist role etc.  The bad guys do have a lot to live up to by replacing Alan Rickman and they don't quite reach that standard.  William Sadler is good as Colonel Stuart but doesn't have any style of his own, anyway it's good to see Franco Nero (cult star of western Django) in an American film.<br/><br/>The film has some nice twists towards the end but it just doesn't come close to the atmosphere of the first film.  By trying to be similar to the first film, Renny Harlin shows that he's not as capable as McTiernan in creating a mood of tension mixed with the action.  The result is a great action movie but one that cowers in the shadow of it's better bigger brother."

This movie had about two good lines, and those were predictable.<br/><br/>The other reviewers said to suspend disbelief to enjoy this movie. I can usually do that, but not this much. As a scientist, engineer and pilot there were so many errors that I couldn't stand it.<br/><br/>The last few examples: Fire does not follow a fuel trail into the air. Fuel does not burn like that, since kerosene is not nearly as flammable as gasoline, which is what they were using for the speed of propagation. The exhaust from even one jet engine would blow out the fuel fire for a hundred yards behind the airplane.<br/><br/>The whole rest of the movie had more examples like this. (Steam in the baggage handling area?) I really did try to suspend disbelief, but it was too jarring."

","For me the first Die hard movie is the greatest action movie of all time. Great suspense, action, story and to top that off, some fantastic acting from Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman. So when I was waiting to see this I was not expecting it to surpass the first but I was hoping for something that would do it justice and this came nowhere close. Decent start slowly building up suspense and unravelling the story but as it progressed I found myself drowning in this pitiful excuse for a film. It was terrible acting which was overdone, very cheesy in terms of action and bad ending. If you have never seen the second film to this top franchise then I highly recommend you go straight pass this one and on to the third which compensates for this diabolical excuse for a motion picture."

","Die Hard 2 Die Harder follows the same tropes as most action movie sequel. It goes bigger and automatically thinks it's better. The plot of the second film is almost identical to the first, but this time it is at an airport. It was directed by Renny Harlin who also directed Cliffhanger a little later. He is known for making dumb popcorn action flicks. And this one is no exception. There are a lot of fun sequences, but over all I felt very bored watching this film. Unlike the 1st, 3rd and even 4th."
"MovieMaster95","8","3","4","2 December 2012"," This time, the weather outside really is FRIGHTFUL!
","Die Hard 2 is a film that has got a lot of backlash over the years. Being too much of a rehash of the film, being too violent and over-the- top and having a flawed plot. Personally, I love the film for exactly what it's trying to be, a fun action film that give fans more of what they loved from the original. It's Christmas eve and once again, Detective John McClane must wage war against a team of terrorists. This time they've taken over an airport and have complete control over the planes above, one of which has McClane's wife aboard. <br/><br/>The film lacks the tension that was present in the original. McClane is never really all alone and he never gets as brutal injured as he does in the first film. Instead the film feels like a race against time with McClane desperately rushing around the airport, capping off baddies and doing whatever he can to get the planes to land. It's still great fun and it's always a blast to watch McClane fighting against the odds.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 also feels a lot more mechanical in it's story telling. Renny Harlin does a decent job but never reaches the excellent standards of McTiernan. The supporting cast doesn't feel as three dimensional as they did in the first film and the gritty realism is somewhat watered down this time. Even the writing isn't as tight this time round.<br/><br/>But these are just minor flaws, in fact I consider it to be one of the best action films of the 90s. The film-makers made the film because of the originals success so they basically tried to give the fans more of what they wanted. The action and stunts are well shot and very fun to watch. The villains are colder than the original's and while not as memorable, are still a very believable threat. Bruce Willis is still in his prime and gives another charismatic performance. <br/><br/>Also, while Harlin may have stumbled here and there, the overall feel of the film is superb. The airport is still a familiar and charming setting for the film and the inclusion of setting the film during a blizzard is great. The heavy snow is not only a major plot point but it also adds to the Christmasy feel of the film as well as being another obstacle that McClane and the terrorists have to deal with on throughout the film. The finale is one of the best ever filmed for an action movie and I know this is an overused phrase but they really don't make 'em like they used to.<br/><br/>Most of all the film has heart, while some say it's just a cold cash-in sequel, I still find it just as warm and as charming as Die Hard 1 and 3. It's still follows the elements that make a Die Hard film, unlike Die Hard 4, that felt like just another Bruce Willis film. It's always a joy to watch this film around the Christmas season, back- to- back with the original. If you loved the original Die Hard, check this one out."
"butchfilms","10","4","6","18 October 2008"," ""Die Hard 2"" is my favorite of the four Die Hard movies
","I know that Die Hard 1 is consider the best of the Die Hard movies almost for everyone, but I have to say that I liked Die Hard 2 more. I find in this movie a better performance of Bruce Willis as the cool smart new york cop John McClane. The performance of Dennis Franz as the Capt. Carmine Lorenzo is very good too. I also find a better plot than the first one, and the action scenes are great. <br/><br/>In this opportunity the action develops in an airport in Washingtong DC where John McClane is waiting to pick up his wife who is flying from Los Angeles to meet her family for Christmas at her parent's house, but serious problems are going to happened at the airport and John McClane will have to kick some asses so his wife's airplane may land safely. <br/><br/>I think this movie doesn't deserve to be the one with less stars in the Die Hard series, this is a much better movie than Die Hard 3 & 4."
"KnightsofNi11","5","7","13","9 February 2011"," A sequel that pales in comparison to its incredible predecessor
","What are the chances that the same guy could prevent two separate terrorist attacks in a two year span, both of them occurring on Christmas eve? Highly unlikely, right? Well Die Hard 2 banks on this implausibility and practically recreates the first Die Hard. The film is littered with silly lines about how crazy it is that this is happening all over again. And yes, I agree, it is crazy. So why make a movie about it? As you should have guessed by now, Die Hard 2 pits hard boiled cop John McClane against a group of terrorists once again on Christmas eve. These terrorists have taken control over an airport and are threatening to crash the many planes waiting to land unless their demands for a military plane that they may use to fly out of the country are met. McClane won't see these terrorists get away with it and sets out to stop them, against the will of everybody else. His wife is also on one of the planes in danger, so that complicates things a bit. What ensues from here is a pretty ridiculous series of gunfights and explosions, none of which really has any kind of awesome wow factor to it like the first film did.<br/><br/>The character of John McClane from the first Die Hard film was great. He was a mixed of crazy and intensity. He could keep his cool and fight through all sorts of pain while remaining freaking awesome. His hard boiled run-n-gun nature made him a memorable, and also very quotable, 80's action hero. I was glad to see Bruce Willis reprise this great role in Die Hard 2 until I began to realize something horrible. His character had been changed. The raw awesomeness that the original McClane possessed had been tossed aside for a loud mouthed and sort of goofy guy. Instead of taking charge with the intensity and determination the first McClane had, John McClane in this film just has this ""why me?"" attitude for the entire film. He just sort of runs around killing people in pretty lame action sequences and nothing he does in Die Hard 2 is remotely close to the badass stunts he pulled off in the first movie. Bruce Willis still does a good job, but he feels like a whole new character that I don't like nearly as much as Die Hard's John McClane.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, there isn't a whole lot going on either. There are plenty of new characters as well as some returning from the original film. There are multiple obnoxious throwaway characters in this film such as an annoying news reporter who doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose in the film save for one particular scene. There's also Dennis Franz as police Captain Carmine Lorenzo, a cop that has a huge grudge against McClane for some reason. He is extremely annoying and his animosity towards McClane becomes ridiculous and silly when it gets in the way of life or death situations. Then of course there's the villain in Die Hard 2. William Sadler plays Colonel Stuart who leads the terrorist group, but in reality he hardly does anything. He's a wuss who sits back in his hideout and lets everyone else do his dirty work for him. Maybe this villain wouldn't have seemed quite as lame if the villain from Die Hard hadn't been one of the greatest villains of all time. Stuart is a crappy villain by himself, but when compared to Alan Rickman's portrayal of Hans Gruber he might as well be a disgruntled 12 year old with a nerf gun. There was a serious aura of fear and danger surrounding the terrorists in Die Hard, but the terrorists in the sequel pale in comparison and don't feel very threatening at all. It is especially ridiculous to watch them try to shoot. They might as well be wearing blindfolds.<br/><br/>I've spent this entire review comparing this movie to its predecessor, so I will say that as a standalone film Die Hard 2 is an OK action film. It is nothing special, but it's nothing worth hating. I give it kudos for trying so hard to be a Die Hard film, unfortunately it just misses the mark in every category. I can't deny that it has its moments, but overall Die Hard 2 is a very weak sequel that is best left forgotten."
"Wulfstan10","4","7","13","25 March 2005"," This one sure did die.
","Sequels are usually, though not always, far inferior to their predecessors, especially when not necessary to further an incomplete story. This is certainly true of Die Hard 2.<br/><br/>Whereas the first Die Hard was original, fresh, unusual, tense, and exciting, the second was unmemorable, tired, formulaic, and just plain dull. It completely failed to live up to the first in pretty much every way and is mostly a waste of time. There are many much worse action films out there, but this is less than nothing special and was one of the sequels that really seems nothing more than an attempt top ride the wave of the first film."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","5","7","13","7 May 2004"," They say lightning doesn't strike twice, they were right
","The first, and worst, sequel to Die Hard (until Die Hard 4, if you count that as a real Die Hard film), is terrorized by the same plot as the original. While waiting for his wife's plane to arrive at Dulles Airport (on Xmas Eve), McClane notices a few suspicious exchanges between a group of men amidst the busy yuletide passengers.<br/><br/>Before you know he is neck deep in trouble with an army of mercenaries, led by Colonel Stewart (William Sadler), who are hell-bent on setting free a corrupt South American General/Drug Baron (Franco Nero). There are more bad guys than before. And more suspension of disbelief is required.<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes and illogical moments that the film almost drowns in its own absurdity. But there is enough action and stunts to cancel it out and distract our attention. Though they not presented in a breathtaking or memorable way. It's all too generic and a bit mean-spirited. No audience nowadays would be satisfied with it so prepare yourself for 80's violence with lots of superfluous F-Bombs.<br/><br/>William Sadler and Franco Nero lack the callous efficiency of Alan Rickman. And a hero can only be measured by his nemesis. But most of the time McClane is just capping off nameless Mercs. How boring. Tho this should not be blamed on Sadler, he has a threatening and intense presence and as he has proved himself in movies like Trespass and Demon Knight. Too bad his character here is so badly written and underdeveloped. I'm sorry but blowing up 250 people off-screen to show how evil you are just won't cut it.<br/><br/>This movie without a doubt certified Renny Harlin as an action director. It was a tough, and huge, movie to pull off. Only he just did it off with no particular charm, it's very workman-like. Though he does a wonderful job of capturing the look and feel of an East Coast winter. The wide-open snowfields and ice-covered runways will definitely make you feel chilly and gives it a more Xmas-y look than the first film.<br/><br/>Although this is another problem. The first Die Hard worked entirely within the space of Nakatomi Plaza. It was claustrophobic and almost plausible. The scale and scope of Die Hard 2 is too big for its own good. The staples of reality are ripped out with ignorance and over-confidence. The bulk of the film is nothing but one dumb action scene after another. It doesn't make for coherent viewing.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is a definite lag in between both of McTiernan's very strong outings. By today's standards it seems dated and very 90's. Which is a shame considering the original and 'With A Vengeance' are, in a way, 'timeless'. It's movies like this that inspired 'Last Action Hero'."

The acting is pretty bad across the board, as none of the cast seemed to be taking the movie seriously; the story is pretty terrible, which would account for that.

"TheUnknown837-1","6","4","7","31 July 2011"," The first ""Die Hard"" was mindlessness done right; the sequel is mindlessness done poorly. It feels more like a parody of the first film than a successor.
","Renny Harlin's ""Die Hard 2"" has four of the same cast members, just about as many action sequences, and some of the same technical crew as its spectacular 1988 forerunner. And despite all that it has going for it, especially the charisma of star Bruce Willis, it comes across and far less captivating and surprisingly devoid of zest and excitement. In fact even though director Mr. Harlin would prove three years later that he has a talent for the mindless action movie genre with ""Cliffhanger,"" his gift is only present in a budding form here and it's not quite enough to save the picture.<br/><br/>The first ""Die Hard"" pitted Mr. Willis against a pack of robbers posing as terrorists inside of a Los Angeles skyscraper. The sequel has him going horn-to-horn and fist-to-fist with a bunch of political fighters who have swept up control of an international airport. Turns out, the terrorists, led by William Sadler, want to salvage their leader, who is flying in on his way to prison, until Mr. Willis once again slides by unnoticed and begins to slowly foil their plans.<br/><br/>Had a better director, such as the original creator John McTiernan, helmed this one and a sharper, more focused screenplay been constructed been hired for the job, ""Die Hard 2"" would have probably resulted in being a more-than-satisfying successor. A sequel that works, in other words. But as it is, it seems like a watered down version of the said product. One of the things that made the first ""Die Hard"" work was an assortment of witty dialogue, a lot of them punch lines that amazingly enough seemed to come off quite naturally from the characters, as if that were the way people really talked. Even though the screenplay for ""Die Hard 2"" was put together by one of the same men, Steven E. de Souza (and another man, Doug Richardson), that flow of dialogue does not work. The screenplay is almost entirely made up of punch lines and it seems so much more artificial, so much more contrived and mechanical. As does the major plot twist that occurs in the third act. Potentially exciting, but coming across as flat and devoid of shock. But even the human elements, involving in the first, are dull here. Mr. Willis is still very charismatic and inspiring of sympathy, but he has no real dynamics with anybody in the movie. No connection with his wife (Bonnie Bedelia), no real animosity with the airport police chief (Dennis Franz), no real sense of friendship with the L.A. cop who saved his life before (Reginald Veljohnson), and no interesting villains to go up against. As the terrorist leader, Mr. Sadler gives an over-the-top, phony-feeling performance, surprising from an actor who is usually so reliable and his scenes are almost entirely just detritus, especially that completely laughable introductory moment where we see him playing martial arts in front of his television set, buck naked. He's no baddie compared to Alan Rickman. It's almost hilarious that the one character that Mr. Willis has the most interesting chemistry with is a rent-a-car airport employee (Lauren Letherer) with whom he shares a simple five minutes.<br/><br/>But even as a mindless thriller, the movie falls flat. Mr. Harlin would get better in time, but he shows very little skill for action here. The shootouts, fist fights, explosions, and plane crashes are all handled and photographed rather clumsily. A particularly bad sequence involves Mr. Willis dodging bullets fired from overhead by barrel-rolling across a hard metal floor. Shot in slow-motion and with far too little sparks to simulate bullet impacts, the sequence looks like a lackluster, ham-handed imitation, or even a training exercise video. Not that any person would be dumb enough to try and avoid incoming bullets that way as opposed to getting on their feet and bolting for cover. But most embarrassing is when Mr. Willis escapes from an exploding airliner by ejecting himself through the pilot's escape hatch. The scene is shot from above, with Mr. Willis being projected toward the screen and screaming in a way that makes it seem like a ""Die Hard"" parody instead of a solemn action-thriller. The only moment that really sparks an inertia is an unfortunately-trimmed and short sequence involving the hero and villains shooting it out while dodging each other on snowmobiles.<br/><br/>Flooded with too many punch lines and lacking any real excitement on both the visceral and human levels, ""Die Hard 2"" is unfortunately a very flat sequel. Now the first ""Die Hard"" was a mindless action movie, but it was mindlessness done right. ""Die Hard 2"" is mindlessness done wrong."

But Die Hard 2 is the weak link of the trilogy, stupid and silly without the thrills to compensate.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, the world's unluckiest cop who's relocated to L.A. after the Nakatomi incident (which apparently brought him closer to his wife). Anyway, it's Christmas and he's waiting for the arrival of his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) at Washington Airport, but all hell breaks loose when a team of ex-commandos led by the renegade Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) places the airport under siege, forcing all the approaching passenger airliners to circle around the city until the terrorists' demands are met. Naturally, McClane's going to take the situation into his own hands, especially since his wife is in one of the circling planes that's running low on fuel.<br/><br/>All things considered, Die Hard 2's premise isn't half bad; it could make for one really nifty thrill ride if crafted with a better hand. But it's directed by Renny Harlin, who while being technically proficient as an action filmmaker, fails to put any of the extra flair or juice that separates the classics (Raiders of the Lost Ark, for instance) from the pretenders (this film, as a perfect example).<br/><br/>There are three major action sequences in Die Hard 2, and they're all relatively small scale and a little underwhelming. The first, a fight in the baggage area between McClane and two of the ex-commandos, is well-choreographed and filmed, but the foley guys must have had an off day. The sound effects for the kicks and punches are only a tad better than what you'd expect from a late 70's chop-socky flick, and this is coming from a film that reportedly cost $70M to make.<br/><br/>The other two action scenes are solid enough, a bloody shootout in a terminal that results in quite a massacre, and the climactic setpiece, a fight set on board the wing of a moving airliner, is terrific and the only totally satisfying scene in the whole picture.<br/><br/>Thpse two action sequences aside, Die Hard 2 is virtually without thrills. Hindering the film is Steven E. de Souza's script, which calls upon McClane to utter terrible one-liners (""What is this, a tag team?!"" ""Just the fax, ma'am."") and pits him agains the airport's own chief-of-security, yet again employing the whole ""hero clashing against superior officers"" cliché that marred much of the original Die Hard, but is actually even worse here.<br/><br/>That's because the chief of security is played by Dennis Franz, one of the most grating actors on the big screen (surprisingly enough, he's bearable on NYPD Blue). The screenplay sets him up as a lazy, incompetent idiot who can't accomplish one aspect of his occupation with any efficiency. The film, in fact, builds so much tension for the audience against this character that we expect and demand an even worse comeuppance for him than the villains. But the script actually has the cajones to overlook the stupidity of this slob and make him into a requisite good guy at the end.<br/><br/>While Bruce Willis is fine as John McClane, it's the supporting cast that irks me. Almost everybody outside the lead role is completely unmemorable or stupendously awful. The former applies to William Sadler and Fred Dalton Thompson and the latter is exemplified by Art Evans, whose acting skills have convinced me that I can also appear in over fifty films by uttering dialogue as if though I'm reading it off a cue card. This is one of the worst performances I've seen, period.<br/><br/>With little in the way of exciting action or plot, Die Hard 2 is clearly the worst of the much vaunted action trilogy, and will probably still retain that dubious honor when Die Hard 4 is eventually released."

","After the sheer excitement of die-hard , die hard two with its ""so what"" plot and ""meh"" action is just a big let down.

"knucklebreather","6","3","5","23 July 2012"," The magic is missing from this one...
","The original ""Die Hard"" was one of those special movies where Hollywood really got it right. It never quite felt like a big dumb summer blockbuster action flick, it was just so much fun and, while the movie as a whole was a bit implausible, there were very few specific moments where the typical viewer would be annoyed at the blatant lack of realism, completely unbelievable characters and lack of suspense and enjoyability. The first movie was great because, even though you knew in the back of your mind the hero would win, he kept getting put in such bad situations that you really wondered how he'd pull it off. It was a highly suspenseful movie, and the wonderful score certainly helped with that. What also helped was that the movie's three-way conflict - McLain vs. Terrorists vs. Dumb cops - was entertaining on all sides, with the terrorists being led by the charismatically evil Hans and the dumb cops being given a human face and made likable by the twinkie-loving Sgt. Al Powell.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 has a lot of superficial nods to the original movie - cameos, jokes about ""why does this keep happening to us?"" - but it doesn't actually replay the parts that worked so well and kept the movie moving swiftly. In this installment, McLain is in the airport and only in real peril when he runs into the terrorists, who have taken over air traffic control and are not allowing any planes to land and using their 90 minutes of remaining fuel as a timebomb threat (of course, perhaps the fatal flaw of the movie is how little sense this makes, given the fact that there are plenty of viable airports within 90 minutes flight of D.C. that could be used for emergency landings).<br/><br/>""Die Harder"" is thus solo McLain versus the terrorists even though he's surrounded by cops (all the ones who show up are, of course, incompetent or corrupt though). In the first movie there was a good reason why the cops - as mediocre as they were - couldn't help. In the second movie, we're just asked to believe that they never think of things like going out onto the airfield to see what's going on as a mystery plane lands. The one saving grace is Dennis Franz's hilarious performance as the police captain who hates McLain's guts, it's over the top, but fun to watch due to Franz's brilliant comic acting.<br/><br/>All of that said, this movie isn't truly bad, it's just not the action movie magic of its predecessor. It's fine as a big dumb 90s action movie to watch on cable TV one Sunday afternoon, as I just did, but I won't be grabbing the DVD unless it's in the mega-bargain bin."

","The first Die Hard was like the godfather of all action movies. It was what everyone looked for in an action movie. Die Hard 2: Die Harder, however, wasn't even close to making me feel that since of anticipation and excitement that the first had to offer. It was just another movie to me, but nothing special though. I'm not saying that this movie was bad, but it just wasn't ""that"" good, if you catch my drift. The story was indeed very simplistic and easy to follow up until the last 30 minutes of the movie. There were plenty flaws in this movie and Bruce Willis didn't really have that ""edge"" like he did in the first Die Hard. So for those of you who haven't seen it, but want to see it, just rent it. I didn't care for it that much to be honest, but it was still watchable and at least it wasn't like Battlefield Earth with John Travulta were there was no plot at all. Even so, there just wasn't enough ""hype"" for me, so just keep that in mind if you plan on seeing it."
"arthera09","6","3","5","31 May 2007"," The fact it is a Die Hard is its only saving point
","This movie just was not that good and the only good thing about it was that it is a Die Hard movie. First of all everything felt forced. They tried to do the Christmas thing and whole set up was way to contrived. The dumb police chief, the black technician, and the crazy maintenance man all felt really really fake. Plus they need to put the stupid journalist in this movie. Bad move. I did like the over the top violence and the fact that John McClane is not someone who stops. The only good line was when he blows up the plane at the end. The screaming of Holly at the end was a bit too much. But I did like the new reporter. The slitting of the guys throat still makes me jump and the fact that Stuart and the military guy were working together was obvious and just really bad. The music was not good and the action scenes were even a little week. I did like the snow mobile and the Annex fight scene, but the first one did not feel quite right. The radio showing up on the desk was just a bunch of lazy screen writing. John McClane was still the lovable a$$hole and a lot of fun but some of his one liners were just plain awful. This is my least favorite out of the three movies, but it is still fun to watch."

","Die Hard 2 (aka Die Hard 2: Die Harder) follows John McClane (Bruce Willis) who arrives at Dulles Airport to pick up his wife for the Christmas holidays. But, being a Die Hard movie, some terrorists take over the Airport's traffic control system and hold all the inbound flights ""hostage""... There is only McClane (and the Airport cops, and the army) to put a stop to the terrorists.<br/><br/>This movie is fairly dumb. There are soooo much implausibility and a tonne of plot holes:<br/><br/>1. McClane arrives a few hours early to pick up his wife at the airport. I mean - who goes and picks up their loved ones from an airport a couple of hours early?! Probably only the stupid and lonely....<br/><br/>2. The fact that the old granny smuggled a cattle prod on the flight is pretty silly (unless pre-9/11 they didn't check for weapons on flights?).<br/><br/>3. You see terrorists getting nasty with the luggage area of the airport - but what does this have to do with taking over the airport's traffic control system?<br/><br/>4. If the British Plane thought that the ground was in fact 200 yards higher than in reality - shouldn't it have crashed before the runway? <br/><br/>5. The total implausibility of McClane and his wife getting caught up together with terrorists again - plus the fact that the obnoxious news presenter from the first film is, not only in this film, but travelling on the same flight with Holly McClane on Christmas Eve with his camera man in tow. Why would a reporter from LA be flying on Christmas Eve to DC with a camera man?!<br/><br/>6. The stupidity of the police who don't bother to check the immediate area to find out where the terrorists were hiding.<br/><br/>7. Why couldn't all the planes hovering over Dulles just fly somewhere else (it isn't like Washington DC is in the middle of nowhere)? <br/><br/>8. Holly McClane mentions that she was on a 5 and a half hour flight from LA to Dulles - but it only takes less than 4 and 3/4 hours.... duh! <br/><br/>9. The bunch of terrorists dressed up as painters in the annex - what do they have to do with anything except for the excuse of having a gun battle with the SWAT team?<br/><br/>10. The rental car woman that tries to pick up Bruce Willis - clearly he is old enough to be her father and it is sick. Plus she was mega-peeved when Bruce stole her stamp pad and paper - but when he gets back - she gets all flirty.<br/><br/>11. The reporter who sneaks into the control tower... what the? Security?!<br/><br/>12. The polite service on a British carrier??! Not in this universe. <br/><br/>13. Bruce Willis manages to call his wife on the plane phone. I'm not sure how that works...? Speaking of phones - the reporter appears to go to a ""pay phone"" near the toilets of the plane.... I've never seen those?<br/><br/>I'm sure just about everything single bit of this movie has some sort of plot hole or implausibilies. But if you switch off your brain - it ain't a half bad dumb action film. Just not up to the standard of the first one."

"stormhawk2020","8","2","3","21 July 2017"," Great second part
","""Die Hard 2"" is the first of 4 sequels to the amazing ""Die Hard"". This is pretty much the first movie, only on a plane. Terrorists have taken over an airport in an attempt to get a Latin American dictator and drug lord named Ramón Esperanza (a mix between the Panama's dictator Manuel Noriega and Colombia's drug lord Pablo Escobar) who is being transported there free. But, John McClane happens to be at the airport because his wife is flying in. She can't land because the terrorist group have made it so planes can't see the runway, so her plane is running out of fuel, and it's a race for McClane to stop them and get Holly (his wife) down safely. This is the one I have seen the least, and when watching at the marathon, it was like a whole new movie because I forgot so much. It's very exciting and has some great action, and begins the series ascend to get crazier and crazier with their action pieces. I mean he fights on the wing of a plane that is about to fly. Insane? Yup. Entertaining? Your damn right! Great sequel and the last appearance of his wife Holly, but a great way to keep the series going."
"PredragReviews","9","2","3","11 May 2016"," Yippee... you know the rest!
","I think Die Hard 2 is the best in the series. You have John McClane (Bruce Willis) once again having to save the day when terrorists take over an airport, sabotaging the communications to the planes overhead and holding them at bay. His wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) happens to be on one of the planes, so he really has no choice but to intervene. He has his work cut out for him when he deals with a foe who almost makes Hans Gueber look like a softie. Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) and his recruits make it their mission to rescue a drug lord (Franco Nero) from the custody of the Feds.<br/><br/>The excitement is back. The action, and tension. The humor and wise cracks. The way that McClane argues with Dennis Franz's character is just gold, not to mention how the dialogue just bursts like explosions when the talk gets heated (for example, when John and reporter Cole get pushed out of the tower, or when McClane and the Major debate the difference in their approach to a crisis). I personally love the change of atmosphere in this movie. The first one involved a building and now it's a large airport but an airport being held hostage can be every bit as shocking and dangerous as a large building. The first one was almost like warm sunny desert with the setting in L.A. and ""Die Hard 2"" is much colder with it taking place in snowy Dulles Airport. I strongly disagree with a previous reviewer saying that it should've taken place in another high-rise office tower. Harlin took a good chance at a new place and really pulled it off very well and the result is another excellent and unforgettable classic with one of the best explosions in movie history. Even elements of Mother Nature (Icicles anyone?) come to the aid of McClane in his battle against Stuarts goons. Well, if you liked the original then you'll love this, I certainly did! <br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","2","3","25 December 2015"," Brilliant. Adds to the original splendidly.
","Die Hard 2 sees everyone's favourite smart mouth cop John McClane back in business as another group of nasty terrorists descend on LAX on a perticularly cluttered, and this time snowy Christmas Eve. Changing the setting from a mostly deserted high rise to a bustling airport at that time of year amps up the excitement factor quite a bit, and although nothing will ever top the visceral simplicity of the first Die Hard, story - wise the sequel has a lot more going on, and just buzzes with that eclectic vibe of desperation, camaraderie and business that many people wade through on the holiest of nights. Willis is more frantic then ever here, probably because the stakes are higher and local law enforcement is even more unwilling to believe or assist him, to the point of ridiculousness. The terrorists are spearheaded by monstrous Colonel Stuart (underrated William Sadler, leaving a slimy trail of icy fear and violence without ever raising his voice past an unnerving murmur). His troops seize control of the airport's power grid, shutting down all the runway lights and making it impossible for several planes to land. So now instead of a gaggle of office workers held at gunpoint in a building, we have several thousand people stranded at ten thousand feet, in danger of running out of fuel or worse. Higher stakes indeed. Sadler is a representitive and herald of shadowy South American criminal General Esperenza (Franco Nero, wonderfully intense) who is in federal custody somewhere out there and using the airport situation as leverage for his release. It's a bit convoluted and always chaotic, but never boring. Throw in supporting work from Dennis Franz as the world's most uncooperative police chief, William Atherton, Reginald VelJohnson, Art Evans, Fred Dalton Thompson and cameos from a young Robert Patrick and John Leguizamo, and you've got yourself a nice sequel that turns the dial up without going overboard, aims to please and comes out a winner."
"moviemattb","9","2","3","22 December 2014"," Great sequel, but can't beat the first
","""Die Hard 2"" takes places after the first one as John McClane is now being moved from being a New York cop to a Los Angeles cop as he waits for his wife at an airport in Washington, D.C., but things don't go well as McClane has to deal with more bad guys as again like the first one to save the people and his wife on Christmas Eve. I thought ""Die Hard 2"" is a very well done sequel, but it can't beat the first because it was a classic action movie while this one is not. Don't get me wrong, its a fun movie but I like the first one more. My problems with the movie is that the movie is very much like the first as it takes place at an airport instead of a tall building. Also, I don't think Colonel Stuart is that much of an interesting villain; I mean he's okay and the actor playing the villain name William Sadler does a fine job, but I really love the Gruber brothers more as they are both played by Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons. So those were my only problems with this movie. Now, what do I like about this movie? Bruce Willis is still being awesome, and still kicking butt as John McClane; without him, this movie won't be worth watching. Bonnie Bedelia returns as McClane's wife from the first movie, but she doesn't have that much to do; nevertheless, she is really good in it. Reginald VelJohnson also returns from the first movie, which if I haven't mention him in my review of the first one then I apologize; I thought he was good in the first as well as this sequel. Although, he is not in the movie that often so he is just there to make a cameo. The movie is directed by Renny Harlin, who you may recognize him for directing ""Cliffhanger"" and the fourth ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie does a fine job with movie as well as handling the action scenes really well, and they are exciting to watch. Michael Kamen does again a fine job with the music as what he did in the first movie. The movie does go by at a really good pace, which if I had to admit, I originally thought the pacing was slow but now its better than I remember it to be. So that is what I thought of ""Die Hard 2"" is a fun action movie, and it is worth watching. I give it a 9 out of 10."

Only this time he's at Dulles Airport in Washington D.C. waiting for his wife's plane to arrive. But when McClane stumbles upon a couple of terrorists he tries to warn everyone in the control tower about it.

Stuart(played greatly by William Sadler)is demanding that major foreign drug dealer, General Esperanza is freed. But since the tower is powerless, McClane wages another one man war against the terrorists and must hurry before his wife's plane crashes.<br/><br/>Willis and Sadler do great jobs in their roles. Dennis Franz also does a funny job as the airport police chief. It has a great return of some old characters such as Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton, and Reginald VelJohnson.<br/><br/>This gets my vote as the most entertaining of the three Die Hard movies. 10/10"

","Die Hard should have had been a one-off film, but it ended up being a successful franchise, as well as spawning a load of copycats. Die Hard 2 was both a sequel and a copycat by being Die Hard in an airport. Fortunately there was enough self-awareness in the script and the formula was changed just enough because John McClane was able to work with other characters. This sequel was a product of its time because story was influenced by the War on Drugs, the Iran-Contra affair, and American backing of military regimes in Latin America.<br/><br/>Whilst Die Hard 2 doesn't match up to the first film it is still an entertaining action-thriller in its own right. Considering the state of modern action/blockbuster films Die Hard 2 is refreshing because of its violence, swearing, and use of practical effects."

"YouelleArge99","8","1","1","22 May 2020"," Die much much HARDER!!!
","Bruce Willis stills gives credence to the character that he made famous. Returning from the first movie, Bonnie Bedlia as his wife, Holly, and William Atherton as the arrogant TV reporter, Richard Thornburg give us a bird's eye view of the terrorist attack from the skies, but that sub plot seemed to drag down the movie a little for me. Good performances were given by Art Evans playing Leslie Barnes and by Republican presidential nominee Fred Thompson as Trudeau, the man running Dulles Airport. However, William Sadler gave a weak performance as the movie's protagonist, and he kind of makes you wish that John McClane had not killed Hans Gruber in the first one.<br/><br/>So, Die Hard 2: Die Harder did little to recapture the power that the first in the series seemed to sweat out of ever pour. It was basically the same movie with a slight twist in situation to make it feel fresh. Still, this is a Die Hard movie, and it gives us enough humor and action packed adventure to leave us satisfied after the whole experience is over. Unlike so many sequels that, back in the eighties and early nineties, seemed tired and useless except to bring the overall feel of the first movie down, Die Hard 2: Die Harder is worth the 124 minutes to catch up with an old friend.<br/><br/>Not my favorite of the film but Top 3 for sure!"

I love Die Hard (1988) to death, I love Die Hard: With a Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard they are my favorite action films of all time. Die Hard 2: Die Harder is my fourth favorite film in the Die Hard franchise series the problem with this film is the pacing, it is slow, it goes so slow aroud. The reality about this film, it is not realistic it is a Hollywood film. This movie has a lot of problems, a lot of flawes. It is not my favorite action film, but it still feels like a Die Hard film.<br/><br/>Directed was by Renny Harlin who directed (Cliffhanger (1993) and A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Drem Master (1988).) written was by Steven E. deSouza and Doug Richardson who wrote an excellent script and the story it is based on a novel 58 Minutes by Walter Wager and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane he reprises his role.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good sequel, a good action movie of the 90's it is a good sequel just it is not even close good as the first 80's action film Die Hard (1988). Which is my personal favorite action film of all time. Die Hard is a pefect 80's aciton film of all time. This movie was budget $70 million it cost even more money than the first movie did. Just the film has so manny problems like cheesy one liners. The characters I just don't like some of them. The first movie was more robbers in this movie they were more terrorists.<br/><br/>The problem was the film come slow to me, the airport scene: if the airport shutsdown or when controller says god luck and god bless you need to go to another airport. Dulles International Airport if there would be emergency if the air field would be taken over, they are other near airports like Baltimore which is near airport to Dulles International, Philadelphia airport they are always back up airports. The last fight scene on a cargo Boeing 747 is actually wrong: when McClane opens the fuel line on the side of the engines there is not a panel that says fuel dumping. There is no huge panel like was in this movie, and actually fuel panel is the in back of the wings not near engine. There are more problems with the movie like, McClane's wife Holly Genero McClane is again hostage, nosy annoying reporter ""Dick"" Thornburg is back and it is Christmas again. Those problems and facts ruines the movie for me. Because Die Hard, Die Hard: Witha Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard they felt realistic movies to me, this was just silly and really hard to cope. I know Renny Harlin really had problems like how to make a good sequel that comes near to original. The snow was fake, they had to make it, beacuse at the time shooting at the film they did not had any snow.<br/><br/>The characters I don't like Captain Carmine Lorenzo he was a dick, he treated McClane like some criminal and I did not like his atitude at all, he was a duchebag. I enjoy and love Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson played by Paul Gleason in the first movie, his character to me was at least likeable. Carmine Lorenzo was unlikable. I hate it so much this annoying guy Marvin played by Tom Bower, I hate it his character so much. I wish he would be dead. Major Grant I did not like him at all, once he was a duche and then he turn in to likeable guy but later in to a bad guy. I hate Colonel Stuart one of the worst villians I have ever saw. Holly Gennero McClane I hated her in this movie, she was not a wictim and I hated ""Dick"" Thornburg because in this movie he caused panic in the airport and he shut police down with his facts and his story. I hated this character. In the first movie McClane beats terrorist by him self, he was one man army in the first movie in this movie he had help and he did not beat terrorists all single. What happened to Al Powel? He only had 2 scenes and he disappeared from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie I liked some people love it, I like the film for what it is. John McClane, now a lieutenant with the LAPD who this time finds himself trapped in Washington D.C.'s Dulles International Airport during Christmas week when mercenaries take over the airport's instrument landing system and threaten to bring down incoming passenger jets (one of which is carrying McClane's wife) unless a deposed military dictator on his way to the United States is allowed to be freed upon his landing.<br/><br/>I still enjoy snowmobile scenes when Stuard fires at McClane with his automatic gun and McClane flys with his snowmobile and you see explosion I like that practical effect and I love that in the film. I like the airport scene, the snow in the film, I love the weather how they filmed in 1990. McClane with the pipes as improvises torches and waves frantically to signal the incoming plane. I love McClane trying to prevent a plane crash, I love that in the film. When Colonel Stuart and his mercenaries throw six hand grenades through the shattered windows of the cockpit. McClane has no choise but he uses the pilot's ejector seat to escape just before the plane explodes. A parachute deploys ,but the plane is blow up really great explosion scene that is my favorite in the film.<br/><br/>The action is alright, I understand the film, a military are trying to free their drug lord General and they plot to escape so they sieze the airport. I love Samantha ""Sam"" Coleman played by Sheila McCarthy she was a hot babe and I love that she helped McClane and she defened him she did not rat him up to those 2 cops in the elevator. Robert Patrick was in this movie as one of the mercenaries before he played his iconic role T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The finale scene on the airplane I liked, the explosions I liked.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a good action movie, but it could have been a better movie. I like the film it is a good action sequel I enjoy it even with problems. The airport scenes to me they are still feel realistic, it has a good action snowmobile chases. Bruce Willis is excellent as Detective John McClane the hero in this movie, I love his charather to death. It is rated R and it is still bloody action film."

in the first hour. How can anything that follows give us cause to root for the hero
when so mamy people have already died?
Also, one critic raved about a scene where
Maclain ejects from a plane shortly before it explodes : ""His nose almost TOUCHES THE SCREEN as he is blown upwards in an incredibly realistic scene""(I'm paraphrasing).

","Die Hard 2 is not as good as the original Die Hard (to be expected), but it's exciting & loads of fun. The first time I watched it, I liked it, but was slightly mixed. Then I watched it a second time, and found I was fully on board, loving every single second of it (well, except for one unnecessarily violent moment in the latter half of the movie, but it certainly does NOT affect the movie's quality). A year after the first film, John McClane must leap into action AGAIN to deal with terrorists trying to prevent a South American drug lord. As mentioned, it's heaps of fun. There's lots of great action, as well as a great sense of humour. There are several humorous references to McClane going through a similar experience yet AGAIN, second Christmas in a row. And the story is pretty good - and kinda scary, like the original.<br/><br/>And like the first, it's quite violent (and full of swearing - albeit not as much as the first), and isn't suitable for children. With the exception of a throat-slitting scene, I wasn't bothered by it.<br/><br/>A fun & thoroughly entertaining joy ride."
"Floated2","7","1","1","20 December 2018"," A Solid follow up
","Released 2 years after Die Hard, had seen a lot of high expectations considering the success and praise of Die Hard. With more pressure upon the film crew and cast in making Die Hard 2 as good and successful as the original, much must have been considered.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 feels slightly more serious in tone than Die Hard, as it is less campy, and Bruce Willis plays his character arguably the same (in a good way). Though the pacing ins't as good, as some parts tend to drag on and become boring, but other than that, there is enough action, with a similar plot. Though the plot feels less realistic and more silly but overall slightly less joking around from the leads, and villains<br/><br/>One thing which was an improvement are the villains in Die Hard 2. With less cringe lines and a more serious tone, these terrorists worked better than the original.<br/><br/>Although Die Hard 2 is lesser than the original, simply because the formula is rehashed (very similar opening and ending finale scenes) it is still quite a fun ride. We can see as to why these films are as loved, both have happy and predictable endings. After a rewatch 08/09/19' Die Hard 2 remains decent but a lesser version of the original. Not that great either, there are upsides but overall on a second watch, was more so bored. Enjoyed Die Hard with a vengeance more than Die Hard 2."

","To put it quite simply, this is a fun, entertaining flick. I have it the same exact rating as the original, due to the fact I was just as entertained whilst viewing this gem of a sequel. While at times the dialogue seems forced and derivative, most likely to try and capture the banter and wittiness of the first film, the plot and action of Die Hard 2 makes up for any shortcomings it may have if being compared to its predecessor. I had a smile on my face during this whole movie, and even for a little while after. Go ahead and watch it. It's worth 2 hours of your life."
"Min111","Null","1","1","20 July 2017"," Die Harder in an airport
","It's actually a good sequel, but at the same time, it couldn't live up to the original film, and it's of no surprise because the original film is probably the greatest action movie of all time - most would agree. Still, Die Hard 2 is right up there among the best action films of the nineties (Die Hard was made in the eighties) and everyone knows that the nineties was the time where action films dominated the cinema screens mainly due to the success of Die Hard. What I enjoyed about Die Hard 2 is that it was set inside an airport, and the airport is large and full of people, so it makes it more interesting to follow. The villain wasn't that great, and it's probably one of the main reasons why this movie couldn't at least come close to the original. All in all, it's worth watching, but at the same time, you shouldn't expect it to be as good as Die Hard. It's a very good movie."
"Screen_Blitz","7","1","1","5 December 2015"," Entertaining, but slightly inferior Die Hard sequel
","Bruce Willis makes his return as the iconic hero John McClane who was last scene taking down a dozen German terrorists one by one at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles in one of the most crowd pleasing action flicks of all time. Taking place exactly one year after the events of the first film, John McClane is awaiting for his wife Holly (played by Bonnie Bedelia again) at the Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C to spend another great Christmas with her. His plans quickly go bad once again when a group of international terrorists led by Colonel Stuart (played by William Sadler) began seizing control of the airport and taking countless innocent civilians hostage. To make matters worse, the terrorists began taking control of the air traffic control, causing runway lights to shut off and inference in traffic signals. With planes full of innocent lives (including his wife) running low on fuel and unable to land safely, McClane must once again use his incredible skills to take down the merciless terrorists and the save the lives of the passengers along with his wife, once for all. <br/><br/>With John McTiernan returning as the director, this movie comes as a decent continuation to the franchise; with some exciting action scenes and well-drawn characters and performances. However, this film fell slightly short of the formula that made the first film a smash hit. The main villain Colonel is not quite as memorable as Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman in the previous film. While William Sadler gives a great performance, his character doesn't have the same charisma as Gruber. On the other hands, the action scenes are a bit exciting and well shot, especially the intense fight scene that takes place on the wing of the plane towards the end. Most of the action takes place outside in the snow and blistering cold winds. Then there is John McClane who still remains fresh as ever and is energized with a strong performance by Bruce Willis. Lastly, the plot works pretty well, although there some inconsistencies here and there. Overall, it was enjoyable at the least.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder may not be as memorable as the first film, but there is no doubt that this film is quite a thrill ride and Bruce Willis shows that he still has John McClane in him."

"siebertws13","8","1","1","23 August 2015"," Solid Sequel with Spectacular (and Stupid) Moments
","Pretty much a remake of ""Die Hard,"" this time set in an airport. Considering how derivative the story and characters are, combined with how quickly they turned this big budget film around -- literally two years after the original -- it's noteworthy how good ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" actually is.<br/><br/>The reason it works rests on emulating what worked the first time around and pulling it off: tons of interesting characters on all sides, a genuine movie star performance from Bruce Willis in his signature career role, escalating stakes on a limited narrative playing field, spectacular FX that hold up 25 years later. Characters from the original ""Die Hard"" are cleverly and effectively worked into the plot, the new characters are all pretty good in perfectly typecast roles (Dennis Franz as blowhard a$$hole cop; Fred Thompson as steely voice of authoritarian reason).<br/><br/>Weaknesses again are too many needlessly stupid characters and plot elements, and too many machine guns that never hit our hero while he almost always plugs the bad guys with perfect marksmanship. And the conniving television journalist actually comes off as more creative and likable in the sequel, so what happens to him doesn't feel as necessary or satisfying.<br/><br/>While the villains this time aren't quite as interesting, the subtext of American military and intelligence services corruption at the heart of the global drug trade is unexpectedly daring. And the final fight on the plane wing is as thrilling as it is absurd. <br/><br/>Also worth noting upon release you could see this movie in 70mm and it was absolutely spectacular on the huge screen (where I saw it at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., a truly memorable cinematic experience)."

","You know how I remembered that I saw this film once before? It was when John McClane (Bruce Willis) hit the eject button on the General's recently landed plane, just ahead of the grenades going off. That was just so unbelievably outrageous I just had to shake my head. I have my doubts that one could actually pull that off, but what the heck, it's an action film so anything goes.<br/><br/>Fresh off the Nakatomi Plaza case, our hero McClane is back in action again, and just as he proclaimed in my summary line above, if at first you wildly succeed, why not do it all over again. There's really no difference in plot here for the ""Die Hard"" sequel, except it's not as confined and Bonnie Bedelia earns her paycheck simply by sitting around the whole time. Wish I could get a gig like that.<br/><br/>Not trying to be cynical here, the film is a blast and a half for action film fans and followers of Willis. For what it's worth, the picture's an entertaining two hour diversion that keeps things interesting with it's character twists and over the top villains. If that's what floats your boat, then the only other thing I can say is Yippee-ki-yay and let it go at that."

","I thought Die Hard 2: Die Harder was a great movie and I honestly think it is very underrated as an action film classic. It definitely suffers a bit regarding people's opinions of it because the movie it follows, the first Die Hard, was such an awesome and even perfect action movie that there is no way for any sequel to even come close to living up to it at all.<br/><br/>The second movie also takes place at Christmas and this time John McClane (Bruce Willis) is reunited with his now back together family but at the airport in Washington D.C. where his wife is going to be landing the air traffic controller tower is taken over by terrorists who hold all the planes in the sky hostage and will make them crash unless the authorities release the military prisoner from Central America that is being flown into the airport that day on a U.S. Army aircraft. <br/><br/>The action and story are amazing with more great performances and humour, I recommend this movie and the first three Die Hard movies without reservation! #1 is the best!"

","I love Die Hard. I really do. I first watched this immediately after Die Hard, since I wasn't even born when any of them came out, and I had the ability to do so. I was worried that it wouldn't hold up to the expectations I had put in my head. But, it did. It is a wonderful movie, with a great plot, just the like the first. The acting of Bruce Willis is still awesome and he still says his beloved quote, ""Yippee-kiyay-mother-f**ker!"" I just love it, the quote and the movie.<br/><br/>This movie takes place one year after the events at the Nakatomi (don't know how to spell, sorry) Building in Los Angeles. John McClane is still our main man doing his thing in this delightful ass-kicking movie. And he's about to go through saving people all over again. When a group of terrorists wanting to get a convict of an airplane, take control of the airport, the same airport John just happens to waiting to pick his wife up from, John must go kick some ass and make it rain blood. He stops the terrorists through nearly everything they plan. Unfortunately, John could not save the plane they crashed. Since they had jammed all the communicating systems and they the ability to make it seem like the plane had a lot of altitude left, when they really didn't have any. Meaning, they crash, whilst trying to land. A lot of stuff happens, including all of the lights being turns off on the runways so the planes must fly in blind. In the end, John saves the day, kicks, ass and saves the plane his wife was one.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous."

","Christmas eve again with John McClane, this time on Dulles airport in Washington DC. This time John McClane is waiting for the arrival of his wife on a plane. But of course everything went wrong, which was to be expected.<br/><br/>The airport was taken over by a band of terrorists who tried to recuperate and liberate a general who had been convicted of some anti- communist crime or something. That is not entirely clear and that does not matter. Of course these terrorists could not succeed in their plan if they did not have come accomplices in the airport and in the armed forces brought in to deal with the situation.<br/><br/>But John McClane is the savior of the day, which is normal on Christmas eve. John once again managed to stop the apocalypse he could not really prevent since he was surprised in it himself, but he also managed to get rid of the beast, the dragon and Babylon at the same time: the liberated general, the chief of the terrorists and the military traitor. <br/><br/>Apart from that the rhythm is quite diabolical, though they kept the panic for the very end. People in that airport were so patient, so enduring, so smiling silent when something was obviously wrong. Thanks to a journalist the bad news was finally aired and the panic could come. We are not told how many casualties.<br/><br/>Pure entertainment based on a very fast rhythm and some kind of humor that is always targeting some kind of officials or uniformed commissioned puppets and generally below the waist if not below the knees, low, low, low anyway.

In order to do so, they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes. With no runway lights available, all aircraft have to remain in the air, with fuel running low, McClane will need to be fast, as his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is on one of the planes in the air.<br/><br/>Willis is again in good form, Bedelia is good but a little under used, William Atherton returns as TV reporter William Thornburg as does Reginald Vel-Johnson as Sergeant Al Powell. John Amos is good as Major Grant, and Robert Patrick is effective in a small role. Lauren Letherer stands out in a small role as a cute rent a car girl who hits on McClaine.

"Fedorahawk","8","1","1","28 May 2014"," And The Sequels Begin
","After the success of the fist Die Hard film, it was no surprise that a sequel would soon follow. A positive remark that can be made about this film is that it is not the worst sequel ever made. Of course the action, dialogue, and story line are recycled. That isn't the issue. In my opinion, the only place it lacks is in the villains. The original film had one of the most memorable villains of all time, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman). This film does not define itself with a unique villain. They are bland in many aspects, with no offense to the actors playing them. Any issues that can be found comes from the writing, which is saying something, because the writer, Steven E. de Souza is a wonderful action film screenwriter, but I digress. Anyway the film isn't bad, it just doesn't live up to its predecessor."

Yes, there are huge plot holes, but when the premise is one man saving the day against insurmountable odds, of course it's going to be contrived in his favour. The airport works because, just like in the first film, it's a setting people recognise and have probably been frustrated in. It's more than just weather that's stopping your journey, and wouldn't it be great if there was someone like John McClane around to sort it out! And, the kid killing Sgt.

It's still a lot of fun from start to finish. John McClane is still a likable a**hole and although the villain isn't on par with Hans Gruber, he's still an okay villain. Nothing too special but still has all the requirements. The action is still tons of fun, especially the plane crashes. My favorite scene is probably the scene when John attempts to help a commercial jet land after the terrorist leader has shut off the lights on the runway, but fails and the plane crashes anyway, and John just sits on the stairs in the next shot broken and teary-eyed. This shows that John is still a human being that cared for all the lives he failed to save. Every man woman and child.

","Having seen the first, we rented the second. As the film played, my wife noted I was mumbling under my breath and making spluttering sounds. For a film to be effective, it has to ""bring the viewer into it,"" and to do this, it must be convincingly realistic. This one isn't.<br/><br/>To pilots, this film is totally unbelievable. All airliners fly under Instrument Flight Rules, which means that they are in continual radio contact from the time they taxi before takeoff until after they've cleared the active runway at the destination airport. So presuming the tower at Dulles was taken over by terrorists and couldn't communicate, after a pilot tried to reach the tower (or more likely Approach Control), they'd merely switch back to en route control and advise them that they couldn't reach Dulles, and request to be vectored to another airport (with the snow conditions, Bermuda might have had a lot of visitors were that done).<br/><br/>Well, let's say that all the airline captains aloft were simultaneously struck with the stupids and decided to orbit Dulles in a stack. Without direction from a controller, just how are they supposed to get into a safe stack, and without running into each other? More likely, they'd talk to each other on the tower frequency and decide to go elsewhere. (A previous reviewer pointed out that any aircraft on the field could be used to transmit The Message McClain was trying to get to the pilots, so there was no real problem.)<br/><br/>The ""electronically lowering the glidepath"" trick wouldn't work, either. If it could have been done, the pilot before landing would check the altimeter(s) in the aircraft and would notice the height discrepancies. Nobody's going to plan a flare below ground level.<br/><br/>There's so much of that stuff in the picture that I was getting increasingly irritated as the film dragged on.

Juan tries to pull some shady 'I'm a policeman so give me a break' thing but he can't get away with it. Am I supposed to sympathize with a guy that pulls badge when he breaks the law? Why do I have to consider the policeman that is actually following the law and doing his job an arse? Anyways, Juan's car gets towed and he carries on waiting for his wife.<br/><br/>There are some really nasty guys that are planning a reception party for a General. The bad guys are really mean cause they walk down hallways wearing angry faces in silence and they are still angry and silent when in the elevator. What if anyone farted? Would they smile then? The chief of the baddies is a naked ninja that shoots imaginary bullets with his imaginary gun (in reality a remote control) at the TV. The General they are throwing the klatch for is called Esperanza (meaning ""Hope"" which is nice), he used to be the dictator of the Republic of Valverde, a country located between Mexico and Argentina. You know, an imaginary country that says ""is in Latin America"" but does not point fingers in case those red countries have cinemas and their inhabitants might get offended.<br/><br/>The baddies' plan is as follows. Step 1. Two guys will desecrate a church and kill the warden/priest, who will die in slow motion. Step 2. Two guys will go to the luggage handling area to tamper with something, because we all know that main airport systems are located there. Step 3. The naked ninja and his bff will hang around the airport instead of going to the church because there's no other way of making Juan and naked ninja collide. Step 4. Gain control of the airport. Step 5. Throw a party for Mr. Hopes. Sounds easy, right? Wrong! They did not count with Juan being there and he being the only policeman with half a brain! Juan kills one of the baddies and no one seems to care, because Washington's police dpt. is full of idiotic fats it seems.<br/><br/>Once naked ninja gains control of the airport he demands that no one meets the airplane General Hope is in, he'll handle the party all by himself. Juan is mad cause his wife is there up in the sky surrounded by a dorky old woman and an annoying news reporter, and he wants to have champagne! So he decides to try and regain contact with all the other airplanes to let them land, because airplanes although having all sorts of computer magics in them, cannot land without light bulbs in the ground.<br/><br/>Naked ninja gets mad and crashes a plane. The plane apparently has no gas left but it explodes like OMG-did-we-just-witness-the-Tzar-bomb? It doesn't really matter because the plane looks very cheap, like one of those airlines that makes you pay even when you fart. So we don't care that much. Oh no wait, we care because Juan finds a teddy bear and that's just outrageous! Meanwhile Juan's wife is having champagne by herself in the air, more outrage! She could not wait for her husband! No wonder they get divorced! Hope's airplane lands and both naked ninja and Juan go to greet him, but a fight ensues, it seems they are both battling to see who is Hope's best friend. They shoot at each other with 90's bullet sounds that are super realistic. Juan loses and has to leave pulling the emergency escape thing from the pilot's chair, which throws him like 130 miles up in the air but he survives the fall because he's a ghost from the very beginning.<br/><br/>A special task force arrives, but they are shooting only imaginary bullets cause they are on naked ninja's side and we all know how he loooooves imaginary things.<br/><br/>Special Task Force, Naked Ninja force and Hope they all decide to go and have the party in the Bahamas, so they board another plane. Juan is maaaad. He did not get and invite and his wife is probably slutting it out all drunk in the air, so he does what every rational man would do: climb into the wing of an aircraft taking off. He falls and he goes WTH Yippee ki-yay and lights up the gasoline that is being left by the plane, and since we all know that that gas being lit travels faster than light itself the fire is able to get to da choppa! Sorry, wrong movie."
"harrymccormack1981","4","3","6","12 August 2012"," Overblown Steven Segal-like sequel makes it a watch hard.
","I've watched the original Die Hard many times and regard it as a classic as everything clicks with the story, the acting and the direction. I'd been hesitant to try it out due to it's harsh criticisms from some sources as a ""rehash"" and usually sequels destroy the original with unnecessary continuation of character/story that had run its course in the first place. This usually comes about with a change of director and this is the case with this film.<br/><br/>Anyway I got a Die Hard Quadrology DVD on the cheap and decided about over 20 years after it was released, to give it a go.<br/><br/>The plot line basically the Christmas after the first film with off duty New York Cop Bruce Willis waiting at an Washington airport for his wife Bonnie Bedelia's plane to arrive from Los Angeles to have a festive family holiday.<br/><br/>However William Sadler, a military terrorist and his gang come along and ruin his plans by holding the airport to ransom by gaining control of the airport equipment which puts the incoming planes in danger. Their mission is to free a South American dictator/drug lord heading for ""justice"".<br/><br/>Mr Willis, who has shoes this time, looks team up with loudmouth Airport Police Chief Dennis Franz, Communications chief Fred Thompson and his old pal Reginald VelJohnson (in a cameo) amongst other people to battle the terrorists and ultimately bringing his wife back alive.<br/><br/>It seems a bit promising at first but falls into ""sequel doom"" when it the plot line tries to outdo the original with ridiculous plot lines and comedic attempts. The constant reference to past events in the first film (with the annoying William Atheron returning as the invasive reporter who is used a comic relief on Mrs McClane's plane who keeps referring him as ""Dick"".) The acting also wears thin very quickly and Bruce Willis is pulled about all over the plane when the film tries to trick you with sub-plots. There is no villain in the film (and it turns out that there are a few) that are a patch on Alan Rickman's character in the original In conclusion it's not a patch on the first film and even as a stand-alone film it would be even rated amongst some of Steven Segal's mediocre movies. To be fair though at least Bruce Willis appears human and he feels pain rather than the silly superheroes you usually get in such movies.<br/><br/>At the end I was hoping Die Hard With a Vengeance is a big improvement (the original director John McTiernan returns)."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","3","6","26 January 2009"," Not quite the blockbuster its predecessor was
","Try as it might, ""Die Hard 2"" is not quite what ""Die Hard"" was. The original casted an enormous shadow as a consummate action situation film and while ""Die Hard 2"" seems to fit that mold on premise, some key elements that made the first film so good manage to slip out of this one.<br/><br/>Like the first film, ""Die Hard 2"" takes place in one night as a group of terrorists take over Dulles airport's communications system in order to help a drug lord flee the country. As a result, it keeps inbound planes in a holding pattern that if held too long, will result in disaster. What the terrorists don't know, is that Holly McClane is on one of the planes, the wife of Lieutennant John ""I'll take matters into my own hands thank you"" McClane (Bruce Willis).<br/><br/>McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong time yet again, but he handles it remarkably better this time, seeing as he's done this kind of thing before. While he still talks to himself in the movie, one of his character's signatures, and he's motivated by love for his wife once again, there's something different about this mishap. Last time, McClane was trapped; his fear was fully realized by the audience. He had no one to communicate with and had to rely entirely on himself. He spends way too much time in this film bickering with D.C. airport police (led by Dennis Franz) and befriending odd airport employees. There's a lot more negotiating and planning--not doing. Even when things are blowing up and guns are being fired, director Renny Harlin, who takes the reigns from a hard to replace John McTiernan, doesn't do much with it. The action is not particularly exciting.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 2"" also fails in its antagonist. The group of terrorists have no strong leader, no Alan Rickman from the first film to pose any formidable threat. They give you very little reason to believe that McClane won't succeed. While we know the good guys will win out in these kinds of films, the better movies will always test your assurance to some extent and this movie doesn't. The suspense is just not the same. <br/><br/>Lastly, the concept is just not as impressive. While airports and terrorists generally work well together, in this movie the plot has no real magnitude. Considering the film was put right into production after the success of the first film, it would seem that they weren't too picky or worried about the concept behind the sequel: they just wanted to churn it out. Sure, fans of the original will enjoy watching John McClane's latest exercise in terrorist-shooting, curse-shouting fun, but connoisseurs of great action movies will be largely unstirred by it."
"Darkcanuck","3","3","6","23 November 2008"," Predictable and ludicrous
","I understand action movies take creative liberties on the plausibility of certain situations, but this movie just pushes the envelope way too far. Too often did I find myself literally yelling at the screen, in the hope that maybe one of the characters, at some point, would actually use a shred of common sense.<br/><br/>Many others in the IMDb community gave examples of what I am talking about here - but let me add yet another; McLean and the flight engineer decide that it would be a good idea to go searching a close by small community for the terrorist hideout. When they do find it, what happens? Of course, McLean does NOT call the army... he goes in all on his own -- and for what? To get into a tussle with a sentry and ending up killing him with a goddamed icicle. Come on? Even John McLean would wait for the cavalry to show up in that situation.<br/><br/>I don't care how good the action and effects are... if the underlying story checks common sense at the door, it's difficult to enjoy any movie. I think Michael Bay has proved that point time and time again; and Die Hard 2 is just another entry into the mindless action blockbuster genre. Don't waste your time with this one, you could just jump right to the third installment of this series and be happily oblivious."

","Far more offensive than Bruce Willis smoking tobacco and cursing his way through this actioner is the delirious expenditure of fossil fuels incurred by the irresponsible studio and the sociopathic director, Renny Harlin (false name). In his commentary (on the DVD), Harlin describes how the picture, on a tight schedule, became a mad search for snow all over the North American continent. Harlin flew his 300 crew, overpaid cast, and fleet of planes tens of thousands of miles in search of the white stuff. In Spokane, Wash., he arrived with hundreds of technicians, vehicles and airplanes, hired hundreds of extras, and woke up in the morning to find the snow had melted. The same thing happened elsewhere. Harlin describes how he could not believe the industrial agglomeration of ""three miles"" of trucks that assembled at a Denver location. This kind of carbon expenditure is an environmental crime in itself, forget the ""terrorists"" depicted in the movie. Harlin should be grounded from airplanes for the rest of his life, he is a single-handed enforcer of climate change and the destruction of the human environment."
"jhaggardjr","9","3","7","18 October 2000"," Almost as good as the original
","""Die Hard 2"" is the excellent first sequel to my all-time favorite action film ""Die Hard"". This one doesn't quite top the original film but it comes very close. A few predictable moments keeps this from topping the first film. But hey, why quarrel? Bruce Willis returns as John McClane, now part of the L.A.P.D. instead of the N.Y.P.D. as he was in the first film. As the movie opens McClane is at Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C. waiting for his wife's plane to land. But he soon finds out that a terrorist plot is developing. Before you know it, he's right. The terrorists (through unusual circumstances) take over the airport in different fashion as these bad guys try to free the world's biggest drug dealer who's on his way to the nation's capital. Willis is in fine form here as are the action scenes. Giving ""Die Hard 2"" a new setting, a somewhat different plot, and new characters is a major plus. Some of the other characters from the original are back: Bonnie Bedelia as Holly, McClane's wife, who spends almost the entire movie on an airplane; Reginald VelJohnson (briefly) as Powell, the L.A.P.D. cop who helped McClane in the first film; and William Atherton as Thornberg, the sleazy TV reporter who just happens to be on the same plane as Mrs. McClane. New characters this time around include William Sadler as Col. Stuart, the lead terrorist; John Amos as Grant, the hard-headed commander of an army's anti-terrorist squad that takes on Stuart and his men; Franco Nero as Esperanza, the drug lord; Dennis Franz in a stupidly hilarious performance as the incompetent airport police chief (to match the incompetent police chief of the first film); Sheila McCarthy as a local TV reporter; and Fred Dalton Thompson as the man in charge of the airport tower. ""Die Hard 2"" is exciting, funny, and very entertaining. An exceptional sequel.<br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"

Flight restriction must have been very lenient back than cause a old lady bring a taser on board the plane. ""Air Force One"" the movie probably got some ideas from this flick though. This one does have it's moments but it's very few and didn't really get my attention nor was I all that entertained. It's not a bad action movie but it's just so darn generic most of the way through. Even the villains don't really stand out despite the fact that one of the actor is Robert Patrick who played T-1000 in ""Terminator 2"". Even the main villain just comes off as some sleaze ball and doesn't stand out. It connect well with the first movie when it comes to the characters but it's just a forgettable action movie.<br/><br/>4.5/10"

","Maaan!! What a movie!! This movie has been growing on me over the years like crazy. I'm convinced that it's almost as good as the first one. That Renny Harlin really hit it out of the park with this one!! But what really makes this one great?? Snow! Snow! Snow! Lots of snow!! Snowmobiles, snowy runways, icicles, blizzard conditions - makes you want to grab some hot chocolate (or in my case tea) when watching this one.<br/><br/>OK, so there is no Alan Rickman. Who cares? You've got Bill Sadler as Col. Stuart whose steely blue eyes look like they could pierce right through your heart! Man, that dude gives me chills! Then you've got John Amos, Franco Nero, and even young Robert Patrick, John Leguizamo, and Vondi Curtis Hall in smaller roles as terrorists! And am I the only one who is still seriously disturbed by the scene where Col. Stuart causes the British plane to crash?? I remember when I first saw it (pre-9/11) I found that scene very disturbing to watch. Now it's even more so. Really makes you root for McClane at that point to tear those bastards apart! The film just works like clockwork! It never lags! Always something crazy is happening! There's just something about Christmas, snow, airports, hustle-and-bustle, and ruthless terrorists that make this a must-see every Christmas! And it has one of the coolest endings in action movie history - you know the scene I'm talking about! The zippo scene! And then the movie finishes off with a brilliant rendition of Jean Sibelius's ""Finlandia"" - courtesy of Michael Kamen. Renny's idea!! I think I can now almost say that I prefer DH2 to DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. Which is no small feat. DH3 is an amazing action picture - with McTiernan back at the helm. But DH2 just feels more faithful to the original - Christmas, terrorists taking over, McClane crawling through ducts/shafts, McClane's wife, Al Powell, Thornburg, pain-in-the-ass bureaucrats, etc! And basically the action being limited to one general location - high-rise/airport.<br/><br/>Top marks for one of the top action films of the 90s!! Even Siskel & Ebert agreed. Siskel in particular was ecstatic about it! And Ebert actually said it's better than the first one. That's some high praise!"

"refresh_daemon","7","2","4","10 January 2008"," A sequel, in both good and bad ways, but still entertaining
","The pitch for this film would've been easy: ""It's Die Hard, in an airport!"" And that's almost essentially what it is. This sequel follows the rules of sequels true to form. Increases the madness, increases the mayhem, increases the body count and does more spectacular explosions. Returning are most of the main players from Die Hard (some in minor roles), the ""yippy-kay-yay"" catchphrase and the surprisingly regular presence of black Americans (something I like).<br/><br/>First of all, I have to say that Die Hard 2 is not a thinking person's movie. Think too much about what's going on and it will fall apart. The characterizations and decisions made by characters in the course of the film are not all that realistic and the sequence of events of the film doesn't hold up to much logical scrutiny. But despite this, Die Hard 2 has a surprisingly high entertainment factor and if studying film hadn't permanently turned on my ever present analytical side, I'm pretty sure I would've been able to fully ignore these issues and enjoy myself.<br/><br/>You see, Die Hard 2 is, in some ways, like a really enthusiastic, but not too bright person. While, if you really listen to what the guy is saying, it's not going to come across as sensible or rational, his overall glee and rampant eagerness provides a kind of charm that might just win you over anyway. Die Hard 2 works really really really hard to make all those leaps in logic and giant plot holes palatable and works really really really hard to win you over with good natured entertainment.<br/><br/>But this is not Die Hard one. The villains in this film don't have anyone as potent as Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber. There is no real solid supporting character like Reginald VelJohnson's Al Powell. On the plus side, although the bureaucrats in this film are a little ridiculous, they don't approach the total silliness of the FBI agents in Die Hard. Bruce Willis does manage to carry Die Hard 2, but without a worthy antagonist or strong supporting characters, it just seems emptier. Furthermore, the previous film had some notable personal issues that needed to be dealt with, this one really only has the issue of the terrorists, so it doesn't really have any real growth for the characters either, which further waters down the soup of Die Hard 2.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, despite all these things counting against Die Hard 2, it still remains entertaining enough to not be a total waste of time. But this film is more lightweight than the last and certainly not mandatory watching. It holds together because John McClane is so much fun to watch (and the slight bits of reflexive humor thrown in do help to lighten the tone, making the silliness a little more acceptable). And so if all you're looking for is a night of good entertainment, watch the original Die Hard. If, afterwords, you want more of the explosions, ridiculous scenarios and the bad-ass John McClane, this is the next logical place to go. 7/10."

But a group of mercenaries take over and shut down the landing area of the airport until their demands are met. So what will McClane do? What else? Nothing but kicking terrorist butt! Willis returns in this sequel to the action masterpiece Die Hard. Here he is as energetic and as witty as in the first movie. You gotta hand it to Willis, he's like the only actor who acts stereotypically and we still enjoy it no matter what. Yes, it's that stereotypic action hero we love no matter what!! He also delivers the godlike line here.<br/><br/>William Sadler was also a good, but not great, choice for the lead villain, as his character is a cruel bad-ass. He's like a buff kung-fu kicking dictator, who goes around crashing planes as he pleases. Also, it's nice to see Robert Patrick in his pre-T1000 years, as a henchman, but at least he had a line, and a good one, too. Dennis Franz was okay as the airport security chief, Fred Thompson was good as the Head of Air Traffic Control, as per others.<br/><br/>The action scenes look bigger, but some not better than the first. The claustrophobic tension is gone, as it's no longer a building, it's an entire open-space area that is under control. Also, the budget is considerably bigger this time around. Bigger stunts. Bigger explosions. Bigger plot holes. But still, Renny Harlin still directs some pulse-pounding, if not absurd, action sequences. Accompanied by a great Michael Kamen score, and a still-great screenplay from De Souza. Also, the editing is quick and flashier than the first, as it was done by Stuart Baird, who would later direct the excellent thriller Executive Decision, also involving airplanes.<br/><br/>Still, while not quite living up to its predecessor and the story is an almost direct-replica of the first, it is by no means bad and it is still a worthy sequel for Die Hard.<br/><br/>6.9/10<br/><br/>Delton"

And some of the scenes will make you hold your breath (the conveyor belt walkway, the grenades in the military plane, the airplane wing fight) and drop your jaw right into your popcorn.<br/><br/>But the villains here just aren't as diabolical as in the first; they have more military goals as compared to the greed-driven kidnappers they are aping.

He's a villain that is pretty unlikable, this is a guy that is completely cold, calculating, and one that's not afraid to cross the line. I like we see little bits in his character from the possibility he could be a sociopath as he doesn't seem to care about who he kills or anyone else except for anyone that is involved in his operation and is only concerned about his gains or whatever he clams drives him.<br/><br/>But the interesting thing is how hypocritical he is as we hear, though in not much detail they guy was a war hero but somewhere along the line he turned coat. And two things he says about a drug lord having the guts to stand against commie aggression and a quote from a general about ""treason being a matter of dates"" (whatever the hell that's supposed to mean), from those things he says it shows how far bent and broken his moral compass truly is.<br/><br/>Franco Nero, he has a small cameo role as the Drug Lord, it's sort of interesting that he's in this movie as Franco was a famous action star in the 70's mainly for those Italian exploitation action film's which are cool. Just seeing him and Bruce Wills there in the same film is cool as you have an action star from yesteryear and today. It's a shame both of them didn't get to do some sort of action film together where they were both allies.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis as usual is great as John whom is once again the reluctant hero that didn't ask to be a hero but is. Really like how John Amo's character in one scene sums up McClane ""You're the wrong man, at the wrong place, at the wrong time."" And John says, ""Story of my life."" Yes, it is actually it sums up the whole Die-Hard franchise.<br/><br/>Its true John might not be the right hero for the job but he's the hero we need as usual he is kick terrorist scum ass, despite the fact he really wishes he didn't have too, what sane person really does. He as usual has some of the best memorable lines, really like what he says as he is about to crawl into another air duct, yeah John I know the feeling there are somedays I'd rather be and do something else, let alone just have a simple quiet Christmas myself.<br/><br/>The action is great as usual, I really like how the violence is amped up in this film as we actually see some really good blood and squib effects making the film a little more violent than its predecessor. From that Skywalk shootout which was really cool seeing John waste those scum mercs. On a side note one of those mercs was played by Robert Patrick which is cool and true as most familiar faces have got their start playing small roles. Man would have been cool seeing both Bruce and him do a film together.<br/><br/>There is the snowmobile chase and tussle at the Church area. Really like some of the kills in the film that are really good from a platform used as a guitine to smash a scum merc's chest and my favorite where John kills another scum merc by killing him ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" style ripping out an icicle and staking him.<br/><br/>But also, what equal powers the movie and franchise in general is in the suspense and this film does have a really good amount of suspense. From once again getting a step ahead of our protagonist as we see some of what Stewart is up to and hoping John will be able to pick up on it and get a step ahead of them if possible. But also there are some things about Stewart's plan we don't have all the details about which lead to a twist or two that I felt is a good example of ones done right because despite not seeing it one hundred present coming it doesn't feel out of left field and it makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>Even like that military funeral scene where John was trapped in a airplane cockpit and multiple grenades were being thrown in, at that moment you know John is in deep crap, I remember being on the edge of my seat in that moment and thinking ""Get out, now, now now!"" how John escapes I'll just say ""MacGyver, eat your heart out.""<br/><br/>There are also some bits of emotion as well, like there is one scene I won't say what that is but there is a scene that is just tragic which just like John put a real tear or two in my eyes. But that scene alone acknodged the jeopardy factor, why losing isn't an option, but most importantly all the more made you care and want John to win; teach Stewart and his scum army a lesson they'll remember forever.<br/><br/>It's true the film does come into a turbulence spot or two, for one thing this is a minor quibble is the fact that there isn't really a memorable supportive cast for John. Yeah there are a few characters that help him like a controller guy, head control guy, and Marvin the Janitor but that's pretty much all and they do help out but not as much. Would of helped the film if John had a number two to bounce off of, like having Denis Franz (another underrated actor I like) instead of being a stereotypical blowhole chief or even Robert Patrick as John's partner helping him out in the situation.<br/><br/>But my main problem with the movie is the pacing is rather uneven, really touch and go. It's just there are places where when the action ends nothing happens for a while. Part of the other problem is some of the scenes with John's wife Holy and that so-called Reporter Dick Thornburg I thought were unnecessary as most of it really didn't do much for the story and were filler by their nature. It just seemed like in those spaces of nothing John should be on the move doing something. But these are just minor specs of turbulence easy to fly though, other than that everything else is fine.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 flies high with thrills.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars"

In this film he has to fight against very hard terrorists and also to save the lives of a lot of passengers.

The screenplay is very good with what they had to work with, everything is in there for a reason.. but there are a few moments which are complete copies of the original.<br/><br/>Regardless, watching this movie was no waste of time and it was surprisingly gripping throughout. It moves very fast and we get to see Bruce Willis at the top of his game, doing what he's best at throughout.

","I liked this movie and thought that it was very similar to the first one. I gave the first one a 7 and i gave his one a 7 as well like i said, theyre both similar and have theryre own ways. They both have different plots but i felt like the first one was to the point and this one was kinda hard to understand. I mean i liked it and it had some good quotes and scenes like the snowmobile part and the plane explosions. It was nice that Robert Patrick was in this movie but he barely had any screen time because maybe this was before terminator 2 so he wasn't that popular. The acting really wasn't that good, i mean i know it was the 90's but. I hope the 3rd one is better and i cant wait to see the modern ones. Its also funny to see Bruce Willis with hair. And that part with the naked man in the beginning was kind of unnecessary. The bad guys felt, looked, and acted like bad guys to me. I thing i like about these movies is that it drags you into it so it feels like your part of it. An OK movie!!!"

They knew you were there to be entertained. This movie delivers.<br/><br/>Now that I think about it, there is no gratuitous nudity in this one. It has been replaced by a hip talking grandma who tasers her dog.<br/><br/>There is one scene where a lot of people get killed, that was a little too serious in my opinion for this movie but it's nothing you can work with, it just is a little disturbing for me and a particular phobia I have.<br/><br/>This really is just Die Hard the first one times 2, instead of Nakatomi Plaza it's New York airport.

","Die Hard is the greatest action movie of all time. Nothing else has surpassed it, not even its sequels. While Die Hard 2 recycles the story of the original, this elevates the stakes and opens up a larger can of whoop-ass!<br/><br/>1988's Die Hard had a simple concept: one cop battles twelve terrorists who have seized a building. In 1990's Die Harder, one cop battles even more terrorists in an airport. The first Die Hard was fresh and magical, had a cooler bad guy and had more build-ups. This one has a more complex plot, more twists, better and more action, and more at stake.<br/><br/>John McClane (Willis) is taking a Christmas vacation with his wife (Bedelia) in Washington DC. Meanwhile, sadistic Col. Stuart (Sadler) and his crew of terrorists completely take over the airport to guarantee the safe arrival and getaway of infamous drug lord (Nero). The terminal security and police won't listen to John who knows about terrorists very well. Planes will crash and loyalty will change and only John McClane can save the day and his wife from certain death.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, this has better and more action (probably the most violent in the series). There's one action scene were the terrorists take out a SWAT team and McClane explodes out of an air tunnel and destroys them all. Easily the best scene in the series. Although this does not have quite as much suspense built up as in the first, Die Hard 2 makes up for it by having super intense violence and chase scenes. The base of the terrorists isn't even in the airport, so there's the wonder of ""how?"" The terrorists shut down the lights on the landing, so any landing plane will crash. We want his wife to make it out alive. This is where the stakes are raised again: she stands a greater chance of dying than in the first.<br/><br/>I love everything this movie has. It is almost as good as the first and one of the truly best action flicks ever!<br/><br/>4/4"
"supergamer125","7","0","0","16 August 2015"," A worthy sequel to a masterpiece.
","Die Hard was one of the best action films of the day. So naturally a sequel was to be made to capitalize on the success. What followed was a worthy sequel that was also a success. Die Hard 2 is a bigger movie than it's predecessor. But bigger isn't always better, it lacks some of the suspense that made the original great. While the original took it's time to introduce the characters and set them up before the action begins, this movie jumps into the action very early on. That isn't a bad thing since we know most of the characters already and probably want to see McClane kill bad guys. This movie is very similar to the first Die Hard; John McClane goes somewhere for his wife, terrorists take over, wife becomes a hostage, and John McClane has to stop them. In this movie John McClane is back with his wife, in the original they recently had an argument. You wanted them to get back together, because you wanted John McClane to succeed. Here, it's like he already did.<br/><br/>Although I've had a lot of complaints so far, that doesn't mean I hate this. On the contrary, I like it. The action is still a blast to watch. John McClane has more one liners making this funnier than the original. I said it isn't as intense as the original (it does have a couple of intense scenes though), I stand by that but this is just as fun if not more fun to watch.<br/><br/>A lot of old characters return such as Holly, Al Powell, and Richard Thornburg. There are a couple of new faces like the chief of airport security who plays a similar role to Dwayne Robinson the police chief in the last movie. As the guy who wants to help the hostages, but disagrees with McClane's methods and actively dislikes him.<br/><br/>The new villain Colonel Stuart (William Saddler) is a good villain that is completely without morals and would kill anyone to get his way. Him and his team take control of the airport and hold the planes hostage. He's not as good as Alan Rickman, but he plays his role well. One of the reason's he isn't as good as Hans Gruber is because he and McClane don't have much conversations. By that I mean in the original McClane and Hans had multiple conversations through the radio and argued with each other and teased each other which gave them a good rivalry that was fun to watch. That happens around once or twice in this film. However he is probably the only villain that can fight McClane head on. All the others are more leaders and not soldiers, so if they were to fight McClane they'd lose. But Colonel Stuart does fight McClane at the end for a good and intense fight at the finale on the plane. In fact he pretty much wins the fight.<br/><br/>In short Die Hard 2 is a good follow up to the original that knows what it is and has fun with it and brings the audience along for the ride."

","Die Hard 2 (1990) was a terrible and meaningless sequel. The situations were inane and filled with nonsensical logic and it was stupid all around. I don't know why they even bothered to make this movie. Everything about is just plain rubbish. All of the elements that made the first film interesting were either over done or never utilized. The bad guys wern't cool and the performances seemed forced. They should have left well enough alone. But I guess the lure of filthy lucre and endless sequels won out over logic and sanity.<br/><br/>The movie takes place at an airport during the holidays. This time John's (Bruce Willis) wife (Bonnie Bedelia McCulkin) is flying to the east coast. But the threat of terrorists and violence towards the innocence put another hold on their holiday plans. Can John save the day once again? Will there be another lame plot twist? How will show up from the previous movie?

All have a brightness. Decidedly lowbrow, but easy to read, almost incidental. <br/><br/>The stunts are each directed as an arc, each pretty well unified. Lots of fireballs. Lots of vertical space. Pretty good variety in camera coverage.<br/><br/>This is the airplane one, the one with the fax joke.<br/><br/>I suspect that everyone will find either this or the first their favorite, depending on their philosophy of film.

","Sequels have had a wide range in quality some are better than the first(Terminator 2, Empire Strikes Back, Godfather 2) some are not as good. Die Hard 2 is the latter. Its story recycles a lot from its predecessor, however it does still change things to make it different, like setting the film in an airport. The Film still is fun to watch with more action than the first and some genuinely surprising twists. The Humour is still there and the Villain is very formidable. But the pacing isn't as good. The First Die Hard got things started fast, while Die Hard 2 is a bit slower. Once again the police characters are extremely annoying. Overall Die Hard 2 is fun but not the action masterpiece that the first film is. If your looking for an entertaining action movie then i say check it out. If you enjoyed the first Die Hard then you'll probably enjoy this one too. Just Don't expect it to be as good."

","A year after the Nakatomi incident in the first film, John McClane is now an L.A. cop and he is expecting to meet his wife at Dulles Airport. Unfortunately for him, this Christmas isn't going to get merry with out getting bloody first - a team of mercenaries who plan to free a high profile prisoner, also soon to arrive, seize control of the airport and threaten to start crashing planes if their orders aren't followed. Too bad for them that John McClane is there to give 'em hell.<br/><br/>The monumental first film in the now classic series seemed impossible to top, and as far most people see it, that's the truth. This film doesn't in anyway top the original, but it's a great sequel. Bruce Willis does a great job at reprising his tough as nails, wise-cracking hero and a new director, Renny Harlin, really pushes him to new limits. Unfortunately that also means that a lot of logic is lost - or rather in this case, blown up. The original's plot was very clever and almost believable as a good thriller not just as a very entertaining action film and that is where this film falls short of its predecessor. The set-up, while very good by action movie standards and provides a very entertaining film, is just a little dumb in parts. The script could have been refined a little before shooting to get that cleverness back that made the first one so good.<br/><br/>However, this film is in no way a let down. The bad guys are a ruthless bunch that you'll love to hate (especially William Sadler), there are a few twists along the way that make very entertaining, and Renny Harlin's action scenes are pretty intense all the way through. 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong violence and profanity"

The story is simply too weak and the villains are too uninteresting to make this a real must see. Also the movie recycles a bit too many things from the first ""Die Hard"" movie to be considered really original.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis really is in his element again as John McClane. He truly was born to play the character. Willis and his character is what makes this movie better than your average action movie. Dennis Franz plays a typical Dennis Franz role and his fans will be delighted. Art Evans however played a really irritating character. There are some small roles for Colm Meaney, Robert Patrick, John Leguizamo and Vondie Curtis-Hall. Most of them were fairly unknown at the time.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 2"" is still a better movie than most of the other action movies made the past decades but the story is too weak and unoriginal to make this a real must see.

","Die Hard 2: Die Harder<br/><br/>Continuing the events in the life of John McClane, `Die Hard 2: Die Harder' features a band of terrorists taking over Dulles Airport. And yippee-kai-yay, look who's here. John McClane! And guess who is the only man who can stop the terrorists? John McClane! And guess whose wife is on a plane that can't land at Dulles until the terrorists get what they want? Yep! John McClane!<br/><br/>Enter John McClane, who must find a way to take out all the terrorists before it's too late. Using his Zippo lighter and a pistol, he gets to take down about nine thousand baddies. Wow. Good marketing for Zippo: `Not only can it stop a bullet.it can ACT like a bullet, too!'<br/><br/>People were hard on this movie when it came out. And I can certainly understand why. Anything the makers of the first film should have learned is that their formula worked before. One man. Trapped in a building. Hostages. Let's film! But in part II they ignored all this to deliver some big explosions. Not only is John McClane NOT in an enclosed area (unless you count a huge airport as enclosed), and not only do they have an un-loathed bad guy (unlike the first where we loved to hate the bad guy), but none of the original formula is there. The film retreats into trampled terrain - `Rambo' terrain. John McClane is no loner an intelligent and sympathetic character. He's a lean, mean, fighting machine that blows up everything in his path.<br/><br/>But then again, considering it as an action film and not a sequel to one of the best of its genre, the film ain't all that bad.<br/><br/>There ARE some great explosions, including McClane getting trapped in a jet fighter and bad guys throwing grenades in. What to do? Why, launch the ejection seat, of course. Next thing we see is ol' John sailing through the air, saying, `Oh Sh-------!'<br/><br/>And the very end is nothing short of adrenaline-pumped, pyrotechnic action spectacular. The Zippo lighter comes in handy yet once again for John. KABOOM!<br/><br/>All in all, `DH2: Die Harder' is definitely worth seeing. It's not worth going out of your way to see, but it's worth it if you can find it. Just don't expect anything near the original.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars - just for that ending. Boy, was it great.<br/><br/>BTW: Look out for `Die Hard 4: Die Hardest' coming out in 2004. Really. I mean it. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are already signed on. Visit IMDb.com for more information on the sequel.<br/><br/>I'm just wondering what the fifth will be called. How about, `Die Hard 5: Die Hard, Harder, and/or Hardest'? Or what about `Die Hard 5: Burn, Baby, Burn.' The possibilites are endless."

","Released a mere 2yrs after the original and helmed by `fill-in' director Renee Harlin, Die Hard2(1990) simply exceeds the original in staging, scale, AND emotional connection. This unique sequel-that-isn't-a-sequel grabs audiences by building on its predecessor-it finally turns John McClane (Bruce Willis) into a truly vulnerable hero fretting with foreknowledge....and for his wife.<br/><br/>Somehow, he again stumbles into a public place overrun by terrorists where he's the only one who appreciates the problem. However, his personal situation is different this time: he's not isolated, he just needs the co-operation of someone in authority.<br/><br/>DH2's terrorists take a major international airport with impunity because they know they have a pull-push-through advantage in their personnel. But soon they have to contend with not one wildcard (Willis), but two-the second being the airport's quiet genius, Chief Engineer Leslie Barnes (Art Evans). McClane & Barnes keep their emotional distance much more than McClane & Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) did, quite sensibly for the franchise. Twinkie-chomping Sgt Powell phones in a short reprise appearance. Literally.<br/><br/>McClane's chief homegrown adversary, the traitorous Col. Stuart (William Sandler), is reminiscent of Martin Sheen's sent assassin from Apocalypse Now-a military man suffering from a disappointed cause and intellectual excess. Sandler himself observed that his birthday-suit discipline was `a great opening to a character', and the whole movie. Fans find Col. Stuart an extremely `effective' terrorist (they really hate him)-although his men look obviously out-of-place as they insensitively carry their gaudy (fake) Christmas presents.<br/><br/>The setting, during a snowstorm at Christmas, coalesces DH2 into an airport disaster/political technothriller/`superbowl' actioner -hybrid. Its success demonstrates the value of attracting ALL the right professionals.<br/><br/>Harlin's canny decision to launch the film immediately after the main title allows the action to appear unrelenting. That impression is further parleyed by huge, logistically nightmarish, yet effortless-looking effects by production designer John Vallone, DoP Oliver Wood, and DH1's Sp/fx Coordinator, Al Disarro. They give us snowmobile chases, moving baggage beltways, and miles&miles of fake snow; make deadly use of scaffolding, fake a couple of jet crashes, and hover a helicopter over the wing of a speeding jumbo! ....The snow itself became an unofficial character once it `insisted' on being trucked in (1989 was infamous for not having any).<br/><br/>Such production values were Herculean compared to DH1: John Vallone built a 130'x207' set with an oversized 2-storey ATC-tower (large enough to accommodate the cameras/cranes), coupled with soundstage-spanning miniature runways, miniature planes and miniature lights outside.<br/><br/>
The lavish talents of both cast&crew are a real treat-and the reason behind DH2's success, together with the original story.<br/><br/>The screenplays of DH1&2 were adaptations of two different novels by completely different authors. Joel Silver's vision turned them into sequential Bruce Willis vehicles. Roderick Thorp(1936-1999) wrote `Nothing Lasts Forever' in 1979, which later became DH1(1988). DH2 was adapted from the Walter Wager novel `58 Minutes'-with added streamlining characters written for DH2 by Thorp-before the screenplay was finalized by Stephen DeSouza & Doug Richardson.<br/><br/>DH2 just bulges with action-the `annex skywalk' firefight is best, with all that scaffolding, paint, and glass presenting such dangers to flesh. Thanks to stunt-coordinator Charles Picerni (brother to Paul of the 1960s' The Untouchables), all the homicide victims fall dead in uncomfortable positions, increasing their pathos-and the movie's cred.<br/><br/>
Yet despite DH2's achievements, some niggles remain.<br/><br/>For one thing, the series has dated a little. Still arrogant, McClane is foul-mouthed and crass to the point of embarrassment-esp. with Carmine Lorenzo (Dennis Franz), the Chief of the terminal police, and with Sam Coleman, the female reporter (Sheila McCarthy).<br/><br/>Admittedly, Capt. Lorenzo's lines ARE obnoxious, which force McClane to spout even worse ones in reply: `Hey, Lorenzo! What sets off the metal detectors first? The lead in your a** or the sh!t in your brains?' Sadly, such immaturity undermines them BOTH.<br/><br/>Part of the problem was that Franz kept flubbing his lines-he never got comfortable. He has never portrayed an obnoxious character again; he's settled back into disenchanted, apolitical cops.<br/><br/>McClane's oft-repeated and sometimes clumsy victimisation unfortunately became DH2's biggest cliche. Since it's the element that reveals the franchise formula, the active excesses had to be dropped: by DH3 McClane is only verbally dismissed.<br/><br/>DH2's remaining conceit is its audience-teasing about just who the good/bad guys are. Franz's Lorenzo and John Amos' Major Grant deliver lots of misdirection, but it became impossible to backpedal their stated intentions: Lorenzo's disingenuous smile in the last scene, and Major Grant's 180-degree change of attitude halfway, are difficult to swallow. Jackie Burch didn't miscast; the fault is in the tricky writing.<br/><br/>DH2's humour was also tricky: when the rent-a-car attendant (Lauren Letherer) invites McClane for coffee, his comeback-`Just the fax, ma'am'-is cute; but his `...not the kind of ride I'm looking for' to Sam Coleman goes too far: without heightened circumstances, his corrosive hostility is incomprehensible. Such apparent arrogance undermines McClane's character as both a family man AND as a vulnerable hero.<br/><br/>We're also repulsed when the older passenger (Jeanne Bates) relates how she'd tested her stun-gun on her own dog! The joke's too ratcheted, yet Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) only reacts with an askance stare. This left the old lady looking too stupid and immoral.<br/><br/>Another mistake occurs when the (black) terminal cop (Paul Bollen) points his gun at McClane instead of the fleeing African-American terrorist (Vondie Curtis-Hall)-even if unintentional, this plays like reverse prejudice onscreen (but would've appeared as just typical `McClane-victimisation' had they not cast an African-American as Officer Carlson). Now this WAS careless casting.<br/><br/>The film did take artistic license aplenty, but we just love revisiting the same characters, seeing them be put through newer paces.<br/><br/>
DH2 really is `the Superbowl of action movies' (Sandler). The less-pleasant true sequel to DH1, DH3, although again directed by McTiernan, is so far removed from the `superbowl'-feel that we're just not interested in any Special Edition. For archetypal hyper-realism, DH2 has no equal-not even within the series.(8.5/10)"

He was a hero because his life depended on it where as here he`s a stereotypical stock good guy who could have easily left everything to the experts . Yeah okay his wife is in danger but is this a convincing motive for McLane running the show ? <br/><br/>Secondly because McLane has to interact with many characters it shows that Bruce Willis isn`t a very good actor ( In my opinion ) though to be honest he isn`t helped by poor dialogue . In the original talk scenes are kept to a minimum<br/><br/>Thirdly the stunts that made the first movie are inferior here not to mention being overblown .

I don't have enough characters in this review to give all the stupid scenes so I'll highlight the more annoying ones. McCain is able to get a machine gun, H&K MP-5 I believe, from one of the terrorists after he kills him, then he is chasing a terrorist on a snowmobile and the two of them have a snowmobile duel, neither one hits the other and McCain makes the statement ""no way I missed, I had him in my sites"" well McCain, the terrorist was also shooting at you to and probably had you in his sights, also, however he was not shooting blanks. So, McCain goes into the security office where the chief, who does not like McCain and will not listen to him, McCain starts shooting at him with the blanks. Every cop in that office pulls their gun and points at McCain and no one shoots him into the next stupid movie. BS! And then let's not forget the scene in the C-130, McCain finds himself in the cockpit and the terrorist begin to throw hand grenades into the cockpit with him from the first and grenade thrown into the cockpit I counted 26 maybe 30 seconds and then McCain is able to activate be eject switch and eject safely from the airplane. Well no grenade in the world has a 26 second delay fuse. This would be stupid, as the enemy would have about 20 seconds to throw it back at you. If you have not seen this movie yet, don't, and I would also pass on the rest of the series because they do not get any better.

","After the slightly disappointing Die Hard comes Die Hard 2, and like most sequels fails miserably. There is a number of reasons why a sequel can fail, for example loss of originality, something clearly not wrong with Die Hard 2 because it isn't difficult to keep a thriller plot line original. John McClaine's character is still the bad-ass police guy, so that's good. The reason why a lot of sequels fail is because they feel like they have to take everything to the next level- it has to be bigger and more bold than the last one, and in doing so they make the film even more stupid than before, in the case of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen for example. However, this is not the case with Die Hard 2, things aren't really more over-the-top than its prequel, the problem is, if anything it's dumbed down. Things are less exciting, the plot is just plain boring, and the thing that made the first film so watchable- a well written villain played by a wonderful actor- wasn't there. The result? A boring story that feels far too long with boring action sequences that have nothing new in them and no memorable characters."

Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber was one of the all time great villains and neither William Sadler or John Amos can match his on screen charisma. The plot is absurd just like the first film but unlike the original, which was tautly paced and exciting, this one was a bit too long and had its fair share of dull moments. One of the annoying aspects of the first film, the incompetent head policeman was also present here.

","No explanations are required to illustrate how outstanding the original 'Die Hard' is, with many claiming it to be the greatest 80s action film ever. With such big box office numbers and acclaim, a sequel was to be expected. Fortunately, it's a decent follow-up. But its self-aware serendipity is also a familiar curse. John McClane is back, this time attempting to stop of group of soldiers turned terrorists at an airport on Christmas Eve. It's a generic by-the-numbers plot that, for the most part, moves along at a swift pace. A sequel fully equipped with typical McClane one liners from ""yippee-kiyay"" to many dialogue lines of Willis talking to himself sarcastically. ""Why does this keep happening to me?"". And it's with this self-awareness that the film falters. It acknowledges that the events taking place are serendipitously alike to the first film, which in turn loses the credibility in the plot. I mean Christmas, again? Accompanied by a bland antagonist(s), it quickly becomes clear that it pales in comparison. Alas, it remains enjoyably buoyant throughout, with the explosions increasing in radius (atleast two planes exploded). Willis again packs the testosterone and retains McClane as one of cinema's greatest characters. However, forget about the dazzling protagonist, the real hero is (drumroll please)...the fax machine. Yes, never has a fax machine been so useful in a film. Predictably the airport security were useless, but damn that fax machine was something else. Such prowess, such elegance. The way it prints out that paper with no distractions. Just one machine, doing one task. ""Die Hard 2: Fax Harder"". Seriously though, a decent sequel. However bigger explosions and carnage does not necessarily make a better film."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","1 February 2018"," A worthwhile follow-up to the action classic
","The original ""Die Hard"" is an essential action movie that ranks among the very best in the genre. At this point, we've seen four sequels of somewhat varied quality. For my money, the most successful of these is ""Die Hard 2"". I like that it stays closest to the spirit of the first movie, although others may be hoping for a bit more variety.<br/><br/>This time around, the events of the movie once again take place on Christmas Eve. Defying the odds, detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) once again finds himself having to almost single-handedly take down a team of terrorists who have placed his wife in immediate danger (along with several others). This time, instead of being trapped in an inaccessible skyscraper, the would-be victims of terrorism are now trapped aboard passenger planes that are unable to land and are rapidly running out of fuel. With these kinds of similarities, I'm glad that the movie goes so far as to have John McClane ask himself how this sort of thing can happen to the same guy twice. That kind of self-awareness makes it easy to forgive the movie's disregard of plausibility in the pursuit of entertainment value.<br/><br/>Thankfully, they took more than just inspiration for the plot from the first movie. Willis is back, of course, but so are Bonnie Bedelia & William Atherton, plus (in a cameo appearance) Reginald VelJohnson. There's some good interplay between Bedelia & Atherton that livens up the scenes aboard the plane. At ground level, some of the notable supporting actors are Dennis Franz, John Amos & William Sadler. All in all, a nicely assembled cast that does justice to the compelling script by returning screenwriter Stephen E. de Souza.<br/><br/>Director Renny Harlin got his chance when John McTiernan declined to return and I'd say that he did a perfectly capable job in his place. The film moves at a brisk pace with no shortage of action. The climactic showdown may be a bit over the top but not quite so much when compared to later entries in the series. Another returnee worth mentioning is Michael Kamen, who once again provided a unique musical score.<br/><br/>Although it certainly isn't the most original movie of all time, ""Die Hard 2"" does a good job of providing thrills in the same vein as its predecessor. Subsequent sequels strayed further from the original template and, in my opinion, lacked the intangible qualities that made ""Die Hard"" stand out among a sea of action movies in the first place. While ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" has its moments, ""Die Hard 2"" has always been (and is likely to remain) my favourite of the sequels."

","RELEASED IN 1990, "" Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" is the second of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series.

Meanwhile McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is stuck in the air circling the airport with her nemesis from the previous film (William Atherton). Dennis Franz plays the head cop (with an attitude) at the airport while William Sadler plays the lead terrorist. John Amos appears as the head commando while Art Evans is on hand as a reasonable cop and Tom Bower as a helpful janitor.<br/><br/>The Die Hard flicks fill the bill if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, fun action flick. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off.

There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's ""The Mummy Returns.""

","The second and third Die Hard movies were better than the first. I rated 2 and 3 an 8 and the first one a 6. ""Three"" was great with Samuel Jackson and Jeremy Irons as ""Simon"", the nursery rhyme cracking psycho. <br/><br/>The second film is great with the addition of ""NYPD blue""'s tough, temperamental, no nonsense Dennis Franz. Bruce Willis is his usual tough wise cracking cop who is always either on vacation or suspension, and his marriage to Holly (Bonnie Bedella) is always on the rocks.The bad guy here is William Atherton who's hungry to have a huge Christmas Eve power trip controlling Washington DC's Dullus airport. They plug in their communications network at a nearby church, of course after murdering the caretaker there. William and his men have a soft spot for South American dictator Franco Nero (who does look like Fadel Castro, Roger Ebert was right) who's getting transported to the USA for major drug smuggling charges. William, in order to free his buddy,is willing to hold up the entire airport,leave planes circling for hours including Holly's plane, and cause a plane full of innocent English passengers (since when does an English narrow bodied plane fly to the US?) to crash (I don't like how they made the passengers and attendants on that plane so pleasant and nice when two minutes later were a fiery death).I like how on Holly's plane, smarmy,annoying passenger William Sadler, who the flight attendants can't stand, re unites with Holly after a previous incident. Flight attendant to Holly: "" what did you do to him?"" Holly: ""I knocked out two of his teeth"". Attendant: "" champagne?"" I liked that. I also liked a lot of the action with Willis and his enemies at Dullus, first in the baggage handling areas, there were several shootouts, and a very narrow escape from a grounded plane with fresh grenades just thrown in and Willis catapulting straight up into the air on a parachuted ejector seat.<br/><br/>I also liked the back and forth banter between Willis and Franz (some of it really played out like an ""NYPD blue"" episode). Franz did not like a badass with an L.A. badge preforming his own style of active duty in his airport. Franz tells Willis off in his office after gunning it out with a couple of bad guys, and does not care that Willis was only shooting in self defense. He tells him ""you're in my little pond now,and I'm the big fish who runs it"". Willis then in the control tower, fails to convince Franz and the control tower head that there's a plot going on. Then when they all see the runway lights shut off and they get a dictation over the intercom from the terrorist about his demands, everyone can now see what's really happening. But instead of Franz acknowledging to Willis he made a mistake by not believing him, he just pushes him away saying ""we got a first class unit, SWAT team and all, we don't need no Monday morning quarterback!"" Like he told him before, that LA badge didn't mean s*** in his airport. <br/><br/>There's also the annoyingly over chatty Washington D.C. press news anchor who gets the same words from each person she comes to with her microphone when she says ""just give me two words"", the words in response being "" f***"" and ""off"". It is annoying that while during a terrorist crisis, you don't want some bubbly news anchor coming to you chatting your ear off. She even says to Willis at one point ""who-y who?"" after not hearing a name Willis mentions. Overly talkative people seem to want to not just increase the amount of words they say but also embellish their words like saying ""who-y- who"" instead of just ""who"" or ""givetty- give"" instead of just ""give"". I've meet overly chatty people in real life who do that, and it does annoy some people. <br/><br/>I did like Willis saying while showing his ring finger ""just the fax"" to a pretty woman offering to take him out for a drink, after helping him fax some papers to L.A., to his Twinkie eating friend who was seen doing just that several times in ""Die hard 1"". I also noticed the addition of what's his name, the cop who gave Willis a parking ticket at the beginning of the movie playing his usual wise*** character."

"MaximumMadness","7","1","2","8 January 2017"," ""Die Hard 2""- When it is able to do its own thing, it's great. But it falls prey to just repeating what came before a few too many times to be anything more than ""decent.""
","""Die Hard 2"" is one of those sequels that is unfortunately just a little too in love with what came before to really stand on its own. You know what I'm talking about... movies like ""Ghostbusters 2"" or ""Rush Hour 2"" that simply coast by on repeating what worked in the original while doing little else to differentiate itself, other than changing the setting or upping the stakes a bit. Yes, after the neo- classic that was the original ""Die Hard"", it seems like the production team and director Renny Harlin were perhaps a bit frightened of the prospect of a follow-up, so they played it safe. And I can definitely understand that reasoning, and I don't necessarily even blame them for it. But still, it has to be said... the best moments of ""Die Hard 2"" are those few fleeting glimpses of originality that are occasionally injected into key sequences. The rest of it? Just a slightly inferior retread of what came before. Is it bad? No, not by any stretch. But it is a bit of a step backwards.<br/><br/>A few years after saving the day at Nakatomi Paza, New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is on his way to pick up his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at Washington Dulles International Airport on Christmas Eve. However, there's a game afoot, as a group of evil former Special Forces operatives headed by the vile Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) seize control of the airport in an attempt to free General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero)- a drug lord and dictator from the nation of Val Verde who is being transported to the US to be tried for his crimes. With the planes in the air held hostage, McClane must now battle his way through the airport in order to stop this deadly scheme and save the day- and his wife- once again.<br/><br/>To give credit where it is due, the cast is uniformly excellent. Willis is as charming and charismatic as ever, and it's fun seeing him back in the role that helped define his super-stardom. Especially now with the added bonus of him being somewhat self-aware of just how ridiculous it is to be in this situation once again, which generates some good humor and informs the character. Bedalia is a ton of fun in her returning role as Holly, and it's a shame that she didn't continue to play the part in future installments. She helped ground John and make him feel like a real person. William Sadler is adequately menacing as our lead villain, and though he's no Hans Gruber, you'll definitely love to hate Colonel Stuart. There's also some really nice supporting roles, including a blink-and-you'll-miss-it pre-T2 Robert Patrick as one of Stuart's thugs and a really fun cameo from Reginald VelJohnson as his iconic character Al Powell.<br/><br/>Finnish director Renny Harlin takes the seat helm this entry in the series, and I think he does a really great job visually and aesthetically, especially given this was his first massive film. He's got a good sense of composition and flow that works well for the material, and he knows how to paint thrilling and stylish sequences of bloody action and harrowing stakes with ease. Even with his background mainly in the world of horror, he proves himself quite capable. It's almost a shame in retrospect, especially seeing where his career has gone in recent years with a string of critical and commercial failures. The man knows how to make a fun flick... and I hope he recovers and is able to deliver on his promise once again.<br/><br/>Written by original co-writer Steven E. de Souza and series newcomer Doug Richardson, the script is the source of both the film's most rampant strengths and also its most tragic failures. Penning a sequel is always a hard thing to do, especially with high stakes and even higher expectations. And I do think that de Souza and Richardson for the most part capture the spirit of the original. And at its best, there are some really great sequences. I particularly admired some later scenes where McClane is actually about to leave the airport, as it not only broadened the story but also showed us something new and exciting. And its these moments of originality where the film most shines. However, as I mentioned above, the problem is that there seems to be an inherent fear to try too much new with the film. And thus, it often boils down to just simply re-using tired and true ideas from the first film. Lots of McClane crawling through vents while complaining. Lots of shoot- outs in small spaces. Lots of people talking over the radio. And even some secondary characters like William Atherton's smarmy reporter Richard Thornburg are brought back in wholly superfluous supporting roles, for no other reason than the film to highlight them in an attempt to win the audience over with nostalgia. It feels too ""safe"" for a ""Die Hard"" movie, and the inability to take any real risks brings it down a lot.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it's not a deal breaker. The excellent performances, likable characters and sharp visual direction are able to overcome many of the fundamental issues in the storytelling. In the end, ""Die Hard 2"" never reaches the great heights of the original. And outside of a certain fifth film that I like to pretend doesn't exist because it's unwatchable, it's probably the weakest of the series. But it's still most certainly a ""Die Hard"" film at its core, and it's still a ton of fun. It just can't quite elevate itself beyond the level of ""pretty good"" due to it just repeating what came before but with somewhat less flair.<br/><br/>I give ""Die Hard 2"" a decent 7 out of 10. Fans of the original should check it out, but don't go in expecting another classic."

The first thing I noticed is Bruce Willis seems to get the same little cut above his right eyebrow as he got in the first movie. I know, nit picking, but it's almost like a studio found that the eyebrow injury tested well among audiences. <br/><br/>Okay, so that was a little bit of a minor thing compared to things like grenades with the longest fuse, ever or the completely gratuitous nude scene from our villain with the perfectly sculpted posterior, but it sort of gives you an inkling of where I'm heading here. If you look too closely at this film, it'll drive you mad. They put so much detail into this film and most of it is pure nonsense. <br/><br/>In it, you get Colm Meany and Patrick O'Neal speaking to each other in fake accents for absolutely no reason whatsoever. You'll see a hole in a windshield just to remind you that there's a hole in a windshield. You'll have someone describe the hole in the windshield although it'll really have no impact on the plot other than there being said hole in said windshield. You'll watch airplanes land on runways covered with debris from other airplanes... wait, I'm just going to stop there because there are way too many plot holes, mistakes, goofs or just plain nonsense in this film that it makes Transformers look like a documentary.<br/><br/>At the end of it, you just won't care. It has some magical ability to just make all the nonsense go away and leave you rooting for the indestructible John Mclean and his plucky band of sidekicks.

The fifth Die hard movie a good day to die hard is also a little better. But still this one of this best action movies made before 1995. John M.c.c.l.a.n.e battles another group of terrorists.

"MUFCOK","7","1","2","26 January 2015"," Entertaining Sequel
","Firstly I will start by getting the comparisons with the first Die Hard out of the way. For me, Die Hard 2 lacks the same tension that its predecessor has; it doesn't have many scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat. It seems a lot more over the top and predictable. Bruce Willis is just the same but he does have quite a few more cheesy one liners and some of them felt a little forced and awkward. The story is very similar to the first (terrorists, hostages, his wife etc.) but that didn't bother me to be honest.<br/><br/>It's Christmas again and John McClane is in Washington waiting at the airport for the plane to land with his wife on board. He notices some suspicious looking activity and shortly after things escalate out of the control. A terrorist group has taken control of the air traffic control and leaves several planes circling the skies (one of which has McClanes wife on board), running low on fuel and unable to land until their demands are met. The police force and security there don't want to talk orders from McClane so he again, takes matters into his own hands. McClane uses everything and anything he can get his hands on to stop the terrorists in time, including machine guns, knives, snow mobiles, helicopters and even suitcases!<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is an entertaining action flick with everything you would expect from a film of this genre from this time period. Its main problem is it just isn't as good as the first Die Hard and you cannot help but compare whilst watching it. Die Hard 2 just feels a lot slower and creates much less tension, it seems to take quite a while to get going and the action scenes seem to come in stages, it feels like you will have a decent action scene and then nothing for 20-30 minutes or so. It is only 120 minutes long but it does feel like it is dragging its heels at times. Die Hard 2 does push the boat out in the action scenes though, it can be quite violent at times and there are plenty of explosions! The Villain, played by William Atherton isn't doesn't have the same presence as the villain in the first movie.<br/><br/>Overall, if you compare it to the first Die Hard it isn't great, but if you view it as a standalone film; which I think you should, it is an enjoyable action flick! Personally I found it more entertaining than I was expecting and as far as sequels go, Die Hard 2 is a pretty good one!<br/><br/>7/10"

","John McClaine is forced to be the hero again when Col. Stuart (Sadler) devises a plan to hold the entire airport hostage. Stuart has taken over control of all the electrical equipment affecting all the planes that are landing on the runaway. With no lights on the runaway, all planes are in trouble. If that isn't enough, McClaine's wife Holly is on one of the planes. McClaine must rediscover his nose for trouble and the heroics from the Nakatomi situation to save his wife and everybody else. <br/><br/>No matter how hard Reny Harlin tries, this is nowhere near as good as the first movie. The first movie is a groundbreaking action movie that inspired many clones over the years. This movie is inferior like most sequels. Despite the effort, I didn't sense anything else but wanting to make money from everyone involved. It feels disingenuous and I never really bought into it. The storytelling pales in comparison and it just feels there. Sequels are very tricky because you have to make sure that it feels legitimate and not just a money-maker. This is one of those movies. All that aside, I actually do enjoy this movie a fair amount. It's action packed and Renny makes sure there is never a dull moment. The action is really brainless that feature some ridiculous OTT stunts that aren't believable for a second! McClaine escapes situations that make him look like Superman in certain scenes. Luckily, McClaine's character manages to make you feel like it was smarts and dumb luck. Despite my criticisms, it's entertaining all the same. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the action. Memorable moments include some good scraps on the wing of a plane near the end. It does begin to drag after a while, but I did enjoy them for the most part. The performances are pretty good. Bruce Willis is great as McClaine. When he wants to be, Bruce is a fun actor that can easily carry a movie. He carries this sequel for sure. He has some awesome one- liners that he ad-libbed himself. His boorish wise cracking persona is a treat to watch and he's perfectly adept in the action scenes. He doesn't have as much to work with here, but he makes the most of it. He's a perfect everyman that anyone can relate too. Bonnie Bedelia is wasted here. Her screen time is much shorter than she had in the first. She has a couple of memorable scenes, but she's nowhere near as prominent. William Sandler is technically solid as the villain. His performance is kind of dull, though. He lacks spark and the charisma that Alan Rickman had. His intensity makes up for that somewhat. William Atherton's role is shorter as well, but he does what he does best! Play an A*hole. Dennis Franz can do this type of thing in his sleep, but he's so fun to watch with it! He's so good at what he does, it's impossible to fully dislike him. His interactions with Willis were a blast. John Amos is fun in his role. Reginald VelJohnson is limited to a cameo in this movie, which is a shame. His dynamic with Bruce in the first movie is sorely missed here. Franco Nero makes a dull bad guy. Robert Patrick and John Leguizamo show up as well. The violence is typically strong for a Harlin movie. An ice pick in the eye was the highlight, in my opinion. <br/><br/>Even though it's my least favorite of the original trilogy, I still watch this once a year. This movie is fun! Just make sure you suspend disbelief and temper your expectations if you haven't seen it. That's about the best advice I can give you. <br/><br/>Favorite quotes<br/><br/>McClaine: Hey Carmine, let me ask you something: What sets off the metal detector first?

"jimbo-53-186511","6","1","2","5 November 2013"," Good film, but nothing more than that
","This is definitely a worth entry in the franchise, although it is undoubtedly weaker than the first film. I will come to the various weaknesses shortly. First of all, a brief overview of the film; <br/><br/>A group of terrorists led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler)hi-jack Dulles International Airport in Washington DC. They take charge of the communication system at the control tower and more frighteningly they are able to take control of the electrical equipment affecting the aircraft. The purpose for this is so that they can escape with General Esperanza (Franco Nero) who is being extradited to the US on drugs charges. The instructions Stuart gives to the police and airport security are clear; he will light up 1 runway for the General's plane to land on and no-one is to approach this aircraft and no other planes are permitted to land on this runaway. The terrorists prove they are not to be messed with when their orders are disobeyed resulting in one of the aircraft crashing onto the runway due to the terrorists informing the pilot that he was 200 feet higher than he actually was. John McClane ends up involved when he spots 2 of the terrorists up to no good in the luggage room. He also has a personal interest in stopping the terrorists as his wife is on board one of the planes that they have taken control of;<br/><br/>There were a couple of issues I had with this film; firstly,(and this is a big one)a couple of the terrorists kill the bloke in the church house and the rest of the terrorists use this as their command base. The church house forms part of the airport, yet when the airport police discover that the airport is being hi-jacked by terrorists no-one thinks to check out the church house to see if they are there. Why? This would be an obvious place and yet no-one thinks to check there till towards the end. Also, the janitor tells McClane how to get onto the airport runway undetected via a series of tunnels so that he can intercept the General's aircraft. McClane does this successfully, but why did he go alone? If the janitor knew about this, why did no-one else know or think of it? Why didn't McClane get back up before going onto the runway? Did anyone else also think that it was rather convenient that McClane manages to acquire a deceased villain's walkie talkie where the deceased villain had kindly punched in the 10 digit code before his demise? Come on....<br/><br/>The acting was generally good particularly by Willis and Sadler. All of the other members of the principal cast also put in decent performances.<br/><br/>DH2 had the potential to be as good as the first film, but the numerous plot holes and absurdities prevent it from being anywhere near as good. It isn't an awful film by any stretch of the imagination and it is at least entertaining and action packed. It's enjoyable (if you look past the numerous plot holes) and it never gets boring. I just feel that if a little more thought had gone into the script and they'd cut out a couple of the OTT cheesy action scenes, this could have been great. It's still worth watching, but fans of the first film are bound to be a little disappointed."
"BA_Harrison","9","1","2","18 August 2013"," A runway success.
","If you can swallow the preposterous notion that 'the same s**t can happen to the same guy twice' then the chances are that you'll have a great time with this explosive, big-budget sequel by Finnish film-maker Renny Harlin. A man clearly at home working in a cold environment, Harlin makes the most of his sub-zero Dulles Airport backdrop, delivering a frozen flurry of knuckle-bruising, bullet-riddled scenes of mayhem guaranteed to give avid action fans goosebumps.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis, reprising his role as tough NY cop John McClane, effortlessly smirks his way through countless bloody gunfights and brutal smack downs against a team of highly trained mercenaries trying to free a deposed dictator/drugs baron (played by cult Euro actor Franco Nero), making this one even more violent than it's predecessor (icicle in the eye—yowch!).<br/><br/>Although the plot lacks the purity of the original, and William Sadler's Col. Stuart can't hold a candle to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber for sheer villainy, Die Hard 2 is still one hell of an enjoyable action flick."

","I know that I probably hold the minority view here, but I've always preferred Die Hard 2 to its predecessors. I take solace in the fact that the legendary American movie critic Roger Ebert agrees. Maybe it's because I like aircraft more than I like tall ugly buildings, but for my money this is the best of the first four Die Hard films (I have not seen the most recent).<br/><br/>Of course it stretches credibility to the point where it crashes and burns with more of a kaboom than any of the special effects on show, but this is not a movie intended to be taken seriously. Some outrageous stunts against absurd odds and some tongue-in-cheek dialogue, mixed in with a few crater-sized plot holes and a bagful of airport thriller clichés, say it all. This is John MacLane, not Jason Bourne.<br/><br/>The special effects are still excellent after 23 years, and while some very lax security issues give the movie's age away as being pre-9/11, who cares? This is one of the ultimate popcorn blockbusters, well worth watching if you somehow have not yet seen it and worth revisiting if you haven't seen it for years."

Once again, in the wrong place at the wrong time, John finds himself hurled into a deadly terrorist attack that plans to take the drug dealer off to a tropical paradise. Plenty of quotable lines to pick up for the next generation of viewers, but not without the famous 'yippie kayee' line.

","Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a fun action movie, who you can enjoy with a popcorn and a Pepsi without a problem. But is it as good as the first Die Hard movie? No, and the reason for that is, it is so many stupid things in the movie, who bugs me all the way. For Example you can't bring a shocking device on an Air plane right? I don't wan't to spoil to much but i don't get why the shooting incident close to the church has to go down like it does. <br/><br/>On the other hand Bruce Willis does a fine job on being John McCaine again. All the other actors do fine again. I also like the fact that this movie is put to Christmas as well, and has sort of a christmassy vibe to it. I wish they had kept that later in the series. <br/><br/>To sum up this is a good movie, but a lot of annoying things makes this a 6 out of 10 for me."

","Bruce Willis is back in his iconic role of John McLane, and this time he's up against a bigger threat with more lives in jeopardy. <br/><br/>After the terrifying events in LA, John McClane (Willis) is about to go through it all again. A team of terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (Sadler) is holding the entire airport hostage. The terrorists are planning to rescue a drug lord from justice. In order to do so, they have seized control of all electrical equipment affecting all planes. With no runway lights available, all aircraft have to remain in the air, with fuel running low, McClane will need to be fast.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is one of the finest sequels of the franchise, and a seriously awesome action sequel. The formula for sequel greatness is all there, and the way that McLane comments on how it is all happening again is quite refreshing. It's a hilarious commentary and hardly a tedious one, unlike in other sequels like The Hangover Part II when the guys comment that it's all happening again. I mean, we'd forgive that if that film would have turned out to be actually good.<br/><br/>John McLane partners up with, instead of Powell and Argyle in its predecessor, he teams up with a funny janitor, among others. The janitor doesn't have a lot of screen time, but he nonetheless leaves an impression on us. <br/><br/>There's a sort-of emotional layer of surprise at one point in the film, when a plane crashes. But it soon goes back to its fun and suspenseful ways. Out of all the Die Hard situations, I think I'd hate being in this situation the most... Think about it, how scary would it be being up in a plane for however long, running out of oil. Especially one is afraid of flying, which I am. And they don't they're in danger, but when they approach the ground - they sure do. It'd just be terrifying to be up there, especially when the criminals are incognito. <br/><br/>In a nutshell: The first Die Hard sequel brings the laughs, fine one- liners a short battle between McLane and Robert ""T-1000"" Patrick. It also amps up the action and the explosions."
"Climinator","10","1","2","2 February 2013"," Just A Day At The Office For John!!!
","Gunfights! Chases! Punch ups! And that only happens in the first 20 minutes! Die Hard 2 is the explosive sequel to the blockbuster original. This time Bruce Willis portrays McClane as having a far more vulnerable side. In this sequel John is waiting for his wife at Dulles Internation Airport. Suddenly a group of terrorists hijack the Airport Control Tower's systems, threatening to crash any of the planes circling above. With his wife held hostage on-board one of them, John does what he does best. To me this is actually my favourite of all four Die Hard's. This is because McClane is actually up against a bunch of rogue Special Forces members. Therefore they are more than a match for him generally speaking. As well as Bruce, his co-stars bring enough energy into their roles to make the film enjoyable. Bonnie Bedilia makes John's wife Holly feisty but likable, William Atherton is hilarious as sleazy reporter Richard Thornburg, John Amos is fantastic as the stubborn Major Grant and William Sadler is chillingly evil as Colonel Stewart. If you like Die Hard then you'll probably like Die Hard 2. 3 & 4 are although good, they have just not got that claustrophobic feeling of one man against it all in one place. Something that the franchise should have retained."
"curtisloew","6","1","2","6 May 2008"," 'Strays from the definition of Die Hard...'
","Inflated with the glory of Die Hard, the writers of Die Hard 2 may have got carried away with themselves. The plot of the sequel seems to try and over-complicate itself too much, with extravagant twists and turns. This alone seems to make the film stray from the definition of Die Hard: immense explosions, one man against all odds with only the manliest of manliness on his side. Perhaps Die Hard 2 has deliberately moved away from the meaningless action of Die Hard, and if so this presents the film in an even worse light. There are too many cross-references, too many quick 'try-hard' lines throughout the film. Willis seems to play the only redeeming character, with the obvious family twist being all the more predictable. The script never seems to take-off let alone taxi from the terminal, as the structure is loose and flounders confusedly.<br/><br/>Yet, there seems to still be some odd sense of satisfaction at the amount of carnage. The explosions are bigger, the action is hard and John McClane's victims do, indeed, Die Harder! For those wanting to sit back and be entertained for an hour and a half this would suffice. McClane racks up another huge body count and the action never seems to stop.<br/><br/>However, this does not seem to be a true Die Hard film. There is too much 'plot focus' too little grit, grime and guts; and isn't that what Die Hard is about, the manliest manliness. Not a film to watch over others, in my book anyway, a film to watch immediately after Die Hard, or part of a return to the Die Hard series."
"DavidSim240183","6","1","2","3 April 2007"," A spirited rehash. But still a rehash
","Die Hard is without a doubt my all time favourite action film. Ever since I first saw it I've loved it. It was a thrilling, pulse pounding adventure crammed with action, suspense and laughs of the highest order. Slickly directed, expertly acted and perfectly paced Die Hard really does stand out as one of the finest action films ever made.<br/><br/>Of course with the success of the original, a sequel was pretty much mandatory. And if any action hero deserves a further saga, its John McClane. Bruce Willis was really the perfect man to play the part. He embodies McClane to such an extent it gets to the point where its not acting anymore. Although a dynamo of action, he's a man with flaws, vulnerabilities and even a family. Not many of them around!<br/><br/>Its a shame then that for Die Hard 2, the writers have simply grafted the same plot as before onto a different setting. Instead of the Nakatomi skyscraper, we have Dulles International Airport in Washington DC. But we still have Christmas. Terrorists. Hostages (including John's wife Holly, spunkily played by the underrated Bonnie Bedelia). News crews. Incompetent thickheaded bureaucrats. And at the centre of it all...John.<br/><br/>Instead of John McTiernan, the man in the directors chair this time around is Renny Harlin. Usually whenever I hear he's at the helm of a film, that's reason enough to start worrying. Harlin produced some of the most brainless films of the 90s. The Long Kiss Goodnight and CutThroat Island are two such guilty offenders. Films that exist for no other reason than to string together increasingly large explosions and bigger and bigger action scenes. And even when he does try something with more emotional depth, he just ends up drowning it out with his trademark explosions. Like Cliffhanger. Still, Deep Blue Sea had its moments. Perhaps because its played for intentional silliness.<br/><br/>Harlin hasn't made a successful film since Cliffhanger. When he was handed the reins to Die Hard 2, his reputation was untarnished. And it was an even bigger hit than the original. Even though it has many of the problems that plague just about every film Harlin gets his hands on.<br/><br/>By using the same basic framework as Die Hard, Harlin puts the only new spin on it. That of a dictator being brought back to America to be prosecuted. But a renegade colonel (William Sadler) in cahoots holds Dulles hostage by hijacking their control tower. Disabling landing lights and ground communications beacons, he makes it impossible for planes to land (ridiculous, because they could establish contact with other airports).<br/><br/>Holly happens to be on one of the planes circling, and McClane must find a way to get control of the airport back. Die Hard 2 is quite efficient. And the two hours do pass by quickly. But it still feels like you've seen it before. Although to the film's credit, it does acknowledge this fact. John asks himself quite a few times how all of this could be happening to him again.<br/><br/>The first half of the film I thought was the best, because its reasonably effective in setting up the events, the characters, and getting John roped into all of this. Even a welcome cameo from Reginald VelJohnson moves the plot along. And there's a stunning sequence where Harlin stages a scarily realistic plane crash at the halfway point.<br/><br/>But in the second half, Harlin begins piling on the explosions, numerous gunfights and fistfights with very little regard for plot. It gets buried so much you sometimes lose track. Harlin keeps trying to outdo himself with increasingly outlandish action sequences. Like when McClane ejects from an exploding jet, the camera fixed in the air, and Bruce Willis heads straight for it until he's almost touching it. Its exhilarating, but a few seconds later reality sinks in and you realise just how absurd the whole stunt was.<br/><br/>There are quite a few characters to keep track of, and sometimes Die Hard 2 feels cluttered. There are some good actors filling out the roles, but it doesn't flow as organically as the original. Even though quite a few are likable. Like Fred Dalton Thompson's head of operations. Or Tom Bower's janitor who proves an invaluable ally to McClane.<br/><br/>Its in the roles of the villains where Die Hard 2 really falls down. The original had the excellent Alan Rickman, who created one of the most memorable villains ever to grace the action film genre, Hans Gruber. A clever, quick witted criminal always one step ahead of everybody else. But here we have William Sadler's anonymous Col Stewart. He's adequate in the part but never brings him to larger than life status the way the role requires. Of the Die Hard trilogy, he's the most forgettable bad guy.<br/><br/>In the air, Bonnie Bedelia does what she can with the limited screen time she's given, and the plot manufactures it so that Thornburg, the slimy reporter from Part 1 happens to be on the same plane. And again he manages to complicate matters because of his blind ambitions. Although the film acknowledges this is all a rehash, this is taking it a step too far.<br/><br/>Still, Bruce Willis brings the same enthusiasm to the film. Quipping away merrily and handling the stunts just as expertly, he's the film's ace in the hole. There are a couple of decent plot twists towards the end, and McClane's solution to their problem is clever (if a bit improbable) but Die Hard 2 still doesn't match up to the superb original. Just remember, there was worse to come from Renny Harlin. In that regard, we should be grateful that Die Hard 2 entertains at all."

"barnabyrudge","6","1","2","17 June 2004"," Entertaining sequel.
","The original Die Hard wasn't the most plausible movie ever made, but it tried to rationalise some of its action and stunts. Die Hard 2: Die Harder completely does away with believability and goes for a comic-book level of reality. Of its type, it is an entertaining and well-made film. Fairly frequently you may find yourself groaning with despair at some of the unlikelihoods (for example, how long do those grenades take to detonate when the bad guys corner Willis in Esperanza's plane cockpit?), but the breathless pacing and spectacular set pieces should just about win you over enough to get a thumbs-up rating out of you.<br/><br/> Story, as already mentioned, is pure fantasy. One year on from his escapades in Part One, John McClane (Willis) is awaiting the arrival of his wife's plane at Washington Dulles Airport. On the same evening a team of heavily armed, ruthlessly organised mercenaries, led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), seize control of the airport. Their objective is to liberate a Central American revolutionary named Esperanza (Franco Nero) who is being flown into Washington under armed guard. They threaten to start bringing down planes if anyone tries to foul up their elaborate plans. But of course, McClane - as we all know - is a dab-hand at thwarting terrorists, and once again he single-handedly takes them on.<br/><br/> The film might have fared better were it not a Die Hard sequel. McClane wouldn't go through an ordeal like this twice in his lifetime, so immediately the film becomes a joke in terms of logic and feasibility. Also, there's a bit too much posturing. A good example is near the start when bad guy Sadler is practising his karate moves naked in front of a mirror, and also as the bad guys prepare to head off on their evil mission they march down a corridor in their headquarters, each man coming out of his room with ludicrously immaculate timing to join the back of the queue! However, Die Hard 2 makes up for its weaknesses on other levels. The set pieces are excellent, including a hair-raising plane crash, a snow-mobile chase and a fight on the wing of a moving aircraft. Similarly, the dialogue is well written, veering expertly between knowing humour and square-jawed declarations of courage. On the performance front, Dennis Farina steals the show, etching a memorable portrayal as an abrasive airport cop.<br/><br/> Die Hard 2 asks for a massive suspension of disbelief. If you roll with it, you'll be entertained. If you take it too seriously, you'll end up shaking your head in despair."
"senortuffy","6","1","2","15 January 2004"," Beware plot holes
","This is a decent followup to the first ""Die Hard"" movie.  It lacks a villain with personality like Alan Rickman, but the action is pretty good and for the fans it follows the same formula as the original.<br/><br/>What bothered me while watching a tape of it recently were the gigantic plot holes in the story, some of them big enough to fly a 747 through.<br/><br/>For instance, the whole mission to rescue General Esperanza was awful time consuming.  They were on the ground nearly an hour before finally making their escape.  Seems to me if you were gonna get away with this, you'd have to have him off the plane and out of the airport within minutes, not an hour.<br/><br/>And how could they have foreseen a snow storm fouling up visibility?   The bad guys must have planned this months in advance and couldn't possibly have know what the weather would be like.  If it had been clear and mild that evening, there wouldn't have been enough confusion to allow the escape to drag out so long.<br/><br/>Also, if the control tower was knocked out, would the planes continue to circle Dulles for hours?   If you were the pilot, would you just go round and round til you ran out of fuel?  Washington is close enough to Philadelphia and Baltimore, where the airports could have handled the planes forced to divert from Dulles.<br/><br/>Finally, even if terrorists took over the airport communications system, the regular phone lines were still up.  If they were cut also, then someone would have had a cell phone.  Why didn't anyone on airport security call in the cavalry?<br/><br/>These flaws in the story line kept nagging at me while I was watching the movie, but if you can suspend your belief in reality, this isn't such a bad movie to sit back and enjoy."

","Die hard is one of the greatest action films of all time,die hard with a vengeance is almost good,but to be honest i was never all that keen on this second one. Having a different director wasn't a good start(renny harin takes over from john mctiernan)but the main quilty party is the script,IT PLODS TO MUCH. In the original, maclane was in endless danger and was never truly safe until the very end of film,in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this one,maclane is more of your typical super sleuth trying to work thing's out in the safety of the dulles air tower while the radio controller's speek boring tecnical jargon. Theres none of the claustrophobic tension of the first film. william sandler isn't as interesting as alan rickman's bad guy,it isn't as if he is a bad actor or anything(watch him as the grim reaper in bill and teds bogus journey,he's a scream)it's just that his character isn't as well written. But the main thing that is offputting about this one is the violence. Don't get me wrong,i am no pussy when it comes to shocking images,and the original was hardly a bed of roses,but this goes to far. the icicle in the eye belongs more at home in a paul verhoeven film.(infact there was a similar scene in total recall which came out in the same summer as die hard 2)but where as verhoeven does everything in an over the top,irony laden fassion,this does it with no hummor at all. Put that and a sickly sentimental ending(and to be honest the first one was quite moving in place's)that is up there with soldier as the most unconvincing happy ending in a action movie and you have another run of the mill follow up cashing in on the succes of the original. The intermitent action interludes are well done,but that is about it.<br/><br/>5/10"

I now own the collectors trilogy and having watched it again, I feel like calling it unoriginal is unfair to the trilogy, since they're all SUPPOSED to be along the same vein.. otherwise it wouldn't BE a sequel. It would be like saying, ""Well, Empire Strikes Back was a dumb movie because they used lightsabers and the force in the FIRST one!""<br/><br/>I'll still say Die Harder (I can't believe they called it that!) is the WEAKEST link in the trilogy, but in it's own right it stands as a pretty darn good action flick."

","Die Hard launched the career of John McTiernan and Bruce Willis as MAJOR Hollywood stars. It also made $137 million worldwide. So whats in store? A sequel that must live up to the original (not an easy job, especially for young director Renny Harlin). But for once, they did it right.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder takes place 1 year after the events in the original film. Detective John McClane (Willis) has moved to Los Angeles and joined the LAPD so he can be with his wife, since they got back together at the conclusion of Die Hard. He is waiting, again at Christmas, for his wife's plane to land at Dulles International Airport. But then lightning strikes again. A sophisticated team of mercenaries led by the sinister ex-Army Col. Stuart (William Sadler) have hijacked the airport's control systems and have power over the airplanes, which are forced to circle over the airport while their fuel runs out. His demands: allow the deposed dictator (and druglord) of a Central American country's plane to land and instead of being taken by Government officials, he will board a fully fueled 747 along with Col. Stuart and his crew to be taken anywhere. Refuse, and planes start crashing. Once again, McClane is forced to be the unlikely hero.<br/><br/>The story in the picture is solid and there are plot twists that keep it interesting as McClane does anything and everything to stop Col. Stuart. This includes a shootout with mercenaries at an unfinished skywalk, a snowmobile chase and fighting with Col. Stuart on the wing of a disembarking jet. The action in the film is really fantastic, and so is the direction. Again, a great cast has been assembled with some returning characters (Holly McClane, the reporter, Sgt. Al Powell) and some slick new villans (sharp eyes can catch Robert Patrick as a mercenary, the guy who would later become the T-1000 in Terminator 2).<br/><br/>The only real problem in the picture is the script. It tries to much to be like the original movie. The reporter from Die Hard returns in a nothing role. There are more thickheaded cops for McClane to argue with. And there is even the discovery of the walkie talkie that the mercenaries use.<br/><br/>Even so, don't let that discourage you from seeing Die Hard 2. It's a pulse-pounding rollercoaster of unpredictability and fun that lives up to the original."

","I echo most user comments that find this less than the original but still a good bit of fun. The decision to practically repeat the hostage/wife-in- crisis scenario is not a total fluke, because they have shifted a bunch of things to create a strong narrative space: airport instead of tower, horizontal instead of vertical, crowds instead of empty space, the wife above in one of many planes desperately circling the air instead of below. In the first we had those marvelous LA horizons through windows or from the top of the tower, here we have chilly airport runways disappearing in the night.<br/><br/>There is much more action this go around. Interesting is how far our devices have come since. Watch how first we have that whole climax with Willis on the wing of the plane and only after it's over do we return to the situation with the planes having to land. I'm sure Nolan must have seen this and the first dozens of times growing up. Imagine how many more anchors and parallel drift he would create between these two set pieces. Or imagine how many different cameras and cuts Tony Scott would bring to any of them to create visual swirls and vortices, then look at the film and be surprised by how static and clean it is.<br/><br/>Willis had some more acting classes by now whereas in the first he was completely raw, just this charismatic guy pretending he had to save the day."

","At first, I thought the producers had lost their minds. Renny Harlin instead of John McTiernan on a Die Hard? But this one is as good as the first, if not better. Bruce Willis reprises his role as the indestructible John McClane, and like Al says, the insurance companies are getting nervous. This time McClane is up against a top notch crew of black ops commandos who have figured out every angle, except McClane. John is the fly in the ointment, and he does his best to counter every move the commandos make. The action scenes are exceptional, and the actors are perfectly cast. William Atherton and Bonnie Bedelia reprise their roles as well, and their interaction on the plane while John fights the bad guys on the ground adds an additional tension to the film that peaks your interest from the start. Dennis Franz as the irascible airport police chief compliments Fred Dalton Thompson as his boss. John Amos as the changeling Army major sent to foil Col. Stuart is priceless, and even plays up with McClane's character. Marvin the janitor is a perfect substitute for Argyle the limo driver, and the entire film proceeds with the pace and tempo that keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what the heck is going to happen next. Rated R for violence, brief nudity, and a whole lot of language. Definitely collectible as #2 of the set of four."

","A cop waiting at Washington's Dulles Airport happens to sniff out a plan to free a terrorist leader. The thinking on the part of the filmmakers was that the formula worked the first time so why change it? This sequel pretty much uses the template of the first film, with Willis again single-handedly taking on a team of bad guys. Even though they don't fit the story, a subplot involving Bedila and Atherton is squeezed in so as not to stray from the proved formula. As with the previous film, the plot is preposterously stupid but mostly entertaining. Willis looks very comfortable as the wise-cracking superhero and is fun to watch."

","This movie is cool. Poor old John McClaine (Bruce Willis) just doesn't seem to be able to spend a nice quiet Christmas alone. It is as if he is a bad luck magnet. The movie opens with his car being towed away and a smart mouthed airport cop giving him a ticket. Then he finds out that his wife's plane is half an hour late, and then some terrorists take control of the airport, and poor John McClaine just cannot sit still. Okay, his wife is on a plane circling Dulles airport slowly running out of fuel, but still he's a cop that knows how to sniff out trouble and when he sees it, he wants to get to the bottom of it.<br/><br/>Die Hard II takes Die Hard and keeps up the pace. There are plenty of action scenes and the movie keeps you hooked until the end. There are twists in the plot and a few surprises. This movie takes place in an airport where as Die Hard is in a building. The stakes are much higher because the hostages are a number of aeroplanes packed full of people. The reporter form Die Hard makes an appearance and Holly plays a minor role. Bruce Willis crawls through ducts and always tries to get to the head of the terrorists. This is something that is missing form Die Hard: With a Vengeance. My opinion is that it has something to do with the change in directors. Die Hard II is directed by Renny Harlin, who takes the original movie and works with the same idea and gives it new life. John McTiernan returned to do Die Hard: With a Vengeance and thus seemed to treat it as a completely different film. There is more linkages to Die Hard in Die Hard II that there is with the third one."

","It's a sad commentary, but every year around the holidays I start thinking about John McClain. That is how ingrained media has become in our minds. This week I decided to watch Die Hard 2 for the 8 millionth time, because unlike most sequels, I found it to be better than the first. Not to say that the first isn't a classic film, but the second one has two things the first lacked. First, Director, Renny Harlan, who is the master of action films, completely unappreciated, and a man who has given me hours of excitement. The second thing is the supporting cast, which features the likes of Dennis Franz from NYPD Blue, Fred Thompson of Law n' Order, and of course veteran character actor, William Sadler. Willis once again is brilliant as John McClain and gave the 90's a true action hero! The Die Hard films are the frame work by which all modern action films are compared and if you skipped the second one, because it was a sequel, you're an idiot! This is a can't miss movie for action junkies."
"Mr-Fusion","7","1","3","22 December 2011"," More terrorists, more explosions, more John McClane
","Bruce Willis' smirk would never again be this bulletproof. It tends to make John McClane overly confident for a while in DIE HARD 2, a movie that promises more and bigger: effects, explosions, firefights and a bigger cage for our hero to run around in. While it doesn't rise to the unreasonably high levels of its predecessor, it does give us big-budget Summer tentpole, a likable hero, ridiculous situations and a droll Christmas wit neatly boxed and gift-wrapped for an early July Christmas. It's clearly a retread, and the filmmakers want you to know that (""I can't believe this. Another basement, another elevator. How can the same thing happen to the same guy twice?""). It's a self-awareness that adequately sets the stage and lets its audience relax and enjoy the ride. As DIE HARD sequels go, it's loud and not at all deep, but makes for a solid good time.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","3","2 November 2011"," The right sequel : ""Die Hard 2"", in the right place : an airport, at the right time : Christmas ...
","""You're the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time"", to which John McClane replies ""Story of my life"" and he's damn right!<br/><br/>""Die Hard 2"" is the continuation of McTiernam's 1988's groundbreaking action masterpiece with quite an ambitious premise: being even more spectacular, suspenseful, violent and thrilling than the first. Well, since it couldn't have been as fresh as the irreplaceable ""Die Hard"", it better had to succeed on the other departments. And it sure did ...<br/><br/>Let's make a little calculation: how many innocent people died in ""Die Hard""? Well, there is the first Security Guard behind the desk who, let's face it, was doomed from the beginning, the second Security Guard, Nakatomi's General Manager Mr. Takagi, a shocking death but necessary plot-wise to convince us about Gruber's evilness and determination, and last but not least, there was Ellis who, like the two FBI Johnsons, had it coming. And after that, we could have a break  4 innocent people when it could have been ten times more, not the most disastrous body count on the 'good guys' side.<br/><br/>Now, let's consider the second opus of the ""Die Hard"" trilogy, Renny Harlin's ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" (and $10,000.00 to whoever remembers the name of director). Now, there's about two hundred people dying in a plane crash, where you could hear some agonizing screams before a giant explosion. This was one hell of a gut-wrenching scene that immediately put the notion of 'mission succeeded' into perspective. But I guess, when the lives of thousands and thousands people are hanging by a thread, right there, in the air, one can consider it as a good score. Well, it's still for me hard to imagine that one director had the guts to kill off so many innocent people just like that. Yes, there were the first troop of cops, and that was quite disturbing, but it was part of their job. The 'Windsor' crash will remain one of the most disturbingly evil acts from an action film and the word is an understatement. But without it, ""Die Hard 2"" would only have been a sort of ""Die Hard in an airport"", while the crash makes you totally forget about the first opus, and John McClane's heart-breaking reaction makes the moment even more powerful.<br/><br/>Sorry to occupy so many lines for what I consider the emotional highlight of the film, but this is the part that I always fear whenever I watch the film and I'll never forget how it haunted me the first time I saw it. After that, I couldn't get the evilness of the antagonist Colonel Sadler off my mind, he's probably one of the most underrated villains, especially because his actions were not even inspired by greed, Sadler was the quintessential terrorist, in his exploitation of fear and sheer terror for political reasons. I don't even think I'm reading too much, because ""Die Hard 2"" has a great capability to inspire the most basic reactions toward the characters, especially the antagonists, who belong to a more one-dimensional kind of villains. They can kill everyone in the most cold-blooded way, and this evilness makes the most gruesome deaths, from their side, kind of satisfying. While the first ""Die Hard"" was based on the interaction between McClane and Gruber, this one relies on the level of action to accomplish the mission, and the suspense guided by the urgency of the situation: planes stuck in the air on the Christmas Eve with no lighting to guide them to the airport. <br/><br/>McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong moment, again, it's Chritsmas, again, his wife is in danger, again, and he's got to go through basements and elevators... again. But these similarities are only the plot elements that contribute to recreate a nice feeling of déjà vu, necessary to enjoy a movie series especially thanks to Bruce Willis' portrayal of John McClane, as charming and charismatic as ever, with everybody against him forced to act by himself. Apart from that, he movie is totally different from ""Die Hard"" in terms of violence and body count. It even raised the level of violence to epic proportions, if there was ever an epic-action film, it would be ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"", featuring so many thrilling sequences, especially one involving an ejection seat, that any attempt to question some plot details is useless. Yes, there are many moments where you wonder how this or that solution couldn't have been used but like its glorious predecessor, the movie captivates your body and mind in such a way, you don't have time for purist technicality<br/><br/>Why are they all cheering and laughing their asses off after the resolution, while so many people died? Why is McClane so reluctant to get into an ambulance? Why should he care about his parking ticket? It's not a movie to judge rationally, it's a good old popcorn film that respect its promise of pure entertainment, but not without a certain amount of shock and gore. The film is much more violent than the first one, and some part can traumatize sensitive eyes, but for the rest, it works as a solid follow-up, respecting the spirit of whatever made the first ""Die Hard"" so memorable, at least more than the third opus.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed ""Die Hard 2"" and never got the criticism... but I'm sure that among those who visited the threads of IMDb or read the harsh reviews before watching the film, a vast majority would be surprised by the quality of the sequel, probably one of the best movie sequels in an action series. And Yippie-ki-Yay, IMDb users!"

","Bruce Willis returns as the iconic action hero John McClane in ""Die Hard 2"" and instead of fighting terrorists in a building in Los Angeles he fights another terrorists (former military men), and this time they invaded Dulles Airport in Washington and they want to take control of everything. Here comes lots of action, shots, incredible scenes and some humor as usual in Die Hard series. <br/><br/>In this new adventure McClane is at the airport waiting for his wife return from a business trip when he notices strange happenings and some unusual movement in the place. He finds out that a military named Colonel Stewart (William Sadler) took control of the airport, at distance, controlling all the planes that are going to land including the plane that carries an important General (Franco Nero) who's about to be rescued by Stewart's group. <br/><br/>In the middle of all this there's the chaos at the airport, flight controllers panicking, the chief of police (Dennis Franz) complaining of McClane actions on the airport and the dangerous tactics used by Stewart in order to get all he wants. And there's McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) on board of one of the planes trying to land in Washington, and she has to deal once again with the arrogant reporter Thornburg (William Atherton).<br/><br/>As an action film the movie goes very well compared to many action flicks that emerged in the past 20 years. In comparison with the other films of the series this is my least favorite because of the excessive drama, it takes too long to really have a decent action moment, and some viewers might get confused in some parts. On the technical aspects I disliked the dark cinematography with overused red lightning, it's almost impossible to see things here. But it's a very thrilling picture, with many inspired and original scenes (McClane escaping of the plane filled with grenades by pushing the eject button of the pilot seat).<br/><br/>Actors performances are very good, Willis is a great action figure playing McClane, Art Evans has the coolest character in the film, and Bonnie Bedelia is even better than in the first film. <br/><br/>The great aspect of this film is the inclusion of many references about the excellent 1988 film directed by John McTiernan, and brought back some of the characters too. I think many people were disappointed that he couldn't direct this one (he was offered the job but he was already filming ""The Hunt for Red October"") but Renny Harlin made a great job here, way better than the ones he's directing lately. 10/10"

","I remember easily comparing 'Die Hard 2' to 'Indiana Jones 2'; both are inferior sequel to the classics they followed and definitely less than the installment that followed. But, after watching again, believe it or not, 'Die Hard 2' really wasn't that bad. It appears they simply made it as a big summer event movie, with comedy, homage to the original, action, explosions and blood. They succeeded. Unfortunately, it doesn't touch the original 'Die Hard' (nor part 3 or 4), but in its own right, it's still worthwhile. Of course, you have to let a lot of suspension of disbelief go – he jumps on a plane (for the first time, that is) and fights on the wing in transit, for Pete's sake. But that's part of the 'Die Hard' mythology: crazy NON-CGI stunts – like the good ole days. But unlike current action flicks, i.e. 'Wanted', the 'Die Hard' movies had heart, character depth & development, funny dialogue, real-life action sequences that took time & not computer space and a true action hero, Bruce Willis. Not that this movie is perfect, by far its not. It's just entertaining, fun and exciting – if you just let yourself be entertained. Unfortunately, if you don't get the ""BIG SHOCK/SURPRISE"" the first time, it's so painfully obvious the second go-around. And that is definitely the movie's biggest flaw. Well, that and today, in 2009, it's also terribly blatant it was filmed prior to 9/11 – anyone seems to bring weapons aboard a plane or even smoke anywhere they please in the airport. This time, John's waiting for his wife in their newly reconciled partnership to land in DC, and surprise, terrorist attack to release a captured General. John fights back. By far not the best 'Die Hard' but still its fun and worth a watch."

"Anonymous_Maxine","7","1","3","10 November 2008"," ""How does the same sh** happen to the same guy twice?!""
","So John is LAPD now, which I suppose means he wasn't able to convince his wife to come back to New York with him and instead decided to relocate to California to be with her. I like that this gives his character more of a human element, and also adds to his humanity by portraying him not as an infallible movie-hero but a very real man with needs and emotions. <br/><br/>This is the same character that was saw in the original Die Hard, who wanted his wife to move back to New York with him and was also physically affected by his wounds throughout the course of the movie. A lesser film would have him getting shot and injured left and right, but the wounds would just be forgotten about as the movie progressed. This happens all the time (The Hunted, with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro springs to mind).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this time around, while John is still effectively portrayed as a loving family man, the bad guys are robotic action movie clichés. Maybe it was Robert Patrick's machine- like performance here that got him the role in Terminator 2? If nothing else, it's interesting to me to see blood come out of him when he gets shot<br/><br/>This time around, terrorists have taken over an airport and are threatening to crash passenger jets if their demands are not met. Immediately, my head is filling with red flags, even though I am not what you would call and airport expert. <br/><br/>It seems that the terrorists have seized control of the electrical system of the airport, blacking out the runway so that the plans can't see to land. I know that passenger jets are designed so that an airport can take control of them and land the plane, and that the pilots don't really have to do the actual landing itself. But does that mean that the pilots are helpless in the cockpit during landing? I didn't know that, and frankly I doubt it. But then again, reporters are able to gain easy access to the airport's control tower in the movie, so clearly there are a lot of liberties taken with reality for the purposes of the plot.<br/><br/>At any rate, John's wife is on one of the jets awaiting runway lights and permission to land, which means the bad guys are going to have a bad time with one particular guy.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is that the premise is just so weak to me. It just seems so ridiculous to think that just a handful of people, even 20 years ago, could take over the control tower and render an entire sky full of passenger jets completely helpless.<br/><br/>We are asked to believe that not only are the pilots helpless during landing, but also during a holding pattern. If they have no control of the plane, why do we have air traffic controllers? What is the point of talking to the pilots if the airport controls the plane anyway?<br/><br/>But if you can believe that, then maybe it will be easier for you to accept that fully loaded passenger planes would sit in a holding pattern indefinitely until they literally run out of fuel and fall from the sky rather than diverting to a nearby airport. And it also might not seem so strange to you when one air traffic controller tells the pilots of one plane ""Good luck"" after telling them to continue their holding pattern even though they're running low on fuel. Good luck??<br/><br/>Overall it's still a good action movie, John is still cool as hell but unfortunately the story is unimaginative and is told through generic action sequences, many of which make little to no sense. At one point, for example, a bad guy is sucked into one of the plane's engines (I would have given a spoiler warning, but you had to already know that that would happen somewhere in this movie) and doesn't damage it at all. <br/><br/>But in the movie's defense, at least the generic action fits well with the flow of the film. Obviously no flame could ever catch up to an accelerating 747, but it does make for a tense scene, and even a bit of what can only be called comic relief when the trail of fire provides runway lights to guide the rest of the planes in the holding pattern to a safe landing. How good could this movie really have been had it not had the airport on fire at the end?<br/><br/>I love the pilots believable dialogue as they begin landing (""If they can do it, so can we!""), and although the movie contains one of the most unrealistic climaxes that I've ever seen in a mainstream action film, it is a passable entry in the Die Hard series. Sadly, it's the worst one"

","In 1988, ""Die Hard"" became a surprising success with only a 28 million dollar budget. Less money was spent on Timothy Dalton's two Bond movies, and they are not as daring as their immediate predecessors. With more money and confidence from 20th Century Fox, the writers and producers went to work on the sequel. ""Die Hard 2"" is bigger and better. It is not better because it is bigger, but because Renny Harlin is the director and writer Steven E. de Souza shows more self-discipline.<br/><br/>""Die Hard"" is well-made with far above average action, snappy dialogue, a top-echelon villain, sets that augment the mood, and Michael Kamen's helpful music. It would receive an instant recommendation if not for the gathering of idiotic characters (my review mentions eight) led by Paul Gleason's police chief. Here, we only have two: police Captain Carmine Lorenzo (Dennis Franz) and returning news reporter Dick Thornburg. Lorenzo is not as omnipresent as Gleason's Dwayne T. Robinson. de Souza exerts more control over Thornburg's interfering powers and makes his actions slightly more reasonable.<br/><br/>Intrepid Los Angeles policeman John McClane (Bruce Willis) is in Washington D.C. spending the Christmas Holiday with his wife Holly's (Bonnie Bedelia) family. He arrived before Holly and awaits her arrival at Dulles Airport. When a group of outlaws plays havoc with the flight tower, McClane once finds himself in the center of deadly standoff. He sees the repeat situation as atrocious luck, but his misfortune turns out to be the good luck everybody else needs that night.<br/><br/>Harlin explains the situation to the audience over a news broadcast, but the crux is that former South American ruler Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) has been extradited to face drug trafficking charges. His plane is to land at Dulles that night. Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) sees the situation differently and demands that Esperanza be handed to him in exchange for control of the tower. Holly is on one of the planes lacking enough fuel to go to another airport, so John places himself ""on the playing field."" John McTiernan photographed the action in the first movie well. Against Renny Harlin, however, he loses. Harlin is one of the most adept action directors in history. There is not one bad second during the six action scenes. Harlin uses zoomed out angles to best exhibit the spatial relations between the combatants and the environment. When they are firmly in our minds, he combines close-ups with his longer distance shots for maximum effect. Next, he incorporates even wider shots to complete his masterful presentation. When Stuart and his men are throwing several grenades, Harlin accomplishes with one angle what most directors need three or more to equal.<br/><br/>He utilizes only one jump scene. Most often, he allows us to see what likely will happen before it does and builds our anticipation by waiting a few more seconds to finish his trick. The brawl outside a church is a prime example, as are McClane's lethal finishers in the luggage room and skywalk shootouts. Harlin also takes his time during Colonel Stuart's ""lesson"" to the control tower. That particular scene will shock anybody who does not know about it before their first viewing. Sadly, I am not a member of that group. All of the other scenes provide a prelude to the finale, which is not very long, but showcases Stuart like never before. I was so impressed when I first saw that I went back and watched it twice more after the movie finished.<br/><br/>William Sadler uses his large eyes and prominently boned face to help give Stuart a chilling countenance. Few can look stern as well as Sadler can, and he can convincingly shout without yelling. Stuart ranks third on the Die Hard villain list, but not because Sadler or the written character are weak. Thomas Gabriel and Hans Gruber are simply exceptional villains played by two good actors giving career performances.<br/><br/>If one argued that nobody could have played McClane better than Willis, I would agree. He is not distressed if only his wife is hurt. He treats any loss of innocent life as failure, and Willis lets us see the anguish and fury when it happens. Willis carries an innate toughness and common man charm, so he does not need to act for those traits to shine. Bedelia does not have quite as much time as before, but as soon as we learned that their marital problems have been fixed, it becomes much easier to for her to sell us the character.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Franz is not featured as prominently as Gleason was. Lorenzo is still an idiot, but not to the extent of Dwayne Robinson. I do not like Franz because his parts here and in ""NYPD Blue"" reflect disgracefully on the 98% of good policemen in our country. Lorenzo cost this movie its ninth star, and it would have cost it more if the character had more screen time. Fred Dalton Thompson is good as usual playing Lorenzo's boss and watching Art Evans is fun.<br/><br/>The overall cast performs better here than in any of the other three John McClane movies. de Souza has a poor resume but would have a far better career if he had replicated this success. ""Die Hard 2"" is action at its core, but the other elements such as lighting, set design, plot and, of course, acting which transcends the genre, are in full force. Give Harlin talent, money and anything resembling a good script and he can make a most superior product for anybody who can handle the content. I hope another ""Die Hard 2"" is in his future."
"theshadow908","7","1","3","1 August 2007"," Good entry into the franchise.
","Die Hard 2 picks up two years after the first film. John McClane is back with his wife after moving to Los Angeles and transferring to the LAPD, and now they're in Washington visiting her parents during Christmas. McClane is at the airport to meet his wife's plane when a group of American terrorists take control and refuse to let any planes land, including the one carrying his wife. Once again out of his jurisdiction and facing an incompetent airport police captain, John McClane finds he's the only one willing to do anything about the situation, and he sets out to save his wife along with hundreds of other people. Die Hard 2 is a good follow-up to the first film.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 takes much of the same awesome action sequences and plot devices and moves it from an office building to an airport, adding some new twists and turns along the way. John McClane continues to be an everyman type of hero that's easy to like. He's fast talking, funny, and he gets the job done. The supporting characters in this movie prove to be awesome allies to McClane or huge pains in the ass, which is fun to watch. The humour in this movie is just as hilarious as the first film, keeping you laughing between all of the explosions. The only problems that I really have for Die Hard 2, though minor, are that some of the action scenes are a little more unbelievable this time around, and the main villain in this film, though really rotten, isn't as exciting as Hans Gruber from the first film. These two minor problems don't really effect the enjoyment of the movie though.<br/><br/>The acting is still great. Bruce Willis does just as well in this film as John McClane. Dennis Franz is good as the headstrong airport police captain who doesn't think he needs McClane's help. William Sadler is good as the American soldier turned terrorist that McClane must stop.<br/><br/>Overall, Die Hard 2 is an awesome sequel to an equally awesome film.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"indigonorthpa","8","1","3","9 January 2007"," Not a bad action flick
","Die Hard 2 is better than the original.<br/><br/>I'm sure many people will love all the action in this movie and they sure will get some good value for their money. They'll see a lot of explosions, spectacular shoot outs, even Bruce Willis flying in a fighter jet. Personally I was a big fan of this movie, until the second half, when all the action with all the terrorists started. At first this seemed like a very nice action comedy, which really had all the ingredients I was looking for, but than it all went wrong. I want to believe a lot of things, but not everything that was shown to me in this movie. Bruce fighting on the wing of a flying a jet, rescuing his daughter with it from a sky scraper, shooting a rocket through the building to a helicopter while a man is hanging on the rocket... No thank you, that's a bit too much for me. I'm probably one of the few who saw this movie who thinks about it that way, but if the action had been a bit less, I would have rewarded with better points."
"Humppe","7","1","3","29 November 2006"," Bring on the guns!
","The Die Hard series counts among the few series with simply great movies in it, such as Indiana Jones, Star Wars or LOTR. <br/><br/>With a smash hit opening like Die Hard I, destroying it with a sequel is close at hand. But no, Renny Harlin delivers a tight and witty package of smoking guns, an intelligent plot, great stunts, hilarious one timers and some fairly good acting. It does not quite live up the claustrophobic feel of of the first film, nor the wits and charisma of the third blockbuster, but in no way is this a weak link. <br/><br/>The film is set in an airport and action takes place on baggage strips, on escalators, in basements, in venting shafts, on runways, on snow scooters and on the wing of an airplane. Former military man Colonel Stuart (William SAdler) hacks in to the control tower of an airport in Washington DC in a snowstorm and blackens all the runways, making all planes circle around in oblivion, waiting to run out of fuel and start falling out of the sky. The constant Unlucky Alf, or police officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) of course finds that his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is on one of these planes. When trying to take control of the situation he gets to take a truckload of crap from airport security captain Carmine Lorenzo (Dennis Franz from NYPD Blue). <br/><br/>So follows a race against time in all places imaginable on an airport with deceits, lies, killings, crashing planes, bombs and a lot of masculine boasting. Bruce Willis cements his character as the well-meaning, but take-no-crap-officer McClane in this movie and is backed up with great acting from obnoxious reporter William Atherton, Franz and Art Evans. Many later famous actors do very small roles as henchmen, pilots or other killing crew in the movie, most notably Robert Patrick, who's next role would spring him to fame in the role as T-1000 in Terminator 2, but also renowned actors as John Leguizamo, Don Harvey, Tom Verica and Robert Martin Steinberg. A big chunk on the downside is that Sadler isn't really doesn't convince as the bad guy of the movie, he is too casual. <br/><br/>All in all, a very good action reel. <br/><br/>-Respect the Humpp!"

Now it's up to John to take out these terrorists before it's to late.<br/><br/>This movie is one of my favorite action films just like the first and third.

The new cast has a lot of well known actors and they do a great job. The action and stunts are classic and the humor is still great. The storyline is very good and I really liked it.

","Building the plot in which McClane finds himself again i believe was a successful attempt, may not be as original as the first one of the series but...in any case builds a perfectly balanced action movie. The humor that Bruce Willis posses as an actor makes him perfect for the role. Combinig this actor's attributes with the set of qualities owned by the lines and directing makes Die Hard 2 one historical action movie. Believe me or not, i would watch this movie along side with my girlfriend. I read a comment about this movie which said something about Bruce Willis being desperate enough to act in such a movie. A believe this is a mistake, because this actor is the man that made Hollywood rock with his action-comedy movies. Die Hard, Last Boy Scout,Moonlighting are just a few of the movies which represent this man's entire carrier, a very successful one i might add."

","There shouldn't't have been a ""Die Hard 2"". And it certainly shouldn't have worked. They idea that this happened to John McClane twice stretches credibility beyond reasonable limits. And yet, ""Die Hard 2"" is a wildly entertaining action movie that ALMOST equals the original. While the characters and plot are not as well drawn, the action and atmosphere are as good, and there's a certain ""Indiana Jones"" element added with the addition of some outdoor action sequences. Director Renny Harlin hit a career high with this one (and has directed a lot of duds since), and deserves a lot of credit for the film working as well as it does. As much as this shouldn't have worked, it's so much fun that the logic doesn't matter - and far more enjoyable than it's successor, ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"", which tries to do something new but doesn't capture the excitement or suspense of authentic ""Die Hard""."
"Aaron1375","7","1","3","8 July 2005"," Good action here and there, but it lags here and there also.
","A pretty good follow up to the smash hit ""Die Hard"" this one actually made a lot more money at the box office. Still, it is not as good as the first movie as the action here is good, but this one has to many boring stretches and needless plot points and a bit to much this and that to even compete with the much more thrilling and tension building original. This one has actual terrorist taking over an airport threatening to take down the planes if their demands are not met. How does our hero McClane fit in? Well it just so happens his wife is on board one of the flights forced to circle the airport while running dangerously low on fuel. So what do we get, short shots of action that is good and a lot of filler in between. Don't get me wrong, there are some great scenes such as the grenades in the airplane, but this Die Hard just seemed to run a bit too long while the first and third movies seemed to cruise along at a very brisk pace. The villain in this one is not as good as Rickman was in the first one, or Irons was in the third and the whole concept of McClane being in the wrong place at the wrong time seems very unlikely to happen. Granted it is just a movie and for the most part it is enjoyable."
"AwesomeWolf","7","1","3","16 April 2005"," More action awesomeness
","Somehow, the original 'Die Hard' managed to be a smart and perfect action movie. 'Die Hard 2' is a bit of a step down. OK, who am I kidding? 'Die Hard 2' is dumb dumb dumb, and that's the way I like my action movies.<br/><br/>It has been a year since John McClane (Bruce Willis) saved Nakatomi plaza, and he has since become somewhat of a celebrity. Waiting for Holly to arrive at Dulles Airport, things begin to feel a lot like Christmas when a terrorist group takes over Dulles Airport, leaving all in-bound flights - including the one Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) is on - circling the airport and running out of fuel. Naturally, its up to John to take on the terrorists, cause some explosions, and save the day.<br/><br/>So, the first thing to notice about 'Die Hard 2' is that the plot is much weaker than the first, and it is more explosiony. I may have just made that word up, but someday it shall be recognized as a real word. In fact, the plot is pretty much just a bunch of plot-holes and clichÃ©s, but that should all be normal to any fan of action movies. Part of what made 'Die Hard' so great was that McClane was not invincible. He was a regular guy, he felt pain, he doubted himself, etc. Seems as though in the year since Nakatomi, he has taken a magic potion to gain immortality or something. Sure, he occasionally shows emotions, but there isn't enough time for that in between all the flying bullets and explosions. As for the bad guys, the antagonists in 'Die Hard' were a small group, but they were smart. In 'Die Hard 2' we have - wait for it, take a deep breath - a rogue special-forces unit turned mercenary-terrorists, working for an ex-fascist dictator and drug-lord. That's like, every stereotypical action bad guy. Awesome.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever negatively criticized an action movie because of a weak plot or acting. All that is important to me is the action awesomeness of a given movie, and 'Die Hard 2' has plenty of action awesomeness. Regardless of inferiority to the original 'Die Hard', 'Die Hard 2', is still a spectacular action movie. Its fun, its exciting, and the final showdown is one the best fights I've ever seen.<br/><br/>'Die Hard 2' certainly isn't the best movie ever made. Should appeal to action fans, and anyone else willing to suspend disbelief and watch and enjoyable action movie - 7/10"
"jofitz27","10","1","3","20 March 2005"," Andrenaline pumping, bullet spraying, quick talking action movie... majestic
","I think it is fair to say that in recent years action movies have taken a serious downfall. The late eighties and early nineties introduced us to such great action films like ""Lethal Weapon"" ""Die Hard "" ""Predator"" and ""Heat"". Nowadays, as was the case with ""S.W.A.T"" and ""AVP"", directors are cutting the realism to obtain ""box-office"" friendly ratings to get a little more cash from a teenage fan base. Not only does that reduce to the pleasure received from the movie, it seems movie-making is turning into more of a ""business"" than an ""art"" or ""hobby"". But did they do that with ""Die Hard 2""? No. And what do we have? An endlessly superb movie overall.<br/><br/>Starting off with quick, smart talking John McLane (Bruce Willis) in an Airport after receiving a parking ticket in a humorous scene, you can clearly see where this is going; it is Christmas, right? But who could have guessed such an excellent sequel would be on the way? Rarely do they surpass their predecessors. But with this case, everything is right. The dialogue is witty, sharp, and superb, the characters (well, most of them) are hugely likable, and surprise after amazing surprise unravels itself in brilliant chase scene after the other, keeping the tension pulsing throughout. Magnificent.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

If he is like that in real life, Mr. Willis must be a real corker to be around. Watching the different movies he has made, I hope he will be around making them for sometime. I just wonder though, how many more Die hard will he be able to do physically. I mean come on...getting cut and beat 4 and running into the ultimate crazies 4 times in ones life.

This movie is truly a MUST SEE, for everyone who like action movies.<br/><br/>In many action movies, the hero tends to be so mighty, one never really doubts if he/she will prevail. In this movie on the other hand, Willis manages to give a great deal of human vulnerability to the tough as nail John MacLane. Making you sit there with your heart in your throat, wondering: How does this end?!!! <br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING The scene where MacLane sits down on the stairs and just cries, knowing that the plane where his wife is, will soon crash, is perhaps the most heart wrenching scene I have ever witnessed in a action movie. END OF SPOILER<br/><br/>Bruce Willis truly proves in this movie, what a splendid actor he is. In my experience very few, maybe no other action actor can show such an ability to not just act the character, but to become the character.<br/><br/>Although this would have been a good action movie no matter who played John MacLane, It is Bruce Willis that lifts this move up to a level, where it will be held in high regard for a very long time. <br/><br/>It is very rare that a sequel is better than the original, this is the fact here. Although Die Hard certainly is a very good action movie, it lacks that nagging doubt. Does this end well! The same is with the thirdmovie, which is in my opinion the weakest of the three. It is kind of funnier, but lacks most of the nerve from the first two movies. Even so, the third move is also more than worth watching. <br/><br/>If you have not yet seen Die Hard 2 or it's prequel/sequel, then you are seriously over due. Run and rent them!!!!!!"

Renny Harlin does great action but, usually, he's not doing the best dilalogue-scenes. I was happy to admit that that standard also includes ''Die Hard 2''. <br/><br/>The L.A cop John McClane is looking forward to spending the christmas holiday with his beloved wife Holly. The biggest problem seems to be the ticket on mrs.McClane's mother's car. But the problems will surely increase. In the middle of all the christmas-stress a well known dicator is going to land, to be taken care of by the USA. But, of course, a bunch of very evil terrorists has decided to disturb that holiday peace buy taking over the entire airport-control tower. They want the dictator and if someone disobeys they will crash a plane. For John McClane starts an adventure to stop the rat pack from killing innocent, including his wife (again) and starting of a new war. The sequel to John McTiernan's ''Die Hard'' is a highly entertaining movie, sometimes exciting but far from realistic. Everything is the same from the first movie, just doubled. The movie is twice as voilent, the bad guy is twice as evil (but too stoneface), the explosions are more and greater and the speed is even faster. <br/><br/>Willis is as usual perfect in the title role and Renny Harlin is doing what he does best. This sequel has that originality that the first one had, but it is still one of my favorite actionmovies. <br/><br/>My rating: 8/10"

There are plenty of surprises and things you wouldn't have guessed, the pacing is near-perfect, and the airplane crash scene is absolutely bone-chilling.

"Leofwine_draca","10","1","4","25 June 2016"," Cinematic brilliance
","For me, this Bruce Willis actioner is perfect. It has it all; cheesy one-liners (""You're the wrong man, in the wrong place, at the wrong time!"" ""Story of my life...""), lots of brutal action, some really nasty baddies, great special effects from Industrial Light and Magic, and lots of suspenseful and thrilling situations. Of course, it's not on par with the original, untouchable classic, but then what is? By basing this story on an unconnected book, about an airport being taken over by terrorists, the producers wisely moved away from simply doing a rehash of the first film with new locations and plot twists.<br/><br/>Director Renny Harlin is at home with the many action scenes here with are fast, furious, and pull no punches. Lots of baddies die in various ways, my favourites being the man whose head gets stuck in a luggage compactor, and the nasty creep who gets an icicle through his eye for his troubles. The action bits in the DIE HARD series are my favourites of any film; I don't know what it is I like about them, but it's just the style and their efficiency which impresses me.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, once again, from an excellent cast. Bruce Willis has firmly settled into his leading action man role, playing the kind of laconic, down-to-earth lawman which he would essay throughout the early '90s. Bonnie Bedelia lends glamour and an icy cool to her role as Willis' long-suffering wife, while William Atherton gets to redo his obnoxious reporter role from the first film. As for the baddies, they're excellent again, with the exceptionally nasty-looking William Sadler being the chief villain. John Amos is highly likable as the ultra-tough army sergeant. Even Italian favourite Franco Nero turns up as a wicked general.<br/><br/>I love that immortal dialogue by Willis, especially the self-referential lines. I love the fantastic, poetic ending which has to be one of the best endings of any action film, EVER. It's just sheer brilliance (everybody I know who's seen the film agrees with me). I love Dennis Franz as the foul-mouthed pencil-pusher. I love the escape-by-ejector-seat scene. Basically, I love everything about this film and I could watch it again and again for the rest of my life. Unsurprisingly, it's one of my absolute favourites."

Harlin handles this picture like a pro with it's dynamic action sequences, a fast paced, a excellent cast of pros and amusing sense of humour. The special effects are certainly impressive. This was probably the most expansive movie of 1990. The supporting characters are less dumb than they were on the first ""Die Hard"" picture and it is extremely silly at times. But on the usual Summer Blockbusters, that's soon to be expected. It's the kind of movie, you will certainly enjoy if you don't expect logic too much.

I just want to clear up a few things there is no ""weak"" Die Hard movie, there all terrific and I can't wait till the fourth one. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis (my favorite actor) reprises his role as the heroic cop John McClane and once again puts on a terrific show. Thats the thing with guys like Willis. You have so many different types of if you will ""class"" with action stars, your macho and indestructible men, the martial artists that Can take on just about any living mortal and that there's Bruce Willis, portraying an average everyday guy who's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br/><br/>In my opinion the location of this movie was better than the first, the airport was a good idea and the action is definitely heightened. The scene when Willis launches himself out of the plane as it explodes, the snowmobile chase and than that exploding, and especially the ending (though I won't say any more for those who haven't seen it). The whole idea of McClane's wife's plane not having anywhere to land and circling running out of gas along with the other planes. It was terrific. OK its not as in any way as realistic as the first 1 in the first 1 you feel as if it could actually happen, this 1 not so much but the action is delivered better in a better setting and storyline. <br/><br/>William Sadler was a great villain especially in the scene Spoiler when he crashes the plain filled with innocent people, oh man I hated his character for that, meaning he did a good job. <br/><br/>A+ actioner if you liked the first (which just about all the world did) there's no reason you shouldn't like this 1"
"nimajneb8291","10","1","4","20 February 2006"," damn good film
","this is an amazing film... without it's predecessor. Die Hard 2 could have been one of the most outstanding films i have ever seen, but includes far too many features of the first Die Hard. it starts small like a few phrases being said that have already been used, but then McClane begins listening to conversations he shouldn't... again. this is unforgivable in my opinion, however the list of good points is endless, from the non-stop gripping action right from the very beginning to the very end that is socio intense in places that you will literally glued to the TV screen, to the dramatic twists in story and even the small seemingly meaningless and comedic comments that Mr. McClane slips in every now and again. overall i think that Die Hard 2 is a fabulous film and i would recommend it for sure!"
"dee.reid","8","1","4","11 December 2005"," More of the same, but still more fun with our favorite terrorist-busting detective
","It would be interesting to see if Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) ever has a normal day. Nah, that wouldn't be a whole lot of fun, now would it? We've been watching our hero bust up bad guys for nearly 20 years now, and with talks of another, fourth ""Die Hard"" in the works, I think it would be nice to go back in time and watch his past exploits, like 1990's ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder.""<br/><br/>John McTiernan directed 1988's ""Die Hard"" and rocketed wild-card star Willis to fame in an iconic action role. McTiernan's gone for now, and up at the helm this time is Finnish blood-maestro Renny Harlin (whose future clinchers ""Cliffhanger,"" ""The Long Kiss Goodnight,"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"" would later cement the director's reputation in Hollywood).<br/><br/>The film is basically a repeat of its predecessor, going as much as to reuse some of that film's plot devices and mechanics to structure its own fast-paced story line. On a snowy Christmas Eve night, not a creature was stirring... okay, not quite accurate, but it's a good start for a review, even though the events are on Christmas and a blinding snowstorm is rapidly approaching the metropolitan area.<br/><br/>At Dulles International Airport, where Detective McClane is patiently awaiting the arrival of wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), terrorists led by the ousted military colonel Stuart (William Sadler) lay siege not with guns, but by crippling the airport's landing system so they no longer have control of their incoming flights. Col. Stuart's meticulous plan is a jail break: deposed drug lord Gen. Esperanza (Franco Nero) is on one of Dulles's special Christmas Eve flights, and by disabling their guidance-landing systems and using their own equipment, they're going to spring him free and then head to a tropical paradise with no extradition treaties.<br/><br/>Over Dulles, however, many planes are circling and have nothing to do except wait. Those with enough fuel are sent to alternate airports but there are still many overhead, and running out of fuel. With Holly on one incoming flight, what's John to do? The terrorists don't care of course, except getting their cargo.<br/><br/>Only one thing stands in the terrorists way, and that is our hero John McClane, who must also deal with D.C. bureaucrats including a pre-""NYPD Blue"" Dennis Franz as an airport security chief and Fred Dalton Thompson as air-traffic controller Trudeau. John does eventually find some aid with Leslie Barns (Art Evans) though. Reginald VelJohnson reprises his role as Sgt. Al Powell (in what is essentially a five-minute cameo) and William Atherton is back as arrogant news reporter Richard Thornburg, who's also trapped on a plane with Holly.<br/><br/>For his rogue gallery here, director Harlin (working from Walter Wager's novel ""58 Minutes""), has assembled a flawed but capable production that has a stronger emphasis on action scenes rather than plot. In ""Die Hard,"" McClane was an Everyman caught in a not-so-everyday predicament and had to rely on his wits to stay alive, and a lot of the action was spare and took place in confined, claustrophobic areas. We don't have much of that here, as his character has pretty much been reduced to a generic trash-talking, one-liner-spewing archetype who's able to dodge the many bullets fired in his direction without much trouble. But he's still a pretty cool guy, though.<br/><br/>The bad guys, corrupt military officials, aren't all that frightening or intimidating either, though Col. Stuart does seem to peak in sly villainy during one particularly disturbing and explosive sequence of ""lessons."" (This scene alone is probably why ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" is on the FAA's ""no-play"" list of many in-flight movies.) Eventually, Washington brings in Maj. Grant (John Amos) and his men to come and deal with the crooked military terrorists. And lastly, you should also be on the look out for a pre-T-1000 Robert Patrick and comedian John Leguizamo in small parts as Col. Stuart's henchmen.<br/><br/>""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" isn't a failure but is a worthy sequel to its landmark predecessor. It's bigger, bloodier, and much louder than ""Die Hard."" But the tag line's not lying: this sequel ""dies harder.""<br/><br/>8/10"

","Die Hard 2 is worth watching, though it is not as good as the first Die Hard.  It does expand on ideas rather than remaking the original, though not entirely original.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis returns as John Mc Clane, though there are a few changes this time.  He has joined the LAPD, he has reconciled with his wife, and the action is based in the Washington D.C. International Airport.  But, his dry humour and gutsy determination has not changed.  This time round, he takes on a group of mercenaries who want to free a captured dictator from the custody of the government and have taken over the communications of the air traffic control, and must compete with an incompetent police chief who does not want Mc Clane involved, and a group of marines who want to quickly resolve the situation.  Yet again, Mc Clane must jump into action and take matters into his own hands and save his wife and other passengers who are still in the plane/s above before they run out of fuel.<br/><br/>Good action movie and good stunts do make up for its sort of recycled plot.<br/><br/>Best bit:  Mc Clane takes on several terrorists in the airport who have wiped out an entire SWAT team.<br/><br/>8/10."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","1","4","24 June 2004"," Above average as an action film, but only just barely average as a sequel
","This is not as good as the first. I think this is because of these two main reasons. First, how shall I put this... in the immortal words of famous brat Bart Simpson: ""*annoyed groan* Everyone is a comedian."" Every single character that has a speaking part in this film utters, at least once, either a one-liner or a cliche. If a character only has one single line, that will be a one-liner or a cliche. Guess they thought that audience loved the first for the wisecracks(granted, I enjoyed them, but that's because Willis is great at them. I hate it when I hear some random character spout one-liners). Second, this one just took bits of the formula that worked so well for the first, and left more than half out. This time, McClane isn't confined to a building which he is trapped in, trying to rescue hostages. This one has him running around an airport, while the hostages are in planes, where the only threat to them is the limited amount of fuel, which will eventually force them to land. Nothing else. That makes you care too little about the hostages, and pretty much eliminates all the supposed intensity of the situation, apart from the immediate danger that McClane is in, which is a little limited. Also, in the first, McClane seemed more intelligent, cool and calm. This time, he's just running straight into the enemies, shooting constantly. Don't get me wrong, it's entertaining, it's just a little disappointing to us who liked the style of the first. We liked John McClane as he was, and I definitely hoped to see him like that again, instead what I got was Rambo. I also think this has far too many plot holes, especially compared to the first, that was virtually flawless. Okay, now that I'm done ranting, I'll get on with the actual review. The plot is OK, but fairly standard for this type of action film; it's also fairly dull and just barely manages to keep your attention. The intensity of the first is almost completely lost. The acting is about the same, no big surprises here. The humor is pretty lame, in the first it was very balanced, here, it's so plentiful that if I didn't know better, I'd have guessed it was a parody or a comedy. The action is fairly good, less intense than the first, but still pretty good. All in all, as an action film, it's above average, only slightly though, and as a sequel to Die Hard, it is just barely average. I recommend this to fans of action films, but more to fans of Rambo-type films than fans of the first. 7/10"

The change of venue is fresh, and the action sequences here are every bit as exciting as in the original, though the plot drags in between. John Amos is entertaining as the head terrorist, and Dennis Franz gives a decent performance as a desk cop whose feelings for McClane are anything but respectful.

The sequel still maintains that suspenseful atmosphere and the action is every bit as thrilling as before. The dialogue is quotable and memorable, and while the concept struck me as ridiculous initially on film the story is unfolded in a careful, brisk and compelling manner. The characters are engaging, even the villains especially the main one Col.

","After the blockbusting success of the first film, director Renny Harlin (The Long Kiss Goodnight) brought back the humorous, wise-cracking and admirable hero in the wrong place at the wrong time. It is Christmas Eve again, one year since the events at the Nakatomi Plaza Building, and LAPD Lt. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is in Dulles International Airport in Arlington, Viginia, waiting for the flight his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is on, as their kids are visiting her parents in Washington. In the airport John hunches suspicious activity, and of course, they start shooting at him, one gets away. Soon enough, terrorists have made sure that all planes landing at this airport will either crash from false navigation or running out of fuel. The leader Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) wants the airport to make sure that a plane from Escelan Airport in the Republic of Valverde, carrying General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), guilty of drug handling, can land at this airport where he wants, be undisturbed, and then they get away. Holly's plane is obviously one of the 18 planes circling the airport and in danger. John is now on the lookout for the villains to stop their plan, and bring his wife down to the ground safely. Also starring William Atherton returning as Richard ""Dick"" Thornberg, a brief return from Reginald VelJohnson as Al Powell, John Amos as Maj. Grant, Dennis Franz as Carmine Lorenzo, Tom Bower as Marvin, Sheila McCarthy as Samantha Copeland, Don Harvey as Garber, Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as O'Reilly, a quick John Leguizamo as Burke, Vondie Curtis-Hall as Miller and Mark Boone Junior as Shockley.

"davidmvining","3","0","1","18 May 2020"," McClane gets added into an Airport sequel
","This is a movie that is driven purely by plot needs with no room for anything else other than action scenes. No one feels like they have a life outside of the basic plot actions that they need to fulfill. The whole exercise then feels like a mechanical product with no life or soul to it. It feels dead because there doesn't feel like there's a single living person involved.<br/><br/>It's pretty obvious that this movie was originally a script that had nothing to do with John McClane because McClane feels oddly out of place for most of it. He wanders in and out of rooms that he shouldn't even begin to have access to as a Los Angeles police officer in a Washington DC airport. His emotional connection to the terrorist attack on the airport is thin, almost tacked on. McClane has one very brief interaction with the main antagonist, Colonel Stuart, at the very beginning of the film, and the two don't meet until they're punching each other on the wing of a 747 at the end of the film. There's a deep disconnect between McClane and the rest of the movie that feels like a lost Airport sequel more than a sequel to Die Hard.<br/><br/>Speaking of Colonel Stuart, he's a waste. William Sadler is one of those really interesting and intense character actors who popped up everywhere in the 80s and 90s, and all he really does in this is explain and dictate. He explains his plan and he dictates rules to the airport's control tower. He talks about his motive once, but most of his interactions with other characters are perfunctory and plot based. This is where the lack of interaction with the main character really begins to fray the film. Stuart interacts so much more with the air traffic flight director Trudeau than with McClane, like the original story was about them in a game of wits and the screenwriter simply added McClane running around the airport as filler to get him into the story.<br/><br/>In the original Die Hard, John came to Los Angeles in an effort to make good with his wife, and a bunch of terrorists got in the way, taking Holly hostage. In the sequel, it's unclear how much danger Holly is ever actually in, and it seems arguable that all of McClane's actions actually put Holly in greater danger than if he had simply waited in the airport terminal for everything to resolve on its own. You see, Colonel Stuart's plan is to hold the airport hostage for an hour (58 minutes, actually, after the source story's title) so that a foreign dictator can safely land at Dulles and Stuart can steal him away for a, supposed, payment and a hit against communism somehow. At no point does Stuart seem willing to kill everyone in the sky if things go well. He does crash one airplane, but only after Trudeau and McClane (on his own) try to get to a communications tower in contradiction of Stuart's orders. Stuart never threatens to down any other plane in any other circumstance unless he doesn't get what he wants. I do not see how McClane reads this situation as one where he needs to make the terrorists' lives harder. If his objective is to save Holly, he should stand back and let things play out. If his objective is to simply do the right thing, he never seems to realize that he's putting his wife's life in danger. Either way, the smart everyman of the first film has become a psychopathic moron in the second.<br/><br/>The structure of the film is also really weird, mostly around a US Special Forces team led by Major Grant. They're introduced about halfway through the film, do nothing for about half an hour until they have a staged shootout, and then they turn on the good guys with about twenty minutes left in the film. The late addition and lack of attention given to them makes their betrayal feel empty not surprising. I think they should have been introduced no later than half an hour in, taken a lead on the counterattack for an hour, working hand in hand with McClane for the whole time, and then, when things are looking like they're unraveling completely, they turn on McClane, pushing the nadir further. This would also require more time spent with Grant and his men than with another pigheaded idiotic cop (the airport police chief Lorenzo) in the disdainful tradition of Deputy Chief Robinson from the first film.<br/><br/>In addition, the effort to bring a bunch of the pieces of the original Die Hard over and in Dulles Airport strains credulity. John McClane is there on the ground. Holly, his wife, is in a plane overhead. Okay, I can accept that, but then Roger Thornburg just happens to be in the same plane. And John calls Al for help.<br/><br/>Oh, and the throwaway tagline from the first film that became super famous simply had to be included in this one even though it actually made sense in context of the first film and comes out of nowhere in the second.<br/><br/>I simply do not like this film. It's poorly constructed, wastes a great character actor in a nothing part for its antagonist, feels randomly assembled from different ideas, and continues ideas in the flattest possible way from the first film. Renny Harlin is a hack."

","This die hard 2 aka die harder film is good and entertaining but suffers from issues like sound mix and bad cast specially Bonnie Bedelia why couldn't they Casted a different actress she ruined the first one and this one too it was good that they removed her character completely for the third die hard film of 1995,here is the thing in this one its about airport hijacking and making air planes crash on run way as some bad guys hacks airport systems and communications and turns all lights of the runways off making the plane pilots totally blind even with all the radar and camera systems on planes the pilots can't land the plane they need to know exactly where is the runway,now with the airport on hostage Bruce Willis as John Mclane comes to the rescue hey this got good action and some comedy but like i said earlier some technical stuff just don't work like audio quality,cast and some scenes should have been deleted for example the Mclanes wife Bonnie Bedalia and the Tv reporter they serve no purpose in this film,why do we need to see same nonsense again that we tolerated in first one the writers and filmmakers couldn't do it any differently back then until the die hard with the vengeance 1995 to get the series on track but sadly die hard 3 was the last good die hard we ever got after that the series got ruined completely still with whatever complains i have of this one it still holds enough repeat value but not as much as the first part my rating is 5/10"

","If you liked Die Hard so much that you wished for a remake, you're in luck! Die Hard 2 features another terrorist hold-up during Christmastime, separating policeman Bruce Willis from his wife. In a tongue-in-cheek line, Bruce quips at the unlikeliness the same thing could happen to the same guy over two different Christmases.<br/><br/>This time around, the bad guy, William Sadler, takes control of Washington Dulles airport and knocks the power out. With no radio communication to incoming planes, no runway lights, and a limited amount of fuel in the airborne vehicles, Bruce Willis certainly has a crisis on his hands. Add in the coincidence that his wife is on one of the airplanes, and he's desperate to save the day! There are tons of action-packed sequences, just like the first one, but unfortunately, since the hostage situation involves airplanes potentially crashing into our nation's capital, this installment isn't really anyone's favorite. Die Hard 2 is the volume most Americans try to forget, since nowadays, the plot hits a little too close to home. You can skip it if you want to, and head on over to the third movie."

","Completely lacks the charm of the original. Stunts completely beyond belief. Bad guys that aren't that interesting or charming. Good guys you want to punch in the face.
The only part I enjoyed was seeing Bonnie Bedelia again. I'd pay $12 just to stare at her on the screen for two hours.
They should have quit after the original. Of course, the franchise was a huge money-maker so they made 9 of them or whatever. Every one of them worse than the one that came before it."
"andrewmerritt-31652","7","0","1","18 January 2019"," A great blockbuster, but not a Christmas movie
","Die Hard 2 is the sequel to Die Hard and it has Bruce Willis reprising his role as John McClane. It's Christmas Eve again and John is about to meet his wife at the airport, but when terrorists hijack the airport, its up to John McClane to save the day again. If you think that this plot may seem similar it's because it already happened in the first one. This movie tries way to hard to be like the first one, but it's ultimately a parody of the first one. I think of Die Hard 2 as the Emo child in the Die Hard franchise as it wants to be edgy and dark so that it can make the first Die Hard proud. Someone in the cast and crew spiked everyone's eggnog and came up with a brilliant idea for them do the same thing, but in an airport. If you think that the first one is filled with one-liners, then you haven't watched Die Hard 2 as they pump one-liner after one-liner so they can retain some of the humor as the first one did. But hearing some of those was so irritating I thought someone was scratching a chalkboard and some of the actors and actresses looked like it took so much energy and effort to say those lines that I could feel their cringe from the comfort of my living room. But despite everything I just said it does make a pretty good blockbuster instead of a Christmas movie, as I didn't feel the spirit of Christmas as I did in the first one. I think everybody knew that this is the last time that they use a Christmas plot in a Die Hard movie and they wanted to squeeze one more Christmas plot before they hang up and move on to another story in the Die Hard franchise and for that I'll let this slide. Overall, its still fun to watch during the holidays, but its not the same as the first one, but you cant deny it does make for an entertaining blockbuster."

","This worthy and gleefully over-the-top sequel to the tremendous 1988 original often feels like a semi-serious parody of the original. On the one hand, the action is heavy-handed and the violence is grisly (more akin to a ""Friday the 13th"" slasher film than an action movie, really), which lends the movie a harder edge than one may expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. On the other hand, everything is over-sized, including Bruce Willis's John McLane, who has moved from Everyman to a workaday James Bond here, lending the movie a comical edge that softens the sometimes shocking violence. There's an overabundance of characters throughout the movie (not to mention a supporting cast overstuffed with middle-aged male character actors who spend their time yelling their dialogue at each other), but the whole movie moves quickly like a roller-coaster, and it's a blast to sit through from beginning to end."

"bitomurder","7","0","2","11 April 2018"," An unlucky day...again
","Two years after the immensely successful Die Hard, John McTiernan, Bruce Willis, and Twentieth Century Fox teamed up to unleash another John McClane adventure onto the world. Many people do not realize this, but twenty years ago sequels were not usually the bigger and better masterpieces that they always seem to be today. Back in the day, a sequel was often times thrown together to make a quick buck and only the biggest movies ever got the budget to live up to the quality that the first one produced. Die Hard 2: Die Harder was given this royal treatment, but despite everything working in its favor, this one fell short of its predescessor.<br/><br/> I guess what disappoints me in this one is the guys' unwillingness to do anything different. A good sequel should be bigger and better than the original and add something more to the overall series, something fresh and interesting if you will. Die Hard 2 falls short in this category. This one seems like a simple rehashing of the same story. John McClane gets unwitting caught up in a terrorist attack and he comes through to save the day despite overwhelming odds against him. This one again takes place on Christmas in Washington D.C. instead of L.A. The story really does not give us anything new, nor do we see anything but the same John McClane. Unlike the other three movies in the series, John plays exactly the same person who has not grown at all since the last time we seen him.<br/><br/> With that being said, Bruce Willis stills gives creedence to the character that he made famous. Returning from the first movie, Bonnie Bedlia as his wife, Holly, and William Atherton as the arrorgant TV reporter, Richard Thornburg give us a bird's eye view of the terrorist attack from the skies, but that sub plot seemed to drag down the movie a little for me. Good performances were given by Art Evans playing Leslie Barnes and by Republican presidential nominee Fred Thompson as Trudeau, the man running Dulles Airport. However, William Sadler gave a weak performance as the movie's protagonist, and he kind of makes you wish that John McClane had not killed Hans Gruber in the first one.<br/><br/> So, Die Hard 2: Die Harder did little to recapture the power that the first in the series seemed to sweat out of ever pour. It was basically the same movie with a slight twist in situation to make it feel fresh. Still, this is a Die Hard movie, and it gives us enough humor and action packed adventure to leave us satisfied after the whole experience is over. Unlike so many sequels that, back in the eighties and early nineties, seemed tired and useless except to bring the overall feel of the first movie down, Die Hard 2: Die Harder is worth the 124 minutes to catch up with an old friend."

","After the first film being a huge success and a fantastic film there was allot of pressure on this film to be good and what I will say is that it is better then most modern day action movies even though it is a bit of a let down. Now the premise of the film sees John mclaine at an airport on Christmas eve that gets taken over by terrorists and he is the only one who can stop them. Bruce Willis performance as John mclaine is legendary and this continues in this film, he is really funny and a great action star. He is a deep complex character and he does the action,the humour and the drama really well in this film and he is easily the best part of the film. The villain is alright in this film but doesn't really stand out at all, but this film has every character you need for this film with the arrogant cop, the tech helper and the head of the military And it does a good job of selling you this film. The story is completely ridiculous it just tried to be too big for its own good and the motivations for the villains just are way too convoluted and the twist and turns just don't make any sense. The script is a mixed bag, most of mclaines dialogue was adlibbed but was still fantastic. It was just some of the scenarios were absurd and just took you out of the film. The style of the film was great all the action scenes were really well filmed and another reason this film is enjoyable. I also liked the mix of Christmas and die hard again and once again it works for this film. Overall this film is an alright sequel that if your an action fan you might enjoy."

","It is Christmas again and for cop John McClane that means dealing with terrorists! While waiting for his wife's flight to arrive at Washington DC's Dulles International Airport he sees a couple of guys behaving suspiciously; follows them and ends up in a firefight that leaves one of them dead. The airport cops say it was probably just punks stealing from the baggage but when McClane checks the dead man's fingerprints he learns that he was supposed to be dead two years previously. It looks as though he was a mercenary and he was clearly up to something it doesn't take long before that something becomes apparent; former army officer Col. Stuart and a group of mercenaries have taken control of air traffic control system and are threatening to start crashing aircraft if their demands aren't met they want foreign drug dealer Gen. Ramon Esperanza handed over to them when the flight bringing him to US custody arrives. It is up to McClane to foil Stuart's plans before his wife's plane runs out of fuel while local authorities are unimpressed by his presence.<br/><br/>The original 'Die Hard' was a taut action thriller with a small group of terrorists, led by a charismatic leader, being confronted by a lone cop of a sealed skyscraper here there are far more bad guys and the action is set in a sprawling airport complex and even though there is more action the story is less exciting. Col. Stuart is lacking the charisma required to be the main villain and with every confrontation McClane survives virtually unscathed it becomes even less believable. The conspiracy to free Gen. Esperanza is too large; we are expected to believe that as well as Stuart's mercenaries there is a squad of US soldiers who are in on it, we must also believe that they have the skills to take over the air traffic control system entirely and that there are no other airports capable of receiving the circling planes! If you can ignore all that there are several exciting moments and some spectacular explosions as well as some amusing moments; mostly involving McClane's wife and sleazy TV journalist Richard Thornburg. The acting is solid enough with Bruce Willis doing what Bruce Willis does as John McClane and the rest of the cast being good enough but not really providing memorable characters. Overall this is entertaining as a mindless action thriller but somewhat disappointing as a Sequel to a great original."

If you try to turn this into a drinking game, by taking a drink whenever some one says ""McClane"",let me warn you now, it will cause alcohol poisoning!

","DIE HARD 2<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is back as John McClane. Life after the terrorist attack on the Nakatomi building has not been better for Detective McClane. He is happy with his wife, his job is going well and he is happy but when he goes to the airport to pick his wife up, things just don't seem right. John sees a couple of men looking very suspicious when police officers walk past them little does John know that following them would mean that he is stumbling across a big terrorist takeover at the airport. It is now down to John again to stop the terrorists that plan on crashing a lot of planes to get what they want.<br/><br/>This film is a good movie but nowhere near as good as the original. It is a lot of fun, but it is a hell of a coincidence that John just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time again!<br/><br/>The action in this movie is great. Again, like the first film there are some great fighting scenes and shoot ups. The explosions are not very realistic. You can see that a lot of them are pasted onto the backgrounds with computers especially the scene where John uses an ejector seat to get out of a plane that is about to explode. It looks bad but I can imagine that back in 1990 when the movie was made it looked great. I still like the bad effects though to be honest. It gives it a nice retro feel to the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is as good as the first film with a lot of characters making the crossover from the original. Bruce Willis returns as John, his wife is again played by Bonnie Bedelia. William Atherton is also back as the slimy reporter and yes, he is as annoying in this as he was in the first. Reginald VelJohnson makes a nice little cameo as Johns partner from the first film, Al. And we have some new cast members for the sequel. William Sadler plays the main villain Col. Stewart. William is an evil looking bloke. He does a great job as a bad guy. He has a very cold stare. John Amos also has a great role in this film as the ""take no prisoners"" soldier Maj. Grant. John does a great job. I mainly know John from Coming to America where he is so funny but in this he plays a bad ass that takes no trouble. He does it very well and is one of my favourite characters in the film.<br/><br/>There are some classic comedy lines in this film, again mimicking the original and Bruce says his catchphrase right at the end let's face it though, everyone is waiting for him to say ""Yippie-Kai-Yay, Mother fu"" and when he says it, you can't help but smile. The other thing I like about his character is no matter how much trouble he is in, he always seems to manage to be funny. His sarcasm is brilliant.<br/><br/>The film is again set at Christmas time, which makes it feel like a Christmas movie even though you don't get to see Santa anywhere. Why does John always get himself in this kind of trouble at this time of year? The good news is in Die Hard 3, it is the summer time.<br/><br/>This is a worthy sequel and is a great addition to the franchise. If you liked the first one then you should like this one.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""And where do we get those big portable lights?

The airport setting, the snowy winter environment, the nature of the threat, and the twists in the story are all highly enjoyable and, once again, Bruce Willis plays the dirty-vested everyman with commitment and credibility.<br/><br/>Episode 2 isn't as good as episode 1, but it is still a pretty good film."
"RyanEberhart","8","0","3","9 August 2013"," Least Favorite
","Of the five Die Hard movies this is my least favorite. Don't get me wrong it is still a great movie. It is the return of one of the best action characters of the second half of the 20th Century... John McClane.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis his role as John McClane, a police detective in the right place at the wrong time. This time he goes up against ex-military mercenaries in an airport. The mercenaries are trying to help in the escape of Ramon Esperanza, a general from the Republic of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for drug trafficking. McClane is, again, trying to save his wife who is on a plane in the skies above Dulles International Airport.<br/><br/>Again the action starts out slow, but picks up as soon as John McClane gets involved in the action. He runs all over the airport in his quest to save his wife. John is thwarted several times along the way. One poignant scene is of McClane trying to avert a plane crash of a British Airways flight. He makes makeshift torches and runs out on the tarmac to signal to the plane that they are in danger. McClane is unsuccessful as the British Airways flight crashes into the runway killing all aboard. This shows the futility of the situation McClane finds himself in, but he doesn't give up. Quit just isn't in McClane's make-up.<br/><br/>There are three parts of the movie I like the best. The first is when Richard Thornburg (played by William Atherton) is in the lavatory on the same plane as Holly McClane (played by Bonnie Bedelia). Thornburg is in the lavatory on the phone giving an account of the terrorist situation to the news station he works for; Holly uses the tazer of the lady next to her and breaks into the lavatory where she zaps Thornburg.<br/><br/>The next favorite scene is when McClane is trying to save the British Airways flight.<br/><br/>My third favorite scene is when McClane figures out a specific piece of information and brings it to the attention of Captain Carmine Lorenzo (played by Dennis Franz), of the Dulles Airport Police Department. Lorenzo, in his inexhaustible fashion, doesn't believe McClane. McClane takes his evidence, a machine gun, and proceeds to empty the clip at Lorenzo. The bullets in the machine gun are blanks.<br/><br/>Even though this is not one of my favorite Die Hard movies I still rate it an 8 out of 10 stars."

This sees yet another crisis for John McClane, this time at Dulles International Airport.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons it works is having a normal guy like John McClane thrust into absurd situations, and McClane often comments on not only the scrapes he's getting into, but his disbelief that he's faced with yet another terrorist scenario after the events of the first film.<br/><br/>The constant referencing does get annoying after awhile though - it wasn't really necessary to remind us of it throughout the film, all the way to the end."

This movie kicks off well, it draws you in as you are eager to see what will be the outcome of all this bad guys taking position and then next we are drawn into a lone hero taking on a terrorist gang in a way that Jack Bauer (pardon me all you 24 (TV series) fans) would wish he had the guts to even try.<br/><br/>In this second film in the franchise the action starts early brief introduction is done, and McClane starts to kill bad guys bringing one down in the first 15 minutes of the film. The movie did have its fault though, like the time when one of the bad guys stopped getting away to look back, so he could get killed and McClane could get a ride.<br/><br/>Die hard 2 like its predecessor is adapted from a book named 58 Minutes that was released in 1987 and written by Walter Wager and the characters are from the Roderick Thorp bestselling novel Nothing Lasts Forever in 1979. This second movie had recurring cast from the first movie like McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), Dick Thomburg (William Altherton) and Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) who appeared briefly.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off like the last on Christmas Eve, when terrorist took over the airport to break out their fellow terrorist off a plane with no hitches. Unfortunately for the terrorist McClane happened to be at the same airport and his wife was in the air with the planes running out of fuel; McClane has to take out the terrorist and find a way to land the planes.<br/><br/>This movie has McClane our lone hero find himself in the same mess like the first, with almost similar environment; so like he went all carefree in the first and ending up all shut up and beat up in the end, so did he in this one.<br/><br/>The movie's production cost was 3 times more than the first Die Hard in 1988, and made almost twice more, making this 1990 movie a commercial success and it was also well received by critics but not as much as the first which was a critical acclaim. After you have seen the excitement that the first Die Hard brings there is practically no reason why you should not dig this up too.<br/><br/>After this movie 20th Century Fox waited 5 years before we saw McClane again going all ""Yippee kai yay, motherfu@#er"" on the bad guys.

McClane quips as he's back in the thick of things with a terrorist madman taking over the airport to rescue an international drug kingpin who's being escorted home.<br/><br/>The action is bigger, louder and the kills meaner which will satisfy any action fan while Bruce Willis is on top of his game in this Renny Harlin directed sequel that delivers more of the same which isn't necessarily a bad thing but the original Die Hard is a classic which takes something special and probably more original to top. The supporting cast of the first is back (in part) and play their parts to a tee while William Sadler's villain isn't as charismatic as Hans Gruber, rather he's the opposite, a brutal mercenary who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal and we get this point loud and very clear in a disturbing crash scene which works very well in making us root for the good guy.<br/><br/>Die Harder ups the ante, in kills, fore and action but McClane loses a step here and becomes a bit of a parody of himself but it's all in good fun, because really 'how could the same sh#t happen to the same guy twice?'. It's so ridiculous it's great, just sit back and enjoy because more of the same this time around is fine by me.

"Joxerlives","9","0","1","20 February 2013"," An arguably superior sequel
","Die Hard/Predator really set the bar for action movies in the late 80s (oddly I never rated Lethal Weapon despite being its' target audience and being a big fan of The Last Boy Scout). Following it up was always going to be a tough job, you couldn't have him credibly trapped again and skyscrapers had essentially used up all their possibilities but I think they succeeded admirably on all counts. <br/><br/>The Good? Great villain in the shape of William Sandler, quite daring for them to opt for a rightwing military bad guy rather than some foreign menace as we see in 1 and 3. Fred Thompson demonstrates the presence and air of authority which so benefited him in his political career. The annexe skywalk shootout is a classic and bears much re-watching (everyone notice a pre-Terminator 2 Robert Patrick as the mercenary's team leader? And that the SWAT team actually manage to kill one of the ambushers before McClane's arrival). The twist is a killer, I remember hearing Grant and Stewart talk on the radio and thinking ""That sounds like a codeword"" but it was still a massive shock when it happened, people gave a collective gasp in the cinema. But not as loudly as they cheered in the climax when he delivers his lighter line. Ultimately this is the story of the ordinary Joe taking on the high tech/superbly trained/painstakingly prepared bad guys and triumphing through his grit and ingenuity. Bruce Willis is excellent as the everyman, when he asks himself 'Oh John, what are you doing on the wing of this plane?' that's exactly what you were thinking. <br/><br/>The Bad? The great Bonnie Bedelia is somewhat wasted and her final line extremely cheesy. You can't really get a Glock through airport scanners, it may have a polymer frame but its' insides are filled with metal. In real life the airport only had to contact the military and use their radar network to guide the planes down. You can't fire blanks from an assault rifle/submachine-gun by just swapping the magazines, you have to put an adapter device on the end of the muzzle because blanks don't produce enough recoil by themselves to cycle the bolt. How are the bad guys planning to escape, they've no hostages by the time they get onto the 747 so what's to stop the air force blowing them out of the air? Once they've kicked the bad guys out of the church why can't they just repair the cuts they've made to the cables and use control towers' equipment to land the planes?<br/><br/>That said it's a great film and whilst Die Hard 3 isn't bad they really should have stopped at 2."

","The last time we saw Detective John McClane in ""Die Hard,"" he was a member of the New York Police Department. He flew across country to Los Angeles to patch up his marriage to his wife Holly. After single-handedly thwarting a gang of German gunmen, McClane went to work for the Los Angeles Police Department. In ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" our indestructible protagonist finds himself in Washington, D.C., at Dulles International Airport, on Christmas Day. McClane encounters another group of ruthless villains who want to rescue a South America drug dealer when his plane sets down. Literally, these villains hold an airport hostage and make it impossible for any plane to land. ""Cliffhanger"" director Renny Harlan delivers some agile violence, and ""Die Hard"" scribe Steven E. de Souza and ""Bad Boys"" writer Doug Richardson imitate the original. Actually, they do a pretty good job, including giving several characters a chance to encore. Holly plays a bigger role this time around, while the obnoxious reporter that William Atherton plays gets a couple of scenes. If you look closely, you'll spot Robert Patrick of ""Terminator 2,"" Colin Meany of ""Star Trek The Next Generation,"" and John Leguizamo of ""The Rock.""<br/><br/>McClane is the last man that renegade soldier Colonel Stuart (William Sadler of ""The Shawshank Redemption"") counted on when he embarked on his next mission. Stuart's dastardly henchmen have hacked into the airport computers and lowered the land strip so when a plane lands, it crashes. Colonel Stuart makes a good villain, and McClane doesn't have an easy job dealing with one disaster after another. In a sense, Stuart is a more dangerous villain than Hans Gruber was because he orders the death of hundreds aboard a Winsdor Airlines jet. John Amos is good as the secondary villain. Initially, I thought ""Die Hard 2"" was the worst film of this franchise until I saw ""A Good Day to Die Hard."" Altogether, this ""Die Hard"" qualifies as above-average."

","Die Hard 2 (1990) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>John McClane (Bruce Willis) is at a Washington D.C. airport to pick up his wife when a terrorist (William Sadler) and his men take control so that they can free Gen. Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), a powerful dictator. DIE HARD 2 pretty much delivers all the fun, action and humor from the first film but this here takes it a step further and really delivers the goods. It's always hard making a good sequel to a good movie but this one here succeeds in large part because we've got a pretty strong story, a great action director and of course the terrific cast who helps keep it moving. What really stands out about this second film is just the fact that every action scene is really magnified and this starts from the very first one and it doesn't let up until the very end. Like the first film this one here has one action scene after another and they all manage to work. Some of the more memorable ones including the tense ending but there's also a great sequence where a group of soldiers are pretty much caught in a crossfire during a set-up. Willis is certainly in good form here as he handles the action scenes without a problem and best of all is that dry humor that is used perfectly here. He not only gets some good one-liners but you can't help but enjoy this character and the life Willis brings to it. The supporting cast here is terrific with Sadler making for an excellent villain and it's always fun to see Nero even though he's not in too much of the film. Bonnie Bedella, William Atherton and Reginald VelJohnson make appearances and are fine. We also get some great work from John Amos, Dennis Franz and Fred Dalton Thompson. Another terrific supporting character is the snow. Yes, there's so much snow here that you can't help but enjoy the added winter touch and it certainly adds some extra tension to all the stuff going on. The stuff dealing with the planes running out of fuel is certainly very intense at times and director Renny Harlin really manages to keep things moving at a nice pace. DIE HARD 2 is about as good a sequel as one can hope for and is a worthy follow-up."

","I had never noticed that Die Hard 2 got quite a bit of hate. I mean most people seem to like it, but ask most people and they will say that it's the weakest of the four. And I'd be lying if I said I didn't see why. In comparing the four this one probably is the most flawed, but in my opinion, it's also one of the most fun.<br/><br/>This has one of the most contrived plots you will ever see in a movie. The terrorists threaten to keep the planes in the air until they run out of fuel, OK, good plan, but why don't the planes just go to another airport. I mean we heard a couple had closed down due to weather, but there are more than two other airports in DC. So why don't they tell them as soon as they are able to halfway through the movie. There are other plot holes in this movie, but it's an action movie. The villain's a little weird, he's literally introduced doing yoga completely naked, and throughout the first half he seems to be trying way to hard to be evil. And in the end he isn't as memorable as other villains in the series.<br/><br/>But this movie is just a lot of fun to watch, I mean the first films better overall, but I'd say the last 45 minutes of this film are more fun than most of the action in the first. Bruce Willis is of course just as awesome as he was in the first film. I loved the supporting characters, it seems that most of them were able to get at least one laugh. There's plenty of cool explosions, and fantastic effects. Plus the plot, if you can get past all the holes, is pretty interesting, with a few fun twists.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder (a title so bad it has to be good) is probably the most flawed of all four movies so far, but it's just too much fun to care."
"Hey_Sweden","8","0","1","8 December 2012"," A non-stop thrill ride.
","""Die Hard 2"" is a good example of the ""bigger is better"" philosophy when it comes to making Hollywood sequels. Superhero cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) once again proves to be a pain in the ass to terrorists everywhere, kicking ass all over the place in his usual gruff, tough style. He's way ahead of every other character here, realizing something is about to go down while waiting for his wifes' plane to land at Washington, D.C.s' Dulles Airport. He doesn't get too much for his trouble other than a lot of grief (most of it from an airport security chief (Dennis Franz) who's a carbon copy of the incompetent moron played by Paul Gleason in the first film). The villain is a powerful dictator / drug dealer played by international icon Franco Nero, who's helped by traitorous American lowlifes led by William Sadlers' crazed Colonel Stuart.<br/><br/>Director Renny Harlin had already proved his worth directing such horror movies as the effective ""Prison"" and the financially successful fourth ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movie and shows here how well he can handle large scale action. There's plenty of thrills, plenty of violence, and plenty of tension. The only real issue with the movie is credibility; however, while it requires much suspension of disbelief, it does pay the viewer back by delivering testosterone-laden entertainment and never really letting up. The special effects and stunts are spectacular, and the interplay between Willis and his supporting cast is fun stuff.<br/><br/>Some veterans of the first ""Die Hard"" return, namely Bonnie Bedelia as McClanes' wife Holly, William Atherton as self serving arrogant s.o.b. reporter Dick Thornberg and Reginald VelJohnson (who has little more than a cameo) as McClanes' friend and fellow cop Al Powell. New faces include John Amos, Art Evans, Fred Dalton Thompson, Tom Bower, Sheila McCarthy, and Don Harvey. Sadler has got to be the most fun; he's a cold blooded monster and also a bad ass who can definitely handle McClane in a fight. The lineup of familiar actors in small roles is amazing; among them: Robert Patrick, John Leguizamo, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mark Boone Junior, Tom Everett, Colm Meaney, and Robert Costanzo.<br/><br/>As before, Michael Kamens' music is quite rousing, and the reprise of the Vaughan Monroe rendition of ""Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!"" provides another pleasant reminder of ""Die Hard"" 1. The script by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson (based on the novel ""58 Minutes"" by Walter Wager) contains a fair bit of humour and that deliciously profane dialogue that we all love so much.<br/><br/>Overall, this is agreeable escapism, and a fine follow up to one of the modern action classics.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"votesmall","7","0","1","8 December 2012"," Bigger doesn't always mean better.
","The explosions and body count in Die Hard 2 are both bigger, but that doesn't mean a better film, especially when it doesn't have enough action in-between scenes to balance it out! I was surprised when there wasn't as much action in Die Hard 2 as Die Hard. Die Hard's tongue in cheek attitude with mindblowing and intelligent action sequences is the prime formula for an action film done right. So, then I decided that I had to see Die Harder: Die Hard 2, which sounded great. So, I rented it and I was a little disappointed. For one, it was completely different that I thought it would be. When I heard that terrorists took over an airport, I expected that terrorists would TAKE OVER the AIRPORT, rather than the control tower and shut off the landing lights, leaving the people inside the terminals (and in the planes, too for some reason) completely oblivious to what's happening. This kind of disappointed me, because there were a lot of good action sequence opportunities lost. Also, even though the first film was tongue in cheek, this one was REALLY tongue in cheek. I mean, they really turned up the heat on satire here! <br/><br/>Now onto the real criticisms. Die Hard 2 is actually about McClane in Washington D.C for some reason, who's waiting at Dulles airport on *Christmas eve* for his wife, Holly. But he discovers some punks armed with the woefully fictional Glock 7 pistols who seem to be heavily funded. He tells airport security, but they tell him, who is, might I add, a hero for fighting terrorists, to shove it and wouldn't you know it, terrorists take over the control tower and demand the release of a drug kingpin (that was for some reason flying into Dulles on Christmas eve) or else they will cause all the planes to crash. Now it's up to John to stop the baddies before the planes run out of fuel and crash. There are very few fight scenes in this movie, because most of the suspense comes from a 'race against the clock' feel to the story rather than a life or death situation with guns. Not that this is a bad thing, but it doesn't seem like McClane is the hero until the last 20 minutes. Otherwise he is just running around the runways. In fact, most of this film doesn't even take place in the actual airport! <br/><br/>Let's get to the villain. In the first Die Hard, Alan Rickman played a rather suave yet somehow also sociopathic villain Hans Gruber, a German terrorist after money and willing to kill for it. His performance blew me away and he remains one of the greatest villains of all time. The villain in this movie is Colonel Stuart, a man who is supposedly a martial arts expert for some reason, but this is never actually used except for when he is practicing *naked* in a hotel room. Colonel Stuart is a good idea for a villain, but he does not stand out like Rickman's groundbreaking performance. This one is barely even in the movie, and the only really disturbing scene he has is when he pulls a gun on one of his accomplices. I like his character, how he believes in what he is doing and all, but he didn't receive near enough development to be a good villain. Simon from Die Hard with a Vengeance was superior until the film's woozy third act. <br/><br/>Even so, there are some pretty serious glaring plot holes that kind of muddle the film's pace. Just to name a few, why wouldn't the planes fly to a different airport, like Reagan? They never explained that! And why could a band of heavily armed mercenaries that could dispatch a SWAT team not kill a guy rolling around with a pistol? It's not that this film isn't believable, it just has problems with logic, which sucks because Die Hard had inevitable problems that were explained in a clear manner. <br/><br/>Directed by Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea), Die Hard 2 delivers the goods, but it doesn't live up to it's predecessor in terms of action scenes, script or character development. It does have fantastic pace, but it isn't even a very similar movie to Die Hard, but I suppose that's why these movies are so great, they are all original in some way. But this film is just too long and too empty to be a worthy sequel to Die Hard. (How could it?) I never checked my watch ONCE in Die Hard, but here, especially during the last half, I checked it a couple times. But at least it tried to be something a little different and more intelligent, which I can appreciate. <br/><br/>Here's how these movies are: Die Hard: Best action film ever made. Die Hard 2: Good follow-up and better than 3, but not better than 4 in terms of quality. <br/><br/>(ALSO: the Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) cameo made my day! Loved it, but wish he could have had a bigger role!) <br/><br/>A solid 7/10."

","Hot on the burning heels of its blockbuster predecessor, ""Die Hard 2"" is a remake of the original, plotting the action in an airborne 747 on which both wife (Bedelia) and nemesis (Atherton) are aboard. A terrorist transfer orchestrated by covert operatives on the ground ensures Willis has his hands full keeping the bad guys at bay, while both Dennis Franz and Reginald Vel Johnson (via phone) chip in as the reinforcements, with Franz essentially playing the Vel Johnson character from the original.<br/><br/>Willis galvanises his heroic persona with this second outing, firmly entrenching the 'tough guy' image that would guarantee him box office success for ever more, while Franco Nero has a minor role (not the head villain like Alan Rickman in the first) as a terrorist prisoner being swapped to ostensibly avoid the destruction of the hijacked plane. There are other villains in the midst, but their identities are somewhat disguised, so I won't reveal them here, suffice to say that William Sadler toils for his tyranny, and could well be Robert Patrick's twin (who perchance also has a small role pre T2). I also recognised Stafford Morgan, Robert Sacchi (""The Man with Bogart's Face""), Colm Meaney and Bill Smillie in small supporting roles.<br/><br/>While not as witty or suspenseful as the original, there's still enough residual from the original to be worth a look; the stunts are more explosive (and equally unbelievable), and the comic-book villains get what's coming which is all that really matters. Each of the actors is either a direct or close descendant of the first picture, no surprises or formula twists, merely a straightforward cash-in you should find just passable."

The character of John Mclane has become a classic action figure which has been copied numerous times since."

","'Die Hard 2' was always going to be a disappointment because the original was so good. Having said that, the second installment in the hugely successful franchise is a solid and very entertaining splatter film which contains some outrageously unpleasant moments such as John McClane (Bruce Willis) shoving an icicle through a villain's eyeball and biting off another bad guy's thumb and spitting it out.<br/><br/>It is Christmas Eve again and we find McClane at Dulles International Airport in Washington. He is there to meet his wife, Holly, who is flying in from Los Angeles. A group of mercenaries led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler) disable the airport's communications and threaten to cause plane crashes should their demands not be granted. And Holly's plane is one of those in danger. The mercenaries are awaiting the arrival of South American drug lord General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), who is being flown in to Dulles in chains. Upon the plane's arrival, they are planning to storm the aircraft, kill anyone who gets in their way, and free Esperanza.<br/><br/>'Die Hard 2' is a thoroughly entertaining action extravaganza. If you can stomach the graphic, brutal violence and the constant profanity, then you are in for a great roller-coaster ride. This is classic spectacle cinema, a crowd pleaser writ large for the popcorn-munching masses. There are plenty of thrilling action set pieces to enjoy: a fight amidst a maze of conveyor belts holding moving luggage, McClane ejecting from a cargo plane cockpit right before said cockpit is blown to smithereens (a conceit which would find its way into the Bond film 'Goldeneye' five years later), and some hand-to-hand combat upon the wing of a moving 747 in the midst of a ferocious snowstorm. There are pyrotechnics galore and some truly spectacular explosions.<br/><br/>Excellent support is offered in the form of Dennis Franz as Captain Carmine Lorenzo, who is head of airport security and who spends his whole time on screen trying to sabotage McClane. Bonnie Bedelia reprises her role of Holly, and William Atherton pops up again as the arrogant and self-important news reporter Richard Thornburg. The film gains enormously from its snowbound setting, and Finnish director Renny Harlin would go on to direct two more similarly successful action films set against snowy backdrops: 'Cliffhanger' and 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'. Both are worth checking out. In 'Die Hard 2' Harlin has crafted a tense and exciting two hours. If you are looking for violent action, you will definitely not be disappointed."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","3","27 August 2010"," For the lead, it's the same #!*$ happening to the same guy twice; but for the audience, Harlin provides a different, more escapist approach to proceedings.
","As an action film with a substantial amount of plot and peril running along side the necessity to develop and unfold the tales of a number of different parties and characters, whom share differing attitudes to the overall situation, Die Hard 2 is probably a lot better then it really has any right to be. Renny Harlin's film covers American mercenaries turned terrorists with an agenda; the strains airport staff suffer as a result of this; passengers in the planes above essentially rendered hostages; later, the clinical and urgent actions of a special operations team specifically called in as well as the eponymous hero of the entire franchise: police lieutenant John McLane and where he fits in to all of it. The director does an admirable job in balancing each of the perspectives, borrowing from the first Die Hard film of two years previous, but with a knowing sense, whilst trying to go bigger and consequently better with more threat; more action and more spectacle. It doesn't quite cross that divide in the manner some sequels do but needless to say, the film suffices.<br/><br/>The film is a part of a brief pre 9/11 canon of terrorists or whatever seizing a mode of public transport or otherwise and wrecking havoc; a canon you might cite began with the first Die Hard. With films such as Executive Decision; Speed; Under Siege 2; Air Force One and Con Air following on in later years, two or three of which maintained an aeronautical theme, Die Hard 2 stands somewhat high and mightily over its aforementioned cousins. This 1990 film sticks to the first film's guns in following Willis' John McLane caught way out of his depth; here, a similar premise having him arrive at a large, busy locale with the aim to meet up with his wife for the Christmas period. Like the L.A. based high-rise of the first, in which the New York cop was a blurry eyed fish out of water in this more intimate and free flowing California, Dulles airport is a hostile Washington based zone of paranoia, security driven authority and routine.<br/><br/>The film will begin with McLane's car being towed from a no-park zone, plunging him into a realm of failure or pertaining to struggle in his surroundings. The location of the airport interior is busy, chaotic even, with a mass of bodies cramped into close proximity with one another for the festive period and McLane has to work hard just to find a phone, get from one interior place to another and deal with a shooting that carries its own little tasks. McLane's role of being that rose amongst the thorns is verbally reiterated to us by a certain Carmine Lorenzo (Franz), a chief of airport police whom tells McLane that he is ""in my little pond now"" and that he himself is ""the big fish that runs it"".<br/><br/>The antagonist of the piece is a certain Colonel Stuart (Sadler), a former U.S. Army Special Forces trooper whose introduction is inter-cut with McLane's and sees him practise martial art moves in low lighting with nothing on but the television, something he promptly turns off by fast-drawing a remote control. The sequence demonstrates control, precision and a balanced sense of both aggression and technique; echoing his attitudes to the task at hand he'll later face and how he'll deal in going about completing it. A point is additionally made so as to highlight McLane's inability to apparently operate in the ""digital"" world, with some casual jibes at this lack; the film thus planting its final seed reflecting the magnitude of what McLane's up against by making so as to show Stuart's troops set up a load of extravagant looking machines and computers highlighting the ease in their ability to do what comes so difficultly to McLane. The rouge Special Forces troopers apprehend the entire airport's electronics and use them so as to make the interception of a South American drug baron who's being brought into the airport, in custody, so as to face charges. He is Ramon Esperanza (Nero) and is faced with the curious situation have having just the solitary in-flight guard watching over him.<br/><br/>Despite drawing on inspiration from the first Die Hard, the sequel cannot quite top it. Gone is the estrangement McLane had from his wife, here meaning small intricacies such as the use of the gold watch she received as a gift from a male co-worker acting as the representation of the emotional distance between them; later cast away during said film's finale. Kept is the idea of McLane being caught in the middle of a feud between the police or figures of authority and the wrong-doers and kept is the sense of danger. His wife, Holly (Bedelia), is given little to do this time other than remain in the sky and play the role of a person no different to anyone else whom needs rescuing as her strong, empowering role from the first film is substituted for a subplot with journalist from the first film Richard Thornburg (Atherton), who coincidentally is on her plane. Holly's clashing with Thornburg runs on what he did in turning up to the McLane residence with a camera crew in the first film, and her victory over him here does not carry the substantial weight her role did in the first film; in that the attack is rendered personal and stops Thornberg from essentially doing what his job is. General suspense and whatever pot boiling there is in the film is replaced towards the end with wall to wall action, mostly chases involving snowmobiles; helicopters and jets but it is effective and harmless enough via Harlin's decent enough action directing. The film is an intriguing battle of wits and oneupmanship running on a race against time premise as the planes above have their fuel levels fall. It goes bigger than the first but doesn't quite go better."
"jzappa","7","0","2","24 May 2010"," Bruce WillisOur Last Line of Defense
","Die Hard 2, subtitled Die Harder, barges Bruce Willis into an obstacle course of rapid brutality, and he finishes in front in each one, such as in mortal tussles for guns, leaps onto conveyor belts, a discharge from a cockpit, leaping onto the wings of planes about to take off and fighting with cops and bureaucrats. All in one day! Why is Willis so persuasive in a movie like this? Perhaps he associates a roughly strapping build with the bearing and behavior of Everyman. The title of the movie characterizes the essential story material: Here is a man who will not bail out, who will not concede failure, who determinedly persists through the threat of catastrophe. The trials and hazards he encounters would dishearten a Jason Bourne or a 007, but for this guileless cop with the receding hairline, there is no option. When all is said and done: ""My wife is on that plane!"" McClane seems to have the worst holiday luck I've ever heard of as he's in Washington's Dulles airport expecting his wife's flight to land on a congested Christmas Eve. And scheduled into the same airport simultaneously is a military jet bringing a South American drug overlord to justice. An expert crew of terrorists, led by a former CIA operative, plots to take command of airport operations by mechanically circumventing the control tower. They'll interfere with the airport lights, leave dozens of planes circling overhead and then bring about fatalities, as a heads-up. What they want is a standby plane prepared to shanghai the fascist away.<br/><br/>Willis, who has a cop's seasoned eye, pegs one of the accomplices, follows him into a luggage-handling area and finds that a plot is brewing. Regardless, he can't get anywhere with the chief of airport security Dennis Franz, who begrudges an outside cop in his jurisdiction. After a death and countless other indications including a plane crash, the security chief ultimately concedes he may have a dilemma to deal with. But even then Willis' work is not finished, and by the end of the movie he is still virtually unassisted contending with entire planeloads of militants in mortal combat.<br/><br/>This is the archetypal big-budget blockbuster Hollywood action movie with rapid cutting and a fast-moving, bombastic narrative. Since it is so capably hammered out and well-directed, it cultivates a propulsion that hoists it past various and sundry plausibility fractures, indeed canyons, that should have toppled it. Exhibit A, at some point at roughly the middle of the movie we find out that ""there are 18 planes up there but only 5 of them have those phones."" OK! Great! Now the pilots can inform each other that the airport is in the midst of a siege and they shouldn't listen to the phony tower. Yet, because the script insists that they remain in peril till McClane saves the day, they all heed the same approach tower frequency. What's more, how about the scene where the tower apprises the circling airplanes that they'll be out of radio contact for a couple of hours, and the jets should simply continue circling? Why can't those planes just get on the horn with other ground broadcasters, and be redirected to other airports? Weeeellthen Willis' wife wouldn't be up there in the sky and in grave trouble, that's why.<br/><br/>But a more fundamental issue concerns the entire liberation undertaking itself. Who would ever have the funds, the apparatus and the conviction to stage such an enormous and problematic terrorist operation just to bail one drug-connected dictator? However, be that all as it may, I don't care. Die Hard 2 is as absurd as the Bond pictures, and as much fun. And during a Hollywood period (the '80s and '90s) when violence and mayhem are sanctioned to usurp creativity and substantial drama, this is a particularly skillful picture. It tells a story we can relate to, it has many colorful peripheral characters and it handles the action sequences---not to mention location shooting in extreme conditions---with seemingly effortless purity.<br/><br/>There is a plane incident to which degree we weren't sure things would go as far, and it's quite shocking. Another fun moment features a mercenary's opportunity to get an up-close look at an icycle. Another shot places the camera's eye hundreds of feet waaay up in the air and then flings Willis up until his nose just about butterfly-kisses the lens before he begins to fall to Earth again. The director of this snug $70 million comfort food is a Finn named Renny Harlin, whose other credits include the unrealistic but exciting Cliffhanger, the tiringly escapist but hilariously gruesome The Long Kiss Goodnight and the excitingly ridiculous Deep Blue Sea. Like Dutchmen Paul Verhoeven and Jan de Bont, Harlin took Hollywood commercial movie-making, churned it and endowed it with fresh momentum."

Even though the story might be fiction about the belief of witch craft, but from the earlier of years, such witch craft was a little possible, and still is in some cases of today.<br/><br/>When I was too about that age group, I believed in such stories about witch craft, reason being I had heard them amongst other people. But not only about the fact of beliefs, but the story in it's location helped made all the sense.<br/><br/>Only thing is, that the characters played their part so well focusing not only on family behaviour, but the love and understanding of different people that would have been treated differently. I have enjoyed it so much, at that time, as it made me feel a little of my own family. That I would have loved to be part of it. It would be nice to see another film similar to it."

","Die Hard 2 is a action/thriller that is wonderfully casted with a few minor flaws. Bruce Willis, once again, is stuck outside of his home town, New York, where people don't want him there.

","Well here we go again...<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is pretty much the first movie but set in an Airport. If you love the crawling through air ducts the gun fights and the funny quips of our favorite hero then here we go. John McClane is a very unlucky man during the holidays as when he is just about to meet his wife at the airport terrorists attack and yet again he is pitted against an evil genius in a no holds barred action fun film.<br/><br/>So with all things considered it is a fun movie and really and truly if you liked the first movie then you will like the second. If the movie wasn't practically the same thing as the first movie I'd give it a higher rating. You ever wonder why the guy never runs out of clips? The Action is a bit heavier than the first movie and things are slightly more intense so it can be said that this movie is pretty good but it does sacrifice a bit of the acting.<br/><br/>In the end another action fun film for the holidays but if you are planning on flying anywhere this film isn't recommended."

","As far as sequels go, Die Hard 2 is worthy to be called ""almost as good as the first"". The story is slightly less engaging than the original, but John McClain is just as exciting and heroic on this venture. The acting is grade-A all around, and the violence isn't as extreme -- though a bad guy does get an icicle to the eye. Just like the original, this has all the fun, drama, and comic relief.<br/><br/>All in all, while this is a short review for such a grand film, I simply cannot express in words is impact, because it has been years since I viewed it.

","I found ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" to be quite an enjoyable film, and would rank it third best in the saga (my rank is 1, 4, 2, 3). It has great characters, memorable scenes, and a great concept for one of these films, in which John McClane must stop terrorists who have turned out the airport lights so planes cannot land until the bad guys get what they want. The film could easily have made second best in the series, but it lacks the good character development found in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and, of course, the original. Nevertheless, this proved to be an exciting movie, as most action films surrounding airplanes are (such as ""Air Force One"" or ""Executive Decision""). This, however, is better than those films, mostly because we have John McClane, a character who is like a real person on the screen and keeps us engaged in his personality. The plot may be a bit unbelievable at times, since it would be more practical for the planes to land at another nearby airport. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it. I also liked how this film brought back some of the great supporting cast from part one, including Reginald VelJohnson and William Atherton. Not a perfect film like its predecessor, but entirely enjoyable and fun. Worthy of the ""Die Hard"" series.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

","In the sequel to Die Hard, John McClane is in trouble again when a group of criminals take control of an airport to bring an evil General safely and discreetly into the country.<br/><br/>After the success of the first, a sequel was inevitable and the action, the claustrophobia and most importantly, John McClane were all still there.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis (The Sixth Sense) has made John McClane into the ultimate male action hero, with a slick and sarcastic attitude towards life, and most importantly bad guys, and improvising a lot of his own work has made McClane an icon in the genre.<br/><br/>The support cast are also on top form, and provide plenty of tension to justify the scenarios, not to mention the extra humour they bring to the plot.<br/><br/>Though no sequel will ever top the first Die Hard, which will be one of the best action thrillers ever made, Die Hard 2 has a sensible and action orientated plot to keep it's feet on the ground and not go overboard, and is the ultimate sequel any fan could have wanted.<br/><br/>The plot is fast and intelligent, justifying the genre exceptionally well. Perhaps there was one too many action sequences, which does down step the realism, but nonetheless they are all pin point accurate on the entertainment factor.<br/><br/>As with the first, the plot is driven by an ultimate deadly scenario, and using claustrophobia do we get a sense of the situation. The first was set around Nakatomi Towers, and this sequel is focused around an airport. Keeping within limits adds to the intense and dramatic scenario.<br/><br/>The direction is well established to gain the ultimate action feel, and as McClane utters the ultimate catchphrase, do we see the best part of the entire film.<br/><br/>The ending to Die Hard 2 is far less cheesy than the ending to its predecessor which was a relief, and you will be left smiling having seen one of the best action sequels ever made."

Now what I like about this film is the action and suspense like when John tries to get the airplane to stop but it crashes. Also what was cool is that John uses his lighter to blow up the plane while saying, "" Yippie Ki Yay motherf**ker. "" ( Boom )Now that was awesome.

","I know that many rave about the first Die Hard movie, but for me this second one was much better, with a better story. I just found myself wishing it had been a bit shorter, it made me tired just seeing everything McClane had to endure.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis is L.A. cop John McClane, in Washington, D.C. waiting for his wife's plane. But he notices something fishy about a couple of men, follows them to a secure baggage handling area, and ends up in a big gunfight. This leads him to believe there is something more sinister in the plans, but has trouble getting the local police to believe him. Bonnie Bedelia is back as his wife, Holly McClane.<br/><br/>The main bad guy is William Sadler as Col. Stuart, and the whole plot is to gain control of a drug lord, Franco Nero as Gen. Ramon Esperanza, being flown in under arrest. Their plan involved putting incoming commercial jets in jeopardy, as a way to get Esperanza rescued and flown to Central America in a waiting 747.<br/><br/>Dennis Franz, who later became a fixture on NYPD Blue is good as Capt. Carmine Lorenzo, the local cop who tries to get McClane thrown out. A bit ironically, Fred Dalton Thompson who today is a Republican candidate for the upcoming presidential nomination was Trudeau, in charge of air control at the airport.<br/><br/>Overall a good, complex story with lots of action. And, of course, McClane always comes out on top.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. At the end the bad guys have the drug lord and the 747, but McClane gets a local news helicopter to drop him onto the plane's wing as it taxis for takeoff. A door opens and he fights one bad guy, who ends up getting sucked into the jet's engine. The second bad guy manages to knock McClane off the wing, but not before McClane had opened the fuel dump valve to spew jet fuel. As the plane accelerates away, McClane smiles and throws a cigarette lighter onto the trail of fuel, which catches up to the plane's wing just as it rotates for takeoff. The plane goes up in a big ball of fire, all on board are roasted. McClane wins again!! Good stuff."

","Die Hard 2 starts on Christmas Eve & is set at Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C. where Los Angeles cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) is waiting for the plane his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is on to land so they can spend Christmas together with her parents. However all is not well as Colonel Stuart (William Adler) & a highly trained team of mercenaries have taken complete control of the airport & all of it's functions, they turn the runway lights off so the planes above can't land & also disable the communication between the control tower & the plane's. A plane carrying a drug warlord named General Esperanza (Franco Nero) is due to land so he can stand trial, Colonel Stuart wants to free him but as several plane's above start to run out of fuel can McClane save the day & figure out a way to land them safely?<br/><br/>Directed by Renny Harlin this is a fine action packed sequel to the original Die Hard (1988) although one has to say it's clearly not as good although with such a brilliant film to better it was never likely to. The script by Steven E. de Souza & Doug Richardson was based on the novel '58 Minutes' by Walter Wager & again sees LA cop John McClane fighting bad guy's at Christmas, for what it is Die Hard 2 is a great big budget Hollywood action packed blockbuster that's well worth a watch if your a 90's action fan. The character's are good although I still don't like McClane's wife Holly or that stupid reporter Richard Thornburg, particularly memorable are Dennis Franz's foul mouthed highly strung airport security chief Carmine & the no nonsense Major Grant. I also really liked the twist towards the end of the film as well & I must admit I didn't see it coming, other than that the plot is pretty straight forward, maybe a bit predictable yet easy to follow. The film is slow going at times & feels quite long but I'd never say it was boring with the constant race against time scenario McClane finds himself in, there's enough shoot-outs, violence, fights, chases & explosions to satisfy most & overall it's a great film. The chances of McClane finding himself in another situation like the original Die Hard does stretch the credibility somewhat but what the hell, it's only a film right?<br/><br/>Director Harlin does alright, the action scenes are good but maybe not as good or as exciting as the original or some other big budget action films of the period. I doubt a film like Dir Hard 2 would be made today, almost certainly not by a major Hollywood studio with plane's full of passengers being deliberately crashed, terrorists hijacking an entire airport & holding all the plane's with passengers on them to ransom. Apparently barely completed before it was released Die Hard 2 had a huge budget which it went over by a considerable amount, rumour has it at one point Die Hard 2 was costing 20th Century Fox an extra $20,000 every minute of every day it was being shot. There are some good set-pieces here, the scene when McClane escapes the plane that gets blown up by hand-grenades is maybe the most memorable. There's plenty of violence too with icicles stuck in people's eyes, there's plenty of bloody gunshot wounds along with a nasty & very gory slashed throat.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this had a mega budget, it's well made for sure with great production values & you would never guess that the snow is fake. A couple of airports were used for filming locations including Los Angeles International & Stapleton Airport in Denver in Colorado, was originally set to be filmed in Minnesota but there was no snow that year so it was changed. Despite being paid a nice $7,500,000 Bruce Willis has said in a few interviews that he doesn't think too much of Die Hard 2 which is odd because he's been in lots worse films that's for sure, the acting is alright but that bloody Bonnie Bedelia just irritates me for some reason whenever she's on screen.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is a great sequel to a even greater original that can stand on it's own as a top action packed thriller, at least it isn't a total turkey like a lot of sequels turn out to be. I definitely liked it & would certainly recommend it. Followed by Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) & the more recent Live Free or Die Hard (2007) both of which are well worth watching as well."

"powerfull_jedi","7","0","2","10 September 2007"," Not as good as the original Die Hard
","I finally got the chance to watch the second Die Hard movie and while I enjoyed it, it is indeed pretty good, however, not as good as the original. The premise of Die Hard 2 sounds somewhat similar with John McClane butting heads with evil gun-totting terrorists. The plot in this one, however, is somewhat more complicated then the original. The start of the movie is one big surprise, as the hero of the original movie kicks by getting his car towed away in a rather silly manner while waiting for his wife who should arrive by plane at the airport in a few hours, so jut by hanging around in the lobby, he sees two suspicious characters who sneak in into the luggage area, John follows and soon, the first of many gun fights, incredible stunts and near death situations arise and John tries to stop a terrorist plot that's related to an incoming drug baron. And Holly's also in a jam, since the terrorist hijacked the control tower at Dull's Airport and it's lights out, many planes fly around while slowly running out of fuel(it's tense but not as tense as I was expecting). Die Hard 2 is more of the same, really, however it's a more complex plot that does tend to drag a bit, while the original was more tense and active. Bruce Willis once again shines as he's the character that makes the movie worth watching, with his rude and sarcastic remarks, he's an average guy who has trouble dying and he still works here. Holy's character is given very little to do at all, I mean even the reporter she punched at the end of the first movie, gets more screen time then her. Allan, the cop who helped John at the Nakatomi Plaza, lends him a brief hand. The villains are decent, but again not as memorable as the original Nakatomi crooks, the main villains seem somewhat cliché, but one of them is an unexpected surprise(one of the major twists near the end of the movie), but one of the minor thugs who is played by none other then Robert Patrick, this was years before the Terminator 2 movie and the X-Files TV show, with just one line was just amazing, he shines. John Leguizamo is also there, but I don't even remember him involved in anything on this movie, apart from the moment where I spotted him. At end, Die Hard 2 is a little more cartoony but still violent and full of suspense. Frankly Die Hard 2 is also a couple of notches below the new Live Free or Die Hard sequel. But it's worth watching."
"vip_ebriega","10","0","3","10 August 2007"," It's a non-stop seat-gripper that won't quit until it has ignited enough spark for two action films.
","My Take: Just as good, if better, than the original. <br/><br/>I thought the first ""Die Hard"" film was an enjoyable and energetic thrill ride. So with such a success, isn't it time for a sequel. Yes, ""Die Hard 2"" was born, released mere years after the original. This action sequel reunites Bruce Willis with his role, John McLane, from the first film. I think that ""Die Hard 2"", subtitled ""die harder"", is among the films I'd classify as the ""Great Action Movies"", a group of well-made action films that, to me, acts like a roller-coaster ride, making you wish that the theater would apply a seat belt buckle on your seat. Definitely it's on the par with other action films like the ""Indy Jones"" series, ""Lethal Weapon"" films, and the first ""Die Hard"". Actually, I think this is more enjoyable than the first film, but still shares the non-stop thrills and wall-to-wall action of its predecessor. It's a non-stop seat gripper that won't quit until it has ignited enough spark for two action films.<br/><br/>As said, Willis returns as hero McLane, on a Washington airport, waiting for his wife's plane to depart. The plane that his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is on board, is on of the planes that are circling around the airport, desperately delayed from their landing time. But things are about to get stickier when terrorists, led by Col. Stuart (William Sadler), a former government agent turned double-crosser, seize control of the airport's tower, and threaten to crash the beleaguered planes circling above. While already faced with a few problems, including a stubborn airport security (Dennis Franz), a hard-headed government specialist (John Amos), and his wife's plane desperately running out of fuel, McLane starts another all-out war against the mercenaries, and what follows is a thrill-packed adrenaline rush, that wouldn't have been possible, if not gifted with talented direction and superb action sequences.<br/><br/>But the film isn't just good for that, ""Die Hard2"" is one of those very few sequels to great films that actually live up. or maybe better than their predecessor. This one did, and I more than appreciate it for that and so much more. Willis is always a charm as a strong, action hero that can make a charm to his role more than once. Director Renny Harlin keeps the film in a roaring pace that keeps on going and going until the credits roll. It's not at all easy to put up a sequel to a blockbuster film, and it's more of a challenge if your objective is to top the predecessor. But, well, they did. And, boy, did they do it right! <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Die Hard is and will always be the best of the series. A movie so well executed, the sequels and imitators will always be just that.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2 is on the whole, a very well made action fare. Renny Harlin does a decent job tying elements of the first film's style into this one. <br/><br/>Oliver Wood does a great job of keeping the film's imagery in line with Jan de Bont's coverage from part 1. Willis is good, if not as believable. The ejection scene is a nice scene. The gunplay is furious, but not as focused. Fred Thompson adds a good deal of credibility, as he always seems to do, whether its a jack Ryan film, or Law and Order.<br/><br/>I think the weaknesses are many here. De Souza's script is chock full of corny dialog, not to mention an endless fluffy of F-Bombs. John McClaine now seems to be less a regular guy having a bad day, than SUPERCOP! He, nor the other cast of characters have the charm of the first films ensemble. Dennis Franz is the new A-Hole, and frankly annoying as can be. And the vililans? No Hans here folks, but they serve their purpose.<br/><br/>While initially, I felt Die Hard with a Vengeance was an improvement over this, on reflection now years later, though that film has much better acting and writing, it doesn't have the pure entertainment value of this movie.<br/><br/>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a by-the-numbers sequel from the early 1990s, but it is still an above average action film. This is purely a popcorn and hot dog job you can sit around and enjoy with friends by picking apart the crappy one liners, and still having a good time."

","You gotta say one thing for these DIE HARD movies with BRUCE WILLIS--they move. Fast. Hard. And there's usually a plot twist that jumps at you unexpectedly and they're here too. The other element going for them are the clever scripts with plenty of punch lines for Willis to say, and most of them suit his character of John McClane to a T.<br/><br/>DIE HARD 2 makes good use of artificial snow to keep the atmosphere on the frosty side for its holiday tale about a South American drug lord (FRANCO NERO) being expedited to the United States, but being helped in an escape plan by a group of mercenaries led by WILLIAM SADLER. The escape plan includes shutting down the airport and taking over the tower duties so that the plane carrying Nero can land safely before he boards another one for freedom.<br/><br/>What the terrorists don't count on is John McClane being at the airport to meet his wife's plane landing at Dulles. There he gets mixed up in the terrorist plot and finds himself using his brawn and his wits to outsmart them at every turn.<br/><br/>While the story is highly unbelievable, it's also a first class piece of action entertainment on every level. BONNIE BEDELIA does a nice job with some sharp lines as McClane's wife, WILLIAM ATHERTON is chilling as the cold-blooded terrorist leader, DENNIS FRANZ is intentionally obnoxious as a stubborn police captain, and upcoming political candidate for president, FRED THOMPSON, lends his grim presence to the role of Trudeau, the tower supervisor.<br/><br/>Once the action starts, there's seldom a lapse in pace. All of the stunts are pulled off with the kind of timely realism that makes some of the incidents seem more credible than they otherwise would be.<br/><br/>Summing up: A good sequel to the original DIE HARD, it's highly entertaining and most of the credit goes to Willis for doing a first rate job."
"Lord_Crypto","8","0","2","12 July 2007"," Good Die Hard movie but not a great film
","Die Hard 2 is a perfect Die Hard movie. It has the characteristics and makings of a great Die Hard film. Since I am a huge Die Hard fan, I think the Die Hard characteristics of violence, action, and vulgarity are enough to make it a pure entertainment film but it falls short of being a good movie. Although John McTiernan does not direct this film, Renny Harlin does a good job with this sequel.<br/><br/>One problem I have is the acting. I think the film falls short of the other films in a line of supporting actors. Bruce Willis of course returns in his star role of John McClane. His character is just as witty and humorous as ever. The other good performance was Dennis Franz as Captain Lorenzo. His character was extremely funny. A beautiful addition to the film who is just a nuisance and pest to McClane. I am somewhat displeased with the villains. I do not really like William Sadler in this film as Colonel Stuart. He just does not come off to me as being that evil or manipulative like Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons. His character just seems kind of stale and melancholy. I feel the same about the army commander Major Grant who was played by John Amos. There are some good secondary performances but I think some of the major characters were not handled that well.<br/><br/>The story is fairly good. I am kind of torn between the redundant idea of ""Being in the wrong place at the wrong time."" I mean, it just seems like maybe a new idea could have been come up with instead of him just being unlucky. But that entire theme was what made the first film so great and it does re-add some humor to this film which I like. There is one thing that upsets me about the story though. Colonel Stuart leads a group of ex-soldiers to take over Washington D.C. airport in order to rescue a captured drug lord who is being flown in to the airport. Yet this is all they apparently want! They want no money and as McClane said in the most recent one, ""It is always about the money."" So why do they just want the drug-lord? This ""inconsistency"" really influences my disliking of the story. It may not seem like that big a deal but it kind of bugs me. There is a good twist in this movie that I like! I forgot all about it until I watched it again recently and it still surprised me when it jogged my memory. I really think the ending may be the best ending of all the movies! Just the way Willis plays off the ending is superb! <br/><br/>The film has some newer, bigger, and more intense scenes in it. There is more that can be done at a huge airport I think than in a skyscraper so the movie is open to new possibilities. There are still plenty of varied and intense killings of terrorists by McClane so you will never know what to expect which is great.<br/><br/>If you are a ""Die Hard"" Die Hard fan, this a good movie for you. If you are a simple movie fan, this may not be a great movie for you. It is an excellent entertainment film with plenty of action and violence but the story seems inconsistent! It should be seen just because it is a Die Hard movie and as my friend says about Die Hard, ""If you don't like it, you don't have balls!"""

Two years later, this guy came back for more, albeit once again against his will.<br/><br/>This time around, the trouble ensues at an airport, where John McClane (Willis) is waiting for his wife (Bonnie Bedelia). Everything's all right until a gang of mercenaries, led by Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), takes control of the airport's communications system and keep all the planes circling in the air until they can get the convicted General Esperanza (Franco Nero) out of the United States. With only 58 minutes left before the aircrafts run out of fuel and the authorities incapable of doing anything, McClane decides to take the matter in his own hands, much to the despair of the uptight Captain Lorenzo (NYPD Blue's Dennis Franz). This means there will be more shooting, more explosions, more blood and more ""yippee-ki-yay, motherf**ker!"".<br/><br/>By setting the second Die Hard (also known as Die Harder) in an airport, Finnish director Renny Harlin is able to stage bigger and louder set-pieces than John McTiernan did in the first film, and while one of the main charms of the original was the down-to-earth action, Harlin's material never feels overblown or out of place. Why? Because unlike the action sequences, McClane hasn't changed that much: he'd still rather be at home with his wife and kids than battle terrorists all by himself, and yet there he is, getting beaten up to ensure hundreds of people won't die. It is the decision to remain faithful to the character's nature, combined with Willis'charisma, that makes Die Hard 2 as fun and exciting as its predecessor.<br/><br/>If there has to be a (minor) complaint, it involves the villains: Sadler is a menacing presence, that's undeniable, but he doesn't appear in enough scenes to make as memorable an impression as Alan Rickman did in the first film. By the time he is face to face with Willis, however, it doesn't matter anymore: the final showdown is so spectacular all Die Hard fans should forget the fact the bad guy's role was underwritten and just sit down and cheer as McClane saves the day again.<br/><br/>In short: loved Die Hard? Then the sequel should be a great experience too (shame Harlin hasn't done anything as good since, though).<br/><br/>8,5/10"

","Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a solid sequel that is definitely worth seeing after you have seen the first one. Bruce Willis acts and talks the same way, makes similar jokes, and has the same spunk. The movie's plot is basically Die Hard in an airport with a bigger budget and, in my opinion, more complexity. William Sadler is an OK villain, but he is boring compared to the wonderful Alan Rickman. The action scenes are great, and I would say the direction isn't bad. Overall, a very entertaining film that is worthy of being the sequel to the original. Let's just hope the fourth one is good and we have a great series.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I re-watched this movie the other night after many years, and I must say I don't know why people complain about it so much, it totally kicked as much ass as I remembered!! All the elements are there for a good Die Hard: emotional connection, bad guys you truly want to see dead, sarcastic John McLane kicking ass in new and inventive ways with little help, and of course let's not forget Al Powell. The basic story is this: it's Christmas in a Washington DC airport and John McLane is waiting for his wife Holly to arrive. He suspects something is amiss when he sees two men who are up to no good and of course he is right, the action continues to build from there. I don't want to spoil the rest for anyone but I will say this: Expoding airplanes, Det. Sipowicz, and terrorists, OH MY!! Sure, some people will say there are too many plot holes, but this is the epitome of a great action movie, I say plot holes be DAMNED!!!"

","Having lived in the DC area for more than 20 years, it almost never snows before mid - January and only once have I seen a dusting around Christmas time. Snow is usually very light and a blizzard averages about once every 10 years.<br/><br/>Also airport corps at Reagan national don't have NY accents.....I thought this was amusing. I even worked at Reagan national for quite some time so I am very familiar with aiport equipment and procedures. Baggage handling machines are 100% electrical and there would be no steam vents or pipes. This was also amusing, but I understand it was added for dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Though most of the film was around Dulles, the basic ideas are the same.<br/><br/>The rest of the film definitely had a DC feel to it and was much better than the first Die Hard movie."
"Robert_duder","8","0","2","24 March 2007"," A sequel that had to exist and they absolutely did justice to the original
","I had to really base this review on my true feelings of seeing Die Hard 2. The problem with reviewing Die Hard 2 is if any channel anywhere in Cable land decides to air a Die Hard film...it's this one...I've see Die Hard 2 so many times that it hurts...I always seem to catch the same parts and the same lines on TV over and over again despite the fact that Cable TV attempts to bleep out the language with hilarious voice overs such as ""Yippee Kai eh Mister Falcon---TBS"" So I watched Die Hard 2 again beginning to end for this review and I must say the film truly is great in it's own right. I mean plugged up against the magnificence of the Die Hard original...it pales in the shadow but nonetheless has some really important features that make it a necessary and worthy sequel to greatness. Director Renny Harlin took over from the unmatchable greatness of John McTiernan and Harlin was the perfect pick because his career and films, much like McTiernan has had greatness and not so great. Harlin seemed to know the characters and story and what was necessary to create the brilliance of another Die Hard film. Still there was a different and distinctive style in Harlin's film over the original. The sarcasm and biting humor was toned down a great deal and the supporting cast wasn't nearly as important as John McClane and the terrorists but setting the film in an airport was sheer brilliance. The most important thing was not lacking and that was unstoppable, kick ass, edge of your seat, things blowing up ACTION!! Bruce Willis returned to his familiar role as tough, rugged, ripped good guy cop John McClane waiting for his now reconciled wife Holly to land in Washington and join him and their kids at her parents home. John with instincts in tact smells something funny going down and everything from there on in is typical Die Hard. <br/><br/>Bruce Willis is still amazing in this role and although I don't think the second installment had near the bite and brawn of John McClane that the original had he's still amazing at it and a true action hero further implementing that modern day action cowboy name. Bonnie Bedelia also returns as McClane's once estranged wife that pulled him into the first terrorist plot. Much the same as last time Holly is at the whim of terrorists only this time she is in a jet circling the airport the terrorists have taken control of. Bedelia still has that very strong female role down pat and she suits the idea of a woman who can handle McClane. She also has the pleasure of verbally torturing slimy News anchor Richard Thornburg who happens on the same plane as her played by William Atherton also returning from the original. He gets more of a substantial role and is even more slimy and the perfect adversary for Holly who makes short work of him. William Sadler is terrific as the lead terrorist Col. Stuart although he still doesn't hold a candle to previous lead terrorist in Die Hard played by Alan Rickman but he does a decent job as a man determined to achieve his goal. He's military, decisive, violent, and determined like any great terrorist in films. Franco Nero is also good as the major drug dealer the terrorists are negotiating to have released and escape. Add in the cameo and supporting roles by Reginald VelJohnson, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and Art Evans as McClane's newest sidekick and you've got a great cast.<br/><br/>Most importantly the action is swinging within ten minutes of the film's beginning. A gunfight in the baggage claim, suddenly terrorists have control of the flight towers, then they are crashing a 747 filled with people yards from John McClane who is dropping to his knees in terror, a snowmobile chase across an icy lake with machine guns blazing, a high speed Jet chase and finally an unbelievable explosion that is still one of the great explosion scenes in film history. Die Hard 2 lives up to it's name sake and certainly does not disappoint in any fashion. It might not have quite the same wallop that the original had but it also doesn't take away from the series but whole heartedly adds a new chapter that is more than welcome. If you haven't see Die Hard...or Die Hard 2...you don't even know what an action film is. 8.5/10"

","This is apparently not as good as Die Hard. No matter, as I, luckily, have not seen Die Hard, so my opinion cannot be altered by expectation. As a film in it's own right, Die Hard 2 is pretty good, although not great. Indeed, it appears to be heading towards a 3-star rating, until the intense, explosive ending, which is epitomised by Bruce Willis' line: ""Yippie-ki-yay Motherf*****!"" The reasons that it appears to be merely 3-star material for most of the film is as follows, the villain is not very convincing, he does not inspire fear, hatred, impulsive interest or emit a sheer callousness and disregard for human life like the best villains do, for instance, Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator (a much better film). All this guy does is inspire indifference from the audience. Ditto Major Grant, who isn't in the film long enough to be hated as a villain as he is exposed at the last minute. In a way, this adds an interesting twist, but this does not last long. Bruce Willis' John McClane is one big stereotype; one of Rambo. This is fine in Rambo films or other mindless, 'dumb-fun' action films, but not in films which are touted as having more substance than that. McClane is basically a lean, mean fighting machine. The acting is OK, sometimes intense, but never really great; the villain, as I said, is a big letdown. I do, however, like how a reporter in Die Hard 2 incites panic among the populace, which adds to the film's intensity, but unfortunately, Die Hard 2 is also tacked with a very unnecessary outlying Christmas theme.<br/><br/>No, my friends, where this film really does excel is it's ending. After looking as if the baddies are about to escape, McClane somehow heads onto their plane, fights briefly with Major Grant, then after opening the fuselage, jumps off and lights it with a lighter. The plane is followed by one, long jet-flame; unrealistic, but exciting, so who the hell cares? A massive explosion occurs, but not before Bruce Willis has time to utter that movie-defining line: ""Yippie-ki-yay Motherf*****!"" Overall, this is an action film worth seeing, even if it is hardly original. Just be sure to wait for the ending.<br/><br/>3.5/5 stars"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","0","3","8 January 2006"," A reasonable sequel
","There's nothing new or fresh in Die Hard 2, indeed it's a shameless rehash, but that doesn't stop it from being rather enjoyable (although, unlike the first one, not always for the right reasons).<br/><br/>One of the nicest surprises as regards Die Hard 2 (if nice is the correct way to put it) is just how violent it is. I mean, perhaps I've seen the edited television version too many times, but I'd forgot just how nasty some of it is. For example, there's a bit where John McClane stabs someone in the eye with an icicle. It's extremely gruesome. And the moment is made rather funny when Renny Harlin on the commentary says that he tried to do the stabbing tastefully. There's nothing tasteful about it! You see it in extreme detail. But that's why I like it. I'm fed up with PG-13 action films that skimp on blood and guts. Therefore it's nice to see some good old-fashioned gratuitous violence. (But I think the filmmakers missed a trick by not having McClane say, ""Ice to meet you"" when he pierced the bad guy's eyeball.) <br/><br/>Then there's the bit where one of the soldiers gets his throat slit. You get blood, a gaping wound and plenty of deathly gasping. Oh how I miss OTT action film deaths.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the bit where the bad guy crashes a jet plane. This isn't one or two people getting killed; this is a couple of hundred. And although I'm sure some people probably harp on about it being disturbing in light of September 11th, it's not really. In fact, it's rather funny, especially when it's a plane full of clichéd English characters  the pilot says, ""Where the devil have you been?"" (because, according to American screenwriters, the English don't swear), one of the stewardesses looks like Princess Diana and makes references to British Rail, and a distraught passenger looks like the dear old Queen Mum. So to me it's highly amusing when a screaming plane-full of fellow limeys goes up in flames (the Queen Mother, in complete contrast to the Dunkirk spirit, is the loudest screamer). And the scene's good because it ups the ante to ridiculous heights. You really want McClane to kick ass.<br/><br/>Oh sweet Jesus. Asses. I've just remembered one of the film's opening images  William Sadler's sweaty arse. Why the hell does his character train in the buff? It doesn't make any sense. You don't fight in the nude. Well, you might 'fight' naked (with your sword), but you don't fight in the naked with your fists. Wait. No, scratch that But I guess this man-nakedness is meant to show that Saddler's body is a lethal weapon. He's taunt, he's tight and he's, er, stiff.<br/><br/>McClane on the other hand is surprisingly masculine for an 80s action hero (the film may have come out in 1990 but it's undeniably an 80s action film). He even flirts with women! Get that; an action hero that would actually rather be around women than men who train in the nude. Arnie wouldn't approve.<br/><br/>But compared to the first Die Hard there isn't much chemistry between McClane and the bad guy. Indeed, while completely mental, Saddler's bad guy is rather bland. But he does get points for employing a henchman who looks like Nigel Mansell (a man who gets his head crushed Indiana Jones-style).<br/><br/>One of the stupidest things in Die Hard 2 (and there are many) is the way that Dick Thornburg (William Atherton aka Walter Peck) is on the same plane as McClane's wife. What a coincidence! But still, as badly contrived as the whole thing is, it still makes me laugh, especially when Thornburg delivers a narcissistic report on the crapper and then gets zapped by the mad old biddy on board (the speech is actually rather fantastic in how unbelievable it is: ""But at least the truth is NOT among the hostages because I, Richard Thornburg, just happen to be here, to put his life and TALENT on the line for humanity and country, and if this should be my final broadcast"") <br/><br/>Also guiltily amusing is the stupid Chief. Really, there isn't a film Chief that is as stupid and shouty as Dennis Franz's Lorenzo. He's entirely incompetent. And then there's the female news reporter. She always talks like she's delivering a report, even during normal conversation. And at the end, there's a hilarious moment when she finally exercises some journalistic restraint  she covers the lens when McClane and wife hug and kiss. It should be said that she has no qualms about shoving a camera into the face of bloody carnage; your gruesome death is public property. But something heart-warming, something upbeat and positive; oh that's private. No one wants to see that. (Another funny thing is that when the cameraman sees McClane and wife hugging and kissing, he says, ""God that's beautiful."" Yeah, big 80s hair meets sweaty, bloody, balding rozzer; beautiful!) <br/><br/>But actually, I agree with the female news reporter. Who wants to see kissing when you have panicked crowds crashing through glass doors? Not me. In fact, panicked crowds crashing through glass doors may be among the funniest things in the world. I love it.<br/><br/>But the film, though, I don't love. Sure I enjoy it, but it's really for the wrong reasons. It's for the incompetent SWAT team, the casual swearing, the macho posturing, the obvious dummy that gets squashed by scaffolding instead of the supposed flesh and blood victim, the bit with the ejector seat and the way a man gets sucked into a jet engine. It's a silly, silly film, but that's not always a bad thing."

The flipside to this is McClane is THE MAN at taking these kinds of creeps down. This time he's at an airport when the fun starts. Of course no one believes McClane when he tells the macho, swaggering airport security guards that something bad is about to happen.

It has great action in it, such as:<br/><br/>1)The fight in the luggage area 2)The firefight on the Annex Skywalk 3)The crash of the London flight 4)The firefight at the church 5)The incredible ending.<br/><br/>These keep the audiences on the very edge of their seat. In fact, it keeps the audience on the seat in front it is so gripping. The fight in the luggage area is a great, action-packed opening to the movie. The firefight on the Annex Skywalk is one of the greatest, most over-elaborate battle sequences of all time. The crash of the London flight is very clever, touching to the coldest of hearts and unexpected. The firefight at the church is action-packed yet the twist in it (which I won't say here) is fantastic. Yet many hardcore fans of the franchise, including me, would argue the fact that the ending is the best of all three and anybody who slates this movie can't argue with it's OTT, unrealistic ending; arguably the greatest action movie ending ever.<br/><br/>The only dark cloud that hangs over this movie is the amount of plot holes in it. The two major ones being:<br/><br/>1) Many of the planes could've been redirected to other airports rather than circulating around the outer markers.<br/><br/>2)The airport wouldn't have been able to be controlled by an external control point (the church)<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it's a movie; a great movie.

","Die Hard 2 is every bit of fun as the first. The plot may be familiar to the first but it takes place at an Airport in Washington D.C. not at a 40 story building.

Fred Dalton Thompson is the Airport Manager under a lot of pressure and then there's Dennis Franz who seems to say one cuss word after another. The only cast member who I thought was miscast was John Amos even though he did a great job. Amos was more of a comic actor who was in ""Coming to America"" and appeared in an episode of ""The Cosby Show."" After seeing him in those, I had a hard time seeing him as a bad ass turncoat villain. His role should have been given to Bill Duke from the ""Predator"".

","To anybody who has been put of watching this terrific film by bad reviews, don't because you are missing a terrific action film and a great sequel that is a worthy follow on from the first film. What is established here is that we are not getting a continuation of the first film's story; McClane finds himself facing a new terrorist threat and this time it truly is a terrorist threat. No hiding a robbery  here, the baddies are sheer evil terrorists willing to do anything to get what they want.  What is so great about this set up is that director Renny Harlin and writer Steven De Souza get to have fun by drawing comparisons to the events of this film and the first installment. It's Christmas Eve, Holly is on a plane flight back to John, but terrorists are threatening to crash planes unless a drug lord being transported  to America is handed over to them and John McClane finds himself in the middle of it all.  Harlin uses this as the main thrust of the film's humor. McClane finds himself having to crawl through air vents again and remarks at his exasperation at how the same thing can happen to the same guy twice, Holly asks John at the end 'why does this keep happening to us', and McClane is told that he  is the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. The humorous angle is dealt with fantastically.<br/><br/>The action sequences, coming from the man who would go on to give us Cliffhanger and The Long Kiss Goodnight are spectacular, although there is more of a leaning towards explosions and spectacular death scenes than the building of suspense that we had in the first film, but Harlin had a bigger budget than McTiernan did for Die Hard, so that may be the reason. In light of 9/11 the film does have the sense that it wouldn't even be made today. The controversial moment where William Sadler's villain crashes a commercial jet to teach McClane and Dulles Airport a lesson is shocking, from the use of imagery (we see the passengers screaming for their lives) to the (admittedly very well done) shot of the plane exploding, it does leave one with a churned stomach. Add to this other sadistic moments such as the icicle in the eye, one of the villains going through an airplane engine and a bad guy being flattened by scaffolding and there is a slightly more darker air to the action sequences. McTiernan wanted to make the violence in Die Hard almost goofy and cartoon like, one gets the impression Harlin is out for realism.<br/><br/>In saying that is a fine action film. Willis is his usual charismatic self, Bedelia and Atherton make a nice comedic double act, Dennis Franz is a wonderfully vindictive airport police officer and Sadler a chilling villain, if admittedly not as memorable as Alan Rickman. This is fun stuff and is hugely enjoyable. Terrific."

","I am a big fan of Die Hard,the original.So why did i hate this movie? Because you have to be brain-dead to follow this screenplay.Thank heavens this story could never happen because in reality airport folks are not morans.When the terrorists misguide a plane so that it's going to crash sending hundreds of people to their death,what do people on the ground do?Do they blow up something like a plane that would light up the entire area for miles and could be seen from any plane landing?No.Actually they do NOTHING.Only John McLane takes a couple of torches(!!!!!)and tries to make the plane see him but of course they cant. Pleeease!!!!!!What's even funnier,the journalist in the plane at some point picks up the phone and calls his office when the entire tragedy rests on the fact that the airport simply cannot communicate with the planes!!!!!Need i say any more????????"

","Superior action film that drenches testosterone all over the damn place. Explosions, gunfights, fistfights, and even time for lethal icecycles.  You don't have to have seen the first to enjoy this either, as it's pretty straight-forward: a team of wackos wants to rescue their drug-dealing leader from a jail term in the states, so they stage this huge, elaborate takeover of a Washington, D.C. airport where he's about to be delivered.  Willis is waiting around for his wife's plane to land and catches on to things, thwarting himself into one delirious moment after another.  I didn't enjoy the first film, had too many needless characters and dialogue, part 3 was a massively annoying wild goose chase, but this is how action films should (and unfortunately used to) be made.  Well-paced, multi-layered plot but not too much so, a great twist toward the end, and probably the biggest way you could finish it all save blowing up the entire planet earth.

","Die Hard 2: Die Harder. The second film in arguably one of the greatest action series of all time.<br/><br/>Even though many people see this film as the weak point in the trilogy, I simply look at this, then films like 'Knockoff', and laugh. Even though this film can be considered of a lesser standard than the others, it has something which a lot of action films don't... character development. When the first plane explodes, rather than just shaking his head, and then forgetting about it minutes later, we see how physically shaken McLane is that he didn't save the passengers. We see his desperation in trying to save them, grabbing towels, and setting them alight. Now, in a large number of action films, the pilots would see him and pull up, and everyone would be saved. The way Die Harder shows this sequence is a vast improvement, and you really feel the emotion when the plane misses him and carries on, before crashing. Fantastic.<br/><br/>This film has a lot of strong performances. Bruce Willis puts in another emotional performance as L.A.P.D cop, John McLane, and the surrounding cast never let him down.<br/><br/>And Robert Patrick has one of my favorite lines, ""What do I look like to you?"" ""A sitting duck"". Brilliant.<br/><br/>Overall, perhaps not as good as the original, but far better than most.<br/><br/>7/10"

My favorites are the one of Willis flying towards the camera after escaping the cockpit full of grenades and the terrific ending when the plane explodes after he throws a cigarette lighter on the leaking line of gasoline.

","There are days-- and everybody has them-- when no matter what you do things just don't go the way you planned, and by the end of the day you're thinking maybe you should've just kicked back and had that second cup of coffee.  And on a day like that, you can bet the odds are pretty good that even lightening can, in fact, strike the same person twice, which is exactly what happens in the action packed `Die Hard 2,' directed by Renny Harlin, and starring Bruce Willis as LAPD Detective John McClane.  It's Christmas time again, and McClane is at Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., awaiting the arrival of his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), whose plane is scheduled to land within a couple of hours.  It's snowing, the weather is chancy and the traffic in the air is heavy; still and all, things are good, and McClane is looking forward to spending the holidays with Holly and her parents.  What he doesn't know is that there are some people waiting in the wings to change all that-- and they are about to make life miserable for McClane and everyone within their proximity.<br/><br/>	It just so happens that a deposed drug lord, General Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero), is being extradited to the U.S. to stand trial for cocaine trafficking, and his plane is scheduled to touch down at Dulles shortly. but he doesn't intend to stay around long.  A small army of mercenaries-- all former U.S. Army commandos-- are in the process of being deployed in and around the airport, with the intention of doing what they do best:  Making war and creating havoc, and effecting the escape of the man to whom they have sworn allegiance, General Esperanza.  Under the command of the fanatic and psychotic Colonel Stuart (William Sadler), the mercenaries are ruthless, their tactics are brutal and they are determined to carry out their mission successfully at all costs.  Toward that end they've planned a precision military operation right down to the smallest detail.  But their plans failed to include the contingency of encountering a one-man wrecking crew, and they're about to meet him.  His name is John McClane.<br/><br/>	With this sequel, director Harlin devised, crafted and delivered an action film that has exactly what an action film is supposed to have:  Action, and plenty of it.  And once it starts, it never lets up until the screen has gone dark, and it's one wild ride.  It has the added bonus, as well, of having a storyline to back it all up, all of which Harlin presents in a satisfying, cohesive package.  As with even the best offerings of the genre, however, this one requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but there's so much happening so quickly that it doesn't require much effort.  A couple of key scenes are built around things that could only be accomplished through the use of creative license, but it doesn't make any difference; it works for the story and Harlin integrates it so well into the action that it all seems real, and unless you're an expert in a certain field you wouldn't know the difference anyway.  The important thing is, it's exciting and entertaining.<br/><br/>	One element that puts this film a cut above many action movies is the fact that the characters have at least been developed beyond being mere comic book caricatures; these are people with whom you are able to become emotionally involved because they have very real concerns, feelings and relationships.  They just happen to be confronted at this juncture of their lives by extraordinary circumstances.  The relationship between McClane and Holly, for example, adds that element of humanity that makes the film more than `just' a special effects extravaganza.  Willis does a good job of bringing McClane to life with a credible, believable performance, as does Bedelia as Holly.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes a number of actors who were virtually unknown at the time, but who have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, like Dennis Franz (Lorenzo), Vondie Curtis-Hall (Miller), Robert Patrick (O'Reilly) and John Leguizamo (Burke).  Also in the cast are William Atherton (Thornburg), Reginald VelJohnson (Powell), John Amos (Grant), Tom Bower (Marvin) and Sheila McCarthy (Samantha Coleman).  The role of John McClane catapulted Bruce Willis to international stardom, and reprising the character in `Die Hard 2' virtually crowned him King of the action genre. Harlin did a terrific job with this one, Sadler created a memorable villain with Colonel Stuart, and like your favorite ride at your favorite amusement park, it's thrilling-- and as soon as it's over, chances are you're going to want to go again.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10."

I understand that Dulles could not accept planes, but if you can call in US Army Special Forces, why can't you make a call to Anderson AFB?  How did the gasoline from the plane fall in such a nice neat line when it was gushing out like it did?  Why did the terrorists have only five snowmobiles when they had started their mission with many more people than that?  Did the terrorists expect the Air Force and Navy, both of which have bases in close proximity (Anderson and Norfolk), to let them leave peacefully in their unarmed 747?  Did the terrorists actually switch guns between when they were shooting blanks and real bullets?  Also, I find it hard to believe that the Green Berets (I assume that's who they were) would be called in, which the terrorists' plan counted on.  Dulles could just have easily called in the Marines, the FBI Hostage Rescue Team, or the D.C. SWAT team.  Overall this was good, but there were a few loose ends."

Hasn't anyone seen True Lies?<br/><br/>That said, Die Hard 2 is very different from the first.  McClane is now facing real terrorists at a Washington airport, this time led by American Col. Stuart, played by the always watchable William Sadler.  McClane still faces much opposition from the city police force, but at least they are a little more reasonable than Dwayne T. Robinson in the original, and Dennis Franz's character begins to see things McClane's way toward the end.<br/><br/>The mood is much more serious this time, as is characteristic of Renny Harlin's films.  And there are plenty of twists and turns that give the pace a much-needed boost.  Two fantastic exploding plane sequences toward the end give this one the best climax of the Die Hard trilogy.

Lorenzo has some funny lines, including ""I got a !#@%@ reindeer flying in here from the $!%!@#$ petting zoo"" and other swear word packed things up his sleeve.  I did not like this movie's bad guy as well as the previous bad guy, but he lived up to his role.  This movie is equally great in action, but something is missing from it, it isn't quite as good.  It has the same ""Gotta save my wife"" plot, but it isn't as good I thought.  Still it receives an 8/10 for great action, plot, humor, and thrills.

I liked it so much, I own the trilogy!"

","So John McClane is back. That it is one in a billion that he would actually fall in the same trap again exactly one year later is nothing we will argue about. Renny Harlin does it ALMOOOOOST as good as John McTiernan did it. And as usual a sequel of an explosive action movie got to have more violence and even more action. And Die Hard 2 is surely nothing out of the ordinary. But it has got what mostly action movies don't. A plot. A REAL plot. The story is the same but the building has been changed into an airport. And the movie is for once in a while better than the book. The bad guy in this movie is twice ( if not three double ) as cold and tough as Hans Gruber ever tried to be. But since his face is cuind of a ''stoneface'' he doesn't express the same fun as Rickman. The two planes explosions are two of the most classic in action history. Bruce Willis doesn't play as good as in Die Hard part one but he is so awesome as he could be. As usual the movie is filled with stupid cops and some buddies. And part two in this trilogy is what Die Hard almost was. Non Stop Action. Although the fightscene at the wing of the bad guys plane is very very very un-realistic it goes to watch. Said and done.<br/><br/>For thoes who thought Die Hard was the best movie ever will be demolished by disappointment. But those who liked Die Hard but thought it was too tame (or those who have never ever seen Die Hard) will love Die Hard 2. Yippie-Kay-Yeah everybody!!!!!!"
