","Certainly this Universal remake is more in the vain of Indiana Jones rather than the original Mummy.  It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt."
"ricsim78","10","47","49","1 January 2008"," One of my all time favorite movies
","First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but most of the low ratings I am seeing are criticizing ""The Mummy"" because of it's ""weak plot"" or someone even said that this movie could have been written by the person's dog!<br/><br/>Does anyone realize that there is different movie genres? If you go to see ""The Mummy"" and expect to see ""The Departed"", ""The Godfather"", or ""Shawshank Redemption"" then yes, of course you will be disappointed. This is not a drama, it's an action/adventure movie! <br/><br/>Everyone has commented on the fun of this movie, that is what this movie is all about! Personally, I think the story is very good, and interesting. There is a lot to like here: it has elements of action, adventure, comedy, fantasy, mythology, horror, and tells a pretty well made tale (seriously, how many movies manage to pull all of these things off? And pull them off well!). And, it manages to do all of this in style, with amazing special effects and action sequences. No, it's not perfect (what movie is?) but this movie kills most movies in the same genre! I have never seen a movie that can contain so many different elements while still being coherent. This movie is a technical marvel is many aspects!<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is great and looks beautiful as well playing as Evelyn. Yes, she is something like a ""typical damsel in distress"", but she brings humor, intelligence, and a strong will to the part. It's hard to integrate so many qualities into a believable character, but she does it well.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell: After seeing him in so many goofy movies, playing an equally goofy character, I thought he was always going to be cast in lame movies such as ""Encino Man"" and ""Monkeybones"". He was the reason why I had doubts I would like the movie because I could not picture him being more than a one-dimensional actor (able to pull goofy-charismatic off only). Not only does he act the part with stride, but he nails every aspect of his character: He is cool, yet has humor and he really surprised me with how much depth he can add to a role that really doesn't need it! Rick O'Connell wields his dual guns with flair, and I will never doubt Fraser again! I just hope they keep him utilized more and more like this. I was really impressed with him most because he surpassed all expectations!<br/><br/>Everyone else did their parts extremely well, they always stay in character, and add to the elements of the story. <br/><br/>This movie has a lot to offer, and lots of different ways to get your interest, especially if the Ancient Egyptian mythology fascinates you. This movie does have elements of horror: it will most likely scare younger kids more than adults, but putting yourself in the characters places you would be quite afraid. <br/><br/>Imhotep is very scary, mostly because of all the different abilities he possesses, as well as forms he can take. <br/><br/>I could not recommend this movie enough, especially if you have a HDTV and have the High Definition version, you will be blown away! Just don't expect a character driven drama, you're not looking for that with this either!"
"MovieAddict2016","8","128","142","7 October 2003"," Great fun in the vein of ""Indiana Jones""...
","""The Mummy"" is an adventurous yarn in the vein of ""Indiana Jones."" It's a lot of fun, very charming, and never tries to be more than what it is. What is it? An entertaining summer flick which is not only worth seeing, but perhaps even owning. It's one of those fun movies you can return to over and over again and never grow tired of doing so.<br/><br/>It's hardly a remake of the Universal classic of the same name. It's merely a new way to tell the story with the same basic idea - a murderous mummy is brought back from the dead. This time we have a hero and heroine who must stop him before he takes over the world, or something along the line of world domination.<br/><br/>The hero is Rick (Brendan Fraser), a thief thriving off the very basics out in Egypt circa 1930. Arrested and to be hanged, he is saved by the heroine (Rachel Weisz), who believes he may hold the key to helping them find an ancient Egyptian kingdom buried under the sand, if I recall correctly (though it has been a while since I've seen this). Little does she know what lurks beneath the sand near that old kingdom is none other than the remains of a man who was caught cheating on the king's wife years ago and mummified.<br/><br/>Now, after unearthing the remains of the kingdom, the expedition led by our heroes come upon an ancient ""Book of the Dead,"" which, when read from, brings the ancient mummy back to life. Now he is out to kill, regenerate and bring back his old lover - pretty neat, huh?<br/><br/>I own ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy,"" a great movie spoofing the classic film. ""The Mummy"" isn't exactly a spoof but it's very tongue-in-cheek. It knows it isn't an Oscar-winner, it knows it stands nothing against the older film, and so it goes for pulp thrills. I actually believe that this film is a bit classy in execution - compared to many other entertainments floating around nowadays it stands as one of the only films to return to the roots of the pure adventure films like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) so successfully did.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser is a perfect choice for the lead star. Calm, but with ironic and sarcastic humor; cool, but a strong lead. I wondered what it would have been like if they had casted an actor in his role who would have taken it all more seriously. I bet the results would have been disastrous. Fraser knows that this is all good fun, and he's having a good time playing his role with comedy. Every once and a while you can catch a wink at the screen that lets us know that he knows what he's doing.<br/><br/>2001 brought a sequel to ""The Mummy"" named, of all things, ""The Mummy Returns."" I found it just as fun as this film though some critics begged to differ. Summer 2002 brought yet another ""Mummy"" film, this one a prequel called ""The Scorpion King"" - it was a following of a co-star of the first sequel. The Mummy was not in it at all. It was a horrible film that wasn't near as fun as this one. So I recommend you see ""The Mummy"" as soon as humanly possible. After that, see ""The Mummy Returns.""<br/><br/>Either way, you simply can't go wrong."

"bjones","9","143","164","6 July 1999"," Fun adventure film
","Here, the makers took the original stock horror film and turned it into an Indianajonesesque adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. The most visually rich part of the film was the opening scenes set in ancient Egypt. I would love to see an entire film built around that. The sets and costumes were brilliant.<br/><br/>Especially tantalizing is the strictly painted-on attire of Patricia Velazquez as Anck-Su-Namum; what a stunning visual; but it completely upstages her performance. I have heard people talking about it. Some have mistakenly guessed her top was a mesh costume of some sort; not true, it is entirely - and only - paint.<br/><br/>But Velazquez isn't the only thing to turn heads in the film, Rachel Weisz is appropriately attractive, though not as startling; her character is as solid and believable as she is lovely.<br/><br/>The newcomer, Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bey, set quite a few female hearts aflutter; in our party, at least. The internet was lit-up searching for more photos of this guy.<br/><br/>At first, I didn't particularly care for Brendan Fraser as the primary character (he's too well kept and cutesy for a rugged guy-type for me), be he grows on you. He seems to be developing into a versatile actor who will be around for a long time. His work here is good too.<br/><br/>The special effects were the real star of the film, and they were visually rewarding and complimented the story in the right way in the right places. How Arnold Vosloo dealt with those in his role as the mummy Imhotep should be acknowledged. He must have had to imagine quite a bit of what he was interacting with to pull it off, and he does so with great style and substance for this type of role. He was nothing short of excellent.<br/><br/>In fact, most of the remaining characters were well chosen. Jonathan Hyde and Kevin J. O'Connor added to the film in important ways, too. Together, everyone painted an enjoyable film, delivering exactly what it promised; fun, action, and adventure."
"gatsby2244","9","110","125","30 April 2005"," A Superb Action Adventure !
","This is one film that caught my imagination like very few other Hollywood action films I have seen before.Yes,on the face of it,this is another sci-fi action adventure,a surefire winning card for Hollywood -what's so special about that ?Oh yes,there is !To begin with,there is the scenery at the beginning of the film that completely blows you away,making you feel that this movie could be something above what you had expected.And you are not wrong.The first surprise is Brendan Fraser as the American soldier Rick O'Connell, who accidentally stumbles upon Hamunaptra,the city of the dead,where the wealth of Egypt's greatest emperor Seti the First is buried.After seeing him in ""Airheads "" ,""Dudley Do-Right "" and "" ""George Of The Jungle"",I was very very impressed-this is one actor who can do both comedy and action and look good doing it too !Then there is the beautiful Rachel Weisz ,playing Evelyn Carnahan,who teams up with him to find Hamunaptra.She looks great playing her role,and never allows herself to be upstaged by Fraser, matching his brawn with her ever-alive intellect and quick thinking.Kevin J.O'Connor who plays the double-crossing Beni is a very new kind of villain,looking evil and ridiculous at the same time.But when the resurrected high priest Imhotep( played by Arnold Vosloo)makes his appearance in the form of ""The Mummy"", everything else becomes secondary.This is CGI at its ultimate best,and precisely why the film is so unusually absorbing .The horror and threat surrounding the curse of the mummy becomes a concern not only for the protagonists in the film but also for the audience-how will they kill something this scary and powerful?, they ask themselves. .The special effects apart from the mummy are also a treat to watch,and keep you glued to your seat.The element that makes this film not only scary but also enjoyable is the dialog.Almost every member of the large cast has a one-liner that will make you laugh in spite of the sinister atmosphere surrounding the story.The script never allows one second of screen-time to be wasted, ideally combining action with fantasy and humor,creating a movie that I consider a classic.Director Stephen Sommers has delivered a film that is bound to stand the test of time,and is definitely one of my favorites."
"MR_Heraclius","8","37","40","20 February 2020"," I love this movie so much!
","A real romp of an adventure/horror genre with a wonderful aesthetic that works perfectly and he period setting is pure genius at creating an immersive world. Performances are terrific with Weisz and Fraser having a blast and a great dynamic. The CGI does look a little outdated and of course brings the overall film down but the humour and the overall tone is balanced brilliantly."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","37","40","24 November 2003"," ""We are in some serious trouble""
","In the 1990's, a stream of remakes came out after the universal horror films with the monsters: Dracula(Bram Stoker's Dracula), Frankenstein(Mary Shelley's Frankenstein), The Wolf Man(Wolf) and now The Mummy made after the same title. The original stared Boris Karloff and is truly a haunting movie. Despite the fact that slow moving mummies are not as scary of a villain, Boris brought in an incredible eerie performance that is so memorable that made mummies scary. How could we update the story to make mummies more terrifying to a newer audience? Make them faster? Make them smarter? How much they could control? How dangerous they truly are? They put a bunch of CGI into the film but somehow despite it being over the top at times, the story is what makes The Mummy into a great remake and respects the original making the mummy scary again.<br/><br/>In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist Evelyn is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it. After the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he actually stole it from an American named Rick O'Connell, who is currently in prison. Rick tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit reached the fabled city, only to be overrun by hostile Bedouins. He makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged. Rick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where they discover a mummy who Evelyn accidentally wakes up and he's after a band of American treasure hunters who have taken his treasures and wants Evelyn to bring back his true love that he died for.<br/><br/>I really liked the actors they put in this film. I know Brendan Fraiser isn't the best actor, but he really made me believe in him as an adventure hero almost to the likes of Indiana Jones. He's funny, smart, strong, charming and handsome, everything you could want. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn was beautiful, stubborn and smart, she was exactly what all these boys needed and had great chemistry with Fraiser. The humor is a lot, they use a lot of jokes which at times could take away from the film. The CGI is also a lot, but it added to the story and wasn't to the point of unbelievable. I thought the idea of having a faster mummy was more terrifying and that he wouldn't stop coming after his victims in such a horrific way was a great idea. I really did like The Mummy, I know it certainly has it's flaws, but it's just a fun adventure horror movie that really hooks you from beginning to end. The sequels just didn't add up well to this movie, I would recommend The Mummy any day. The haters honestly just don't know how to have any fun, any flawed film could still be a good time and The Mummy certainly is one one them.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","24","26","18 July 2006"," A poor man's Indiana Jones - but still endlessly entertaining
","The Mummy is a great summer adventure for nonstop thrills and kicks. It has a lot of humour; memorable comedic performances (Brendan Fraser), fantastic settings and surprisingly striking CGI for 1999. There is little technically wrong with this film other than that is clearly borrows heavily from the King of action-adventure, Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>What begins as a treasure hunt in the City of the Dead soon turns into a plot that essentially goes like this, as described by Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world."" The good thing is, there is a lot more to it than that, and unlike Indiana Jones, the male hero is not alone in his mission nor does he get all the credit for it. He is joined by the damsel in distress herself Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) who all want a piece of the treasure in the dead city. <br/><br/>While the dialogue is typically sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, it is not desperately punchy. It is probably on par with the Indiana Jones trilogy in terms of cheesy lines. But Brendan Fraser delivers these in a way that is so fitting that it does not really matter, to be honest. Fraser truly gets to shine and show us that is indeed best when it comes to comedy.<br/><br/>This isn't Citizen Kane, but it's NOT 'brainless' summer fun either. It's just a very good adventure story even if it lacks originality. <br/><br/>8/10"

","The Mummy is the best mummy movie ever to be made. This movie will blow your mind by its action, romance, adventure and music score. I loved The Mummy because it's one of those roller coaster rides were you just jump on and never let go. The Mummy is a remake of the 1932 mummy which starred Boris Karloff who played imhotep. The Mummy is about an expedition of treasure seeking explorers in the Sahara desert in 1925. They stumble upon an ancient tomb, the hunters without knowing set loose a 3,000 year-old inheritance of terror, which is personified in the vengeful reincarnation of an Egyptian priest who had been sentenced to an infinity as one of the living dead. I love watching this movie in 1999 at the big screen. This movie made me love Egypt a lot. I guarantee this movie a classic. Do not compare this with the 1932 movie.  Thanks to director Stephen Sommers which he did a wonderful job on this fantastic film. If you want to see this movie do not watch the 1932 one watch the 1999 one because it will blow you away. Last things to wrap this up Spectacular special effects, Roller coaster adventure, Funny moments, Out of the world music score, Superb acting and wonderful cast. This movie is a 10/10 stars."
"ochenko-teresa","9","10","10","22 March 2012"," Awesome roller coaster adventure!
","I will have to say that ""Mummy"" was an action adventure film in the spirit of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I know there have been other attempts over the years, but ""The Mummy"" comes the closest to hitting the mark.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"", directed by Stephen Sommers, is the story of librarian and aspiring archaeologist Evelyn (Rachel Wiesz), accompanied by her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), enlisting the help of French Foreign Legion soldier Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to find a lost Egyptian city. I prefer not to say more as this type of plot is best when the story unfolds before you.<br/><br/>Sommers directing is fast paced. There is never a dull moment, never a talky interlude to break the tone of the action. Every scene in the film is necessary for the plot advancement. Director Sommers knows an inherent part of any action film is to keep the camera moving. There are very few ""static shots"".<br/><br/>The special effects, by ILM, are fantastic. I was hooked from the opening sweeping shot of a bustling city in ancient Eygpt, beautifully recreated.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser is a very credible action hero. As Rick O'Connell, he has such a clumsy, boyish charm you can't help but like him. With a half smile and his perchant for the understatement (""You brought a new friend back from the desert, didn't you Beni?""), he is almost the equal of Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. Rachel Weisz is wonderful as the aspiring archaeologist Evelyn and John Hannah is fun as her near do well missionary brother Jonathan. Kevin J. O'Conner as scared of his own shadow Beni (I won't reveal what his role is in the story) is delightful.<br/><br/>What keeps this film from being the equal of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is the lack of character curve. Unlike Indiana Jones, who learned the hard way to respect powers he can't touch or see, I can't think of anything any of the characters in ""The Mummy"" learned.<br/><br/>However, ""The Mummy"" is still rip-roaring entertainment. Sommers and Executive Producer Kevin Jarre (screenwriter, ""Glory"") wisely created a film with an emphasis on action. They must have figured (rightly so) that any story about the Mummy presented to 1999 audiences would just not be scary, so the tone was changed to action/adventure.<br/><br/>Action films greatly rely on the ability to make the audience believe that what they see is possible within the first five to ten minutes. If this doesn't happen, the viewer will have a poor experience for the rest of the film. Most action films cannot achieve this. They ""shoot their bolt"" too early, rendering the rest of the film unbelievable. Also, the closer an action film is to related reality, the more difficult this becomes. Like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (still my all time favorite action film), ""The Mummy"" allowed me to suspend my disbelief within the first ten minutes."

","This movie is meant to be a classic.  It is so ingenious and good that makes you watch it over and over again!<br/><br/>I actually watched this movie 6 times in the theaters, and then I bought the video and I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie.<br/><br/>It is about an Egyptian high priest Imhotep, who was caught having an affair with the Pharaoh mistress and consequently was punished with death and a curse.  Then many centuries later, adventurer Rick O'Conell discovers him with Evy, and archeologist, Jonathan, her greed brother, and a group of Americans seeking for fame an glory.<br/><br/>This movie is great, the cast is so good, I never heard of any of them before this movie, except for Brendan Fraser who was in the super famous ""George of the Jungle"" movie.  Anyways the performances are vey convincing, Brendan Fraser is great as handsome hero, Rachel Weisz is great as Evy, a clumsy but very intelligent egyptologist, John Hannah delivers the humor in this movie as Jonathan, the good-for-nothing guy who only cares about money, I have to mention Oded Fehr too, he was pretty good as the mysterious and attractive Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Mejais who is in charge to put the mummy back in his grave, and how can I forget the Mummy himself, Arnold Vosloo, who was, without any doubt, the best one in this movie. His performance is so good as the evil and sexy high priest Imhotep, he doesn't make you hate him, he makes you feel sorry for him!  That is what I call ""acting skills"".<br/><br/>The plot is good, it's not a cheezy-horror flick or something like that, and the dialogues are awesome too :) Let's not forget the direction, Stephen Sommers does a great job.  And special mention to the music, by Jerry Goldsmith, it was one of the best parts of this movie.<br/><br/>You get a lot of ""candy eye"" in this movie, for guys and girls, for guys you get Rachel Weisz and in the beginning of the movie you see the Venezuelan top-model Patricia Velazques as the unfaithful Anck-su-namun; and for girls you get Brendan Fraser, Oded Fehr and of course Arnold Vosloo.<br/><br/>Anyways I highly recommend this movie, THIS IS A MUST-SEE. ***** out of *****"
"catmommie","8","135","171","12 May 1999"," Silly Fun
","Citizen Kane it ain't, but if you're looking for good, silly, H. Rider Haggardesque fun, this is the film for you.  While it  hasn't replaced the Universal classic in my affections, let's face it, the venerable original creaks a little.  I mean,  Karloff's Imhotep only moves two feet per hour -- geez, how will I ever escape him?  Arnold Vosloo's Mummy is considerably more fleet, and frankly (from the dirty old lady's perspective) is pretty darned buff for a dead guy.  A modern affectation, sure, but I like the idea of a mummy with a great butt.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser looks good, has a fabulous voice, and a whole boatload of goofy charm.  Hey!  Call me shallow, but that's pretty much all I'm looking for in a screen idol.  John Hannah was acceptable, if not inspired, as the wastrel brother.  Rachel Weisz is gorgeous, and acquits herself well in the role of ""Heroine in an Adventure Film;""  i.e., she screams and gets rescued a lot.<br/><br/>OK, I lie.  The modern ""Heroine in an Adventure Film"" is SPUNKY, screams, and gets rescued a lot.<br/><br/>And as to Oded Fehr, who plays the mysterious desert guardian of the mummy's tomb (a role traditionally assayed by Welsh character actors) -- I and the rest of the ladies in my party indicated, through a series of incoherent grunts and some unattractive drooling, a strong desire to see much, much more of him.  And we mean that both literally and figuratively.  Powers that be, please take note.<br/><br/>A couple of small caveats:  the bug quotient in this film is much higher than I usually tolerate.  It puts you right off your Milk Duds.  And where in the hell did those camels come from?<br/><br/>So if you're in a mood for brainless entertainment, I recommend that you set your intellect on stun, rush to the nearest cineplex, buy the large popcorn (WITH butter), and settle in for a couple of hours of colorful, loud, over-the-top fun.<br/><br/>Catmommie"

I got what I had hoped for: a fun, special-effects extravaganza. <br/><br/>In fact, if you read a number of reviews, you see the word ""fun"" more than anything. That best describes this film.<br/><br/>This was an Indiana Jones-Jason And The Argonauts combination adventure story. It's cartoon-like in nature with an absurd swashbuckling hero, outlandish action scenes and the occult theology that filmmakers love so much. (The Mummy has God-like powers, even producing Old Testament plagues.)<br/><br/>However, the film isn't all good news. It's too long by about 10-15 minutes and there is simply too much action and too much noise. The film needs more lulls.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser is pretty good as the Indiana Jones figure and Rachel Weisz, a new face at the time, makes a solid impression in her debut.

Many compared this film to Indiana Jones n other treasure hunt films. Whatever the similarities, this film is pure fun. It is one of the best movies -- in terms of sheer entertainment. The pacing is good n the visuals top notch considering the era. It has monsters, thrills, humor and daring close calls. The opening sequences of Ancient Egypt are breathtaking as are the shots of new century Cairo. The special effects has fast paced skeletons, sandstorms, beetle hordes, fiery hail bombardments and hungry locusts/tiny monsters. Ther is little to think but plenty to enjoy in this movie. Director Sommer filmed the action in carefully composed widescreen shots, where it's always perfectly clear what's going on.

","From beneath the depths of Hell, the ultimate symbol of evil is about to be reborn.  Beyond mortality, beyond death, this creature of the undead will rise.  Darkness will fall for all of eternity...and this plague will forever swallow this planet Earth...<br/><br/>About two thousand years ago, in the land of Ancient Egypt, a well-respected high priest known as Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) has been a very naughty man. His one-stand with the Pharaoh's mistress may very well cost him his life. After the Pharaoh discovers this illicit, forbidden love affair, Imhotep and the mistress murder the heartless Pharaoh without second thoughts.  As payback though, Imhotep is to suffer the gravest consequences...<br/><br/>Imhotep is eventually sentenced to die a most horrifying death.  The Pharaoh's guards have buried him alive inside a tomb, complete with ravaging scarabs and all.  What's even worse is that the guards have placed a disturbing curse upon the buried soul.   Whoever opens the tomb of this ancient evil will awaken the curse that has lied dormant for thousands of ears.  All shall suffer eternal damnation, as the Mummy will release its unstoppable powers upon the lands and onto the cities.   His reign of terror will spread...<br/><br/>For twenty centuries, this soul has rested in peace...  Jumping forward to 1925, a bunch of foolish archaeologists, driven by profit and ignoring all admonishments, have decided to open the tomb of the wretched Mummy.  Well, that decision was foolish...  Now, the armies of the dead will inhabit the Earth and evil will take over...  Only Colonel Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his brave team of courageous souls can prvent the Mummy's plans to rule the planet.  Along with an alluring librarian and inspiring archaeologist (Rachel Weisz), her timid brother (John Hannah), and an even more craven sidekick, Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), O'Connell and his company of wisecracking Smart Alec folks are mankind's last hope.  This though, happens to be another incident where the good guys are at the wrong place at the right time.  Heaven have mercy on these souls...  Will faith spare human lives, or can the world kiss hope goodbye?<br/><br/>THE MUMMY is so much better than I originally anticipated.  The special effects alone will blow you away!  It is unbelievable how the Mummy is able to transform himself from a rotting, disintegrating corpse to a fully developed supernatural being, and even to a raging sandstorm.  Also, those creepy crawly scarabs scare the daylights out of me!  The scarabs literally crawl under people's skins!   Impressive production values, capturing and recreating the ruins of Hamunaptra at its full glory, serve as another highlight for THE MUMMY.<br/><br/>Sure, there are also the monstrous zombies, the nightmarish flying locusts, and the fallen skies.  Yes, there is also the requisite damsel-in-distress (and love interest) who captures Imhotep's heart.  The venomous super-villain who must eat the flesh of others in order to survive is a plus as well.  However, director Stephen Sommers (DEEP RISING) transcends beyond clichÃ© material.  He brings to the audience original ideas with a refreshingly cool tone.  He makes sure that there is style within the special effects.  The eye-popping FX in general will keep crowds contented, and then some.<br/><br/>It is tough to keep a straight face when watching this movie, but you have to praise Sommers and the cast for letting you have so much fun.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed ridiculous as for some of the sequences.  One scene that had me chuckling throughout was when all the slaves were synchronically chanting ""Imhotep!""  Kevin J. O'Connor finds himself having some of the best one-liners as he may eventually switch allegiances and serve a different master.  Yes, the humor is somewhat gratuitous, granted.  However, in all sincerity, the humor is needed to lighten the film's dark tone.<br/><br/>The acting is more second rate.  Arnold Vosloo made a terrific villain and Rachel Weisz lights up the screen with her gorgeous presence.  Fraser and O'Connor are great also.  The rest of the cast is kind of listless though. In spite of that, THE MUMMY is a spectacular spectacle laced with show-stopping special effects and genuine chills.  The music, composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith is pulse pounding and excellent.  The orchestration is wonderful during this film's every thread of suspense.<br/><br/>Overall, THE MUMMY is one of the best blockbusters of 1999.  Nonstop thrills and surprises galore highlight this enthusiastic, fun-filled entertainment. THE MUMMY has lots of fun and excitement.  The only flaw that prevents this film from being a full fledged four star movie is its occasional lapses in credibility and coherence.  At times, this film is extremely ludicrous, but who cares, its fanatically fun to watch.  Genre fans, take note.<br/><br/>Remember, you cannot keep the dead buried forever...<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2 out of ****."

It even contains a bit of Ancient Egypt at the beginning and Seti I.<br/><br/>This film is not one of those where it gets good near the end, this film is amazing from the very beginning.

","This film is definitely one of my favourites.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser did a brilliant job as Rick, he was obviously cut out for the action adventure types, managing not to take himself to seriously but still play a character who isn't just in there for comic effect. Rachel Weisz's Evy undergoes a big transformation over the film, going from nervous librarian to brave mummy-killer, yet still doing the whole thing with a ladylike dignity and propriety, and is a believable heroine, whilst John Hannah is funny and the right amount of annoying as the gambling older brother Jonathan, providing comic relief and helping the plot along. Beni, the annoying, 'friend' of Rick's from the Foreigh Legion also offers us laughs, whilst still being frustrating and almost creepy.<br/><br/>The other characters in the film also live up to expectation, with Arnold Vosloo's performance as Imhotep both frightening and intriguing, and provide a film which is both exciting and humorous, mixing the right amount of 'horror' with laughs and action. The special effects of the film were strikingly amazing, and painted a near-believable picture of a mummy out for revenge."

","If you liked the original Mummy, then this is probably not the movie for you. This is more like Indiana Jones series. Since I did enjoy both, I found myself not disappointed. I loved the action, history, adventure, and a little bit of romance thrown in. Even a bit of comedy. To me the movie moved fast enough to be interesting but not so much so that I couldn't keep up and enjoy the other aspects. I absolutely loved the special effects. No expense were spared. The cast seemed to enjoy each others company which made everything even better for the viewer. I was taken on a ride through Egypt and was not disappointed.

","To remake The Mummy in the style of Indiana Jones but with a humorous edge was a stroke of genius, and it is executed very well in this movie.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser nominally heads a cast who all perform very well, but Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep hits the number one spot as far as I'm concerned (although I have a distinct soft spot, if that's the right expression, for Patricia Velasquez' gold painted costume as Anck Su Namun.<br/><br/>The action practically never lets up, especially in the last 40 minutes or so, and his helped along by equal quantities of wisecracks and special effects.

Brendan Fraser is really good in it, I don't think I have seen a movie of his before and he was perfect in this role as a droll man of action. My favorite aspect is how the director deliberately plays the movie for laughs and is winking at the audience with some of the lines. Like when Brendan Fraser says in reply to what should they do next - ""We have to rescue the damsel in distress and save the world"". I loved that. This movie is just plain fun and actually has some really funny moments as well.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" doesn't take itself seriously and knows that its just an entertaining comedy adventure and plays to this with no pretensions. The horror parts are all in good fun and aren't meant to be scary, this is a perfect film for families. An old fashioned movie that knows what it is and delivers on what it promises. I rate this highly because movies like this seem rare for some reason and I wish directors of today would take a look at this movie and make some more in this style."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","9","10","6 May 2007"," Good simple entertainment.
","At the time of its release, both the public and critics were screaming and shouting that this movie for being to much of an Indiana Jones wannabe. Now that this storm has settled down, I hope that more people will be able to take this movie for what it is; pure simple entertainment.<br/><br/>This is certainly a movie that entertains. It's clean and simple and makes no attempt in putting in any realism or much originality for that matter.<br/><br/>It's obvious that Stephen Sommers, just like with his other movie ""Van Helsing"", was attempting to revive the old adventure genre from the '30's/'40's. And just as with ""Van Helsing"" was the case, it doesn't do this very successfully. Modern movie-making and '30's/'40's adventurous storytelling just don't go together well anymore. The movie is perhaps more of a spoof than an homage at times. And although I certainly enjoy and admire Stephen Sommers attempts, I just don't think these sort of movies will ever make a large impact, or revive the genre from the old days. But I certainly wouldn't mind seeing more simple big blockbuster movies from Stephen Sommers in the future.<br/><br/>The movie is loosely and I mean very loosely based on the 1932 ""The Mummy"", starring Boris Karloff in the title role. The movie mostly chooses its own approach and simply uses the concept of the mummy for an overblown entertaining movie with a simple story.<br/><br/>But entertaining this movie surely is. The movie is filled with fun characters, lots of over-the-top action and a perfectly adventurous feeling all over it, due to the movie its settings and traveling elements.<br/><br/>The characters are perhaps the foremost reason why the movie works out so entertaining. All of the characters are extremely simple and stereotypical but that works really well for such a movie like this one, that obviously doesn't take itself too serious. On top of that the movie is also really well cast. It was the movie that introduced the world to Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo, though his career never really got off the ground. Brendan Fraser shows how well he can handle the comical sequences but he also is convincing as the action hero of the movie, mainly because he has the right looks for it. Rachel Weisz plays a more light and naive kind of role and it actually is hard to believe that she is mostly playing now more demanding roles in movies such as ""Constant Gardener"" and ""The Fountain"". John Hannah is perfect as the more comical sidekick of the movie and also Arnold Vosloo impresses as the villainous mummy. Also the supporting roles of the movie are very entertaining, such as the stereotypical cowboy-type Americans and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni, who also provides some comical notes. The characters are also made more entertaining by some fine and fun written dialog.<br/><br/>But there isn't much else to the script really. The movie purely is an excuses to show off some new special effects and let the mummy cause all kind of mayhem across Egypt. Yes, its incredibly simple but perhaps also all the more entertaining because of that.<br/><br/>The sequences with the movie definitely are the highlights of the movie, as he unleashes all the biblical plagues across Egypt. The special effects are convincingly looking for the mummy and his neat tricks, though it's definitely true that by todays standards the effects are all quite slightly below average.<br/><br/>The settings of the movie are nice, though some are obviously fake, and they help to give the movie its adventurous feeling. The movie obviously had an high budget and it shows in its action sequences and special effects. The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is also fine and truly uplifts the movie. Jerry Goldsmith has made a couple of epic scores for some not so epic movies.<br/><br/>Good simple quality entertainment.

"Spondonman","8","5","5","1 February 2015"," Fun pharaoh tale
","This has been shown by UK ITV so many times over the years that apparently similarly with the many other regular viewers it has become one of my comfort films to see repeatedly. A night with Die Hard, Where Eagles Dare, The Guns Of Navorone, Stargate, Time Machine and The Mummy all on TV would be a night of terrible clashes.<br/><br/>Starting in 1290 BC in Egypt with a ""very naughty"" priest mummified alive it moves on to AD 1923 with a wise cracking male American archaeologist meeting up with a dotty female British one and her lily-livered brother to go on a jovial quest for an ancient tomb. Together with a jovial rival digging party they manage to unleash the forces of Darkness by awakening the less than jovial Mummy to bring plague and death. I hope Evie was happy with all the carnage her impetuous reading of the incantation from the Book brought down on thousands of hapless heads. The varied mayhem ensuing meted on the just and the unjust is sometimes horrific sometimes slapstick – probably kids today think the heartlessly graphic imagery laughable, but me, I'm easily horrified. However ultimately, it's a fast and fun adventure yarn for kids and adults alike with an interesting plot but with plot holes as gaping as Imhotep's gob, taken relentlessly and with panache to a noisy conclusion. The gags fall thick and fast too; it was Brendan Fraser's finest film and although Rachel Weisz has done better things they really made a charming screwball couple – without them sparking it would have been a completely different film. And I wouldn't have seen it so often either. If Arnold Vosloo lives to be 2000 years old he will probably never top his characterisation of the ancient baddie in here. So with some gruesome cgi cartoonery moments not for the squeamish but also with plenty of solid nonsense entertainment for the hardened majority there's something in here for nearly every mortal."

"bowmanblue","8","5","5","8 January 2015"," Fun, fun, fun
","Okay, before I begin the review proper, I must warn you that I'm probably going to be using the word 'fun' a lot to describe 'The Mummy.' Because that's all it is – fun. A lot of people liken it to the Indiana Jones movies and I can see where they're coming from. Then again, an equally high proportion of the audience detests how the two movies are likened to each other. No, I'm certainly not saying that The Mummy is anywhere near as good as the Jones trilogy (notice how I'm leaving out the Crystal Skull out of that statement!), but it is similar.<br/><br/>The Mummy is one of those 'family fun' kind of movies – an adventure which should most likely be screened on a Saturday afternoon for everyone to cheer along to. Brendan Fraser takes the lead and is at his best when he's acting big and dumb, but, in doing so, he's also completely lovable and easy to root for. Rachel Weisz is his 'love interest' and, apart from being able to read/speak the ancient texts, doesn't do that much for the portrayal of women in cinema, as she spends much of her time in need of rescue (you'll have to watch the sequel if you want to see her kicking some a$$!). John Hannah is her on-screen brother and he's the main 'comic relief' of the film – a part which sometimes goes horribly wrong if it's handled incorrectly. However, fortunately, despite being the coward of the bunch, he's funny enough not to be annoying (and even fires a gun or two near the end if you watch closely).<br/><br/>So, our blundering trio of heroes only go and wake up an ancient mummy when they're raiding a tomb in Egypt. And he's not happy. Not only does he want to 'borrow' the bodily parts of those who woke him up, but he also wants to take over the world – typical, huh? The creature itself is actually CGI for the most part. I guess they couldn't get an actor who was decomposing to play the part. However, when he's fully formed, he's played by Arnold Vosloo, who does the job to act menacing (even when he doesn't say a word of English).<br/><br/>So, expect gun fights, undead creatures chasing our heroes, the odd car chase and pretty much everything else you'd come to find in a PG action/adventure movie. Yes, nothing here is that new, but when something's handled correctly that doesn't matter. It's still a fun a film that should please everyone. Basically, there are two ways of watching The Mummy – you can either nitpick the whole thing and pull it apart, or you can simply gloss over any of the plot holes and simply enjoy it from what it is – the filmic equivalent of Brendan Fraser himself – big, dumb, silly fun, fun, fun."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","5","5","31 May 2011"," It's not horror you know - it's just real good family fun.
","The Mummy is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also co-writes the screenplay with John L. Balderston. It stars Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor. Jerry Goldsmith scores the music and cinematography is by Adrian Biddle. Plot sees Fraser as ex-Foreign Legionnaire adventurer Rick O'Connell, who teams up with Egyptologist Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz) and her cowardly brother Jonathan (Hannah), to try and stave off the apocalypse born out of the unleashing of the mummified remains of High Priest Imhotep (Vosloo).<br/><br/>It's true to say that ""Indiana Jones"" raised the bar for action/adventure films in the modern era, the kind involving treasure, artifacts and mystical perils. It's arguably true enough to say that with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the standard has been set so high it's unlikely to be bettered. There's been a number of similar films to have come along post ""Indiana Jones"", films that have one thing in common, that the critics are scornful towards them whilst the box office has kerchinged with the sound of cash being spent by the cinema going public. ""The Mummy"" is one such movie. Universal rework their own 1930's creeper to deliver a high energy, effects laden adventure full of wit, stunts and eye candy fun. Yes it's ""Indiana Jones"" lite, but so what? We may be lacking an intellectual script, but for sheer guts, construction of set-pieces and interesting story, this delivers wholesome family entertainment. Cast are fine, Fraser comfortably files in for square jawed heroics and Weisz is suitably posh, spunky and sexy. Hannah revels in playing a wastrel type, while Arnold Vosloo is enjoying himself greatly. However it's ultimately the effects that win out, explosive and eye poppingly enjoyable, Sommers and his team have not pulled any punches in their willingness to entertain all the adventure film loving family. 7.5/10"

","This is blockbuster entertainment at its finest: Not too complicated but not overly simplistic, a solid script with snappy one-liners, terrific special effects that still look good even twenty years later, and perfectly cast with the right actors. Brendan Fraser makes for a great leading man and Rachel Weisz is a real discovery here, while supporting players John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor seem to be having the time of their lives. The movie also takes the central elements of the 1932 Universal monster classic and adapts them from horror to adventure (with some horror elements surviving and being surprisingly effective), resulting in a crowd-pleaser that has stood the test of time."

","The Mummy is an enjoyable movie that somehow has the nostalgic atmosphere of the movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The supporting actors are charming and funny (especially Rachel Weisz and Brendan Fraser). This movie is not perfect; it has several plot holes, isn't very historically or artistically accurate, and the ""horror"" scenes are more laughable than scary. However, it's not supposed to be taken very seriously anyways, more to be watched for some Indiana Jones-like pretenseless fun, preferably with some friends while drinking from a mug of hot chocolate. Really the only big thing I have to say against it is that the marketing made the film look more serious or horror-like than it really was."

It's got Egypt, it's got action, it's got adventure, some funnies, and lots of Indiana Jones-styled thrills.

Still, many of my friends and acquaintances couldn't stand this film because of him, but this is one of my favorite underrated films. This and its sequel.

This is because I knew it wasn't meant to be taken seriously like Indiana Jones with that said it is a blast that also throws you curves I didn't expect. It kept me guessing and intrigued. A film that does it's job very well with a mixture of horror and comedy and a sense of adventure that feels very Indiana Jones-ish. And the acting isn't too bad either but the best performances were from Rachel Weisz as Evelyn and Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni.

Imhotep is more of a plague, pox, locust, scorpion, sandstorm type of guy, someone for whom the kittenish tete-a-tetes between Rick and Evelyn hold no charm. <br/><br/>Oded Fehr and John Hannah come on screen in strong supporting performances to help Rick and Evelyn avoid Imhotep's wrath. <br/><br/>The entirety of the film has an old-timey Saturday matinée feel to it, and although it doesn't rise to the level of a blockbuster summer feature, you could describe it to a novice as perhaps the best B movie of cinema's modern era. <br/><br/>Much of the film's core appeal goes back to the spirited acting Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz supply, and to their significant chemistry together. Although romance must take a back seat to danger in an archaeology adventure flick, it bears noting that their chemistry as a couple is decidedly more compelling than the Indy and Marian pairing in ""Raiders."" As Raiders is the superior film, that is saying an awful lot about The Mummy's likability quotient, which is high."
"Rohmega","8","4","4","26 January 2015"," Good fun action adventure Film with superb special effects
","**** MILD SPOILERS **** <br/><br/>The Mummy is one of the most fun and entertaining good action adventure horror films that can be seen over and over again. This film is best described by the word ""fun"", there isn't much not to like and the film is overall well put together. The films starts out with a very promising layout of ancient Egypt in the time of Pharaoh Seti I. The special effects shown are very good and are far better than ""normal"" blockbusters of that time, the sequel, The Mummy Returns (2001), has far worse special effects, but is still an entertaining watch. The acting starts out a bit weak and the delivery is not too convincing for the setup of the story, luckily, the rest of the film improves greatly on this. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz gave a good performance and Brendan Fraser as O'Connel just works. The comic relief is given by Kevin O'Connor as Beni and John Hannah as Jonathan, who both do an excellent job. O'Connor's role in aiding Imhotep is also very refreshing from the generic ""funny guy"" who is ""just there"", he has a purpose and never feels unneeded. One of the most hilarious scenes is when Beni tries to complement Imhotep on making a giant wall of sand to kill O'Connel. ""I love this whole sand trick... it was beautiful... bastard"", I laugh every time I see this scene, especially since Fraser was perplexed they kept that scene in the Film. <br/><br/>The action plays a very important role in The Mummy and refreshingly, it's done well and the camera-work is smooth and the editing doesn't dull the experience. Many blockbusters today make the mistake of editing too much, making a cut at the moment of impact, taking all the energy out of it. In The mummy, the camera lets you see when a hit is a hit without shaking the camera like a little child who has to get a flu-shot. The camera angles are wide and there is never annoying zoom-ins or weird close-up-and-then-pan-to-more-action-shots. Everything is just good and solid. <br/><br/>What makes this movie timeless, however unintuitive, are the special effects. Watching it, even in 2015, will not make you look at some effects and laugh about how bad they are. There are few classics that hold up this well to time. The half ""juicy"" (funny scene) mummy is ever as convincing and terrifying now as it was back then, a very impressive feat., It isn't intrusive or overdone, at the same time, the special effects are not the only thing that hold this movie up to being a very good experience. The music is very well done and is perfect for creating the atmosphere which makes this Films believable and exciting. <br/><br/>Watching the Film with Brendan Fraser's commentary is also a must, it makes re-watching the Film refreshing and it makes you laugh at even more scenes because you will remember Fraser's commentary the nth time you watch it. <br/><br/>The Mummy is a good Film, it knows what it is and is not afraid to sometimes mock itself. A must watch for when you want to see a very entertaining and excellent Film. Don't nit-pick every aspect of the movie and then, even if you have seen it 10 times before, it remains one of the best action Films in the action/adventure genre. Don't expect it to be a story without plot holes and just sit back and enjoy."

","This version of The Mummy (one of the several titles within film lore that seems to have been made and remade for decades) is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a modern adaptation of an old horror classic, especially given the types of films that are released these days. The action and special effects of the 1932 classic have been massively increased, and the new film turns more to shocking special effects, often cheesy comic relief, and sparkling scenery, away from the slow, creeping tension of the original. As a result, we get a fast moving feature that places a lot of emphasis on its special effects and it's good-looking stars. Thankfully, the movie knows when to laugh at itself, but it trips because it doesn't know when to stop.<br/><br/>The film starts roughly 3000 years in the past, with the Egyptian priest Imhotep being put to a rather vicious death for getting a little too friendly with the Pharaoh's mistress. Naturally, he is mummified alive, sealed in a coffin with a lot of flesh-eating beetles (the sounds of which make up some of the creepiest stuff in the whole movie), only to be accidentally resurrected by a lot of bounty hunters a few millennia later. This is where the cast comes in, Rick (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah).<br/><br/>Rick is the hero of the movie, the guy who has been there and done it all and just wants to get his money and get out. He's kind of like a cross between the single-mindedness of Han Solo, the bad one-liners of James Bond, and the adventure experience of Indiana Jones, except that he comes across more as a muddy conglomeration of characters like those rather than an original character of his own. He goes through his part upset by the fact that other people seem to be constantly be holding him back from some faraway goal, the importance of which they can probably never be expected to understand. <br/><br/>Evelyn is there mainly with scientific interest (until she meets the hottie hero and romance is added to her To Do list) and her brother Jonathan is there for pure financial gain, as is the movie's director and crew and production team. There is also a tagalong character named Beni who I can only satisfactorily describe as a greedy rat, someone you would expect to meet on the wet streets of New York in the 1940s or something. He is a constant double-crosser who never has anyone's but his own best interest in mind, and so naturally ends up working for the resurrected Imhotep. His weird eye-makeup and pathetically whiny little voice make him a perfect candidate for the throwaway antagonist, who Rick tries vainly to save in a climactic scene near the end of the film. <br/><br/>The interesting thing about the plot comes up when you consider when exactly Imhotep became the bad guy. Really, all he did was fall in love with the wrong girl, and then when he was brought back to life, obviously he wanted to bring her back, too. One of the first things that I learned in film studies is that the audience should know as soon as possible whether they are meant to like or dislike a character, because first impressions are difficult to overcome. With that in mind then, when exactly was it that he went from the poor love-struck protagonist from the first act of the film to the monstrous antagonist during the rest of the movie?<br/><br/>My best theory is that first and foremost, he's killing people to bring himself and his love back to life. Granted, more killing would not justify the death of himself or of his loved one, Anck Su Namun, but considering the fact that all he did was fall in love and also considering the way that he was put to death, his reaction upon achieving life once more becomes a little more understandable. Second, what exactly does a resurrected protagonist look like? I must admit that there is something a little too daunting about trying to come up with a likable mummy, but Imhotep is certainly a man who has seen more than his share of suffering.<br/><br/>The special effects are hugely impressive despite the fact that they are obviously special effects (the art of invisibility was not achieved very well here). When Imhotep is slowly regenerating, there are scenes showing his body and face that are impressive in their spectacle, but not impressive in not looking animated. As a whole, The Mummy is exactly what you might expect it to be, except that it was released amidst so much excitement and hype that it really should have taken itself more seriously and been more of a thinking film. It would have, under those circumstances, been immensely more respectable and might have joined its predecessor as a movie classic. It is a successful update of the Mummy theme (which has become almost a genre in itself), but there is a lot of fluff in the film that simply doesn't belong."

Brendan Fraser in his prime is a dream and as much as I'd like to say that this is a ""find the treasure get the girl"" film, our lead actress is so independent in her drive. Jonathan is fun, there is a lot of friendly banter and the plot revolving around the mummy is well done. The temple is like Indiana Jones with just the right amount of fantasy vs. ancient Egypt.

"spookyrat1","7","3","3","23 April 2019"," Change of Setting!
","There's no doubt the movie business can be an unpredictable affair at times. In 1998 Stephen Sommers wrote and directed a disaster/monster feature with fairly rich comic undertones to it. It was called Deep Rising and it tanked (despite this writer liking it) fairly spectacularly, though it has gone on over the years to achieve a degree of cult status.<br/><br/>Now for some writer.directors that commercial failure may have represented the kiss of death. But in this case, not for Stephen Sommers. A year later Universal Pictures almost doubled his budget from Deep Rising and let him go and make what was almost the same sort of film again. Go figure. At any rate their intuition proved to be correct. Sommers remake of The Mummy, turning it from a horror film into a tongue-in-cheek action adventure proved this time to be a commercial master stroke and franchise starter. Sommers and Universal had an international hit on their hands.<br/><br/>What changed? Superficially heaps, but intrinsically, not a great deal. Both films deal with monsters, The Mummy less mysteriously. The obvious differences are the settings. Deep Rising is water-bound; largely set on a disaster-afflicted cruise liner amidst a storm tossed ocean. Being set in the burning sands of the Eygptian desert (with Morocco substituting), The Mummy does appear worlds apart.<br/><br/>But really Sommers just cleverly tinkers with his Deep Rising template, refines a few odds and ends and voila! ... finds out he has a hit on his hands.<br/><br/>The Mummy ramps up the humour quotient and eases back a little on the gore/horror elements of Deep Rising. Kevin J. O'Connor moves from being a comic side kick in DR to being a comic villain in TM. John Hannah, comfortably fits into the comical shoes of Jonathan Carnahan, the new bumbling side kick. Arguably the main reason for the The Mummy's success lies in the lead pairing of Brendon Fraser and Rachel Weisz. They have real onscreen chemistry and Weisz, as airy, but also feisty and smart librarian Evelyn Carnahan, proves she has the comedic talents to match those, we already knew of Fraser. Unlike Deep Rising, where the leads didn't meet up till the second half, Sommers wisely ensures this time that Fraser and Weisz team up early in the film, so we can all more fully enjoy those rom-com sparks flying.<br/><br/>About the only character actually keeping a straight face and playing an orthodox but very convincing villain, is South African stage actor Arnold Vosloo who is Imhotep, The Mummy, aided in his role with some well executed CGI. effects.<br/><br/>The Mummy is fast-paced from beginning to end, provides plenty of thrills, spills and laughs along the way, along with more than a touch of romance. It's lot of fun, quite charming and never pretentious. But ultimately, it reminded me of the fine movie lines that exist between hits and misses."
"supimsatan","8","3","3","20 August 2017"," Still great in 2017
","Amazingly a lot of action, adventure and some fun in it!<br/><br/>From beginning to end, The Mummy is very simple, and not one second of it is incomprehensible to a young audience member. The pacing is great; the buildup to the resurrection is actually a great success, and the adventures that ensue are horrifying, hilarious, and adventurous. Brendan Frasier gives a very nice performance as Rick O'Connell, and Rachael Weisz is just as good as Evey. For what he's given, Arnold Vosloo is very menacing as Imhotep, and Oded Fehr's character could have used more screen time to allow us to appreciate him more -- though plenty of that is in the second. The action flows, and is shot very well. The special effects are really good, and I don't think there has ever been a cooler-looking mummy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is decent enough to warrant a buy, though not nearly as sweeping as it could have been, it's still a decent collection of music"

"sherbetsaucers","7","3","3","6 February 2007"," You Call Him Dr Jones, Maybe?
","This is less a remake and more a re-imagining of the original Mummy movie. Where as the Boris Karloff version is pretty much an out and out 1930's horror, this is very much an action adventure in the style of Indiana Jones, a movie that The Mummy cannot help being compared to.<br/><br/>Much like Indiana Jones it harks back to the Saturday matinées of years gone by, but with a budget. The plot is, of course, simple. Ancient evil lovable rogue race against time comedy characters yadda yadda yadda. Let's be frank; this is standard adventure stuff, but here it is done well. Very well.<br/><br/>What this movie excels in is set scenes. Considering that this is an action flick it of course should be a given but let's be honest, it isn't always. From a wonderful opening sequence set in the past we have a fantastic 'Time Passes' effect to a bunch of Legionnaires facing off against the approaching Arab hordes. This pretty much sets the tone for the whole movie. From biplanes to river boat battles, this movie has everything you could really ask for. The highlight being a Harryhausen tribute with Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell battling re-animated mummies. How he manages to look so dashing with his tongue stuck so firmly in his cheek I'll never know.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the true strength of this movie, the humour. Again, much like Indiana Jones, The Mummy is a movie that is prepared to not take itself too seriously, but without verging into the overly camp, a trick that writer/director Summers failed to pull off with Van Helsing.. However the humour in The Mummy is even more pronounced than with Jones. Kevin J. O'Connor and Omid Djalili both create fantastic comedy side-kick types that manage to actually be funny, as opposed to just grating. But even the main stars show a flair for comedy. John Hannah's one line deliveries are bang on and Fraser, who has already played the comic role in movies such as George of the Jungle and California Man has a fantastic sense of timing. However the big 'comedy surprise' for me with this movie is the Leading Lady; (with this kind of movie, that term just feels right) Rachel Weisz. Her reactions to the insanity around her are fantastic, and she also provides us with one of the biggest laughs in the film as she single handedly destroys a library in a moment reminiscent of any number Howard Shore or Buster Keaton movies.<br/><br/>This movie is wonderful and, while some of the scenes may be frightening for young children, I think it is great fun for all the family."
"dieall","Null","5","6","8 December 2015"," It's a classic!
","The Mummy (1999) The Mummy (1999) is an action adventure movie directed by Stephen Sommers. Even though The Mummy follows a typical plot like many other action adventure movies, it has something different that appeals to audiences. Based on Egyptian myth, this movie portrays walking mummies, unstoppable Egyptian curses, and mysterious Egypt's historical sites with wonderful computer graphics and sophisticated special effects. The movie begins in ancient Egypt. When high priest called Imhotep (Amold Vosloo) killed pharaoh Seti the first because of his relationship with the pharaoh's mistress. When the pharaoh's bodyguard caught Imhotep, they mummified him alive with a desperate curse and buried him under the city of the dead. 3000 years later in 1923, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), who works at Cairo library as a librarian, is interested in an ancient Egyptian magical book of resurrection. To find the book, she hires Rick (Brenden Fraser), who is an American soldier, and they take a trip together through the Sahara desert. At the end of the trip, they finally find and read the book. They don't know what will happen after reading the book. They just release Imhotep from the cruel curse. In the movie, almost every action scene, such as gunfights and chase scenes, are filmed using computer graphics and special effects. It is because Imhotep is a perfect source of computer graphic and special effects since he is an undead mummy and has supernatural abilities. It's truly amazing that Imhotep completes his body as he eats men alive and makes gigantic sand storm in the middle of the desert. Moreover, the mysterious Egyptian historical site, where the action scenes are filmed, makes The Mummy even more thrilling. There are many kinds of deadly traps in the set, such as falling ceiling, pressurized acid, and man eating beetles, so audience can enjoy the thrill of near misses. The director of The Mummy effectively combined Egyptian myth with computer graphics and special effects. That's why he can successfully create the strongest mummy in the movie and he was able to make this movie special compared to other movies. This movie will please anyone who is sick of watching ordinary action movies."

It felt like the perfect movie to me and it is definitely my number one favorite. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was just very interesting to see everything. I especially loved the scripting and the casting. Brendan and Rachel worked very well together."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","5","6","14 January 2012"," My Favorite Fraser Franchise
","Director Stephen Sommers' version of the horror classic, The Mummy (1932), has been one of Universal's most successful franchises. It's also because of this that got Stephen Sommers famous. It also made a slew of other celebrities famous as well. And although it does not play like an Indiana Jones film, it pays homage to archaeologists and the magic within old architecture. Not mention this film made two more sequels.<br/><br/>Starring in this film is Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy called Imhotep. This is the first film that I witnessed Arnold Vosloo and then later on I realized he also played in two other sequels of Sam Raimi's Darkman (1990) series, which I thought he played really well. Brendan Fraser is not one of my top favorite actors but I do like the way he works in these kinds of films. I enjoyed his performance in Looney Tunes: Back In Action (2003), but I liked him even more in this film. The character of Fraser, Rick O'Connell has serious personality but in a goofy fashion. The rest of the characters in this film act the same way. Rachel Weisz's character, Evelyn can be klutzy at times and so is her nitwit brother Jonathan played by John Hannah.<br/><br/>The goofiness is what's good about this movie. The actors know their characters are silly and that makes it funny to watch. The stupidest person of all in this film is Jonathan. Truly, he does not know what he's doing and in the end, he's never satisfied; shows you how grateful he is to be alive (after all he's been through). What also works great is the dialog. So much of it is serious but in such an indirect way that it doesn't come off as serious. I guess this was the idea of Sommers' mummy film. He wanted the audience to enjoy it with some decent action and funny one liners,...and it worked.<br/><br/>The Mummy has a mix of multiple genres because how the screenplay is set up. Arnold Vosloo can play a pretty scary mummy; little kids will be terrified by him. The whole undead idea is the horror aspect. As for the silliness, that's the comedy aspect. The action is great in this film too. Most of it using firearms but it does involve an interesting flight sequence and the finale is really fun to watch. Seeing O'Connell fight off a slew of undead Egyptian guards. Bring it on! Or as O'Connell said sarcastically, ""This just keeps getting better and better"". Because 1999 was the time where special effects were really starting to get high- tech, this movie has some really nice visuals. Also the music is great which Jerry Goldsmith composed. I enjoyed this film very much and it really has a good reputation although less than half of critics liked it. <br/><br/>Besides having a villain with the same name, this mummy movie is nothing like the original classic from 1932. What makes it different is Stephen Sommers' direction of abandoning the slow droning tone and mostly replacing it with comedy, action and some shades of horror."
"Kittiko","10","6","8","27 May 2010"," The Curse of an Addicting Action Film.
","The first time I saw 'The Mummy', I was terrified. Of course, I was only 9 years old then (and very much a chicken obviously). Now that I am 20 years old and have seen the film without a hint of terror, I'm very much glad I got over my childish fear of flesh-eating bugs and sat through this amazing movie's entire length. It's too good a film not to watch.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in ancient Egyptian times, sometime around 2000 years B.C. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is the trusted High Priest to Pharaoh Seti I, but he's got a thing for Seti's soon-to-be wife, Anck-Su-Namon (Patricia Velasquez). They have an affair behind the Pharaoh's back and plot to take over the rule with a devious, murderous ambition. When Anck kills herself after she and the High Priest brazenly kill Seti, Imhotep tries to resurrect his love, only to be captured by Pharaoh's watchdogs, the Med-jai. Imhotep is mummified alive, the victim of the dreaded Hom-Dai, and sealed up inside the base of an Anubis statue in Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead. Anyone who disturbs him risks releasing his wrath on the world.<br/><br/>Flashforward to Cairo, Egypt in 1926, and we have librarian Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her booze-loving brother Jonathan (John Hannah). They happen upon a map that leads to the fabled Hamunaptra, which is hidden in a 'puzzle box' that Jonathan swipes off an unsuspecting American. This American is Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), an ex-legionnaire who has been locked up in a Cairo prison for 3 yearsand someone who just happens to have been to Hamunaptra. Evelyn pays for O'Connell's release, and she convinces him to take her and Jonathan to the City of the Dead. After all, it could be the find of the century! The three of them, along with O'Connell's former buddy Beni (Kevin O'Connor) leading his own party of 3 rowdy American cowboys, excavate through the City and unfortunately happen upon Imhotep's tomb. At the same time, the American tomb raiders and their snooty Egyptologist Dr. Chamberlin find the famous and powerful Black Book of the Dead, which if read correctly will bring the dead to life. Evelyn sneaks it away from Chamberlin and reads itraising Imhotep from the grave and unleashing his fury. It's now a life or death struggle as the unfortunate individuals try to escape Imhotep's vehemence. I'll let you find out for yourself what happens, should you so choose to watch the movie.<br/><br/>This is one action movie that I could watch over and over. The dialogue, the costumes, the music, I pretty much love everything about this movie. I'm very big into Egyptian mythology, so there's one more reason why I adore this film. Even though the real Imhotep wasn't a homicidal, back-stabbing High Priest to Seti (he was actually an engineer and architect) and the Book of the Dead isn't really a book at all (rather, it is a set of papyrus scrolls laid to rest with each mummified individual), the story behind this particular Imhotep really sucked you into him. The other characters are excellent as well. I think Evelyn is my favorite movie heroine: she's got brains and a little brawn behind her, and she's not a stereotypical damsel-in-distress or sword-wielding assassin chick. She carries herself well. Jonathan is a riot, Rick is the kind of guy you would love to have as a body guard, and Imhotep himself is the most diabolical former priest to ever be resurrected. My personal favorites are the Americans: Daniels, Henderson and Burns, Daniels being my favorite of them all (Corey Johnson is one of my 5 favorite actors). Beni adds the right amount of comic relief and Jonathan Hyde's Chamberlin is perfect for the obnoxious, know-it-all professor. The plot's easy to follow, and the special effects are pretty damn good.<br/><br/>There's nothing better than a good action movie, and 'The Mummy' is definitely among the best. I highly recommend seeing it (and its sequel, one of the few sequels I actually like). It's alright if you know nothing of Egypt and its rich, mythological past; once you get sucked in, you won't want to be pulled out.<br/><br/>My grade: A+, 10/10"

","The Mummy is an action-adventure film in the vein of classics such as Raiders of The Last Ark and The Goonies. It is a movie filled with moments scary enough to make your skin crawl, but in equal amounts moments that JUST make your heart warm. The chemistry between the cast is amazing, especially between the hunky leading actor Brendan Fraser and the ever beautiful Rachel Weisz, who both give an outstanding performance that carries the movie forward as an adventure film with a lot of heart for the whole family. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie is great, in no small part thanks to director Stephen Sommers, who is also in charge of the screenplay. You really feel like you are along for the adventure, as opposed to just observing it from a distance, as you witness the two leading characters, played by Fraser and Weisz respectively, go from disliking each-other to by the end of the movie being smitten with each-other, brought together by the difficulties faced during the resurrected mummy Imhotep's relentless pursuit to destroy them.<br/><br/>All in all it is a movie you JUST have to see if you're an adventure film enthusiast, which if you aren't, what are you doing?

","Don't get me wrong, we have had lots of great movies since '99, but I really feel that this is the last one where it was just 10 for 10 great. And it was a great way to end the 90's, which I still believe to be one of the best movie decades; we knew how to make great movies and we knew how to make great trailers for those great movies--not just rapidly flashing scenes with drums and clashing and building violins, but REAL trailers edited to perfection with great music.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" just packs it all; from Adventure to Horror to Fantasy to Drama to Comedy, and in my humble opinion, it succeeds superbly in all five genres. It is just such a FUN movie! The sites (and sights), the sound design, the CGI (while I won't say it's perfect), and, of course, Jerry Goldsmith's masterpiece of a score which can take Alan Silvestri's for ""The Mummy Returns"" to the cleaners any day of the week.<br/><br/>While ""The Mummy"" was a blockbuster, it is sadly one of those unappreciated movies. Shortly after its release is when movies began to take a turn for the worse and become darker, and for what ever crackbutt reason, darker is what the American Audience wants. Audiences just want movies where everyone dies (a lot of the time including the hero(es)), the music is heavily synthesized, and the plot is simplistic.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" is an epic adventure from beginning to end. And I can only hope that our movies return to this movie-type some day soon. While I do like ""The Mummy Returns"", it was a little too silly for me. And ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""? No comment. The first one just captures the fun-ness that movies are SUPPOSED to be; a movie that grabs you out of your world so you almost feel as if you're IN the movie (he said, at the risk of sounding either cheezy or loony), very much in the tradition of ""Jurassic Park"" and its sequel.<br/><br/>It's just truly a classic, and will hopefully remain so long enough to see a day when it is appreciated again."

O'Connor is very effective as the weasel Benni!, perhaps a little too well, he was so convincing!. Oded Fehr is great here as Ardeth, he was cool, and likable i dug his part. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5"
"MoonwalkerFairy","10","4","5","8 May 2004"," The hidden city of Hamunaptra sets the scene to unleash the curses of Egypt and re-awaken The Mummy.
","An action packed film, that echoes the greatness of Indiana Jones.  Sadly it is however not quite as good.  It is packed with references to the doomed curses of Egypt and the ancient scripts, very well thought out and very entertaining. Brenden Fraiser plays the part of the hero brilliantly and looks the part with his unshaven predatorial look!  Rachel Weisz also has the damsel in distress role down to an art. The film tells the tales of the hidden city of Hamunaptra, where rumour has it that the ancient scripts can be read out to unleash the power of the Mummy - a man murdered for having an affair with the emporers wife, but he escaped first and cast a curse which would enable him and his love to awaken from the dead in the bodies of mortals in years to come.  It just so happened that it took 3,000 years before they were re-awakened, so hes pretty bitter!!"

","I love this movie! It is funny, but not ridiculuous. It is amusing and exciting. The colours are fantastic and the action is breath-taking. I've seen it five times in the cinema. The actors are excellent, they really identify with their characters. What I really hate, is ""The Mummy Returns"". It is just ridiculuous and nothing else. And I'm not alone. Everybody who has seen ""The Mummy"" and liked it, despises the second part. You have to watch ""The Mummy"" a few times to discover all the gags and hidden elements. And it's worth seeing them. So, just try it."

","I have looked at all the comments of this film the good and the bad, and there are over 700 of them.<br/><br/>It was the best film of the year, fantastic special effect by John Berton and ILM, great direction and stunt work, and all the actors gave they're charactors credability, expecially Kevin j O'Conner and Arnold Vosloo, they were very good at being the baddies. Brendon Frasier as the hero brought the quality of an action man to the film, as did Oded Frer, and  Rachel was the best choice for a heroine,the right mix of brains and dissiness. I also liked the ""tounge in cheek"" humour which gave it a lift between the scares.<br/><br/>To those of you who wote such negative things ""get a life"". This was entertainment at its best, acton, adventure, romance. It will become a classic and stand the test of time, like the old one has and still does.<br/><br/>

The last few years, Simon Crane has worked on the really BIG films of US & UK : GoldenEye; Saving Private Ryan; The Mummy; Titanic.

"ivo-cobra8","10","5","7","5 December 2015"," The Mummy is the best movie epic action nonstop ride!
","The Mummy (1999) is my favorite true nonstop action epic movie!!! Filled with dazzling visual effects, top-notch talent and superb storytelling. It was the second movie i went to see in the theaters in 1999 with my mom as a kid. I was just a teen than I have enjoyed this movie a lot. The first movie in 1999 I went to see in theaters was The Matrix (1999) with also my mom and I have enjoyed both of this movie. Every time I am watching it, I still enjoy it! I had no idea it was a remake of 1932 film The Mummy. I never watched movies from 1938. There were spawned 2 sequels and one prequel/spin-off film. I love and I like both of the sequels on their own way and I hate the prequel/spin-off film. ""The Mummy"" (1999) was one of the finest Fantasy action adventures of all time. For the Mummy, achieving that level of serio-comic entertainment was unprecedented, and I still do not think it has been duplicated. All the witty dialogue, near perfect script, Dr. Bey... This was a very adult movie, but also for children too, and therefore accessible at different levels. The comments by Ebert, and co. were silly at best, as we have an example of critics turning up their nose at a great film, just to be 'in', be smiled upon by the academy, etc. It was therefore a poor review, a poor appraisal by the twain: this time you should not have used them. <br/><br/>I am keep hearing that this movie is getting a reboot now with Tom Cruise in it but why? Why rebooting this movie? It is stupid! The reboot will fail, even with Tom Cruise in it and It will be rated PG-13 and It want be so good like this movie is. ""The Mummy"" is more Fantasy than Sci-Fi, and really perhaps should be classified as Fantasy Drama. Nonetheless, the rebooting of ""The Mummy"" by Stephen Sommers in 1999 would top, or near top, any list in which it is appropriately placed. ... And that ridiculous quote by Ebert & Co,, that this movie was ""the son of... the son of ... Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is sheer nonsense. This is to imply it is derivative. In a broad sense, all movies are 'derivative', and indeed so was Raiders. It does have a great amount of CGI effects, Yet there were real stages, too, I have learned: such as at Dracula's 'Ball': This was held in some Medieval Church, if I recollect accurately. I thought that the effects were good, though the viewer is perhaps surfeited with them. (...) Nonetheless, though bothering me initially, when I came to 'understand' this film, I look past it now. How much money do you want the producers and the studio to have to spend...? I thought was in perfect harmony with the plot, being grandly that of Good vs. Evil.<br/><br/>This film, and unlike his ""The Mummy"" of a few years prior, is not 'immediately accessible' and does take repeated viewings to enjoy. This due to the plot's complexity, to appreciate the humor, and to appreciate the acting. Stephen Sommers did well with this movie but did very poorly with the GI Joe movie.I think people take ""The Mummy"" remake too seriously. It has great special effects that hold up pretty well, charming performances (especially Brendon Frasier, who I'm surprised didn't become a HUGE star after that kind of leading man performance/success. I mean he was pretty much was the Christ Pratt of that era and should have had the type of career upgrade Pratt is getting now. The dialogue is hilarious and very entertaining. I mean we're not talking a classic Oscar winning film here, but an irresistibly fun blockbuster that holds up well 16 years later. <br/><br/>So the actors in this movie were good and the story including the directors were great. Everybody in this movie did a great job. This is one of the best movies ever made. It doesn't get much better than Brendan Fraser battling a 3,000 year old mummy. The action and the Special effects CGI are great. Brendan Fraser did a terrific job playing Rick' O'Connell a Legionnaire adventurer who served in the French Foreign Legion turned out a deserter and later a prisoner, he did outstanding acting performance as a bad ass action hero on the screen! Rachel Weisz as Evie Carnahan did an outstanding and a perfect job as a shy but intelligent Egyptologist. Arnold Vosloo as High Priest Imhotep and the Mummy was fantastic, he is such an underrated actor. Gosh he was even so good in Hard Target (1993) my favorite Jean-Claude Van Damme/John Woo movie. Kevin J. O'Connor as Beni Gabor a former soldier in the French Foreign Legion was just awesome and I loved his performance in the film. Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay the leader of Medjai was incredible outstanding. This movie is what it is a perfect Adventure movie a like Indiana Jones but a bit too underrated, that shouldn't have been. <br/><br/>Deep in the Egyptian desert, a handful of people searching for a long-lost treasure have just unearthed a 3,000 year old legacy of terror. I am giving this 10/10 for been entertaining summer blockbuster action/adventure/fantasy movie! The best one in the series.<br/><br/>The Mummy is a 1999 American action adventure horror film written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role as the reanimated mummy. <br/><br/>10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: Universal Pictures, Alphaville Films Starring: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Jonathan Hyde, Kevin J.

"Hussain-AL-Naseer","8","2","2","14 May 2020"," The Mummy & The Mummy Returns
","The Mummy and The Mummy Returns both are my all time favorite movies as the Cinematic experience I got with both the movies on single screen theater is just I can not forget. Both films are the visual gems and has the capability to give you a great visual experience of ancient Egypt.
Action sequences, storytelling, Cinematography, Art, Costumes , Sets and CGI effects are some of the aspects to look for.
Both the films are blended with Humor, Emotions and some thrilling moments which may bring you to the edges. Director Stephen Sommers has effortlessly done his job to keep the audience intact with his crisp direction. The Screenplay articulated well especially in the second installment as story unfolds and connects with its first installment .Never forgetting the performances which also contributed equally to make this franchise worth watching. Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connel is surely the Heart and Soul of the movie, the Hero larger then life Macho, Blunt and Brave Fraser has nailed it, he was also exceptional as a caring Father and a lovable Husband in the second installment, Rick O'Connel is the best character Bredan has ever played supported toe to toe by Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan, Arnold Vasloo as Imotep has done good job as most of his role was behind CGI but he is the proper villain we got in the movie, Patricia Velásquez, John Hannah & Oded Fehr all justified their presence and supported well to the leads.
What ruined this franchise was its third installment even Jet Li as main Antagonist couldn't save it. Rachel Weisz & director Stephen Sommers absence felt greatly and Alex as grown up is something that I didn't buy as the little Alex in second installment was Brave kid just like his father which was all lost in third installment."""

","Recently, The new movie of Tom Cruise -- The Mummy (2017) has shown in cinema. As the new start of the old series, it brings limited feeling of freshness, compared with The Mummy (1999). When I was a child, The Mummy (1999) became a nightmare of me. After watching the new movie of Tom Cruise, I really think the old one is much better than the new one. This film is very predictable in the manner in which it is carried out. The formula of hero saves the girl, hero kills the villain, and hero saves the planet is tired and old, but it will be the addition of humor, special effects, and Fraser as a brilliant action hero that will carry this movie for most viewers. You can have a look in Yidioo.com."
"Quinoa1984","6","2","2","7 June 2017"," a look back 18 years later on Stephen Sommers' big stab at Hollywood escapism
","This movie is like if you take Raiders of the Lost Ark (and other Indiana Jones movies in general, those serial-tropes) and deduct like 10,000 IQ points from it. It's *so* Raiders, but it's also still, in being true to the original 1932 film, still SO Dracula- rip-off in some ways, even down to Kevin J O'Connor (OH MY GOD NOT- HENRY_PLAINVIEW from TWWB!) playing Renfield to Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep (though Renfield crossed with Alfred Molina from Raiders- did I mention this is RAIDERS with like a lot of dumbness injected in?) It's a slam-bang action movie where half of the dialog are full-on *Movie* lines. You know the ones? <br/><br/>This is where characters, especially Brendan Fraser (who, honestly, is having the time of his life in this role), spout off a lot of clichés - Rick makes sure to say ""We're in deep trouble"" more than once, or to be ready with a line while being tossed conveniently across the room of the inside of a pyramid. And characters just do dumb thing after dumb thing, or characters appear where they shouldn't but hey gotta advance the plot... like the whole entire group of dumb American cowboys(!?) who manage to make it off of the boat that catches on fire and while we get scenic views of Fraser and Weisz and her brother going across the desert, the rest are not to be seen... until convenient.<br/><br/>Oh, Rachel Weisz, by the way, is a great thing about this movie. Really, she's the one who practically got a career off of this movie, and she is so incredibly charming and dorky (the scene where she gets drunk is a different kind of drunk scene than we get in Raiders with Marion, I should note). She may be a ""Damsel"" occasionally in distress, but she is acting Evelyn on a wavelength that gives the movie an energy and delight that helps to balance out all of the stock actors and characters surrounding her (even O'Connor, who is giving this one- note weasel his all, is that). She and Fraser have the kind of old-time Hollywood chemistry, with enough modernity, that makes the movie watchable even as it gets so.... so.... so.... so... so dumb.<br/><br/>And yet... it's entertaining. It's occasionally cheesy and haphazard - my God, does that climax where every single thing seems to come alive, usually by mistake - and I neglect to note how, despite being from old Egyptian lore (even if that's lore taken from older movies and serials), it also borrows in one giant chunk from the Evil Dead. But... well, I kept watching and not simply because I had to for an upcoming podcast.<br/><br/>PS: Spoiler -<br/><br/>about O'Connor's Beni... near the end, they really didn't know what to do with him, did they? I mean the writers; he's about ready to escape on the camel, he has a good amount of gold after getting away with being a conniving creep... but he sticks around and goes back inside, and as soon as he does we know exactly what's coming for him. The movie also goes the extra step of showing us how he meets his maker. It feels oddly cruel though, despite how slimy he's been. I almost felt sorry for him or even something close to sympathy. Isn't it enough to assume he's squashed with everything else inside the pyramid once it collapses? Like anything else here, it's overkill."

"DesertDogMedia","8","2","2","26 July 2014"," The Mummy
","Title: The Mummy<br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A group of explorers discover the lost city of Hamunaptra, they soon awaken the mummy who hunts them down one by one to assimilate their organs and bodily fluids. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: Brendan Fraser is known for his role as Rick, and his role in the franchise is what some believe to have made the movie work in the first place. Needless to say, the other movies he's been in haven't been as good as his role here. Rachel Weisz plays the Evelyn who always needs rescuing as she is the damsel in distress. John Hannah plays everyones favourite coward Jonathan, he acts like a coward and ultimately is one in this movie and we love him for it. Kevin J. O'Connor plays a similar role to John Hannah in this movie but Kevin's character of Benny will side with who ever will give him money. <br/><br/>Noticeable Camera work: The movie is great at faming up its shots, especially for scenes of torture of death, making it so you can't see it, but still grasp the feeling of what is going on. Time lapse of a couple thousand years while we are looking a the statue of Anubis. Dolly shots following the action in the first fight scene Worms eye view of the Medjai<br/><br/>Graphics: The CGI in this movie is great for its time, be it the CGI for the mummy or the scarabs, it is great. The mummy looks like it is there, the effects that have been used with the sand are convincing and make to be an amazing movie. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: The 'Book of the Dead' should be the 'Scroll of the Dead', because Ancient Egyptians didn't use books, they used scrolls only. The Roman Empire invented the book layout which is used today. Evelyn says that the scarabs ate Imhotep alive and very slowly, but every time we see them on screen, they always eat people within seconds. There were 5 canopic jars in the chest, but only 4 are used in actual mummification. Evelyn also mentions that they would take out all of the organs, this is incorrect as only the lungs, kidneys, intestines and stomach were put in canopic jars and the brain was removed and discarded. The heart and other organs were kept in. Imhotep fears cats because they are the guardians of the underworld, in actual Egyptian mythology, cats were worshiped as gods because they were connected to the goddess Bastet who was the goddess of motherhood and protection. The actual guardian of the underworld was Anubis who would guide the souls of the dead into the afterlife or the underworld. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: When I was younger, I had an ingrained fascination with Egyptology and this film was one of my all time favourites. So much so I watched this movie (Which is rated 15 for DVD) and I watched it over and over being only single digits in age at the time. So I will try and be not so bias in my review. This movie has its fair share of faults, especially when it comes to knowing about Ancient Egypt, but I would blame this more on the screen writers than anyone else. This is movie was made a year after Deep Rising, using a similar horror theme along with the actor Kevin J. O'Connor. Before this franchise, there were only mummy movies for the 'golden era' of cinema, which had the notoriously bad and some what cheesy effects that you would expect which classic monster movies, this movie made mummies cool again. This movie does have jump scares, but they are mild and are just there for the characters in the movie more than the audience."

But what I didn't understand about the movie was, didn't the guy with glasses disintegrate or something like that, instead of him disappearing? Plus, the story line was great, the special effects were sensational, and finally, the actors did better than their best. They did ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!

","This movie rocks. Brendan Frazier plays a former, probably AWOL, Foreign Legionnaire who stumbled across the famous but until now unknown, city of Hamunaptra. This occurs when his character and a real weasel of a legionnaire are fighting what turns out to be not bandits but the guardians of the city and its secrets. Frazier's character, Rick, hooks up with a rather clutsy but extremely knowledgeable person in Evy. She has a very good knowledge ancient Egypt and reads some their languages. She saves Rick just as he is about to be hung by buying he out from the greedy prison warden. The scenes on the paddle wheeler are interesting and sets up what is too come. The American adventurers are of course killed along the was as the mummy is pieced back to a body. Patricia Velasquel does a very good job as the reincarnated Anch Su Namun. She plays a stone cold bitch until towards the end when she shows her true colors and runs."
"BrickNash","10","2","2","2 June 2013"," True cinematic entertainment!
","The Mummy is without a doubt absolutely everything that embodies the term 'Hollywood'<br/><br/>What we have here is a slick, fast paced, funny and action packed film full of mystique and wonder.<br/><br/>To start with the film looks amazingly lush with it's golden hue running throughout. Everything is spot on from the lighting to the sets right down to the last dusty detail. The CGI may not be as high resolution as today's standards but it still looks absolutely tremendous and really suits the tone of the film.<br/><br/>The plot is a pretty obvious homage to the Indiana Jones series but it not once falls foul of plagiarism and instead takes the idea and expands on it so much as to make it truly it's own film. Fraser is great as the Indy type adventurer and paired with the stunning Rachel Weiss the pair have a great on screen chemistry that's nicely bounced off of John Hannah and Omid Djalili's comic characters.<br/><br/>Writer/director Steven Somers manages to give the characters some genuinely snappy and funny dialogue and the action comes in boatloads but is never gruesome, gratuitous or falls back on gore which is actually a very hard thing to do especially in these days of de- sensitivity when everything has to be harsher.<br/><br/>I simply can't praise this film enough, it's just pure cinematic entertainment full of thrills, spills, romance and visuals. It's strange that The Mummy actually comes off as a much better film of the genre than Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull since the latter series basically created the genre.<br/><br/>One of the rare treats to come from a director and team who really believe in what they are doing, and it shows!"

I have recently saw her in Oz and she hasn't change much. Way to go Rachel Weisz! Arnold Vosloo is an outstanding bad guy. He play the part to perfection. He also did a good job in the first GI Joe movie. I haven't seen the second movie yet. I am waiting to watch that on video just because the guy who directs the Step-up dance movies directed that one and I have a bad feeling about it just because of that fact. Anyway this movie was awesome. I love the American cowboys in that movie. I see so much of myself in them. I wonder if that is how the rest of the world views us American. If so then they're more or less right about us. Sadly. The effects in this movie are outstanding but that isn't what makes this movie so good. It is the fact that this is an excellent ride that never lets down. I wish the sequel was better."

","Before I begin my opinion on this flick, I would like to say that I never watched the original but I heard that lots of people love it and despised the sequels that preceded it. So, when I rented this on a VHS copy from a library, I thought, ""This may not be so bad."" and watched it to see if it would catch my very interest. To my surprise, it did and I was really enthralled by it. Sure, it isn't a masterpiece, but for what it is, I really enjoy it. So, why am I giving this a 9/10? Well, before I can get to the redeeming qualities, I would like to point out that this movie lacked some character curve with resulted in all of the characters completely undeveloped.<br/><br/>Flaw aside, everything turned out brilliant. The story may not be the same plot from the original, but it has a nice ""Indiana Jones in Egypt"" concept and it works perfectly here and it has some gripping action sequences helped by some great special effects from the Industrial Light & Magic company.<br/><br/>The direction from Stephen Sommers is great and did a decent job at creating a mood of suspense and atmosphere. The acting is also great. Brendan Fraser is great as Rick O Connell and his chemistry with Evelyn, not to mention their romance, was well thought out. Oded Fehr, and several cast members like John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor did great with their roles, but Arnold Vosloo steals the show for portraying the terrifying Imotep brilliant due to his dark and scary presence. The strongest aspects, however, goes to it's brilliant cinematography, it's Egyptian and atmospheric music score from the late Jerry Goldsmith and it's beautiful Egyptian scenery that gives the movie both scope and an epic sweep.<br/><br/>Overall, The Mummy isn't a masterpiece, but it's definitely an example of a movie that is worth-watching to those who still love it."

It's not too hard to sound pretentious as you deconstruct every nuance, and I can't help but think that perhaps it would have been easier to write a review of 'The Mummy' after the first few times I saw it. Unfortunately some ridiculous number of watches later, all I know is that I feel this is a modern children's classic that I absolutely adore. I get the distinct feeling that 'The Mummy' and the sequel 'The Mummy Returns' will be replacing Indiana Jones post Christmas dinner when the family gather around the television to lose themselves in something wonderful.

The movie assumes you have an imagination (I do obviously) and is nothing but a fun time.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, who will remind people of Indiana Jones, but more badass. Fraser portrays Rick as a wise-cracking American who is searching for treasure beneath the sands of an ancient Egyptian city. He is also escorting Evy (Weiez), a nerdy but pretty British librarian, and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), who, like Rick, is interested in striking gold. Trouble starts when Evy accidentally awakes Ihmotep (Arnold Vosloo), a former priest of a Pharoah that was mummified alive for murdering the said Pharaoh, after having an affair with his mistress (Patricia Velazquez). Things go from bad to worse when Rick's ""buddy"" Bennie (Kevin J O'Connor) sides with Ihmotep in exchange for gold. Joining the battle to kill the mummy is the leader of a desert people tribe (Oded Fehr) who warned the party in vain to leave the city or die.<br/><br/>The film is not only a great action movie, but it can also be considered a comedy. Fraser and Hannah frequently crack out classic one liners such as Fraser's ""If I don't make it outta here, don't put me down for mummification"" and Hannah simply showing disgust when a group of Americans are seen having fun when the desert people attack. O'Connor is funny as the bumbling Benny, and Weiez simply works her magic on Fraser. These two have some great on screen chemistry. Fehr is awesome as a gun shooting desert guy. And while the mummy is a bit whiney, Vosloo does a good job with part anyway.<br/><br/>An excellent film. A perfect 10, and I definitely recommend the film's sequels as well."
"LilyRFox","9","2","2","21 July 2008"," A Great Fun Adventure Movie
","'The Mummy' tells the story of a gaggle of differing characters in 1920's Egypt who, for varying reasons and each with their own agenda, travel to the ancient city of Hamunaptra. Once there, a series of events leads to the resurrection of an ancient high priest with astonishing powers.<br/><br/>This is most definitely an adventure movie in the same vein as that of 'Indiana Jones'. It has some great action sequences, some fantastic humour, the characters are engaging and the potting is spot on. It keeps attention throughout whilst never dragging out for too long. The real strength of this movie is the neatly placed comedy and that, despite its fairly self-aware OTT subject matter, it delivers some genuine moments of shock. Definitely a rollicking ride for all the family; it will keep you very entertained no matter what age."
"z46629","9","2","2","4 February 2008"," A brilliant parody of the action/horror genre
","Reading the most highly-rated comments for this film, I've seen many praising the action and the ""fun-factor"". But none have highlighted what for me takes this film to a higher level, which is the way that it adroitly and subtly sends up every mummy/horror/action film in the genre.<br/><br/>It is a masterpiece: the progressing bullet-holes in the paddle-steamer's side, about to take Fraser's head off; the salute as the bi-plane sinks into the sand; the dismembered arm reaching for the sword at *just* the right moment. It is simply the most ingenious parody I have ever seen -- and it does it all with such grace that most viewers never even noticed.<br/><br/>But for those who are aware of it, there are a few signposts to show that this parody is intentional. The one that stands out in my mind is the camp-fire that flickers every time someone mentions something otherworldly, until one of the characters remarks, ""That happens a lot around here, doesn't it?""<br/><br/>This film is comic timing at its best. Rachel Weisz, Brendan Fraser and John Hannah are clearly having a ball, and who can blame them? This film has it all -- action, comedy, great lines and a hot librarian."
"karlito5","8","2","2","11 January 2007"," Good, solid and most importantly FUN entertainment
","The Mummy is truly one of those movies that you can watch again and again. The plot is pretty flimsy however the writers are well aware of this and although the film does not generate into a full blown spoof there is vibe all the way through the film that everyones 'in on the joke'. The Mummy's charm lies in that although it is light-hearted you're never left in a situation where you wouldn't be rooting for the hero.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Brendan Fraser puts in a great performance as Rick O'Connell and proves that he is guy who can handle the demands of stunt and effects heavy film. Rachel Weisz is good too as the clumsy librarian Evelyn. The real stars though are the supporting actors. John Hannah is absolutely hilarious as Evelyn's brother Jonathan and manages to steel every scene he's in with a brilliant one-liner, in fareness though Weisz and Fraser seem aware of this and have no trouble reinforcing each punch-line's impact. Oded Fehr is great too as a descendant of the Phaoroah's bodyguard he too has some great lines and like the others maintains a degree of sincerity without ever taking himself too seriously.<br/><br/>The effects are great too and there are some cracking set-pieces most notably the one on the steam boat and the opening battle at Hamunaptra. In all the action scenes though there is an emphasis on making it fun and not too brutal, this I think gives the film a more wide ranging appeal - even if it is let down slightly by the inevitable romance between Evelyn and Rick which is not done quite as well as the rest of the film although it still has humorous moments.<br/><br/>Overall? Well worth two hours of your time if you have or haven't seen it - 8 out of ten."

","If you're looking for a deep, insightful drama into the rich history of Egypt then look elsewhere because this is not for you. If you just want to see a film full of fun, adventure and a dash of romance all set in an exotic location then 'The Mummy' is the answer.<br/><br/>The story is set in 1924 Egypt where our hero is gregarious American Rick O'Connell, who is hired to take geeky English archaeologist Evey Carnahan and her wimpy brother Jonathan to a hidden tomb where they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a wrathful mummy who is intent on destroying the world. As the trio struggle to send Imhotep back to his grave, they are joined by Ardeth Bey, a member of the sacred Madjai entrusted to ensure the mummy never escapes.<br/><br/>In much the same thread of a Nineties version of 'Indiana Jones', 'The Mummy' is has the usual formula of brave heroes and treacherous or cowardly antagonists. Brendan Fraser is very likable as the wise-cracking, reluctant hero O'Connell; I admit I despaired of him after seeing 'George of the Jungle' but he redeemed himself here showing he is capable of delivering comedy without the stupid faces and making a twit of himself. Rachel Weisz's Evey walked a careful line between being a bookish English woman without delving into being stereotypical view of the English. And John Hannah was hilarious as Jonathan with Oded Fehr's Ardeth Bay providing the females of the audience with something nice to look at! But it is Kevin O'Connor as the traitorous Beni who steals the limelight with some of the best lines of the film.<br/><br/>'The Mummy' is a typical example of a Hollywood action film, full of thrills, humour, stunts and a scare or two. It's a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours, especially on a cold night when you want to imagine yourself in a sunnier climate. Great fun!"

It's groaning under the weight of the cliches, the plot is horrifically predictable and it doesn't have a shred of originality.  But that  doesn't mean that I don't love it.  This film definitely makes it into my top ten.  In fact, 'The Mummy' was the first dvd I ever bought, and I'm still watching it.  The CGI holds up enormously well, even considering the leaps and bounds we've made in the field since then.<br/><br/>I'm an enormous Indiana Jones fan, and Sommers has taken all my favourite things about Indiana Jones and shamelessly reused them.  Fraser is brilliant as O'Connell, Rachel Weisz believable as kick ass librarian Evie, and I just loved John Hannah as her reprobate brother.  Even the way his accent wavers between jolly hockey sticks and broad Edinburgh twang doesn't noticeably upset me.  This is a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has no illusions about what it is - a couple of hours of escapist fun.  don't watch this film if you get annoyed about authentic historical details.  Do watch this film, if. like me, you love anything vaguely historical, and have a hero thing.  I waited with bated breath for the sequel and was a little let down.  But that's another story . . . ."

It is hugely toungue in cheek, I believe that this is what is effecting alot of opinion around here, everyone, it does not take it's self anywhere near seriously. ""Kill the bad guy, rescue the damsel in distress, save the world"" that sums it up perfectly. The action is a delight, the interactions of everybody, it is one huge pleasure feast, they have left behind all the corny fright stuff of the classics and made this a special effects and humour driven rollercoaster.<br/><br/>  The add for the sequel looks like they may have left behind what was best about this one, it seems to be more serious and paced action stuff but so did the add for this original.

"m0rg16","8","2","2","9 February 2004"," Good action movie
","This movie is a remake of the old classic ""The Mummy"" movie. But of course, they changed alot of things around. Which is good. Why bother with making a remake if you're just going to make it exactly like the old one? If you're gonna do a remake, why not do it with some style? And this is what this movie accomplishes. Instead of a horror movie, we are given an action/adventure movie, with much fitting comedic elements. But there are some creepy moments in the film, and I have to say I would be interested in seeing a horror movie based on this story. But for now, this will do.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser plays Rock O'Connell; a mercenary hired by some unknown group. After he gets chased away from the city of the dead, hamunaptra, by ghosts he is sent to jail when he arrives in Cairo, for trying to have ""a good time"". Enter: Jonathan (Brilliantly played by John Hannah) who just happens to steal a nifty little gadget from Rick's pocket while visiting the Cairo jail. He shows it to his sister, Evelyn, and she recognizes it to be of some importance. They manage to get Rick out of jail, and in return he has to lead them to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead.<br/><br/>On their way to Hamunaptra they stumble upon another adventure and treasure seeking party, which is most unfortunate, because it is this reckless group that eventually let loose the title character: The Mummy. The Mummy's, or Imhotep's (that's his real name), mission is to destroy all living beings on earth, starting with those who let him loose. Now it's up to Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan to stop him before he can accomplish his goal.<br/><br/>The story is good enough to keep the movie going, and it's not in the least confusing which means we'll get a semi-braindead action film without any hassle of lack of story or to much action. The movie is a perfect mix between plot and action sequences, and this is great thanks to the director Stephen Sommers. This movie is definetly worth a rent, or even a buy if you take a shine to it. And if you liked this movie, I also recommend the sequel: The Mummy Returns, which continues in the same style as this movie.<br/><br/>8/10 - Perfect mix of storyline and action gives us a really, really good action/adventure movie with some really funny scenes thrown in here and there."

","Oh, I am some 17 years late on viewing this film but even after all this time I can say that the film does not look dated. It is very entertaining. The story is simple and follows chronologically the chase for the lost city / artifacts. <br/><br/>As for the special effects... again, though the film is old I do not think that the effects seem dated as many people complain about in some older films in comparison with new ones and more advanced technology. However, some effects did remind me of the film Terminator and some scenes of Michael Jackson's Thriller video.<br/><br/>As a lover of Egypt - especially ancient Egypt and as I returned from there a month ago - I enjoyed the film very much. I guess if you could look at all the things that are 'egyptian' with inscriptions and statues and figures... it may not be very accurate, but if you just look for entertainment - this film is great!

","A re-make of the legendary 1932 horror classic, comes a film by Stephen Sommers and one of the best films of the 90s steps forth. Our director took the original story and expanded it into an even better incarnation of the story that people will be sure to love. It really adds a lot more dimension to the characters. Naturally, this film does not live up to the atmosphere of the classic and is far from surpassing it in anyway. This is a standard fun little adventure movie not to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Released at the turn of the century, I saw this film at a young age and realized what an achievement these effects were. They couldn't be better to say the least. ILM has never failed us have they?? Let alone this, we have a spectacular cast assembled here. Brendan Fraser has never before, or since, been so enjoyable. He was born to play this role I believe. Playing as his love interest is Rachel Weisz, beautiful and a damn good actress. As her brother Johnathan is John Hannah, who supplies his much appreciated comedic touches when needed. Being a well done blend of horror/adventure, it's so surprising the comedy works along with our mummy's terror scenes, which are imposing as one would envision. Playing Imhotep is Arnold Volsoo and the suspense in the film is played out rather well. Even with his sidekick Benny at his aide. Chilling scenes with awesome action sequences, Sommers has outdone himself here with this re-make. But let's not forget Jerry Goldsmith, who delivers a thrilling score. He really captures the tone of the film in his music, as he always does. It's a fun movie and nothing more. Love it, surely a classic."

","To be honest, this film is not my cup of tea, but I recognize that it does have some excellent features. Brendan Foster and Rachel Weisz make a great partnership and go a long way in setting the pace and maintaining it at top speed.Also, they somehow or other are able to link together a whole series of scenes composed of farcical nonsense.  And in the labyrinth of passageways where the scenes take place I find myself at a complete loss in understanding just where they are inside the pyramid.  But that does not matter.  There are far more exciting and terrifying things to worry about e.g. the bloodless mummies resurrected and in a fit of rage attack our heroes with wild abandon and the scarab beetles that can enter beneath the skin and burrow around the human body. There is danger at every corner.  The special effects are so well done.  Swords flash in every direction and legs,arms and heads of the mummies are sent flying from their scare-crow figures.  Our hero and heroine escape death by a split second time and time again like the characters in the Saturday afternoon serials. Anything can be done to excess and I feel the fight with the mummies is rather long and a trifle repetitive.  I wonder sometimes if special effects are ousting the actors in cinema today.  This is a mammoth production.  It must have cost a fortune to make. The most exciting episodes for me are the escapes through the corridors with the counterbalanced blocks of stone closing the escape routes. I admire the charismatic Brendan Fraser (so good in George of the Jungle). He handles these crazy parts so well. His co-star Rachel Weisz plays an archeological librarian who unbelievably does translations of Egytian hieroglyphs while on the run. What a gal! In a word, this film is a mad mixture of movie magic.  Kids will love it to the end."

","Stephen Sommer's The Mummy is a rip roaring adventure flick of the very best kind. It's got that timeless dime store novel vibe and is there for the main purpose of entertaining the bejesus out of us for two hours of popcorn movie bliss. I'll no doubt get so hate for it, but I enjoy it more than any Indiana Jones flick out there. It's just too much fun, peppered with sassy humor whenever it stops for breath. Rachel Weisz seemed like a pretty grounded choice to play Evelyn, the flighty archaeologist who discovers an artifact leading to the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra, where supernatural forces lie in wait. Brendan Fraser in his pretty boy heyday plays Rick O Connell, the dashing soldier of fortune who tags leads their pack with riches in mind. Little do they know, the cursed ghost of High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) haunts the remains and has nasty plans for anyone that crosses his vision. Vosloo's dark charisma makes for a wicked antagonist with just the right notes of sympathy, and they really have fun with the special effects, as he turns the forces of nature against out heroes in fantastical scenes that rival Arwen bringing that river to life. The cast is full of hidden treasure character actors including John Hannah as Evelyn's cheapskate brother, Jonathan Hyde as a snooty historian with probably the funniest line in the film, Kevin J. O Connor as Rick's sniveling war buddy, Oded Fehr as the leader of a mysterious band of warriors, Erick Avari as Asa museum curator, Patricia Velasquez as Imhotep's foxy lost love and Bernard Fox in a chortlong, scene stealing turn as a drunken war pilot. Despite having elements of horror, the tone is persistently light, and flies along with terrific humor, swashbuckling and a sense of old world entertainment that can't be beat. A comfort movie for me, must have for any collection and a classic in the stable of 90's films."

The basic answer on a negative critique on ""The Mummy"" seems to be: ""Hey, what did you expect? It's a fun movie."" It's not. It's bad filmmaking at it's worst. It's not entertaining - and I was looking for shallow entertainment. It's not funny - the jokes are lame and the scenes that should've been serious are jokes too (which are also lame). The script doesn't even try to present a coherent or consistent plot - it's just a series of badly written, acted and directed scenes, held together by plot holes. Three days before I've seen ""The Mummy"", I started reading William Goldman's ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"" and I think it gives a really good overview of the inner workings of the American film industry. However, ""The Mummy"" told me more about Hollywood filmmaking (and the power of marketing and the average moviegoer) than this wonderful book - and it makes me sad."

I had to drag myself through this film. The fact that the film apparently does not take itself seriously does not excuse the absence of a plotline or anything watchable in it.<br/><br/>The film is just a few actors milling around, held together by the presence of once mouldy corpse and the odd punch in the face.

As an adult, I felt tested as to howmuch I could take. This movie is (in my opinion) another example where the makers thought they could get away with some nice computer F/X. But they seem to forget that these things only support a movie, not carry it. You still need a good story and some convincing actors to play it. I'm not against computer F/X, but they can't make up a poorly put together movie.

True, there are a few discrepancies in the script, it is a tad overlong and Kevin J.Connor's Beni mayn't be to everyone's tastes, but it is a solid film of its genre. The visuals are absolutely stunning, every scene with the Egyptian desert is enough to take your breath away, and the costumes are very nice too. The music by the one and only Jerry Goldsmith is a very creepy and atmospheric score, and just goes to show what a talented composer Goldsmith was. I will admit some of it is quite scary, and that is an understatement, I do confess being scared of the film when I saw it for the first time when I was 9(I'm 17 now), and there are some scenes that still scare me now. It is no wonder because Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep was a masterstroke, very, very frightening at times, especially when the Mummy disguises himself on the ship, and takes off his cloak to claim his first victim. The other performances are fine, with a dashing Brendan Fraser and a stunningly beautiful Rschel Weisz. John Hannah, if you forgive his accent, was on the whole fine. Overall, a fun and likable horror adventure, flawed yes, but guaranteed to give you entertainment and perhaps nightmares. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"Bronis","1","10","26","7 July 1999"," The Hands-Down Worst Film of the 1990's
","""The Mummy"" is the worst film of the 1990's... PERIOD.  I have never witnessed a more vile waste of talent and money than this absolutely hideous piece of crap.  The previews made it appear creepy and supernatural, but as the lights dimmed and the movie began, I realized things were taking a turn for the worst. I actually dragged friends along with me because I thought the film would be a prime slice of big-budget Hollywood horror.  Yet the film is so tongue-in-cheek and played for laughs that it completely alienated me as a viewer.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent, but the 1930's version was damn creepier with a budget of probably 1/100th what this one cost. The story of ""The Mummy"" is gothic: it deals with undying love and revenge. These two ideas that are callously thrown aside for as many silly action sequences as they can squeeze in.  The acting is too damn campy, which began to annoy me, say, fifteen minutes into the movie.  The racial stereotypes are downright insulting, while usually solid actors Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, and Rachel Weisz are completely wasted.<br/><br/>The best thing that happened in this movie is when the credits went on at the end.  And boy, did I have apologizing to do to my friends.<br/><br/>Now I don't like dissecting films at all; I usually take them as pieces of pure entertainment.  But this one-- BY GOD-- almost made me lose all hope in Hollywood's ability to thrill an audience.  Universal Pictures, you should be ashamed of yourselves. And there's talk of a sequel.... Now that's scary!"
"KurtR-2","3","4","8","4 February 2001"," Only for the special effects
","I didn't like any piece of this movie that wasn't added by computers. Seriously, the acting was bad, the plot was corny and overall I found myself laughing at some of the supposedly serious moments. The special effects were fantastic, though!  I mean, I won't tell you what they involve, but they are amazing!  I was absolutely amazed by some of the things they did.  Special effects usually can do two things: add to the story (Forrest Gump), subtract from the story.  In this movie, however, they are the story.  There is no other reason to watch this movie, in my mind. The only neat part of the movie that wasn't a special effect was in the last scene of the movie, something sparkles, adding a nice little smile to the end of the movie.  Other than that, I think my dog could have written this movie."

","The Mummy, starring Bredan Fraser in his most promising role at the time (and probably ever since) was a great triumph. The direction by Stephen Sommers was great, as well as the special effects and story. The story especially, since it's a remake of the Universal Monster film series of the 1930s.<br/><br/>The action and adventure make you feel like you're watching a new version of Indiana Jones, it's that good. The supporting cast was great too, you have Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Jonathan Hyde. The ending doesn't really set up a sequel, but at the time, one was not planned. Eventually, two sequels would follow and also spawn a spin-off series (Scorpion King).<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that less than 20 years later, in 2017, Tom Cruise tried to reboot the Mummy series again."

","When this movie was released, i remember it was a big thing so i decided to watch it again in 2018 to see if this hype was real or not.<br/><br/>Surprisingly this movie is really great, it tells a very simple story but with very complex sub-stories and detailed adventurous journey that combines between British, American and Arabic style of fights, motivations and culture.<br/><br/>Of course there is a drawback in moving that Arabic culture to the screen, as you can see there is careless in delivering an accurate culture, language and accent.<br/><br/>""Brendan Frazer"" plays the main role here and I can't imagine someone other than him, he was just born for this role. He did well in action, romance and even silly situations. All other actors did great as well but their performance was not remarkable as ""Brendan Frazer"".<br/><br/>All scenes are catchy to the eye, the director showed a few shadows scenes which were great. If you watch it in 2018, you will not feel that it's old or outdated.<br/><br/>All the make up and special effects scenes are perfectly done. You will see magnificent scenes of Ancient Egypt and its treasures.<br/><br/>Finally, it's a great adventure movie that is not comparable to any other movie that represented the idea of Egypt's treasure hunting, it's funny, light and you will not feel bored here."

"Tweekums","8","2","3","13 July 2016"," A fun adventure
","In the prologue; we high priest Imhotep is having an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress; he catches them but the pair murder him. Shortly afterwards they are caught; she takes her own life but Imhotep isn't so lucky; he is condemned to the worst punishment imaginable; he interred with hundreds of scarabs which eat him alive. His sarcophagus is buried beneath a statue in the city of Hamunaptra; the city of the dead.<br/><br/>Three thousand years later in 1925, long after Hamunaptra has disappeared into the sands and become almost mythical, American adventurer Rick O'Connell finds it once again. Back in Cairo Jonathan Carnahan gives a strange box to his sister Evelyn; it contains a map to the location of Hamunaptra. It turns out he's stolen it from Rick who is now in gaol awaiting execution! Needing his help Evelyn and Jonathan buy his release and they head to Hamunaptra. They aren't the only people going there though; a group of American treasure hunters have learnt of its location as well. What none of them know it that Imhotep is still there waiting for somebody to release him from his grave. Once released he will be a treat to all the world!<br/><br/>Given that this film is rated '15' here I assumed it would be a bit more gory or contain other offensive material but to be honest I thought it was less scary than the 'PG' rated 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'Â… it might frighten younger children but I'd say it was suitable for everybody else looking for an exciting adventure/monster movie. The story is simple enough, without unnecessary twists and the monster, when we finally see it is suitably creepy without being too scary. There is plenty of action from start to finish and some great special effects. The cast do a solid enough job in a way that makes it clear that we aren't meant to be taking it too seriously. Brendon Fraser is fairly impressive as Rick and Rachel Weisz is good as Evelyn. They are ably supported by the likes of John Hannah, Jonathan; Arnold Vosloo, Imhotep and Omid Djalili as the gaoler who accompanies then. Overall I'd recommend this; it was a lot more fun than I expected."

"roystephen-81252","9","2","3","19 February 2016"," Still funny and entertaining after all these years
","Well, times change. At the time The Mummy was a big hit in the theatres, many people going as far as claiming it was more entertaining and even having better special effects than the other big blockbuster that came out at approximately the same time, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I still find that claim ridiculous (yes, I enjoyed The Phantom Menace immensely and I refuse to be ashamed about that, what's more, I love it even more now). The effects in The Mummy were fine (if nothing special) then, but seem pretty outdated and amusingly B-level now. But it doesn't really matter. It's not the effects that make or break a movie. What I want to say is that audiences generally seemed to enjoy The Mummy in 1999, but since then, it seems people have forgotten how to watch a movie that is pure tongue-in-cheek fun (hence the relatively low rating on IMDb).<br/><br/>It is not a real remake of the 1932 horror classic. It is an adventure movie, a kind of comedy version of Indiana Jones. And for that, it does work very well. Brendan Fraser is a surprisingly good fit for the swashbuckling character of Rick O'Connell (a career best, probably), as is Arnold Vosloo for Imhotep. The movie is funny, exciting, well-paced – in short, sheer mindless fun.<br/><br/>I must admit, I dismissed The Mummy as a so-so popcorn movie back then, but I have seen it many times since, and it never fails to entertain. It has proved to be highly rewatchable, and that is always a sign of a good movie for me."

"Elswet","9","2","3","28 September 2003"," Fun and entertaining modern rethinking of an old classic.
","What a wonderful adventure! This is one of my (many) favorite movies!!<br/><br/>Let me start this by saying that badly done CGI, like bad acting, should be avoided at all costs and should NEVER be allowed to be included in the finished product of any production.<br/><br/>Case and point: the Scorpion King from Mummy Returns. It was horrible; deplorable; and just downright nasty-looking. He was no better than the worst video game character ever drawn by an 8 year old in green crayon. <br/><br/>Okay, that having been said, the argument in the industry is that CGI is taking jobs away from LIVE actors and giving them to computer nerds. <br/><br/>That is simply NOT the case. Case and point: again, Mummy Returns. Do you honestly believe the producers would have paid two million extras the standard SAG fees and make up artists for these two million extras, or wardrobe for these two million extras to comprise the Army of Annubis? The answer is a resounding H*LL NO! <br/><br/>My point is that before the diversity of CGI became known, movies lacked SO MUCH in detail. You either had the omission of the army all together, or about 20 shots of the same fifteen guys, all in different costumes, trying in vain to make it SEEM as though there was an army. Either way, what you got was deplorable. <br/><br/>CGI definitely has its place in cinema. <br/><br/>Another prime example of excellent CGI in use is in this production, ""The Mummy."" The opening sequence of the WORKING ancient Egyptian city of Thebes is one of the most awe-inspiring film sequences I've ever experienced, but Ancient History is a hobby of mine. <br/><br/>The only time I have any problem at all with CGI is when it's badly done, as in the example I mentioned earlier. <br/><br/>It greatly enhances our ability to enjoy the story when the eye-candy is well done and in place. Those shots of the Army of Annubis are simply staggering. They look realistic and they are so well done as to make you believe, if only for a moment, that they ARE real.<br/><br/>The love story between Imhotep and Anck Su Namun is a classic, and is as historically correct as that of Isis and Osiris, and while this is classified as a ""remake,"" I simply do not care to compare this epic to the original hit.<br/><br/>How can you compare a true masterpiece of horror from 1932; a time when there were NO believable effects, no mastered technology of CGI, and the standard SAG fees for extras was around $6 a day. (It WAS the depression era, after all) Since the development of the technology used in ""Star Wars, Episode 4, A New Hope,"" computer effects have evolved into a true state of art. I have absolutely no beef with CGI, its use, nor the use of it over live actors. As I have already stated above, my only problem with CGI is when it is badly done.<br/><br/>In this movie, it was NOT badly done. I loved the ""Indiana Jones"" adventure feel of this movie. I loved the fact that they took a dark and dreary (badly done, in my opinion) original campy old horror flick and turned it into an absolute feast for those of us who love the eye candy. <br/><br/>I am also an Ancient History hobbyist, and this movie really sparked my imagination. As I've already stated, the opening scenes of Thebes were so inspiring, I was hooked from the very first moment this movie began to play on the big screen.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser, to me, demonstrates his acting abilities in this production, showing his agents and all those around him that he is SO much above frivolous drivel like ""Monkey Bone"" and ""Encino Man."" I hope he never EVER has to resort to such a waste of his talents, again.<br/><br/>Rachael Weisz is a sheer delight. Her character is totally believable, romantic, soft and lady-like while maintaining a tough interior personality. Not easily done. Bravo, Ms. Weisz! What an excellent performance!<br/><br/>I will not detail the plot here, as there are hundreds of reviews already posted to this site about this movie, alone. <br/><br/>It will suffice it to say that, in the Fiend's opinion, this movie is a wonderful adventure, featuring stellar performances and outstanding effects. I adore this movie.<br/><br/>It's one of the Fiend's many favorites.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"Ezreal","8","2","3","7 May 1999"," Surprisingly engaging F/X movie.
","When I saw the advertisements for the remake of ""The Mummy,"" I could do little more than roll my eyes.  I am a fan of the original, mainly because of Boris Karloff's portrayal of Im-Ho-Tep, back from the dead to resurrect the woman he loved.  All this remake seemed to be was a bunch of silly special effects thrown together to catch a few of the pre-""Star Wars"" summer movie dollars.<br/><br/>Well, it does have a lot of silly effects.  Unabashedly silly, and hilarious.  Not too mention the movie is exciting, engaging and all around a great action-adventure movie.<br/><br/>Brendon Fraser is great as a two-gun American treasure hunter leading an expedition to the ancient City of the Dead in search of a golden book.  Of course, through the course of events, all hell breaks loose.  The story from that point, with some interesting diversions, follows the original rather closely, although with nowhere near the sexual tension.<br/><br/>
Although a great monster for the movie, Im-Ho-Tep in the original was a well-drawn character.  Arnold Vosloo comes nowhere near the performance of Boris Karloff, and is in fact more like Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula in several cases.  Still, when he can raise sandstorms and skeleton armies, I guess no one would ask him how he feels about his lot in life... or death."
"Dannyone","1","8","21","3 November 1999"," They got what they wanted.
","The creators of this ""remake"" of the Karloff vehicle stated that they wanted a ""mummy for the 90's"".  Well, that's exactly what they got.  A flashy film where the title character is an ACTION FIGURE.  Ready made for the toy market. I must be old fashioned, but I much prefer the dark mystery of the older films.  The only good thing about this rash of remakes (IMHO...Imho-Tep!) is that they focus attention on the originals.  If the ""new"" Mummy hadn't been made we might not have the""old"" Mummy on DVD.  Same goes for The Avengers movie.  Thanks to that fiasco I now have a complete collection of the released Diana Rigg episodes on the little discs.  So maybe I shouldn't complain!"

","I saw this movie upon original release and not again till the other day, and I'd forgotten how much fun the whole thing was. And how gorgeous actress Patricia Velasquez was in the role of Anck Su Namun, wife of the Pharoah but lover of the High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo). She really should have had a much larger role. What I did recall was all the great CGI effects with the shifting and shape forming desert sands, along with the mummy effects when Imhotep was brought back to life. The principal players all shared a well defined chemistry, and I liked the low key humor of the often outmatched brother Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah). Interestingly, the movie retained a lot of the Boris Karloff original from 1932, maintaining many of the same characters and story elements. The only thing I wish movies like this would do a better job of is identifying all of it's principal characters. For example, if the tattooed Arab leader Ardeth Bey's (Oded Fehr) name was mentioned, I didn't catch it. It's a little thing, but would prevent one from wondering who the heck the guy is that has such a large role in the story. Be that as it may, you could have a good time with this picture when in the right frame of mind. Maybe not so for impressionable young kids who might be scared by the walking mummy corpses; you might have to hold them off for a while."

","Seems like you either get it, or you don't. Just as with Sommers' followup, the wonderful, hugely entertaining and cruelly underrated 'Van Helsing', this movie seems so unfairly destined to be relegated to cult status, as does star Brendan Fraser, . Our family adored it and still do, and as a reimagining of a classic for the modern audience, alongside 'Flash Gordon', it's a virtually perfect vehicle, delivering solid thrills, laughs galore, marvellous scenery and effects, action aplenty, hearty romance and, yes, heart. The casting is simply perfect, highlighted by the glowing chemistry between the two irresistible leads, both so ably assisted by the truly terrific supporting cast, performing a smart, witty and sincere screenplay that strikes a beautiful balance between the various elements of comedy, horror, mystery/thriller, adventure, romance and good old-fashioned camp. It's a romp, it's genre, it's ""derivative"", sure, but it still has that extra something special, and it's a heartfelt and soidly rendered tribute that inscribes itself convincingly into the canon and, on reflection, proves itself to be a classic of its kind. It must be hard heart indeed that does not love this film and will not recognise how hard all concerned tried to make this the best filmtney could make, and how well they succeeded. Critics may carp, but it's boffo box office is the proof of the pudding and for anyone not terminally jaded, this is and will remain a classic."

","I like it when the Universal relaunched the franchise ""The Mummy"" is a 1999 American action fantasy film which was written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the titular role as the reanimated mummy. It is a loose remake of the 1932 film The Mummy, which starred Boris Karloff in the titular role. The film follows adventurer Rick O'Connell, who travels to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead, with an archaelogist and her brother. There they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a high priest from the reign of the pharaoh Seti I, who has been cursed for eternity.<br/><br/>Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco, on May 4, 1998, and lasted seventeen weeks; the crew had to endure dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes while filming in the Sahara. The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, who blended film and computer-generated imagery to create the titular Mummy. Jerry Goldsmith provided the orchestral score.<br/><br/>The Mummy opened on May 7, 1999, and grossed $43 million in 3,210 theaters during its opening weekend in the United States; a surprise hit, the film went on to gross $416 million worldwide. The box-office success led to a 2001 sequel, The Mummy Returns, as well as The Mummy: The Animated Series, and the prequel/spin-off film The Scorpion King.

","Let's face it. No one's going to claim this is a good movie. Its plot is clichéd, the characters are stereotypes - and quite often racially insensitive - the villain is one-dimensional and the acting can be hokey. But let's also not forget that it's fun. It's tremendous fun!<br/><br/>And that comes largely from the fact that the movie knows it had no chance of being great. So it takes its premise and runs with it. It has fun along the way and that translates to the audience as well. You can clearly see that the actors are enjoying making this film, so why not join in on the fun.<br/><br/>The end result is an enjoyable romp through Egyptian deserts, tombs and bazaars. Plus, the special effects have aged surprisingly well. The Mummy is obviously CG, but in a way that blends well with the colourful set designs.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen this film in years, but I still enjoyed it immensely even in this modern day. It's a classic 90s adventure film and well worth a watch."

","Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) obtains a map of the ancient city of Hamunaptra from Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) whom has landed himself in prison. He shows the map to his sister Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) a librarian whom is also an authority on Egyptian History. When Evelyn learns that Rick knows the way to the ancient city she pays a considerable sum for his freedom and the three of them make their way to the ancient city. Unfortunately for them, a rival group have also arrived at the ancient city (in search of the treasure), but even more unfortunately for everyone else their combined meddling has awoken a Mummy that has been dead for over 3000 years. The Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) intends to use Evelyn as a sacrifice to bring his dead lover back to life...<br/><br/>The Mummy is a fairly goofy, tongue-in-cheek type adventure film and that is perhaps one of its greatest strengths. The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is actually one of its selling points - the cast look like they're having fun here and that does translate well on screen.<br/><br/>I think where this film may run into problems with some people is if you start drawing comparisons to other films - when looking at it is does remind one slightly of Indiana Jones (it's easy to see elements of both Raiders of the lost ark and The Last Crusade). The problem is that it is weaker than both these films because it doesn't have the same tension to it - director Sommers seems to use goofball charm and humour to get by. Don't get me wrong it's fun to watch and quite enjoyable, but it doesn't offer the same type of tension or suspense that you get from an Indiana Jones film and naturally suffers by comparison.<br/><br/>The cast are all on good form with Brendan Fraser making a good hero; he's not quite Harrison Ford, but he does a good job. Rachel Weisz is excellent as well and whilst she's clearly intelligent for the most part I did like the way that she had occasional ditzy moments and also liked that she was afforded some vulnerability (the scene where she was drunk is a good example). John Hannah was fun to watch as a minor comic relief character (kind of like Sallah in Raiders of the lost ark). Vosloo was very good as the antagonist, but in some ways the goofy nature of the film held him back and he wasn't as terrifying as he perhaps could have been.<br/><br/>In some ways The Mummy is both unremarkable and unmemorable (particularly when compared to the earlier Indiana Jones films), but it does have some charm to it, some laughs and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously is also a big plus. It's good for a one time watch, but if you want to watch a really good adventure film focusing on archaeological digging the you really owe to yourself to watch Raiders of the lost ark which is an absolute classic."

","The Mummy is an action film that has the right mixture of humor, romance, horror and action. The acting is played in a comedic style, which is OK because the story plays this aspect well. There is nothing wrong with this film per se, but issues that arise may come from a lack of development in the characters, both main and side. It also may be because of the extreme amount of death that never ends throughout the entire film, killing off everyone who was not a main character. But besides these small instances of pain, the film is decent on all other accounts. It is worth a viewing, especially if you intend to view the sequels. Just don't expect the third film to be decent."

","If you think ""The Mummy"" (1999) is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again.

Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.<br/><br/>Everything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the Magi guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah offers some comedic amusing moments as Eve's brother and Kevin J.

The visual effects are stunning for its time, performances are fair enough although sluggish on few occasions, editing is slick, music is a big plus & the whole picture is wonderfully humoured from start to finish. Now one can find a lot to complain about but it is at least never boring.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Mummy may not qualify as a great example of its genre(s) but this adventurous tale of a dig gone wrong nevertheless serves its purpose well by delivering a solid, cheerful entertainment that viewers of all ages can sit back & enjoy.

","This is my review on the first installment of the mummy movies. I remember seeing this when I was younger and just absolutely loving it. As I grew though I figured out that it was not as great as i once thought.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man (fraser) who is on death row when he is saved by a lady looking for the city of the dead ""hamunatra"". Fraser says he knows where to find it as hes been there previously. So the women saves him from a certain death sentence so he promised to show her the way. Once there they discover an ancient tomb accompanied by an ancient book. Little to their knowledge the tomb and the book have a curse that they will unknowingly unleash upon the world.<br/><br/>This movie is not for everybody. If you are a hardcore movie buff such as myself then you probably wont enjoy it. I enjoy it so much because i grew up with it. The story line is pretty basic and the acting is above average. Im not usually a big fan of fraser but I feel he did an alright job here. This movie is filled with action and thrilling moments. If you have kids this is a great one for them.<br/><br/>Overall I say its worth a watch. It is a fun adventure to sit along and go for the ride. Though it is predictable and somewhat cliché I still find it quite enjoyable. If this seems like the movie for you watch it if not best bet is probably don't waste your time."
"fearfulofspiders","8","1","1","24 September 2008"," Fun Adventure, Despite Some Flaws...
","While not nearly as engaging as Raiders of the Lost Ark, or funny as The Last Crusade, The Mummy (1999) is a nice filler for those waiting for any more Indiana Jones films, or something like it.<br/><br/>From beginning to end, The Mummy is very simple, and not one second of it is incomprehensible to a young audience member. The pacing is great; the buildup to the resurrection is actually a great success, and the adventures that ensue are horrifying, hilarious, and adventurous. Brendan Frasier gives a very nice performance as Rick O'Connell, and Rachael Weisz is just as good as Evey. For what he's given, Arnold Vosloo is very menacing as Imhotep, and Oded Fehr's character could have used more screen time to allow us to appreciate him more -- though plenty of that is in the second. The action flows, and is shot very well. The special effects are really good, and I don't think there has ever been a cooler-looking mummy. Jerry Goldsmith's score is decent enough to warrant a buy, though not nearly as sweeping as it could have been, it's still a decent collection of music.<br/><br/>Overall, there's a lot of fun to he had from The Mummy. It sets out exactly doing what it intended, and never exceeds that or disappoints. I highly recommend it to fans of adventure films, Brendan Frasier, and those looking for a good time on a weekend night."
"JamesHitchcock","6","1","1","10 December 2007"," Entertaining viewing for anyone looking for pure entertainment
","In Ancient Egypt the Pharaoh Seti I is murdered by his mistress, Anck-su-Namun, and her lover, Imhotep. For his part in the crime Imhotep is sentenced to be ""mummified alive"". (It is not explained exactly how this is carried out, but as the vital organs were always removed as a necessary initial step in the mummification process, keeping the subject alive throughout must have been quite tricky).<br/><br/>Fast-forward to the 1920s. Rick O'Connell, an American serving with the French Foreign Legion, and Evelyn Carnahan, a half-British half-Egyptian librarian and expert Egyptologist, are on a quest to find the lost city of Hamunaptra. (Rick appears to be serving with the Legion in Egypt itself, even though in the 1920s the country was under British rule. The nearest French troops would have been in Syria). Unfortunately, they inadvertently disturb the corpse of Imhotep, which proves to be a mistake. Apparently, reanimating someone who has been mummified alive can have all sorts of dire consequences for the world, such as unleashing the Ten Plagues of Egypt. Rick and Evelyn, together with her inept and cowardly brother Jonathan, have to try and undo the harm they have unwittingly caused. In this task they have the assistance of the Medji, a tribe of desert nomads descended from the bodyguards of the murdered Pharaoh, who have for three millennia acted as the guardians of the lost city.<br/><br/>As one might guess from the above synopsis, this is not a serious or realistic film. It is an adventure story with supernatural elements in the tradition of Rider Haggard's ""She"", and obviously influenced by Spielberg's Indiana Jones films, themselves influenced by the old Saturday morning serials. It was to be followed two years later by a sequel, ""The Mummy Returns"", which charts the adventures of Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan ten years later. (By 1935 Rick and Evelyn are married and have a young son, Alex).<br/><br/>The earlier film's main claim to fame is that it made a big international star of the lovely Rachel Weisz. Prior to 1999, apart from the moderately good but unremarkable American thriller ""Chain Reaction"", she was best-known as the star of British art-house movies. ""The Mummy"" established her as a Hollywood name. Perhaps this change in her status influenced the way she appears in the two films. In ""The Mummy"" Evelyn is portrayed as intelligent but rather dowdy, hiding her good looks behind thick spectacles, and clumsy. (In one memorable scene she manages to demolish an entire library). Given that ten years are supposed to pass between ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", she should by the time of the later film have matured into a respectable matron in her late thirties. Instead, she is played as a sexy vamp, especially in her duel with Patricia Velazquez, and actually looks younger rather than ten years older. British art-house actresses might look dowdy, but not Hollywood superstars.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" is perhaps overlong and the pace sometimes flags, especially during the first half. (""The Mummy Returns"", which has an even more incredible and convoluted plot, manages to keep the interest rather better). There is, of course, nothing of any deep significance about it, but it does make for entertaining viewing for anyone in the mood for pure entertainment. 6/10"

There have been many stories about mummys and egyptian tombs but none have come up to the standard of The Mummy.

Weisz plays prim librarian Evelyn Carnaham, who unwittingly releases Lord Imhotep from his eternal living death. The rest of the cast, not least Arnold Vosloo as the titular bad guy, are all equally great, not bad considering their roles are (necessarily) a collection of hackneyed stereotypes.<br/><br/>Were people going to accept an archaeology-based pulp yarn, necessarily crammed with referential gags and slapstick action, without pointless comparisons to Indiana Jones? Well no, but to Sommers' credit he's made room for his own creation in the homage to the pulps' genre. The movie's topped off with a rousing homage to Harryhausen's seminal battle scene from Jason and the Argonauts, here with dusty CG mummies taking the place of stop-motion skeletons.

It's written firmly to be a mass-audience block-buster-brain-dead fare, but it's done a lot better than drivel like ""Mission: Impossible II"" or ""Armageddon"". Importantly it doesn't try to be all clever and smart - the movie is played for laughs. It's not an all out comedy but there's a knowing-wink to the movie as Brendan Fraser quips his way through the movie, assisted by Evie (Rachel Weisz) and her incompetent brother Jonathan (John Hannah). The titular Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) has some good on screen presence and, while not menacing, does have an aura of power to him.<br/><br/>A movie like this contains a heavy dose of action and they're generally well executed. The SFX mostly live up to the job, baring a few ropey moments (most noticeably the scarab swarms), and the viewer is generally kept into the action without ever being confused. There's no directorial innovation or trickery - Sommers sticks squarely to the well known tactics and it pays off.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" has a very Indiana-Jones feel to it, not least because Fraser's character is also an exploring man caught up in archaeology. All he needs is a whip - though he substitutes with a dual-John-Wooesque-two-pistols trick. The humour is what helps the movie along because if it *were* to take itself seriously, it would fall to pieces.

It is of course a story with a tragic end for the prohibited lovers as she is murdered and mummified and he is buried alive with an obscene amount of Scarab beetles to gnaw at his flesh. Cut to 1925 and O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and a group of legionnaires are fending off the remnants of the Ancient Pharaoh's Royal guards who have kept a pact over the centuries to keep Imhotep's tomb from being discovered. Confident that they have vanished all the intruders the guards retreat , unaware that Rick has inadvertently discovered their secret. Thus enuses copious amounts of adventure and Mummy gahs as our hero, now accompanied by Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), Jonathan (John Hannah) and a hoard of expendable extras resurrect the ancient evil and then run away and hide.<br/><br/>The Mummy is sometimes an entertaining feature film, and it is a joy to watch Fraser try and do something a little less George-of-the-Jungle-ish, but, this is an extremely poor flick in the sense of how much quality and cleverness it provides.<br/><br/>Prepare to be entertained during action sequences, but just take note, most audiences won't exactly be that spellbound  with The Mummy.<br/><br/>I rate The Mummy 6 out of 10."

Some great costumes and set design are seen here and later in the movie when our 20th century adventurers come upon the tombs.  Kudos to the set designers and prop people and costumers and matte painters...beautiful stuff.<br/><br/>Anyway, the bulk of the story involves a competition of sorts between a bunch of loud-mouthed Americans and a British brother-sister team (led by their pal Brendan Fraser), all trying to find the Egyptian City of the Dead, where lots of gold 'n stuff is to be found. One problem, though: the City of the Dead isn't supposed to be messed with, 'cause that's where Imhotep is buried.<br/><br/>After a few twists 'n turns, they arrive, awaken bad old Imhotep, and the chase is on.  How to kill the soon-to-be-invincible Mummy?  To make matters worse, Imhotep has picked our British heroine out to be the sacrifice that will bring Pharaoh's wife back to life. Good horror/adventure stuff, eh?<br/><br/>Anyway, the show is a lot of fun, doesn't take itself too seriously, and has some good laughs and great special effects (Industrial Light & Magic).  I gave it an 8."

","Indian Jones and Stargate got it better.  This movie was very entertaining but lacked character. These semi-two-dimentional characters save precious time in development so that the viewer can enjoy more action and special effects.  These effects are very cool, and overall I loved the entertainment aspect of the movie.  The humorous lines and actions were a bit campy/slapstick. It was therefore somewhat less intriguing than Indian Jones' wry humor.

"boobless","8","1","1","10 May 1999"," A light-hearted update with all-due respect to the original.
","As a fan of the original Universal horror films, I dreaded the idea of a big-budget production replete with CGI; however, I was pleasantly surprised by this remake of 1932's ""The Mummy"".<br/><br/>The story takes the original idea (old not-dead guy wants old dead high school sweetheart back) and gives it a 90's scarier-than-then tweak. Imhotep, a bad-ass Egyptian priest gets fresh with Pharoah's woman, and as punishment receives the worst death/curse in the books.  Unfortunately, as with most curses, if you find that book, he comes back.  And like most catch-22's, he's a booger to kill.<br/><br/>Fortunately, like Richard Chamberlain's Allan Quartermain films, this action-filled horror film is sprinkled with good-natured humor which intrudes only once, fortunately at the beginning.  Gunplay is superb, as long as you dig good old-fashioned multi-six-shooter gunfights.  And historically the film does a good job, and very little of the fictionalized Egyptian culture is questionable.<br/><br/>What surprised me most about the film is the special effects. The CGI as said before is the best I've seen in a long time, and only falters when more than one beetle is on screen and when .22 caliber machine gun shells make manhole-sized pocks in the face of a sandstorm.  The worst effect regrettably seems to be a favorite, as Imhotep's distended jaw lets loose too many supernatural howls.  The film lags only when the romance seeps in and breaks formula a little too much in those rare places when formula works.  The denoument does seem rushed, as the curses suddenly go on hiatus after arriving in previously rapid succession.  The ending was reasonably anti-climactic, but natural, and combined with the overall good-natured feel of the film, I was reminded of the best sci-fi film in years: ""The Frighteners"", and as is rare in Hollywood, the two films could be from the same universe.<br/><br/>In short: A respectful update; a peanut butter and jelly cast; clean, but abundant special effects; good and plenty action & humor; fluid story & presentation; worth full price admission."

A bit long but worth it.<br/><br/>Most people will enjoy this film not just for the action, but also for the plot.

And a great way to prepare for the summer movies."

"Ankh-11","1","6","15","24 May 2000"," Failed in all categories but possibly special effects.
","If the movie is supposed to be anything near a horror movie, one can safely conclude that this adaption of the classical Mummy-plot has lost most of what made the old Boris Karloff-version its depth and pathos: While the ""old"" mummy was driven by the search of his long-lost love, the modern mummyÂ´s only driving force seems to be a never explained lust for destructive power in a non-specific, dull way which reduced this mummy to yet another of these dimensionless ""evils"" typically found in your average second-rate film. Some would perhaps argue that this new Mummy-film is, in fact, more of a comedy/adventure-film than a horror film. This is, in one way, probably true but the film falls short even in those categories. The obvious resemblance to the Indiana Jones-films only reminded about how much better those films handled things in terms of plots, characters, action sequences and all other aspects, while at the same time underlining how little character of its own The Mummy actually possesses! The jokes were in generally not really funny, the adventurous parts not really exciting and - as stated above - the horror-parts not horrifying. The only reason to still watch the film would probably be to check the special effects like the sand storm, which I suggest be done in front of a video (giving the otherwise bored viewer a chance to skip the less fascinating scenes ...)."

"keihan","1","8","22","18 February 2000"," The worst remake of all time (and that's saying something)...
","My only problem with the critical loathing of the Mummy (1999) is that I am convinced that they did not dismember it enough. Therefore, I feel obligated to do such as is my duty as a movie lover. I really don't want to. But somebody's gotta, SO...here goes.<br/><br/>One comment that has stuck with me that I heard in the audience the night I went to see this wretched piece of celluloid is someone saying ""This is like Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Which it IS--minus the good parts. One would think with a budget of $80 million that they could afford to a)hire some better actors or b) write a better script. The humor, more often than not, is limp, the characterization is non-existent, all that CGI-animated sand could not hope to begin to plug the frequent plot holes, and I'm convinced that they used Boris Karloff's actual corpse in the initial scenes of the mummy being unearthed to save some money.<br/><br/>The film's main problem is that it cannot decide what it wants to be: action/adventure, comedy, or horror. So, by way of idiotic compromise, it tries being all three and, naturally, winds up failing miserably. The elements of the three genres mentioned above are not interchangable and I very much resent the filmmakers acting like they were. Then there's the business of the plagues of Egypt and the Book of the Dead. Excuse me, but the plagues are from Exodus, not Egyptian mythology, and, as anybody who watched the original 1932 classic upon which this is VERY loosely based, the Egyptians didn't use BOOKS. They used papyrus scrolls! And could somebody please explain to me why, if people have been looking for this city for their entire lives without finding it, it took our thoroughly brain-dead cast something like half a day to?<br/><br/>Probably the worst crime that this film committed was the evisceration of the character of Imhotep. Karloff portrayed him as a love-lost monster, equal parts sympathetic and repellant. Here, he's not even a blip on the radar screen, character-wise. All we mostly see is this dessicated corpse who, for some non-sensical reason, is afraid of cats (must have watched ""Pet Semetary"" too many times), can turn himself in a living sandstorm (which I think makes for a nice metaphor for the filmmakers; both are full of hot air), and has the most idiotic on-screen death ever captured on film. Karloff must be spinning in his grave.<br/><br/>Remakes, more often than not, are experiments in re-animation. While the occasional few do wind up being as good or better than the original, most such remakes are failures. Why? Because the ones doing the makeover don't understand what made the film work the first time...and don't care to. That, perhaps more than anything, is why I hate this version of the Mummy. Some things are better off dead."

","In Joseph Boggs' book The Art of Watching Films, Boggs suggests that we should consider the level of ambition of a film in evaluating that film. That is, we shouldn't criticize Sleepless in Seattle for not being Schindler's List. Sleepless in Seattle set out to be a sweet romantic comedy and achieved that goal quite nicely. Stephen Sommers' The Mummy appears to have been spawned with a fairly low level of ambition in mind. The good news(?) is that the director achieved his goal. About the only saving grace of this film is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>The Mummy is loosely based on the Boris Karloff classic from years gone by. Brendan Fraser plays Rick O'Connell, a soldier of fortune, who knows the way to a famous lost city in Egypt. Rachel Wiesz plays Evelyn, a librarian and would-be archaeologist who joins forces with O'Connell and a few other cliches to find the city and uncover hidden treasures. In trying to uncover the treasure they unleash a curse (guess who) and yotta yotta yotta . . . <br/><br/> One of the few bright spots in the film is John Hannah in a supporting role as Evelyn's brother. Hannah's previous films include Four Weddings and a Funeral and Sliding Doors. His part is more slapstick sidekick here but he carries it off quite nicely. There are some excellent special effects, but I am frankly more than a little weary of films that put special effects where the plot is supposed to be. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz do okay in their roles, but their roles are really not worth much effort.<br/><br/>In the end, The Mummy looks like the offspring of a misbegotten marriage between Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ghostbusters. Unfortunately, it's not as funny as the latter, nor as exciting as the former, and ends up being a ""C minus"" grade B film. There are a few scenes that make it inadvisable for kids under thirteen. The rest of the scenes make the film inadvisable for anyone with an IQ greater than that of the average four year-old. Next time out writer-director Sommers would do well to set his sights just a little bit higher."

","The Mummy (1999): Dir: Stephen Sommers / Cast: Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Jonathan Hyde, Kevin J. O'Connor: Triumphant special effects that translates as an action adventure film as oppose to horror aspects in the 1932 original. It is an enchanting visual sight of everything ancient but the story isn't so wondrous. It opens in ancient Egypt where a kingdom is brought down with the death of Ferrell and the prisoners enclosed in caskets and wrapped as mummies. Jump ahead to the 1920's where the search for an ancient book is in progress. Brendan Fraser is introduced as a prisoner in Egypt until Rachel Weisz orders his release. She and her brother need his assistance in tracking the book. It is obvious that the mummy will be freed in the process with chaos to follow. Director Stephen Sommers handles the action effectively. Fraser is given the one role of any interest. He brings humour throughout as he springs from one action sequence to the next. Weisz is basically a potential romantic interest for Fraser. John Hannah plays her brother and the role is as cardboard as her's. The wrappings on the mummy's body contain more personality than both characters combined. The special effects are the film's best selling point as objects shift forms and creatures descend into reality. Fine concept within a screenplay that remains lost within the mindless chaos.

","""The Mummy"" Trust me, I'm not opposed to having fun with silly material.  I don't consider myself a dour person and I love a good ""bad"" movie.  My take on ""The Mummy"" is this : Expectations were high, and the filmmakers blew it. Set with a 80 million dollar budget and a distinctly stinky track record, how could I believe in my mind that director Stephen Sommers could pull this off?  The movie is a mess of really lame and desperate jokes, boisterous effects, and an unproved cast.  Brendan Fraser leads this journey with a pinch of Indiana Jones, a dash of Jerry Lewis, and a sprinkle of a Barry White baritone.  I don't like Mr. Fraiser, and his usual wooden performance doesn't suit the material. By trying to make him into the hero, the film succeeds in showing off even more of Mr. Fraser's limits. John Hannah makes for a passable lackey, and Rachel Weisz is delightful as the ""girl"" of the film(I was already a fan). The two actors who really ooze mediocrity are Kevin J. O'Conner as the sniveling bad guy, and Arnold Vosloo as the title character.  While being a computer creation for most of the piece, Mr. Vosloo has to take over at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Trouble is, he's not scary at all.  He resembles more of an aging lawyer who just flew back from Jamaica than a mummified agent from hell. The effects, which took up 1/4 of the budget, are in turns both impressive and depressing.  Using the computer to enhance a sky or to make 5 people 500... That's fantastic.  Using the same technology to create a noisy environment where each effect looks worse than the next is where I draw the line (Trust me, Spielberg was on to something when he used REAL insects in ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom""). All the CG stuff looks incredibly false to me, my kingdom for a guy in a rubber suit! Sommers has no tricks up the sleeve except to continuously bombard the senses with noise and predictable humor.  It could have been fun, it should have been great, what's left is the biggest letdown from a Hollywood production in some time.---------- 2"

There was nothing she didn't know... a super-librarian.<br/><br/>Even the music was poor and led to the non-horror feeling. All this movie has is special effects. The dead army of Imhotep looks great but they fall like bowling pins when confronted and still don't have the magic feeling of the Sinbad/Jason skeletons of the past.<br/><br/>This may be a hit with 10 year old's (it sure is better than last year's Godzilla) but adults should hit another theatre for their money.<br/><br/>Rating - 3 out of 10"

","This remains, even after 5 years, solidly at the top of my ""worst films ever"" list. It is simply the absolute worst film I have ever seen.

That is, a calamitous jumble of humorous 'spirits' and the likes. I.e. pure garbage.<br/><br/>The remaining 1% of the budget probably (if they were lucky) went on the cast and the script writer. This had the best collection of the nation's (I really mean planet's) worst actors/actresses. They were painfully bad and if I'm being honest, it's probably this that distracts you from the 99% that was spent on the effects. Maybe that is a slight alleviation for Sommers from delivering the worst film of all time, but he's pushing it.<br/><br/>The dialect and script is so bad you feel embarrassed for the cast that they have to further relinquish their barely existent reputations by nearly enacting them.<br/><br/>Now that I have slated this awful, awful movie, I will advise anyone who hasn't seen it never to even pick up the box and read it.

"alan_wyper","2","3","7","13 February 2007"," Cringeworthy Indiana Jones Rip-Off
","""The Mummy"" is an embarrassing slapstick style rip-off of the Indiana Jones movies. It's not funny (though it thinks it is), it's not exciting, it's not dramatic, it's just willfully stupid.<br/><br/>I'd summarise the plot for you, except that this would only serve to dignify the film by suggesting it actually has a story and characters worthy of the name. In fact there are only clichés and cringeworthy stereotypes, and to make matters worse the film-makers actually seem to glory in their total lack of originality or imagination. Every scene is presented with a condescendingly postmodern nudge-nudge, wink-wink, you've seen this one before haven't you, kind of attitude, as though by gaining audience recognition of the clichés and stereotypes this somehow makes them clever.<br/><br/>Allegedly the action occurs in the 1920s, but actually the film scarcely even pretends to take its period setting seriously. This is not simply a matter of historical inaccuracies. The original Indiana Jones movies had plenty of those, not least in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" the mystery as to what the heck half the German army was doing in British occupied Egypt circa 1936. Yet despite such absurdities, these movies were still careful to recreate a period setting that did, however tenuously, ground them in a semblance of reality.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" in contrast is set in an unreal fantasy land, completely divorced from any actual time or place. Just about everything is computer generated, and it shows. I'm sure I can't be the only one who regards CGI as the emperor's new clothes. Fair enough, it can be genuinely effective when used subtly to enhance footage that has been shot in actual sets or locations. But once you start using it to create whole worlds it just winds up making everything look like a video game. Call me old-fashioned, but I always thought that the whole point of good special effects was that they should be seen and not noticed. If people come out of a movie commenting on how amazing the CGI effects were, then self-evidently they weren't amazing at all. They were rubbish, because everyone was aware of them. In the case of ""The Mummy"" the phoniness of the CGI only exacerbates the phoniness of the script.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was generally pretty bad, although given the script that was hardly surprising. The only ""character"" who stood out at all was John Hannah's, and that was for entirely negative reasons. I don't usually mind Hannah, but here his character approaches Jar Jar Binks levels of obnoxiousness. Frankly I just wanted to punch his face in every time he appeared on screen. Meanwhile, Rachel Weisz looked gorgeous as ever, but that was woefully insufficient compensation for two hours of crass, cynical, cretinous drivel, passing itself off as entertainment."

I don't mean to be to obvious, but it reminded me of another production about Egypt that depended solely on special effects and had no real story to speak off, Stargate.<br/><br/>The Mummy tried very hard to be Indiana Jones, and unfortunately Brendan Frasier is not as strong an actor as Harrison Ford.  The female lead was very strongly played both for intelligence, vulnerability, and tremendous sex appeal.  However her talents were largely wasted here.  All in all this turkey was for the most part unwatchable, and save for the incredible special affects the money spent on this movie could have fed starving people in Brazil.  Trust me, the world could have done without The Mummy.  A tip for the failing Universal Corporation:  Stop making bad movies."

"Cineanalyst","6","2","4","12 October 2018"," Raiders of the Lost Mummy
","Since its beginnings, Universal's Mummy franchise, like the resurrected corpse in this one, has often found vitality in sucking the life force from other films. The 1932 ""Mummy"" starring Boris Karloff did so by reusing the plot and many of the details from the 1931 ""Dracula."" The 1940s Kharis series adopted the aesthetics of serials and B-picture adventures. Distributed by Universal, Hammer studios reworked these prior Mummy movies in its pastiche of 1959. The latest version of 2017 tried to imitate comic-book superhero movies. And, this ""Mummy"" of 1999 went full circle by borrowing, as plenty of others have pointed out, from the Indian Jones franchise, which in turn the Kharis series in particular has been credited as an influence on, along with other classic adventure films. Parts of the prior Universal mummy movies are also reworked here, though, and the 1999 version put a new twist on things with CGI--well before the 2017 Dark Universe debacle did likewise.<br/><br/>Besides adopting and reworking the most popular aspects of Ancient Egyptian history and myth--the Book of the Dead, a hidden Valley of the Kings, the curse of King Tut's tomb and Old Testament stories of Jewish slaves and plagues--the basic story here is taken from the earlier ""Mummies,"" with treasure hunters searching for a lost Ancient Egyptian tomb, unleashing a curse, and the Mummy seeking a living female vessel to restore life to his ancient forbidden love, a princess. This Mummy has the same name as Karloff's, taken from the historical pyramid architect, Imhotep, and both characters don't like to be touched, which they explain is ""a silly Eastern superstition."" There's an Egyptologist curator who secretly guards against the discovery of the tomb like in ""The Mummy's Hand"" (1940), including by partially destroying evidence of its location--pottery in the original and a map here. The cutting off the tongue business, I think, is from the 1959 Hammer version. And there's an ancient flashback scene, which is placed at the beginning here, which isn't as interesting as the self-reflexive pool visions in the 1932 film, which two Kharis pictures later cannibalized.<br/><br/>The 1932 ""Mummy,"" which is otherwise the best of the bunch, suffers from creaky sound, deathly-slow pacing and stiff acting. This ""Mummy"" solves that problem by adopting the mix of action and comic relief from the Indiana Jones movies. Beyond that, it also replaces ""Bugs, I hate bugs"" for Indiana's fear of snakes; the assortment of booby traps and secret passages; and the Biblical-level revenge upon those who trespass. At the least, taking the Indian Jones formula and infusing its classic monster story with CGI alleviates any problems with dullness, movement and pacing. As a horror film, however, the repetitive gaping mouth thing is more yawn-inducing than frightening. It could've done without the silly cat business, too.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, one can only wish that Universal's recent attempts at launching the Dark Universe, with its superhero action-movie antics in ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and the 2017 ""Mummy,"" had someone as competent as Stephen Sommers at the helm. Besides integrating Universal's mummy property into an Indian Jones framework, he created the monster-rally ""Van Helsing"" (2004), which blended elements of James Bond, ""Moulin Rouge!"" (2001) and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine with Universal's traditional Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolf monsters."

","It was one of the first films I saw in Germany.

It's just a big budget movie the special effects are better in an animated movie comma many 90s troops are present in there but unfortunately not the most intelligent, the forces as well as the laws of nature in this movie are so inconsistent and the casting is not really fitting point so none of that Actors are bad, they make an effort and so on, but I do not know what's missing there.<br/><br/>Since the film is sometimes really cheesy a cheesy actor like Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Lundgren might be better suited or a dirty actor like Bruce Campbell, Kurt Russell, or Gerard Butler.
I would honestly leave the rest like that because then it would be balanced or overtake the cast and change only a few characters otherwise I like how ironic the movie is because there are a few things that are obviously only in there because they should look cool and in the movie That's at least addressed anyway, I have a problem with humor.
The beginning of the movie is like chewing gum the jokes are absolutely not funny the character of Evelyn's brother is absolutely superfluous and so not entertaining that he just annoyed and the middle of the movie is a bit repetitive.<br/><br/>Making a good movie is difficult to make a remake, so taking a movie with a great concept and just packing it into another genre is a very smart idea and I would say they did that partially, you can not do it cheap Variant of Indiana Jones designate it looks more like a movie version of ""Relic Hunters"".

"nmholland","7","2","4","27 January 2016"," Cheesy Indiana Jones Rip Off, Yet Good
","The Mummy was directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Brendan Fraser as an adventurous hero who can carry a lot of guns. The Mummy, just like every other movie in existence, has its good qualities and its bad qualities. Its good qualities include a good plot, and good special effects. Its bad qualities include a bad plot, and bad special effects.<br/><br/>What I mean by the above paragraph is that half of the plot, and half of the special effects, are good. The other half suck. To get started, I'll give a brief synopsis: We start out in ancient Egypt and the Pharoah at the time was a jealous guy. He literally didn't let anybody touch his wife. However, his high priest, a man named Imhotep, and his wife were in the middle of a passionate affair, and are busted by the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh sees the body paint on his wife's arm is smeared, implying that another person has touched her. He is then surprised to see it is Imhotep. He is then murdered by Imhotep and his wife, who then proceeds to kill herself, simply because we need a plot.<br/><br/>Imhotep then runs away, but returns to try to resurrect his long lost love. However, in the middle of the ceremony, he is interrupted by the Pharaoh's guards, and sentenced to the worst torture possible, in which the victim's tongue is cut off, and is mummified alive and put into a sarcophagus with flesh-eating bugs, so that he will suffer for a long period of time. Then, it skips forward to 1923 and our hero, Rick O'Connell, is in the middle of a war for the land in which Imhotep is buried. He is abandoned by his friend, Beni, and is almost killed. He escapes, but is later found in prison 3 years later. A woman, named Evy Camahan, and her brother, Jonathan, bail Rick out, and go on an adventure to uncover treasure near Imhotep's burial site. They later find and open his sarcophagus and release him on accident. They now must find a way to stop his plan to resurrect his lover and defeat him in order so save the world.<br/><br/>The Mummy is very reliant on its special effects. This film was released in 1999, a time when they did not have as good of effects as nowadays. However, most of the CGI in the movie was not only believable, but rather good. For instance, all of the scenes containing Imhotep, prior to his state of full-regeneration, look very real, with pieces of his flesh missing about his body. Also, in scenes where a flesh-eating bug is crawling inside of someone's skin, it looks very real. Despite all of the good effects in this film, some of them are either non-believable, or just plain bad. An example of this would be far-off shots of cities look like a cheap model bought at the local Dollar General of a set from Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>Another issue would be the plot. Some of the plot makes perfect sense, and really advances the movie, but other pieces feel like they're just there so that there can be a plot. For example, in the middle of the movie, the team figures out that Imhotep wants Evy so that he can use her as his human sacrifice in order to resurrect his ancient girlfriend. Now, why would he choose her? To me, it felt like he chose her just to give Rick a chance to rescue the damsel in distress. Another good example would be how the Mummy must kill all of the men who opened the box that contained the book of death. When he tries to claim his first victim, he is interrupted, and only gets his hands on the man's tongue and eyeballs. This makes no sense; that he had to take his time in order to get the guy's full body. When he kills the other three men, the process happens instantly. But apparently, this first guy was special, because he had to take his sweet time with him.<br/><br/>Despite the dents in the plot, there are well written parts that really help out the movie. One of these parts would be in the middle of the movie, when the treasure hunters are attacked by a group of men guarding the tomb. Rick is about to get killed by one of these men, but lights the fuse of a dynamite stick, which seems like a really stupid idea at the time. However, if any of you listen to the audio commentary, the director explains that this was put in the movie so that the group could see that Rick wasn't at the site just for treasure, he was willing to risk his life, and those around him, for the knowledge of the history contained in the city.<br/><br/>So, through watching it twice, and once with the commentary, overall, I liked The Mummy. It had a decent plot, likable characters, and halfway good CGI. After consideration, I'd give this film a B-, or a 7 out of 10."

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","0","4 July 2020"," ""The Mummy"" is a great blockbuster film mixing adventure with humor in the right measure
","Mummies, Ancient Egypt, mysticism, curses, legends are ingredients that have always aroused the public's fascination, especially as it is a very distant time for humanity that holds many secrets and mysteries. When ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was released in 1981 and we were introduced to archeologist adventurer Indiana Jones, success was immediate with a story that mixed action, adventure and legends involving historical and mythical artifacts. A few decades later, Universal brings yet another adventure that explores the theme, being written and directed by Stephen Sommers and starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Kevin J. O'Connor, with Arnold Vosloo in the title role. like the revived mummy. Filming began in Marrakech, Morocco, with the crew having to endure dehydration, sandstorms and snakes while filming in the Sahara.<br/><br/>In 1926, a group of archaeologists discovered a tomb in the lost city of Hamunaptra. Inside the tomb found the body of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), the priest of Pharaoh Seti (Aharon Ipalé), who was mummified alive as well as having received the most terrible curse for having slept with Pharaoh's lover and, moved by sickly jealousy and love, to have killed Pharaoh. However, when one of the expedition members reads a manuscript that was found by the group and brings Imhotep back to life, he resurfaces full of hatred and only thinks about meeting his beloved and destroying everyone who crosses his path, bringing with him the ten plagues from Egypt.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" is a loose remake of the 1932 film of the same name starring Boris Karloff in the title role. Originally intended to be part of a low-budget horror series, the film turned out to be a blockbuster adventure film, with its vision of The Mummy ""as a sort of Indiana Jones or Jason and the Argonauts with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time. Universal liked the idea so much that it approved the concept and increased the budget from $ 15 million to $ 80 million. This version of Sommers is very happy to develop a script with all the elements that a big blockbuster should, mixing comedy, mysticism, romance, adventure and terror in the right measure, counting also with impressive visual effects and a soundtrack that give a more realistic and imposing tone to the work.<br/><br/>In this work, the director knew how to bring together that ingenuity already lost in the 70s / 80s, all the elements that make a blockbuster easy to appeal to the public, whether in the charismatic conception of the characters, in the sense of grandeur, a humor that he never abandons. the tape, or in the attachment to the climate of adventure. Sommers, at the time of The Mummy, a reboot of Universal's classic franchise, was a nostalgic. Establishing his atmosphere of adventure from the first seconds with the visual joke on the Universal logo, Sommers not only gathers all the visual and narrative elements that establish an adventure, but also punctuates his film with a rich (even if never deep or complex) range details, facts and theories about, fictional or not, involving archeology and all its symbology, which guarantees a constant verbalization of curiosities about ancient Egypt, almost a historical joke.<br/><br/>The script follows only a few points in common with the feature film of 32: the mummy is called Imhotep and aims to recover his great love, which was also called Anck-Su-Namun and the fact that his powers increase over time. But Stephen Sommers changes a little: instead of making a tense film, he decides to go on an adventure with influences from pulp literature and with hints of 1930's adventure films. Just pay attention to the characterization of Rick, who resembles the typical adventurous hero from that time, in addition to Fraser sometimes being inspired by Errol Flynn. But what Sommers does with skill is how both in the script and in his direction he mixes these classic elements with modern elements in the cinematic language. Unfortunately, one of the negative points is that the Imhotep tragedy ceases to be the main focus of the story and ends up that the high priest is not developed as he should fall into the old cliché of wanting to take over the world. The viewer feels as if Imhotep were more distant, but such a change is understandable in certain parts since it is an adventure film, but the sense of disappointment is present in any case.
One of the reasons that makes the film work is its cast. Fraser and Weisz, caricatures in the right measure and talented in establishing their chemistry on the scene, clearly embark on the game and play with the interaction of their characters, establishing a necessary empathy for the audience to enjoy the adventure with greater pleasure. Fraser has great comic timing and screen presence. It's as if the camera really almost chases the actor for how good he is to be seen. Rachel Weisz shows herself to be an actress with a very strong personality and who escapes the stereotype of the helpless girl. As much as the character was becoming more badass according to the progress of the franchise, this film shows that only with her intelligence and because of the charm of Rachel Weisz the character was already interesting in itself. John Hanna looks great as the film's comic relief, a character who doesn't think straight about his actions and only thinks about riches. Arnold Vosloo, like the feared monster of the title, hits the antagonist on the scene, even though his threatening power is never really realized for the public, something equally hampered by the constant close-ups on the creature's digitized face.<br/><br/>The grandeur of The Mummy is what first stands out. Almost twenty years after its release, and even though it is far from being one of the visual references of those years, the film still enchants and convinces with its creativity in the design of scenes, manipulation of visual effects and control of action scenes (how not to remember the wall of sand with Imhotep's face?). As much as Sommers is not Spielberg and despite his hand in some comedic moments that just don't work, in addition to some clichés abusive to patience, it is in the constant identity of self-parody and a relaxed atmosphere that The Mummy breathes its cinema identity that entertains an audience that, whether in the 90s or today, is looking for an adventure that is agile, lively, funny, visually exuberant and that brings together characters of great charisma. The package here is complete. These range from the type of humor in the film to more grotesque scenes with Imhotep, something that gets lost during the franchise by overdoing more modern elements like slow motion, frame acceleration and excessive special effects. But as Sommers proposes to the viewer a good matinee adventure film, he delivers it very successfully. In addition to having good scares during the screening and great comic relief from the immense charisma of Brendan Fraser.<br/><br/>And as much as Sommers doesn't cling to realism at any time, the competence of technical work transports the public faithfully to the arid, dry and hot desert climate, whether by Adrian Biddle's photography that hits the color palette, in the costumes of John Bloomfield collaborating for the retro identity of the adventure. In addition to a very detailed reconstruction of the time, not only from the 1930s, but mainly from Ancient Egypt where the prologue takes place. Most of the feature's special effects work to this day, especially when Imothep is regenerating that he is not just a mummy that takes the bands off, but that he shows them along with his degenerated muscles and organs. It is really scary and distressing.<br/><br/>The visual effects were provided by Industrial Light & Magic, which mixed cinema and computer generated images to create the title Mummy. The producers wanted a fresh look at the Mummy so that they could avoid comparisons to previous films. John Andrew Berton, Jr., Visual Effects Supervisor at Industrial Light & Magic began to develop his eye three months before filming began. He said he wanted the Mummy to ""be mean, difficult, unpleasant, something that had never been seen by the public before"". To create the Mummy, Berton used a combination of live action and computer graphics, combined with the makeup prostheses and digital pieces on actor Arnold Vosloo's face during filming, in order to achieve ""a threatening and realistic mummy"".<br/><br/>We also have the striking soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, which highlights the grandeur of that scenario and all the fantasy imagined by Sommers amid deserts and pyramids. Goldsmith's music, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage is one of the feature's assets. Like many Goldsmith tracks, the main theme uses extensive brass and percussion elements. The composer also used sparing amounts of vocals, highly unusual for most of his work. The composer changes the tone of the film very well, going from adventure to terror in a constructed way, never abrupt. It ranges from more epic themes with sounds of brass and opera to calmer themes of love. It is a strong element that helps to set the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Being a huge box office success enabling the creation of a trilogy, ""The Mummy"" is a great blockbuster film mixing adventure with humor in the right measure. Even though in terms of genre and quality, it distances itself a lot from the 32 film, this film deserves to be seen preferably with a big bag of popcorn because it will be a fun trip. Anyway, A Mummy is so competent and honest in the gathering of its elements and in its imposition of great production that it becomes difficult not to be delighted with its successes, that for a film so open to concessions to the public, there are many.

"asandor","5","0","0","30 April 2020"," A fun and campy adventure film
","The Mummy, directed by Stephen Sommers, and starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, is a fun, now almost classic adventure film. This film heavily lays on the Indiana Jones style - with traps, treasure, tomb raiding and a good wallop of humour to go along with it. All of these things make for an overall enjoyable film, all things considered. The film follows Fraser as Rick O'Connell, roguish mercenary for hire, as he works with an expedition from an Egyptian museum. The expedition unleashes an ancient evil, that they then must survive, as a reanimated mummy seeks to achieve invulnerability and control Egypt!<br/><br/>To start, I think this film is quite fun. Suitably hammy performances abound, with both Fraser and Weisz, as well as supporting actor John Hannah, bringing the camp. The premise of this movie is suitably campy - with mummies, ghosts and flesh eating scarabs abounding. Even so, these elements bring a level of enjoyment that is well suited to this type of film. The Mummy has become a good example of a camp film that is still quite a fun experience.<br/><br/>To be sure, this film has its downsides. The CGI and animation have not aged well, showing the weakness of this type of visual presentation. Practical effects would have added some longevity to this film, and potentially brought it forward as a cult classic. There are some particularly eye rolling films that were horrifying to see in the 90's, but have not kept that particular feeling alive, to the detriment of the film. The acting in the film, while campy, can also be a bit cringey, especially from the Mummy itself, and many of the supporting characters. Some more believability, or going the other way, skilled camp, would have added some charm. Some side characters (notably the British pilot) are shallow and add absolutely nothing to the film.<br/><br/>These all detract from what could have been a classic of cult cinema. Big box at its release, this film is none-the-less blowing its way into the background of film history, and while it is still fun, it is certainly not overly memorable. A film I enjoy watching, but with some issues."

","It's a massive shame how underappreciated the Mummy is, considering the amount of aspects it balances and gets right. It only has a 60% on RT and only seems to have a small following, despite being an excellent action, adventure and monster films. I rewatched it recently, and only confirmed prior thoughts of greatness. Here some of the pros/takeaways I have:<br/><br/>-The setting is perfectly realized: the movie does an incredible of taking the viewer to 1920s Egypt, a setting rarely used in film. The beautiful desert shots, egyptian-like score and specific period set pieces contribute and enhance the film in many ways. It's often just a joy to look at and listen to the film.
-It does a fantastic job with it's creatures/mythology. The story blends aspects of Egyptian mythology/history seamlessly, as it showcases various locations, gods, objects and characters. It is a lot easier to get into the movie with the excellent world design created here.
-The story is fresh and exciting.
-The actors/characters are excellent. The Mummy has an almost entirely unknown cast (Rachel Weisz being the only actor/actress to star in critically-applauded films) and yet nearly every performance in the film works in its own way. The two massive standouts are John Hannah as Jonathan, honestly in my opinion one of the best comic-relief side characters in movie history, and Arnold Vosloo as the Imhotep, an excellent villain with the perfect amount of humanity. Brendan Fraser is an excellent lead, Rachel Weisz is solid, and even most of the minor characters contribute to the film."

"electronmove","9","0","0","23 February 2020"," A Modern Adventure Classic
","Set in the wind-swept dunes of Ancient Egypt, we're shown a quick glimpse of the origin story for what will soon become the early 20th century, where we're introduced to the tone for what will be the rest of the films length; our hero, O'Connell, serving in the French Foreign Legion, facing down an imminent threat with nothing but self-assuredness and brazen courage against over-whelming odds, and coming out alive. To his side is his ""buddy"" Beni.<br/><br/>Mystic ancient orders, gun fights, sword fights, mummies, insects, magic, even a bi-plane, and then the afterlife, all set against the backdrop of the ruins of old, and the city-streets of new Egypt. While this movie relies on a good amount of CGI special effects to accomplish this, there's more than enough genuine stunt-work, wire-work, tracking shots on vehicles, and practical effects to keep the adventure enthusiast humbled, and the sets give off a very authentic-feeling atmosphere for 1920's Egypt, especially the ruins which feel old and forgotten by time, as if completely removed from the world, entering a place that teeters on the edge between the world of the living and the world of the dead. The studio could have skimped on the details, but everything from the hookah smoking, the period-authentic music in the background, and the money they use in few shots that it's visible, that even the small details were accounted for.<br/><br/>The acting from the cast is nothing particularly jaw-dropping, but clearly done well enough to make you earnestly root for the characters, believe their backgrounds, and trust in what they're saying. Brendan manages to carry a brutish machismo undercut by a sly wit with a manner of grace that keeps him elevated and within the charming category. Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) gives her character a certain level of cute braggadociousness despite always being undercut by those around her, but still coming out ahead intellectually from time to time, keeping her from falling into the narrow trope of ""girl to rescue"" and more of someone to admire at times. Jonathan has the guile of a weasel as he sneaks in and out of confrontation, although remaining loyal to those he trusts. These 3 take up the majority of screen time, while other characters like Beni and Ardeth come and go throughout. Beni, on the one hand, plays a true con-artist and a coward, and very similar to Jonathan but playing the opposite of Jonathan's loyal characteristic where he is instead incredibly disloyal, favoring whoever has the upper hand. The roles blend together to create a truly entertaining thrill ride where you already know the out-comes for many of them, but it's just so fun you can't help but smile and hold on.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers crafted a truly great adventure film that stands up there with the greats like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pirates of the Caribbean, Back to the Future, King Kong, and Jurassic Park. In another 10 years, this will be referred to as ""Classic Cinema""."
"m-d-bruce","10","0","0","18 February 2020"," Long time fan of the movie, but a few things always rankle me
","It is borne of the Indiana Jones type of old-fashioned adventure. Some think 1920s/30s style adventure tales don't translate well into today's movie-making, or even back when this movie came out. There's room for all styles. It is a mix of reality and fantasy with humour and even cartoonish elements. That said, such adventure yarns, however improbable they may seem, need to be grounded in as much reality as possible. But how much is enough? A good balance is represented in this story of a cursed being resurrected but eventually defeated, by supernatural elements.<br/><br/>Before proceeding further here are the things that always rankle me whenever I watch the movie. Trivial perhaps, but it's usually the little things that have such an effect. I must note that these things may have been discussed in a review already but I have not tried to go through all of them, or were perhaps a part of the old discussion board, so excuse me if I repeat old points.<br/><br/>First of all, the name, which is not just about this movie but more striking here. We have accepted these tales for a long time as being about a mummy. But it is really about a bandaged corpse because Imhotep was never mummified. So why is he chasing canopic jars of organs for regeneration if he was buried alive? Was he mummified later? This is never explained or even postulated, and seems unlikely if they found a 'juicy' corpse, with little evidence of wrappings remaining, compared to old movie depictions..<br/><br/>Secondly, it has always bothered me when you see Rick drop from the platform with the rope around his neck. Not because of the implied violence, but from the suggestion that despite the full weight of his body being jerked by the rope around his neck, he suffered no injury or even after effects of what is really a type of body trauma, usually fatal, far worse than being tossed around later by resurrected priests/bodyguards of Imhotep, but the cartoonish element makes more sense with the latter type of violence. This spoils efforts at some reality credibility early on. It would have made more sense, and even logic, if not suspense and excitement, for Evy to have had him cut loose just before the platform lever was pulled.<br/><br/>Thirdly, it is made clear that Evy can both read hieroglyphics and understand the ancient Egyptian tongue spoken by Imhotep, even to the point of correcting a translation by Beni. So how come she never spoke directly to Imhotep when given the chance, such as at their first encounter? Maybe fear at the beginning but what about later?<br/><br/>Lastly, see, only a few trivial things, but these can be annoying at times, we come to Winston. An old war vet suffering from survivor guilt and now an alcoholic hanging out in a remote outpost is a great cliche for this type of movie. But, remember this is 1926, not 1966, so why does an ex-RFC pilot from World War I in 1926, only eight years, not forty years, after the war ended, look like someone's lovable grandpa who would have been too old to fly a decade earlier. He really should have been played by someone in their late 20s/early 30s, but the cliche and poignancy of his sacrifice would be lost. The imagery works in the movie but makes no sense in terms of the historicity of the time period used.<br/><br/>So it's only a few little things and many movies have these, with some dismissed as plot holes. But these are obviously the types of little things that could/should have been done differently, although one can only presume decisions were made for the story purposes. As for 'mummy' vs. 'bandaged corpse', this is a matter of semantics beyond this movie and making them synonymous can be accepted as part of pop culture. But does it seem odd nevertheless? So, was Imhotep mummified later? He must have been in order to explain organs in canopic jars, but the punishment and scratches on the lid of the sarcophagus suggest other wise. So, do we treat anything in a sarcophagus in ancient Egypt as a 'mummy'?<br/><br/>Beyond these minor points the story is fast paced and holds up as a great tale of adventure being one of the best to come out of Hollywood in a long time and certainly up there with Indiana. After all, we have too few such movies for the adventure loving viewer.<br/><br/>Finally, with another comparison to Indiana Jones there is a classic cliche that too often strains credibility but will ever be with us. Take the fourth Indiana Jones as an example, Near the end we have our heroic survivors stranded in a remote place reached after great risk to life and limb, and facing a very dangerous journey back. However, like so many such movies the return journey is always assumed to be easy and simple and never depicted. We then inevitably find our heroes safe and sound back home. It seems all adventure movies have dangerous journeys to destinations but never from. At least here with The Mummy we end with them setting out on their return journey, suggesting it will go smoothly, but not knowing for sure until the sequel that they are safe.<br/><br/>Well, after 20+ years I finally got those things out. As before, despite such minor annoyances, inherent in most movies anyway, we have an adventure classic that will be in the top ten of adventure movies for a long time to come."

","I'm a snobby movie watcher. Most of my favorite movies are not in English, or are horror movies. I'm the type of person who watches 2-4 movies a day (my therapist and I think it might be time to trim that down, ya dig?). So when I say I love the Mummy, you can rest assured that my taste does not include QT, Nolan, Cameron, etc, but it does include the Mummy with Brenden Frazier. I've seen the movie 1,000 times since I was 9. The original is a masterwork of monster horror, something that helped inspire Psycho, invasion of the body snatchers, and the Gojira series.<br/><br/>The remake has merit only as much as a Nick Cage movie does as an adult, which amounts to something that can only be art. The hammy performances, 8th grade writing project script and Pg-13 jump scares are so bad they are funny. This is a movie that gets exciting, and then your realize you're caught up in something that you shouldn't like.<br/><br/>This movie is like a trip to McDonald's.

"andrewmerritt-31652","6","0","0","8 January 2020"," A punk rock version of the 1932 movie of the same name
","The Mummy stars Brendan Fraser, and Rachel Weisz. The film is set in 1925 and involves a group of archeologists who are hunting for the lost ancient city of Hamunaptra. However the group accidently awakens an ancient mummy who begins wreaking havoc in order to find his long lost girlfriend. This movie is loosely adapted from the 1932 movie and it has nothing to do with the Mummy starring Tom Cruise. I'm not going to talk about the Mummy with Tom Cruise because that's another review for another day. But this version of the Mummy will always be better than previous one we got, but I never saw the original let alone heard of it so I can't really compare the two. But this Mummy feels like it was a passion project from director Stephen Sommers. And while the jokes feel like they were just made up on the spot or maybe it tries too hard to be Indiana Jones, it is entertaining. Before the Uncharted games were released this is what Uncharted would've looked liked. And somewhere deep in my brain led me to believe that Stephen Sommers directed his own Uncharted movie which he made a sequel later. And a couple of years later someone from Naughty Dog watched the Mummy and decided to the movie into a video game franchise. And Brendan Fraser was also the inspiration of Nathan Drake, who brings humor to the movie. And occasionally it feels like he's trying way too hard to be romantic or portray Indiana Jones, you can't hate on the person. This movie came out in 1999, and for a time the special effects team did an amazing job creating the Mummy and all the other special effects involved. But when you watch it now, it feels outdated compared to the special effects we have today, but its still entertaining no matter how awful you think it seems. So in the end, The Mummy is a solid adventure movie that lacks humor and romance, but it makes up for its special effects that I would like to think would make Boris Karloff proud."

","I remember seeing this in the cinema way back in the Awesome 90s & it blew my mind & i still think it's excellent & holds up fantasticly with it's excellent fx & Awesome cast.
1999's The Mummy is the best film in the franchise as the others just became boring & lost the perfect tone of Action-fantasy Horror & comedy.
The sequels are just not very good at all but this first film is a fantastic adventure with the once leading man Brendan Fraser at his absolute best as our funny but tough lead hero ""Rick O'Connell"" who is such a great old fashioned character & hero!!!
Brendan Fraser is so COOL here with his many guns & funny wisecracks & handsome charm he's such an all American movie hero, think a little Indiana Jones & Han Solo & any explorer hero from 50's B-movie flicks!!!
""The Mummy"" is full of adventure & the special fx look Amazing, the mummy itself is fantastic & scary but done fun at the same time, i love this film.
Also at times this is like a Horror movie with Zombies, Mummies, Killer bugs & demonic followers & the ""Book of the Dead"" i mean this could be a prequel to the fantastic ""Evil Dead"" Trilogy!!!
A great little cast with the BEAUTIFUL Rachel Weisz & the posh bumbling John Hannah & the cool but intimidating Arnold Vosloo as the main Mummy monster ""Imhotep"" it's a good cast.
I love the Egyptian locations & all the creepy dark underground tunnels & corridors under the pyramids, there's such a fun sense of Adventure & wonder here & there's lots of great scenes or moments, there's some Awesome creepy bits too that lead into the Horror Genre at times & the production design is Amazing as is the music!!!
Another great film from the 90's & still the absolute best Mummy film of them all.
There's loads to enjoy in this Adventure of great entertainment that mixes Adventure,Horror,Fantasy & Comedy together perfectly.
One of the most enjoyable Adventure films of all time!!!
This is what movies were made for, to take you on an exciting fantasy adventure & give you escapism from the depressing real world."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Mummy is an action horror movie that premiered in 1999. The movie is written and directed by Stephen Sommers and stars Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz. The movie is about an ancient mummy that is awakened and must be banished once again. The movie features an American archaeologist played by Brendan Fraser that leads the discovery and eventual banishment of the ancient mummy.<br/><br/>The Mummy is a great movie that combines adventure and action. The movie can be tense at times and the movie is fantastic in its focus on the mummy. Imhotep the mummy, played by Arnold Vosloo, does a fantastic job. He offers tension and great action scenes in his portrayal of the cursed mummy. The movie is incredibly tight in its 125 minutes of running time and it uses all of it to focus on either the main characters or villain. There is not much fluff in this movie.<br/><br/>The main stars of Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell and Rachel Weisz as Evelyn Carnahan do a great job in the leading roles. It was really funny at times following the band of adventurers as they find treasure and clues to unraveling the mystery of the mummy. Brendan Fraser in particular is a breath of fresh air at the time and created a great genre of action adventure movies. Evelyn Carnahan is the love interest of the main character but actually has expertise to provide in the movie.<br/><br/>The computer generated imagery aged remarkably well for its time. This movie uses its computer generated imagery sparsely when it can and it makes for a better movie overall. The budget of 80 million US dollars shines well in this movie and it makes for an overall solid production.<br/><br/>I would recommend 'The Mummy'.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

Some of the scenes can be pretty frightening at times; in fact, it was so frightening that it literally gave me goosebumps. It's a good Mummy movie, and there aren't too many out there, so I would see this if you already hadn't done so. It's clearly the best of the Mummy movies. Even better than its sequels.

","The mummy is sort of a cross between a super-natural horror movie and Indiana Jones. Personally I see the horror as being rather small and the movie focusing more on the Indiana Jones aspect of it. Okay, the movie doesn't involve Nazis but does involve evil undead romping about Egypt seeking immortality, but that doesn't make in a bad movie.<br/><br/>Three thousand years ago, the high priest Imhotep (who in reality was a great architect who designed and built the first pyramids and became a god) was in love with the Pharaoh's wife. Unfortunately the Pharaoh did not appreciate people touching her so when the Pharaoh caught them the Pharaoh's daughter committed suicide. Imhoptep then took her body to the city of the dead to resurrect her, but before the ceremony was complete, the guards caught them and punished Imhotep to suffer the biggest of curses, to be mummified alive and placed in a coffin full of scarab beetles.<br/><br/>The movie then jumps to 1926 where the action happens. A soldier, Conner (Brendon Fraser) stumbles on the mythical city of the dead and finds a key. The key is pick pocketed by the brother of a librarian who dreams to be an archaeologist (who reminds me of one of my classical studies lecturers) and upon discovering that it points to the location of the city, they save the soldier from death and go out seeking the city. The movie goes into a race between them and some cowboy like Americans, and once they have found the city, they ignorantly find Imhotep's coffin, and by reading the wrong words from the wrong book, they animate him. Thus Imhotep begins his quest to regenerate his body and then resurrect his girlfriend.<br/><br/>I think the plot is pretty good. My friend did not like it for a number of reasons. One were the plagues, which were the result of the mummy coming back to life, but in reality were a sign of God's judgement upon the Egyptians. It is also interesting as the plague of hail is always fire. They were not in the same order either. I personally did not worry about this because I was enjoying the movie. I can be critical of some movies, but the plot kept me hooked and I was able to suspend my disbelief. I liked the mummy, and though the critics might rip it to shreds, I will not."

","The degree to which you'll enjoy this movie depends a lot on how much -- and why -- you like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Without ""Raiders"", this movie wouldn't exist. Neither would ""Romancing the Stone,"" ""The Jewel of the Nile,"" and the numerous sequels in the Indiana Jones series.<br/><br/>""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was a true original, the brainchild of Stephen Spielberg, based on the silly, action-filled serials of the 1930s and 40s. There can only be one original, and that was it.<br/><br/>As is always the case, the imitations gave us more of what audiences found appealing in the original. Not only more, but much more. Often, too much more.<br/><br/>In ""Raiders"", the archaeologist hero had to beat the Nazis in finding the Lost Ark of the Covenant. Here, the hero, Frazier, has to beat a bunch of greedy Americans looking for treasure. Frazier is funded by Weisz's library. Unlike Indiana Jones, he has no particular profession. No identity, really, beyond that of the figure who must save the delicious Rachel Weisz when she is strapped down on an altar of rock next to a disgusting mummy who is brought to life.<br/><br/>""Raiders"" didn't have CGIs but ""The Mummy"" certainly does. The mummies march around in cadence, holding shields and swords, a rip off of Ray Harryhausen's skeleton fight from ""Jason and the Argonauts."" But if you like action, you'll get it here. And some of it revolting enough to be thoroughly enjoyable. Nothing I like better than seeing a man eaten alive by overgrown cockroaches. Frazier jumps around, a pistol in each hand, wearing a 1920s outfit with crossed holsters and boots. (""Raiders"" was set in the 30s.) Frazier gapes, she shouts warning, he makes wisecracks with his eyeballs bulging. Weisz has opportunities to look flabbergasted and frightened. Gawd, she's pretty. She has a delightfully wide face, broad nose, scintillating smile, and eyes that belong in a museum.<br/><br/>The thing is, though, the thing that keeps this from being better appreciated than it is, at least by me, is that it's a copy of something else. People sat down and STUDIED ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" trying to figure out what it was that made it so successful, so enjoyable -- what it was that raked in all those SHEKELS. For one thing to be ""influenced"" by something that came earlier is both understandable and inevitable. But for something to be deliberately copied in the pursuit of pelf. To me, that's almost as sphincter-puckering a notion as being eaten alive by giant cockroaches. I guess that's why I never got rich."

","The original Mummy film is the best in the series. And I liked every film in the series. For years people said that these films were rip offs of Indiana Jones. Well, in adventure level, yes, a lot like Indiana Jones. But no rip off. The Mummy films aren't as good, but they are fun.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O'Connell, an American serving in the French Foreign legion.

The sequel, The Mummy returns copied off of this one quite a bit. The 3rd one, Tomb of the Dragon emperor, wasn't a rip off but was dumb fun.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed the whole trilogy. The original is the best. Second would probably be the second one now that I think about it. Then the third one would come in last place. A lot of people hate these movies. I don't see it. It is certainly not art, but it is a lot of fun and like the others, it is never boring.<br/><br/>The Mummy: B+"

","Strictly speaking, this is not a remake. Although I haven't seen the original, I highly doubt that a movie made in the early 1930's could have this kind of action and adventure. Apparently it shares a similar plot-line to the Boris Karloff classic, but unlike many remakes, or ""reboots,"" this one is entertaining enough in its own right.<br/><br/>The film opens in Ancient Egypt, where a priest named Imohtep (Arnold Vosloo) is caught in a love affair with the pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez). He and his priests are executed and the priest is cursed. Cut to the 1930's, where an adventurer named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is about to be executed. He is saved by a ditsy Egyptologist named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) because he knows the location of a lost city where rumors of untold treasure await. While there, they of course end up awaking Imohtep, and with him come a few nasty side effects to the curse.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is that it plays manages to chill us and make us laugh. There are some genuinely freaky moments, and there are also some openly funny bits. Not many movies can make that claim. Even better is the general adventurous spirit that the movie is filled with. It's just a grand old adventure! The acting is great. Brendan Fraser is a likable rogue who can fire a gun no problem but, as he puts it, ""I bet with my life, not my money."" His unlikely companion is a klutzy librarian who loves Egypt dearly (her mother was Egyptian), and Rachel Weisz is terrific in her star-making part. Likewise, John Hannah is hilarious as her dim-witted, treasure loving brother, Jonathan. You can almost see the jewels in his eyes every time the word ""treasure"" is mentioned. Oded Fehr plays the part of the native who knows all about Imhotep with a mix of ""adventure sidekick cliché"" and a serious character; it works. Despite being in only two scenes, Eric Avari steals them as Evie's boss who plays a unique roles in the proceedings. The only cast member who really doesn't work is Kevin J. O'Connor. As the cowardice, traitorous Benny, his character works, but O'Connor's shrill and croaky voice is extremely annoying. Surprisingly, O'Connor has been in nearly every movie with writer/director Stephen Sommors, so I guess Sommers finds something appealing about him.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers knows just what to do with his material. He clearly did not take offense to critics trashing his previous movie, ""Deep Rising,"" a reaction that I found unfair. Luckily, studios didn't either. Sommers brings his knack for action and goofy humor to this movie, and its more effectively used here.<br/><br/>Other than O'Connor's annoying performance, ""The Mummy"" suffers from a few problems. There are a few continuity issues here and there, and if one takes this movie too seriously, they will realize that the story makes itself up as it goes along. Nevertheless, it's goofy charm will prevent most people from realizing them.<br/><br/>Great art, this is not. Nor is it a classic like Indiana Jones. But it's still pretty entertaining."

When I see this movie now (after seeing Indiana Jones movies) I still experience the same fun as I did back then. Not that I don't like Indiana (7 out of 10) but I find Mummy much more enjoyable. The goodness in the script is you always get a feeling that movie is offering you what it promised;non stop entertainment. Among the cast Brendan Fraser is awesomely funny. Rachel Weisz is cute ( missed her in Mummy 3) John Hannah made me smile whenever he showed up and Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy) was cool.

"vortex_lip","8","0","0","6 September 2008"," Mummies! Beetles! Sand! WooHoo!
","The Plot: A librarian and her brother save a prisoner from an untimely death by recruiting him to help locate a fabled Egyptian tomb, and set off into the desert to find not only treasure, but a labyrinthine burial ground for a cursed Mummy who, in the course of the adventure, ""accidentally"" becomes resurrected and wreaks havoc on everyone with a fez, dress or gun. <br/><br/>The Pros: More than anything this film is very funny, especially if you pay attention to the witticisms in between the main dialog. Then there's the entertaining and very well done special effects (watch for the scenes with the mummy-induced sand-storms; pretty amazing stuff). The slapstick doesn't make for a very good horror film, but it does still manage to get it's ""grossness-quotient"" in with flesh eating beetles and soul-sucking rotting corpses (great effects again done to make the Mummy appear, well - ""juicy"", as they say in the movie). The acting is as good as it's going to get for a film of this genre, which in my opinion outshines even the Indiana Jones trilogy. Brendan Fraser is just plain perfect - delivering one uproarious line after the other - much more entertaining than Harrison Ford IMHO. Special nod to Rachel Weisz for being unexpectedly funny for what could have been a typical damsel-in-distress role. Check the memorable quotes section for sample dialog - good stuff!<br/><br/>The Cons: The Mummy Returns does not satisfy, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (The Mummy 3) is even worse, and the Scorpion King, which stole it's plot from The Mummy Returns, is worse than drinking bleach. On an empty stomach. <br/><br/>Great Scenes: Omid Djalili as Warden Gad Hassan who, about 45 minutes into the film, runs into the scene screaming and hands clasped atop his fez as beetles devour him alive. I've replayed this scene at least 20 times, and each time it just gets funnier and funnier."

","I thought the Mummy was an awesome movie ever since i was about six or seven years old. It is an ultra-cool movie that contains a bit of horror, humour and adventure. When i was little, i used to watch this movie nearly every weekend, because i thought it was so great. Now, i watch it nowhere near as much but i still find it entertains me greatly. I found some confusion amongst the two moments where the scarabs relieve a man of his flesh in a matter of seconds, and where they say that scarabs eat people very slowly. The obscure fear of cats that the mummy has makes for an interesting twist,( in that they say nothing can harm the mummy, or whatever,) later explaining that cats are the defenders of the underworld. This is a great movie and anyone who hasn't seen it should see it immediately."

","Starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, this atmospheric, $80 million special effects extravaganza emerges as a first-rate, old-fashioned, rip-snorting cliffhanger. Director Stephen Sommers' tongue-in-cheek tale of supernatural terror has about as many sheets in the wind as previous ""Mummy"" yarns. Although earlier ""Mummies"" qualified as little more than the love-sick fantasies of a vindictive Egyptian zombie, this lively incarnation blends elements of Sam Raimi's campy ""Evil Dead"" series with Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to yield a high-octane action adventure spectacle. After sitting through this giddy but ghoulish saga, you won't go home and worry about the phantoms under your bed.<br/><br/>Writer & director Stephen Sommers' creepy but comic version tops even the straightforward, black & white Boris Karloff original! Of course, the 1932 ""Mummy"" remains an undisputed classic, with the Technicolor 1959 Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing opus not far behind. Nevertheless, the new ""Mummy"" serves as the gauge by which all future ""Mummies"" will be measured. This light-hearted but corpse littered chiller captures the period flavor of all of those imperialist British Empire thrillers while it reinvents its infamous rebel with a gauze. Audiences that typically shun fright fests may find its witty, self-depreciating approach here as refreshing as its dazzling state-of-the-art digital foes are dangerous.<br/><br/>Sommers sets the stage with an expository seven minute ""Prince of Egypt"" like prologue. The ancient city of Thebes appears in all its fabulous splendor in the year 1290 B.C. Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo of ""Hard Target""), Pharaoh's trusted high priest, and the ruler's sexy concubine, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez of ""Mindhunters""), are fooling around when Pharaoh Seti I (Aharon Ipale of ""Son of the Pink Panther"") catches them red-handed. Pharaoh covers his scantily clad mistress with tattoos that smear at the least touch so he knows something stinks. Treacherously, Imhotep and Anck Su brandish weapons and assassinate Pharaoh. The gory gutley occurs either off-screen or is shown in warped shadows stretching across the high walls of the temple.<br/><br/>Pharaoh's elite bodyguards arrive too late to save their sire. Instead, they watch in horror as Anck Su disembowels herself after proclaiming her freedom from Pharaoh's slavery. Anck Su's logicsuicidal as it seemsis that only Imhotep can bring her back to life with is powerful sorcery, so she distracts the bodyguards while he makes good his escape. Later, Imhotep has all but reincarnated Anck Su when the gung-ho bodyguards turn up in Hamunaptra, the city of the Dead, and skewer his skullduggery. Imhotep suffers a fate worse than death. His captors remove his tongue so he cannot scream, wrap him from head to toe in burial linen and lock him up alive in an escape-proof crypt with scores of vicious, cannibalistic scarabs designed to chomp on him for an eternity. According to the prophecy, Imhotep must never arise, least he unleash the ten plagues upon Egypt! The story flashes forward to the year 1923 amid the ruins of Hamunaptra as an outnumbered French Foreign Legion battalion fights an army of tribal horsemen armed with rifles. Meanwhile, from a nearby cliff, the descendents of Pharaoh's bodyguard watch as the desert warriors annihilate the hapless French. Swathed in black robes like Ninjas, with tattoos on their cheeks, they have sworn themselves to guard the crypt of the mummy. Only Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser of ""Gods & Monsters""), a Yankee adventurer in the Legion and a pathetic soldier Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Conner of ""Van Helsing"") survive the massacre. Beni hides in a crypt, while Rick flees into the desert. The bodyguards decide not to kill Rick because they believe that the Sahara will finish him off. Miraculously, O'Connell survives and makes his way to Cairo where he winds up in prison with a hangman's noose in his future.<br/><br/>Forward the story leaps another couple of years. Sommers introduces us to Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz of ""Eragon""), an attractive but disaster-prone librarian in the Cairo-based Museum of Antiquities. In one of the funniest scenes, Evelyn knocks down a bookcase when she tries to shelve a misplaced tome. This incident triggers a domino effect that topples the rest of the bookcases in a perfect circle around the room. This marvelously staged gag rivals some of Buster Keaton's legendary stunts in his silent movies. Naturally, the curator (Erick Avari of ""Stargate"") reprimands Eve, but he cannot fire her because of her late parents' philanthropy for the library. Anyway, Evelyn is a first-class Egyptologist who wants to prove that she is more than just a pretty face. Later, while Evelyn is cleaning up her mess, she stumbles onto her drunken rouge of a brother, Jonathan (John Hannah of ""Sliding Doors'), in a display gallery. He shows her a neat Rubic's cube type box with a treasure map to Hamunaptra. Jonathan reveals that he stole it from Rick O'Connell who is scheduled to hang on the gallows at Cairo Prison. Evelyn strikes a bargain with the greedy warden (Omid Djalili of ""Mean Machine"") and wins Rick's freedom.<br/><br/>""Deep Rising"" director Stephen Sommers has turned up the heat on what would rate as little more than a pulpy but palatable potboiler. Most ""Mummy"" movies are pedestrian, but Sommers' ""Mummy"" benefits from the kind of writing that you find in the adventures of Edgar Rice Burroughs, H. Rider Haggard, and Rudyard Kipling. ""The Mummy"" whirls along at a breakneck pace, bristling with thrills, chills, and frills. The hero is appropriately stalwart, the damsel is naturally gorgeous, and the villain eminently formidable. They embark on a long journey wallpapered with danger and excitement. Let's not forget about those grisly bugs that can crawl under your skin and strip the flesh off you like piranha. The performances are uniformly fun. Arnold Vosloo takes top honors as the moody Imhotep. Although he doesn't deliver much dialogue, Vosloo has enormous screen presence. Happily, he never tries to look anything like Boris Karloff.<br/><br/>If you plunge into ""The Mummy"" looking for nightmares, prepared to be disappointed."

","9 may seem way too much for an adventure film with not many under-the-surface messages if any at all, but believe me folks, it is well deserved! Since I was a little boy, anything and everything pertaining to Ancient Egyptian culture intrigued me like did nothing else. That is not really a very rare trait I had. But pitifully, it has never been much exploited by the almighty Hollywood. Other than cheap B-movies that dealt with cursed ankhs giving archeologists (who look like Peter North) a heightened libido, Egypt was not a context of mainstream film-making. Not many gifted directors tried to look into the real deal. Just like the concept of vampires, the concept of mummies coming back to life to take care of unfinished business (as funny as that may sound) has mostly been a context of derision, until Stephen Sommers.<br/><br/>Unlike the old fashioned directors with a patriotic agenda, modern America has produced a handful of gifted directors such a Stephen Sommers and Gore Verbinski. Instead of sweating their brains over ridiculous conspiracies inside CIA and FBI, Stephen Sommers made something which can be loved and enjoyed 100% by a person of just about any age group and ethnicity. He made use of beliefs and fantasies that were around for hundreds of years, if not thousands, but were never properly utilized before. It is a very difficult task to make a film which promises absolute entertainment in every single scene. To accomplish that, the director needs to be obsessed with the myths and legends himself. No one made TITANIC before James Cameron because they could not relate to the theme at the core of their heart. For exactly the same reason, The Mummy is truly the first of its kind.<br/><br/>Many people said this is more like the return of Indiana Jones. But is it truly? Indy had been to Egypt. We saw some real state-of-the-art camera work in there. But can anyone recall feeling even remotely fascinated about Egypt after watching Raiders of the Lost Ark? Egypt was more like a ground where Indy beat the Nazis in their own game. It could have been Madagascar instead and there would be no basic difference. It also had many not-so-sublime messages of communalism, which I did not dislike personally, but drastically lowered the cinematic value of the motion picture.<br/><br/>With once-in-a-lifetime performances from Brenden Fraser, Rachel Weisz and Oded Fehr, backed by a truly mindblowing musical score from Jerry Goldsmith and awe-inspiring photography and art direction, The Mummy is a film for those who are in love with Egypt, dying to get a true flavour but annoyed and bored with the cheap ideations. It is also for those who love no-nonsense memorable adventure films with the perfect balance of humour. Humour plays a very crucial role in just about any film. Filmmakers often seem to overdo it or leave it out of the equation. This film shows a wonderful balance of seriousness and humour. A little more humour and it could be sadly comic, a little less could make things a little less entertaining.<br/><br/>There is no point in trying to explore if everything shown in this film has historical significance or value, though some of the things indeed do. Watch this film to seek true charm, and charmed you shall be! What better background can there be to embellish the story-canvas of obscure passion and exotic desires with than ancient Egypt? This is one of the 10 most memorably entertaining films I have seen. After watching it a hundred times over, I feel childishly thrilled to watch it from the start again. Same goes for the sequel ""The Mummy Returns"", though I would not rate it so high. There is no time like the first time!<br/><br/>A timeless exotic adventure classic."

","The Mummy is definitely not a great film from an objective standpoint; there are an awful lot of plot holes and things that don't make a great deal of sense, and the characters often do things for no other reason than that the plot dictates they must. Still, Stephen Sommers hits the perfect balance of epic adventure, humor, and thrills to make the quintessential popcorn movie. The Mummy is sort of like those old creature features you used to stay up and watch on late night television, except that it's actually fun and silly and doesn't take itself seriously whatsoever.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, the photography is gorgeous (particularly in the desert sequences), the jokes are, if not hilarious, at least harmless enough, the special effects are decent but limited by the technology of the time, and the music is pretty good.

"TheUnknown837-1","9","0","0","8 March 2008"," one of the quintessential action-comedy movies and a lot of fun
","""The Mummy"" is exactly the kind of science-fiction action picture that I tend to enjoy. It is one of those rare cases where thrills are combined with jokes that ultimately create a realistic and authentistic sense for the atmosphere of the picture and proves itself to be a great roller coaster of a ride without ever becoming too scary or too funny to become schlock, boring, or even uninteresting. It plays itself perfectly, lasts exactly as long as it should, has the right amount of jokes (intelligent jokes), great characters, an interesting plot if not original, and is overall a lot of fun.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" stars Brandon Fraser as a young adventurer-gunfighter who has visited the sacred Egyptian city of Hammunaptra, which is guarded by a secret society who believe that a cursed mummy lies beneath the sands and if awakened, would be unstoppable. Fraser returns to Hammunaptra with a naive, but intelligence librarian and her brother, and oppose a rival company of Americans seeking treasure. Sooner or later, as the secret society feared, the mummy is awaken and great danger is set loose in the world.<br/><br/>The special effects utilized in ""The Mummy"" are utterly convincing. Arnold Vosloo played the mummy in both skin and mummy form and it was up to the special effects team to elaborately convert him into this ugly, contorted, and frightening villain with holes and bugs in him. The mummy mostly roars like a monster, necessarily, and when needed, he talks in a growling, low-pitch voice that makes him scary. And no mortal weapon can kill him, making him a tricky foe to conquer. And of course, he's got his humble servants: more mummies. Not invincible like him, but still effectively brought to the screen.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" also features a fair deal of action scenes, most of them gunfights. The body count in the film is considerably high, and I'm talking about people as well as resurrected mummies. Because it's a fun part-comedy adventure ride, it does not take the matter of life and death seriously. So if a civilian ends up having to shoot a man dead, it does not seem to have an ever-lasting effect on them, but it should not. That would slow the pacing down and destroy the overall effect of the movie. And yes, some of the fight scenes were a bit ridiculous. Yes, I noticed Brandon Fraser firing a six-shot revolver more than six times without reloading, but seriously, who cares? How many times has that been done before? Dozens. We glance over them, so we can glance over this.<br/><br/>Again, this is exactly the kind of film I enjoy. Even critics who found some not-so-positive things to say about ""The Mummy"" admitted that they were never bored with it. And neither was I. It is a quintessential thrill ride full of adventure, laughs, and lots of fun. Overall, it's entertaining."
"vip_ebriega","10","0","0","5 October 2007"," The best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies.
","My Take: It's tons of fun and what else should it be? <br/><br/>Summer movies have become too complicated over its last few years. But THE MUMMY brings back the old-fashioned action movie tradition. They have this belief that the old-school feel still works, and it really does. THE MUMMY may not be a totally perfect summer movie, but it's still darn good ""can't take your eyes of the screen"" entertainment, but the best thing about it is it has almost everything you want in summer movies. Whether it's adventure, thrills, horror, suspense and laughs, THE MUMMY makes all these formulas work and work together forming a delightful summer blockbuster that delivers entertainment that aren't just special effects.<br/><br/>The opening sequence features, perhaps, one of the best and most convincing shot of an Egyptian civilization. It was such a convincing combination of model shots, matte effects and actual shots that its believable. It is perhaps one of the best recreation of ancient Egypt since, perhaps, the large-scale sets in Cecil B. DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS in 1956, which we now know is only made in a studio. This one was actually more convincing, including shots of large pyramids and the crowds and chariots. This opening introduces the Pharaoh's head priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) who has an affair with the Pharaoh's mistress. As punishment, he is to be mummified alive, having flesh-eating beetles feed on his flesh.<br/><br/>This is then changed in to the usual formula of old-fashioned adventure flicks wherein they must find the ancient lost city, uncover its untold wealth and leads to the deadly curse. Then they add the explorers' curiosities which unlocks the deadly curse and unleashes the mummy Imhotep loose on earth. Let the good times roll! <br/><br/>The action sequences get a bit silly (even with the spectacular effects) and the storyline borderline ridiculous, but that's just the point. THE MUMMY is a throwback to the good ol' action-adventures of yore, and frankly, there's not much of them to go around anymore. Brendan Fraser (as Indiana Jones-inspired Rick O'Connell) and Rachel Weisz (as the adorable intrepid Evelyn), and some adorable witty dialog manage to occupy as much screen-time as the action and suspense. The action sequences, of course, are terrific in their own way. The sight of a creatures' face suddenly rise above the sand is some show of terrific special effects (and to think seeing a sandstorm up close is amazing enough).<br/><br/>Along with INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE MUMMY is perhaps one of the decades loudest, most exciting, most gimmicky summer action movie of its decade. Just like the other said film, I enjoyed the film more than just for its special-effects. This one has story, characters and a celebration of screen excitement (all good), a bunch of elements much needed, especially to today's summer flicks. THE MUMMY, perhaps, may be among the few special effects-bound movies were I don't criticize the special effects, which usually becomes the centerpiece in summer movies. This one has story to go along with it, and, boy, was it a good one.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","This movie is not Shakespeare, and it knows it. This movie is all about scares and laughs. Brenden Fraser is terrific as Rick O'Connell, soldier and adventurer.

","this is a very satisfying movie experience for action fans and horror fans alike.the movie follows the story of an American serving in the french legion who during battle stumbles upon some ancient ruins, which hold secrets of its own and years later becomes part of the adventure of the American,a librarian and her nerdy but likable brother and several treasure hunters who all in the process awaken an ancient curse.what i liked the most about the movie the amazing adventure setting and the action sequences that go with it, the visuals,locations and sets are mouthwatering and fit perfectly with the characters in it. the movie also has a comedic charm to it with an array of likable and dislikable characters that are perfect for a good vs evil battle.the story and the acting are very good too.in the end this is a great movie that you should watch if you are an action/adventure fan and even if you're not you should check it out you might be surprised."

","This movie is complete with a great plot, amazing special effects, and hilarious humor. Im not the one to sit down and watch action movies but this one really sucked me in. With all the mummies roaming around it had its little horror moments, but with the cast it had like Brendan Frasier you are sure to laugh quite a few times. The battle scenes and the scene where the army of mummies were coming towards the pyramid was amazing, and the sound is incredible you feel like your in the movie theater.

","Stephen Sommers' ""The Mummy"" (1999) is exactly what a summer action-adventure flick should be. ""The Mummy"" begins in ancient Egypt when the Pharaoh's choice concubine, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) and High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo), kill the Pharaoh and Anck Su Namun kills herself. Heartbroken, Imhotep attempts to raise her from the dead, but is stopped by the Pharaoh's guards. For his crime, Imhotep is mummified alive and cursed, never to enter the after life. But in 1923, an archaeological dig awakens the Mummy. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother, Jonathon (John Hannah), vow to destroy the Mummy. They are aided by the mysterious Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), a man who's people have guarded the Mummy for centuries. When I first saw the cast list for ""The Mummy"", I was skeptic; Brendan Fraser as an action hero? But he pulls it off and is exactly what the character of Rick requires- a goofy guy who somehow manages to save the world. Weisz is wonderful as well. Surprisingly, Evelyn Carnahan is a dimensional character, rather than just some floozy stuck into the film as a romantic interest for our hero. But the best performance has to go to John Hannah. Whenever he is on screen, I can't take my eyes off of him and I laugh at almost every line he utters. As it is a Stephen Sommers film, the special effects are of course amazing  for 1999 at least, and are quite good even now. I like to call the mummy a ""pre-Pirates of the Caribbean creature"". But it's great despite the major advancements since then. The script is also well done (it was written by Sommers as well), containing some incredibly entertaining dialogue and plot twists. If you are like me and enjoy action-adventure films, than ""The Mummy"" is another film you must see. Definitely in my top 10 films."

OK so I'm not the best judge cuz I'm a fan of Brendan Fraser, sue me! I put these movies in my collection between Frankenstein for old horror movies and any of the living dead movies cuz... lets face it the mummy is dead! The CG in this movie for its time is splendid, the points when Imhotep's corpse jaw moves around on his face, turning flesh to rot and rot to flesh... that was brilliant. The sand storms caused by his travel and even the point when he tries to eat Fraser with a sand storm were well done. The blending between CG and mummy's in the final battles were spot on. The acting was... well what can I say? It was what it was. Every person did well in there rolls, right down to the little brat boy chicken poop of a brother, the ""I'll take what I can get"" Beni, and the piggish prison guard. Rachel Weisz is a goddess simple as that.

","The Mummy tells the story of a treasure hunter who teams up with a librarian/archaeologist and her brother so they can travel to the City of the Dead in Egypt so she can find the golden Book of the Living. Along the way, they come into conflict with a larger team who are hunting treasure. Both teams discover the Book of the Dead, and when the librarian reads from it, she unknowingly raises a mummy from its tomb. Now the mummy wants to use her as a sacrifice to raise his lover from the grave, and the treasure hunter must face the mummy to protect her. This is a loose remake of the 1932 horror classic, only instead of a horror, they've turned it into an exciting action film, and it's great.<br/><br/>The Mummy is visually stunning as well as a well written and well acted film. It shows what ancient Egypt really looked like, and the sets are really great. The ancient Egyptian sets are probably the most realistic of any film. This movie is really well written and well paced. It has a great blend of action and comedy, which I like in a movie. The special effects are nearly flawless, especially in the scene where a giant wall of sand is chasing after a small bi-plane. The reason this movie is so good is because it manages to take a story that's been done before, re-imagine it, and make it an exciting action movie that never loses pace or slows down.<br/><br/>The acting is really good as well. Brandon Fraser does really good as the treasure hunter who will stop at nothing to kill the mummy. Rachel Weisz is very good in her breakout role as the librarian. John Hannah is hilarious as her bumbling brother.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great action movie that makes me anxious to see if Universal can remake some more of their classics with an action twist.<br/><br/>8/10"

Now it's up to Rick O'Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, to rescue her. With tons of action and a totally cool plot, this movie is a great edition to any movie collection. Fraser is awesome as O'Connell, who knows something is alive under the sand of Hamunaptra, City of The Dead, and then he has to stop the evil from spreading. He is a funny action hero, and he does his best work in this movie. Rachel Weisz does a super job. John Hannah plays her brother Johnathon, who is some of the comedic support. Kevin J.

Meanwhile, Rick O'Conell and Evelyn (the ones who have awaken the mummy) will do all they could to stop the Mummy, because, if he wins, the world will be destroyed. It is a precious adventures movie like the best classics of the genre. It has spectacular Special Effects, too: the scene of Imhotep turned into a sand storm catching and airplane is superb, for example, and not is the only good FX scene... One of the best secondary characters is Evelyn's brother, the typical dumb character that puts the comic note in it, curiously, results really funny and it never bores in his not so selfish acts. In the plot there is something to show. How the good loving imhotep turns later in the evil Mummy? I realize that his death can make him a little angry, but it results a little curious. (In the second part become clear that he is not bad, but that he will not any effort for being good, he only wants to be with her love and the other thing are irrelevant). One thing to unline is the surprisingly good acting of Vosloo as the Mummy, without speaking almost anything, it results perfect convincing, and you can know lots of things about his personality, only by his actions. To sum up, this is a good adventures film to enjoy the time seeing a classic adventure movie, that can be condensed in three phrases: save the pretty girl, kill the bad one, save the world."

","The Mummy is a classic-style action film which doesn't take itself too seriously (and in this case that style works!). Director Stephen Sommers hits mostly the right marks in this film (and the same can be said for the sequel The Mummy Returns). I love the character interaction between actors Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weisz, with John Hannah providing the proper comic relief, Oded Fehr as the wise warrior, and Arnold Vosloo as an imposing title character. And I would like to mention the incredible and superior score by film composer legend Jerry Goldsmith - this is one of his best in his career (matching his scores for Star Trek The Motion Picture and Total Recall in its uniqueness).

"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","0","29 August 2005"," Running fast and moving backwards...
","This remake in name only of the 1932 Karloff movie of the same name is one of those blockbusters churned out by the studios each summer: slick, glossy, high-concept, and loaded with special effects which dispense with the need for any A-list stars. It demands nothing of the viewer other than the ability to follow the simplest of plots  ""What's the plan?"" asks rummy pilot Winston of our hero O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) at one point. ""Rescue the damsel in distress, kill the bad guy, save the world,"" replies O'Connell, and you can almost hear some secretary buzzing her faceless studio exec boss each September and reminding him it's time to get rolling on another of those 'save the damsel, kill the bad guy, save the world' flicks the kids like so much. The studios have created something of a rod for their own backs, however; each year, they have to outdo the previous year's product, which means ever greater effects  at the expense, of course, of such luxuries as plot and characterisation. That's not to say The Mummy is a bad film  it's not. It does exactly what it sets out to do which isn't to create a work of any artistic or creative merit but to provide the multiplex crowd with a visceral experience that they will tell their friends is 'cool' and 'awesome'. The film succeeds impressively at this. They will tell their friends it 'rocks', and then forget all about it after they see the next one off the production line. In 1984 Kyle Reese told Sarah Connor: ""It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead."" Fifteen years later Ardeth Bay tells Rick O'Connell: ""This creature is a bringer of death. He will never eat, he will never sleep, he will never stop."" That's how far we've come.<br/><br/>See what a lifetime of watching movies does to you? It turns you into a cynic. You begin to learn too much about the films you see, in a sense, so that it takes more than a few explosions and special effects to impress you. The trick is to switch off sometimes, to just let the whole experience roll over you like a gigantic noisy tidal wave that demands nothing of you other than to be swept away by its magnitude.<br/><br/>This one stars Brendan Fraser, a strange leading man; he hasn't been out of work for fifteen years, and in that time he has starred in a string of critical and/or commercial successes and yet his name refuses to become a truly major one in the industry. It's as if he's cursed. He plays former legionnaire Rick O'Connell in this one, languishing in an Egyptian jail until he is saved from hanging by Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz), the world's sexiest librarian, in order that he can help her and her cowardly brother (John Hannah) to find the hidden city of Hamunaptra, where a unimaginable evil waits to be unleashed upon the world. Of course, unleashed it is, and we are subsequently treated to a succession of CGI effects that, six years on, range from mildly impressive to distinctly dodgy as our heroes dash from one predicament to another. It's all good mindless fun at first, A Raiders of the Lost Ark for a new generation, but with more emphasis on violence and gunplay and SFX. O'Connell is no smarter than Indiana Jones was, he's just a reactive hero who leaves all the thinking to the pretty Weisz, who is agreeably cute as the naïve and gullible Evelyn. Unfortunately, the constant fleeing from an assortment of perils that make up the whole of the second half of this movie grows increasingly tiresome after a while. I started growing impatient for the ending rather than worrying over the fate of Rick and Evelyn.<br/><br/>All in all this is a fairly harmless film, an insignificant way to spend a couple of hours if you're going to watch this on the big screen. If you're going to watch this on TV, you're going to inevitably focus more on the acting and characterisation, the plot and continuity (which is truly atrocious at times) and the editing. Don't. Turn off that analytical part of your mind and watch with your eyes only. If you do that you're sure to have a lot of fun"

It was anachronistic -- too much 1999, not enough 1923-'26.<br/><br/> Still, it has its moments. Some of the fights are fairly rousing, even if the style of gunplay is a bit fanciful. The big final battle in the tomb, where the hero has finally run completely out of ammunition, and has to fall back on cold steel, or cold bronze, as the case may be, is interesting and a little reminiscent of the big sword fight with the skeleton army in 1963's _Jason and the Argonauts-, which probably inspired it."

It is a great fast paced action movie with the only real horror being the fact the good guys are up against a mummy.  This one had the better plot of the two mummy movies, but the sequel had the better action so I like them about the same.  This one has them discovering the lost city and awakening the mummy from his sleep.  He starts out all rotted, but as he kills the group that awoke him he regains his former body. Brendan Fraser is rather good in this one as the hero.  The rest of the cast does rather good too, though no real big name stars were used in the other roles.  Some pretty good special effects too, though they are definitely not the best ever witnessed on the big screen.  This movie is just an old-fashioned action movie though so it works.

I thought the special effects were cool and the scenes where The Mummy was regenerating himself were cool. The Mummy was an interesting character too.

The scarabs sent chills down my spine, and the Egyptian setting just adds to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>I am an Egypt freak, and this movie certainly adds to the mystery and attraction of the ancient culture. The temples, the outfits, the royal scandal, make this an interesting plot, but in some points the scenes are a little corny.<br/><br/>The dialogue is funny and clever, but sometimes falls short. It is best to just leave this movie as is, a thrilling adventure with a touch of adventure, rather than trying to make it out as a serious classic. A Hollywood blockbuster yes but one of the considerably better ones."

","Stephen Sommer's rib-elbowing adventure film is the kind of movie most of us hope to see, but rarely do, when we trade our cash for a seat at the theatre.  Humor, horror, adventure, history, romance, all spooned onto a very full plate that somehow manages to balance these elements and leave us satisfied.  With a rousing score and characters that seem to have leapt out of the broad-brush-stroked adventure novels of yesteryear, the movie spares no adventurous twist, no tongue-in-cheek movie reference, and no visual effect to bring the biggest, most absurd, most mummified actioner to the screen (and now, your home screen...).  Watch it with a bag of popcorn and a readiness to catch all the jokes as they bounce by (and for lovers of DVD director's commentary tracks, the interplay between Sommers and his long-time editor Bob Ducsay rivals any radio morning-show banter, and actually makes the film even funnier...). All in all, a worthwhile ride."

","This movie is not deep and the characters are cartoon like, but still it's a lot of fun. Let's face it, this is a horror/adventure movie, which are seldom thought of as great movies. The movie is loosely based on the original with Boris Carloff ( which I have not seen ). The plot revolves around a high priest named Imhotep, who, 2000 years ago, had an affair with the Pharoah's wife and, upon being caught, Imhotep and the Pharoah's wife kill the Pharoah. Imhotep escapes and the Pharoah's wife kills herself thinking that Imhotep will revive her. He tries to do just that but is interrupted by Pharoah's henchmen who mummify Imhotep and bury him alive. 2000 years later, a band of fortune hunters stumble upon the crypt and accidentally bring the mummy back to life. The rest of the movie deals with trying to destroy the mummy before he fully regenerates and completes his plan to revive the Pharoah's wife.<br/><br/>The movie features spectacular special effects and a surprisingly good performance from Brendan Fraser as an Indiana Jones type adventurer. In fact, if you liked the Indiana Jones movies, you'll love this movie also. Again, don't look for any deep themes or rounded characters - you won't find them in this movie, but you will find lots of fun and high adventure in this movie."

","""The Mummy"", while hardly an arty movie, is a very good action/adventure film, with a cool villian.<br/><br/>   The movie starts off (as others have noticed) like an ""Indiana Jones"" film, and could very well be one.  From the prologue set in ancient Egypt (setting the background for our bad guy) and the opening battle scene (between the Tuaregs and the French Foreign Legion [?]) to the last scene as the four survivors ride off into the sunset, this is exciting, non-stop.<br/><br/>   Well, the basic plot goes: an American mercenary (Brendan Fraiser) fighting somewhere in Africa (here is a continuity problem, I guess; if you're well-read, the Tuaregs live in Algieria, Morrocco, Western Sahara, and Nigeria [though Fraiser mentions being in Libya, which was a Turkish/Italian colony anyway]) gets cornered by his Tuareg adversaries. Just as they're about to kill him, their horses suddenly go wild, and a huge face appears in the sand.  <br/><br/>   Later, librarian Evy Carnahan (Rachiel Weisz) hires Fraiser to help her locate Hapunatra (sp.?), the city of the dead.  With another team of Americans (led by Beni, Fraiser's ""friend"" from the Foreign Legion), they find the city, only to let loose Imhotep (Arnold Voosloo), a vampiric creature who must suck the organs from those who were present at the opening of his tomb.  His goal: to resurrect mistress Anuck-Sun-Ahumn (Patricia Velazquez), using Evy as a sacrifice, with Fraiser, Evy's brother Jonathan (John Hannah), mysterious cult leader (and initially the bad guy) Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr), and British RAF veteran Winston Havelot (Edward Fox) in hot persuit.  There's enough bugs, gunbattles, action, romance, one-liners, organ-sucking, sword fights, undead mummies, and suspense to keep you interested for quite a while.<br/><br/>   Very good.  If you want other comments, read other reviews, please.<br/><br/>   Eight stars."

","With the exceptions of plot & film design & Sp.FX the way on how you can rate this film is its PG-13 content I'll show you: (This is not something I do commonly) Violence:Incredibly over-gruesome! at least the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the film's gory parts(which proves that censored graphic violence can have a good side which in this case prevented this film to be a dumb gorefest),this film along with the corpse Sp.FX make the much better film(**** out of 5 stars to be specific)transformers the movie look like a epidose from ""Barney & Friends""(note it did had its fair share of over-brutal violence but no where near enough as much as this film) Language:like most films(Top Gun,MST3K the movie,notable exceptions) the language wasn't all that needed but that's no big deal here. Brief Nudity:Don't be fooled by this part (note I'm NOT one of those hormone-surging perverts),there was no nudity in this film just the princess in the film was wearing an incredibly revealing outfit - true she was almost nude but not enough to be ""must be covered not to be seen by children"" type of nudity,so basically there was no nudity. Sp.FX:Most of the Sp.FX in this film saved it from a much worse review,some of it actually helped to bring it down,The impressive:the Sp.FX in the beginning were actually the best as if they had help from the people of Pixar(Toy story,A Bug's Life),but after the ancient egypt prologue what wasn't in the unimpressive list did look well done but not as much in the prologue,unimpressive:I'll start with the mildest the face in the sand wasn't all that impressive,the 2nd worst the scarabs were more like leeches in this film & besides they more looked like little blue blobs than scarabs,now the worst the corpses(I can't really call them mummies which i'll get to in the plot),for the pre-teen to adult it'll more than likely nauseate you if you see the corpses on a moderately-to-full stomach & it places this film from the intended ""Well too scary for li'l kids"" to ""Would probably traumatize to at least place li'l kids in thearapy for a long while"" & the recently dead corpse's I'd wish the filmmakers were nice enough to block out the scenes of those corpses (but they wouldn't)<br/><br/>Plot:A big problem to a big helper in this film,the plot is completelly weak & is rather bad at times(the only actual mummies in this film were the priests when they were mummified alive),& like what I'd said before the scarabs mostly were more like leeches,& the film was a big mild ""ROTLArk"" parody not too mention that after I'd seen the reviews here I'd have to admit the pilot guy was rather wasted,but the only light part of the Plot & film was the moderately funny one-liners they'd never contend to great comic films but at least it gives a comic break from most of the films plot(not to mention the ancient-egyptian love scandal during the prologue was a little weak too)<br/><br/>Film Design:What most I can tell you here is more relev. to the other areas,So I tell you a couple of noticed film flubs,1 the anubis jar tops -1 of them is a brass St.Wrs Yoda head I'd kid you not, 2nd when im-ho-top got his arm chopped off you can see the metal wiring on the sliced off arm before he placed it back on So in short:the 2 main reasons why I saw this film were 1:a mother's day present for my mother I saw it with her,2: (I know there's still plenty of the year) but I saw it so I've actually seen a movie this year(the last time I'd went to the M.Theaters was seeing the Rugrats movie back in Dec.98),so even though most of the special effects were impressive & the one-liners were funny the rest of this film is a freaky-I.J stylish-monster-mummy movie."

The minor characters are also very well handled. While the plot is fairly straight-lined, there are some pretty good lines. For instance, when a polyglot would-be victim importunes the ancient Egyptian monster in a variety of languages, brandishing the corresponding religious symbol of each, the mummy ignores all until he gets to Hebrew. ""Ah, the language of the slaves,"" he says, sparing the man's life, ""You may be useful.""<br/><br/>Kids, don't try to pick up too much Egyptian history from this tale.

","You take the first rate production values (and lame script) of ""Congo;"" mix in the undead, book of the dead that is accidentally used to release the villain, & the goofy protagonist of ""Army of Darkness"" and have everyone convince themselves they're doing the next Indiana Jones movie. Half bake for 2 hours and you've got ""The Mummy."" This movie is to Raiders what ID4 was Star Wars:  Lame junk that may vaguely remind you of a classic while making a mint based solely on top notch special effects.<br/><br/>What's good about the movie:  Likable cast and great CGI.  Set Design is top drawer as well. Also if you have kids it will scare them without traumatizing them for life.  Most of the grisly action takes place off screen or in silhouette.<br/><br/>What's not so good:  Brendan Fraser plays his usual goofy guy that people loved in ""George of the Jungle.""  He also (like Chris O'Donnell in ""In Love and War"") cannot play a non-contemporary character. This fact is really another caveat (however unintentional) to Bruce Campbell's hero in ""Army of Darkness.  Fraser is not alone in his plight however, as every American character in the supporting cast would be hard to believe as a person from 1975 let alone 1925. Luckily they are all so non-descript and are killed off so quickly you'll have to think hard to remember any of them.<br/><br/>The action scenes are done like a video game.  Fraser runs around with two guns that hold impossibly large quantities of bullets shooting everything that moves.  These types of scenes are really exciting when done with style like John Woo, however, that never happens in this movie.  The hand to hand combat also reminded me of playing Double Dragon on my old Nintendo system. The moment where you actually suspend your disbelief and worry that the hero won't succeed never occurs.<br/><br/>
The supporting cast is mostly unremarkable.  Rachel Weisz (the poor man's Helena Bonham Carter) is quite beautiful but so are the Rocky Mountains and she lacks their depth.  It's not really fair to put her down that way, let's just say she's equal to the material she has to work with.<br/><br/>Kevin J. O'Conner just does an ethnic version of the same character he played in writer/director Stepehn Sommers' last opus ""Deep Rising."" (I suppose he is Toshiro Mifune to Sommers' Kurosawa.) Granted Mr. O'Connor is reprising a role from a movie no one saw and he plays it well so I guess he could actually qualify as a highlight. He certainly is trotted out whenever they need comic relief.  As a bonus to fans of ""Bewitched"" Dr. Bombay also makes an appearance as a WW1 bi-plane pilot.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, this certainly isn't a bad film...just dopey. Remove the digital effects and it's a Roger Corman movie.  Unlike the effects heavy Matrix there is not a single innovative idea to be enjoyed.  This movie will linger with you about as long as it takes you to digest your popcorn into what the script was from the beginning."

","Very loosely based on the 1932 horror classic comes this action-packed adventure set in the 1920s about a devoted Egyptologist (Weisz) who hires a brash American soldier/treasure hunter (Fraser) to lead her to the allegedly cursed city of Hamunaptra to retrieve an ancient and invaluable Egyptian artifact. Their presence spells doom for all those involved as they inadvertently awaken a powerful, undead Egyptian priest (Vosloo) who carries a dreaded 3,000-year-old curse that threatens to obliterate all humanity. Doesn't quite measure up to the Indiana Jones franchise that it closely resembles, but exciting action scenes, good visual effects and scares, and a surprising since of humor make it lots of fun. A little too goofy to be your ideal action-adventure, but a good way to pass the time. ***"

","This is my absolute favorite movie! I first watched it at a friends house last year. It was a few weeks ago I saw it again. It was a Friday night and my younger sister and I were flipping through the channels when I noticed the scene where Rick (Brendan Frasier) and Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor) are about to open fire on the approaching horsemen. I told her to hold on and explained what movie it was. Since then, I've seen it seven times on the same channel.<br/><br/>My male cousin enjoyed it for the action (there's some form of a lethal weapon in nearly every scene!). My sister liked it for the comedy. I myself liked everything about it; ancient Egypt has always held my interest.<br/><br/>It was a good movie. All the characters seemed to be given to the appropriate people.<br/><br/>Just one thing: why did Beni say, ""Nice camel,"" when he himself was riding one? It doesn't make the show any worse, but that didn't make sense. I guess it's because they wanted Beni to fall off the camel, and I doubt Rick could've reached him if he was riding a horse. (should've cut the comment then, huh?)<br/><br/>Over all, it was great, and I don't see why so many people were complaining about the jokes. Lighten up a bit, people!"

","Brendan Fraser is one of my many favorite actors.  In The Mummy he plays the hero Rick O'Connell.  It's the story about a sarcophogus that's accidently released and wreaks havoc until it captures a librarian (Rachel Weisz) to make him invincible.  I really enjoyed this movie because of the action, suspense, romance, and it's over the top humor.  The Mummy has something in it for anyone to enjoy.<br/><br/>  It's no wonder this movie was popular during it's theatrical release.  The lead female character was actually smart and tough.  The antagonist Beni and the girl's older brother (John Hanna) were wimps!   Brendan Fraser sure has come a lot way since ""Encino Man"".  I also liked some of his other movies, too and I'll see the sequel when I get the chance.  In conclusion The Mummy is a very captivating and enjoyable movie.  Catch it if you can!  I hope to see more of Brendan Fraser's work in the future."

","Okay... this may sound harsh... And I'm sure BF is a real stand up guy and all when he's off screen and I really wouldn't blame him all to much for being in this film (maybe his manager via a nice working paycheck) plus the sequel... but what in blazes was casting thinking when they green-lighted his role in these two films.<br/><br/>I would equate it to casting Tatoo from Fantasy island as Dr. Zhivago.<br/><br/>Come on give me a flipping break... I immediately stopped believing in his character and every actor coming into contact with him within a one mile radius. I've never quite seen an actor ""glaze"" through a role like this one. Plus with his ""acting"" played opposite super cool special effects it just made his ""performance"" seem even more contrived. Sure it's not easy working around special effects when you can't see what's there. But the same goes for performances... cause I kept waiting for his to show up!

I'd say more about the other actors but It's hard to comment when you can't see straight from the blinding light of ignorant casting.<br/><br/>What's next for Mummy III, IV and V.

","Where to begin?  I had heard mixed things regarding The Mummy, but i must say that it met and even surpassed all of my expectations.  It feels just like a Saturday matinee, with great action, great comedy, and great thrills. The most important thing to keep in mind for this film is that it is not meant to be any single one genre, but rather a very effective mix of these genres.<br/><br/>The elements of horror are perhaps better described as thrills, as The Mummy tends to rely on a few ""things that pop out"" scares. This helps create a sort of background tension that crops up throughout the first half of the film, in spite of the rather goofy humour.  The action sequences are well-done as well, adding to the conglomeration of genres represented. The overall effect is a movie that spreads itself perhaps just a trifle thin, but still provides an excellent amount of fun and adventure."

","I first caught this movie on my pay-tv service. Having not been to the theatres in almost eight years I wish I had seen this one on the big screen. It deserves to be seen there not on a 28-inch television that lacks the ability to show the movies beautiful landscapes. The cast of Brendan Fraser, Rahel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr, Kevin J. O'Connor, Jonathan Hyde, Erick Avari, Aharon Ipale, Patricia Velasquez, Tuc Watkins, Stephen Dunham, Corey Johnson, Omid Djalili and Bernard Fox are magnificent. I listed them all because I feel this movie wouldn't have worked without a single one of them. This movie worked not only because of them but because of Stephen Sommers' able direction and writing. From the moment it opens the audience is transformed to a world where the impossible is possible. I believed this movie. It had a heart at its centre and a truth far beyond anything that has been filmed in the genre of late. Boris Karloff fans and admirers of the original 1932 version will be disappointed, but please give this one a shot. It has all the elements of those old classics and more. Sommers has done his homework on this one replete  with all the Egyptian lore. I think though he excells in capturing the feel of the time and essence of flawed chracters. There isn't one character in this movie that isn't flawed and that is fresh. These days you have characters played by actors who aren't supposed to be flawed (Harrison Ford). You accept these idiosyncrasies as endearing traits and either root for them or boo them depending on the side you take. Particular attention should be paid to the music. Jerry Goldsmith scores a big one here. His lush love themes and expansive melodies (epecially the Caravan and the Camel Race) are reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia. If I could give this one more than a ten star rating I would. All I can say is, I reccomend this movie highly. Don't come to it with pre-conceived prejudices from the bad reviews or other comments. View it with an open mind and heart. It is 2 hours and 5 minutes of the best damn action I've seen on film in a long time. Kudos to all involved!!!"

","I have seen lots of action adventure movies ever since I was a little brat. Some are very exciting while others are plain dumb or boring. The Mummy is one of the movies that surpass my expectations and yes, it's really, really fun to watch despite its corny script (hey, all action movies tend to have CORNY dialogues, no doubt). In fact, The Mummy is based on a 1932 movie of the same name. While the original movie is slow and horrifying at its best, this latest incarnation has lots of cool sequences that cause our jaws to drop in amazement. Wow, as I have said a million times, WOW! I mean that it's an AWESOME movie that even make Indiana Jones proud. As I watch it from the beginning to the end of the film, I'm truly speechless.<br/><br/>The movie takes in 1923 where several archaeologists stumble upon Imhotep's tomb in Hamunaptra. When the dead priest is finally brought back to life (thanks to Miss Evelyn Carnahan who is obviously curious about the Book of the Living), things get really destructive as Imhotep unleashes incredible powers that would destroy the entire world. So, it is up to our heroic Rick O'Connell to end this madness once and for all.<br/><br/>If you wonder what makes the movie enjoyable, there are two reasons: interesting characters and special effects. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make a perfect couple while the maniacal Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is best suited as a spoilt jester. The rest of the cast members are also truly exceptional especially Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay. And now for the special effects: they are truly unbelievable, from the falling meteors sequences and hair-raising escape from the sandstorm to a grand showdown with Imhotep, you will not going to miss this one out.<br/><br/>If you are satisfied with the first movie, perhaps you want to watch the even more fantastic sequel, the Mummy Returns (I really need to watch this one too!!)."

And if you know me, you know I'm a big baby who jumps at the site of a cricket.^_^<br/><br/>How I finally came to see it was when my brother bought it.

"Bkalina","7","0","0","9 May 1999"," Good, but a ""rip off of style""
","The film industry is running dry when it comes to style, technique, and stories.  ""The Mummy"" is a good film.  I personally found it quite entertaining (I'd say 7 out of 10 stars).  But I'm not making a comment on how entertaining the film was.<br/><br/>The director, Stephen Sommers, borrowed the style for the film.  The Mummy starts out very original but as the film progresses it suddenly developed a mood, look, and feel that reminded me of something.  When I thought about it I realized what it was.  The script and directing style slowly turned into the same as Sam Raimi (Evil Dead I, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness).<br/><br/>Suddenly the film shifts tracks from an intense horror film where you are on the end of your seat, waiting to get scared and fall in or out of you seat; to a horror film with slap sticky zombie mummies loosing limbs and doing Three Stooges style humor (Ala Evil Dead I & II and Army of Darkness).  At one point a mummy's hand gets chopped off and it crawls around and tries to kill the hero (Brendan Friser).  The film also has the ""magic books"" that raise the dead.  Now normally these characteristics slip into film and you can't say ""Hey that's like in..."" But this film is crammed full of Sam Raimi traits.  All the film needed was a chain saw wheedling Bruce Campbell-isc character and they would be in a position to be sued.<br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that the film is not good, it is a very entertaining film.  What I am saying is the following:<br/><br/>The film is a step up from Stephen Sommers' last film Deep Rising.<br/><br/>If you are a Sam Raimi fan and would be offended by seeing his style of writing directing don't see the Mummy, or see it and complain to all your friends.<br/><br/>If you are a Sam Raimi fan and would be pleased to see some one use his style see the film.<br/><br/>If you have or are going to see the film, see Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness, or any other Sam Raimi film so you can see the similarities."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>The recent box office success of The Mummy Returns has given me cause to re-examine its predecessor.  Most of the critical response to the sequel has been mixed, with the majority of the critics stating it's weak when compared to the original.  Movie audiences have been far kinder, many stating it's better than the original and some saying it's even better than Raiders of the Lost Ark!  Naturally, I took the time to look back at The Mummy, the film that opened the summer of 1999.<br/><br/>The film was by no means the most anticipated blockbuster of the summer. That honor belonged to more hyped up films like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and the Austin Powers sequel, but the box office numbers for The Mummy shocked everyone.  I saw the movie for myself and found myself agreeing with many critics and viewers, the film is by far the most fun I've had in a movie theater in nearly ten years, since I last saw Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.  The Mummy is a rollicking thrill ride, a blend of action/adventure/humor with a nice dash of romance that keeps things moving along at a lightning pace.  Best of all, the characters were memorable and the action sequences were thrilling and exciting.<br/><br/>The plot isn't anything that's Oscar worthy, but it does set up a fun premise.  In the times of Ancient Egypt, a priest named Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) was having an affair with the Pharaoh's wife, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez).  The Pharaoh discovers this matter of infidelity, which forces Imhotep and his lover to kill him.  As punishment, the Pharaoh's guards execute Anck Su Namun, and in despair, Imhotep takes her lifeless body to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, in hopes of restoring her spirit to her body.  In the middle of the process, the Pharaoh's guards interfere, the ritual is left unfinished, and Imhotep and all his priests are killed and mummified.  Imhotep's body, in particular, must be guarded at all times, for an ancient curse has been placed on it and if he is awakened, he could bring the end of the world.<br/><br/>The story cuts to the 1920's, with a lovely but ditzy librarian named Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) intrigued by her brother Jonathan's (John Hannah) latest discovery, a key with a map that could lead to Hamunaptra. Unfortunately, the map is burned so they must rely on the man who had been in possession of the key, a former legionaire named Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser).<br/><br/>He leads the small group into the desert, with a rivalling team led by a former acquaintance of O'Connell's named Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), who is leading  a group of Americans.  They reach the lost city at the same time, and while O'Connell's team discovers the mummified body of Imhotep, the Americans retrieve the mysterious Book of the Dead.<br/><br/>Evelyn, who is developing romantic feelings towards O'Connell, is interested in the other group's discovery.  She steals the Book of the Dead from them and reads several passages aloud, with horrifying results.  Imhotep is awakened and is on a quest to gain power and revive his lost love, Anck Su Namun.  To accomplish this, he must first kill the men who found the book and sacrifice Evelyn.  It is now up to O'Connell, Jonathan, and a mysterious cult leader named Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) to stop the mummy before his reign of terror spreads over the world.<br/><br/>The film's director and writer, Stephen Sommers, must be really well-versed in adventure films.  He knows how to bring out the boyhood sense of fun in nearly every scene, and he never fails to do anything less than make this a rousing thrill ride.  He never does anything particularlyl innovative, but his ability to breathe life into the adventure genre again is refreshing. His emphasis on characters and humor make this a more satisfying experience than most other summer blockbusters.  It's nice to see a movie that has true intentions of entertaining the audience, and not just try to make a quick buck.<br/><br/>The action sequences are a partial reason for the movie's success. Sommers tries out something different for every action scene.  There are gunfights, swordfights, tense chase scenes, and a breathtaking sandstorm.  But Sommers wisely doesn't exhaust you with non-stop action.  The real non-stop thrills don't begin until the 1-hour mark.  He does a nice job of building the momentum with adventure, humor, and romance.<br/><br/>Speaking of the romance, Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have an undeniable amount of sizzling chemistry.  They work well together and it would be nice to see them in a film outside of this genre.  Fraser is the perfect choice for the ruggedly handsome hero.  He does a great job for the physical parts and his charisma is just as strong as his acting.  Weisz does end up mostly playing the damsel in distress, but there's great fun in that acknowledgement and she plays her part quite well.  Plus, the fact that she's very cute doesn't hurt matters.  John Hannah as the comic relief is quite hilarious.  Some of the jokes he's given aren't necessarily funny but his delivery is so dead-on, I couldn't help but laugh.<br/><br/>
The lead trio have the most presence.  The actors playing the villains don't really have much dialogue.  Arnold Vosloo is a menacing physical presence and though he doesn't say much he does ooze with a certain sense of icky creepiness (could be due to those mummy effects).  Patricia Velazquez doesn't do much other wear some skimpy clothing.  As a mummy, she basically shrieks her way through the role.  Once again, it's not as if though these villains really need to be well-defined.<br/><br/>Sommers' script isn't anything brilliant by a long shot, but it's a very entertaining and well-spun tale, which is better than what can be said for most big-budget summer films.  The dialogue, though sometimes seemingly corny, actually works perfectly and is often quite hilarious.  The humor, obviously intentional from all standpoints, keeps the movie's pacing tight and adds an extra degree of fun to the whole production.<br/><br/>Sommers also injects the film with the right tone and mood.  It's hardly a frightening film, and that's certainly not the point.  He keeps things on a light-hearted, though still tense and thrilling, level.  The movie doesn't take itself very seriously, and as a result it's a movie experience that's all the better for it.  We've already had a horror-related film about a mummy, and it was time for something more cinematically rousing, which is definitely Sommers' intent.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite outstanding.  The initial sight of the mummy is obviously far too CGI, but it works within the film's tone.  Having a seriously scary-looking monster would have ruined the slight tongue-in-cheek attitude the movie was going for.  The rest of the visuals are great.  The design of Hamunaptra is convincingly ancient and mystical.  The large wave of locusts and beetles are also a sight to behold, but the film's best effect is the sandstorm, which Sommers films from the perfect angles, giving us a sense of how immense in size and scope it is.<br/><br/>The Mummy has obviously had the largest lasting impression of 1999's summer films.  It may not have the money of Phantom Menace or the innovative visuals of The Matrix, but it's a film that is superb because it succeeds in what it promises to do, and that's to thrill and entertain you for a couple of hours, and it has no pretensions about doing so."

","With all of the empty-headed, boring action movies that are the norm these days, it's good to have a movie like ""The Mummy"" come along. Yes, it's goofy and tongue-in-cheek, but what the heck, it's a lot of fun and made by folks who clearly love movies. Stephen Sommers, who co-wrote and directed this film, is having a ball with this movie.<br/><br/>Everyone's talked a lot about the visual effects, and oh yeah, the ILM kids have another field day with ""The Mummy."" ILM must have been a crazy place with both ""The Mummy"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I"" coming out at the same time. The creature itself is a marvel, wonderfully creepy and expressive. What I also loved were the cool backgrounds that lend the film a great sense of place, making the audience feel that they're right in Egypt during the time of the Pharaohs and of the 1920's. Thank gosh for computers, cause man, they're making all kinds of cool effects possible.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, and fitting for this kind of movie. Brendan Fraser is very energetic, sometimes hamming it up too much, but certainly having fun. Stephen Sommers gives ""The Mummy"" a big dose of fun and energy, knowing when to go for laughs and when to go for thrills. Sommers does a great job of bringing back the epic adventure film, and buddy, it's been a long time!<br/><br/>
I, as always, have a lot of admiration for the other artists who make movies. I loved the great score by Jerry Goldsmith (""The Omen,"" many of the ""Star Trek"" films). He composed many themes, showcasing the beauty of Egypt, the evil of the Mummy, or the adventure of our heroes. Both Goldsmith and John Williams are close to 70, and both of these veterans clearly get a kick out of these adventure films and really let loose with some great music. They make film composers half their ages seem asleep by comparison! Adrian Biddle (""Aliens"") knows how to shoot a genre film like ""The Mummy,"" and shows that he knows his stuff when it comes to photographing the gorgeous desert vistas as well.<br/><br/>All in all, a ton of fun for someone like me who was weaned on ""Star Wars"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has been getting kind of cynical about how fun has been disappearing from today's movies. Let's hope Stephen Sommers and others like him keep going and keep making movies that put our faith back in escapist filmmaking.<br/><br/>(9 out of 10 Stars)"
"Aphex97","8","0","0","19 May 2001"," Comic book fun with great modern special effects.
","The Mummy is a pseudo-remake of the 1932 Karloff picture of the same name. This modern Mummy is not like any monster Mummy I've ever seen before. I commend the film makers for making a modern version of this classic monster. Arnold Vosloo plays the antagonist well, he is not the traditional mummy that hobbles about wrapped in bandages. This Mummy is strong, quick ,powerful, has plenty of tricks up the proverbial sleeve, and really is just plain downright menacing. I can't say enough good things about the actual monster and the very flashy special effects used in connection with his powers (e.g. the wall of sand with his face). I give the monster and related effects a 10/10. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty good (despite some large continuity problems). Two groups of treasure hunters find a much sought after legendary lost city in Egypt, only to accidentally awaken the Mummy, and thus fulfill a 3000 year-old prophecy of a great curse and plague on the Earth. Now they must save the world. The whole movie has the feel of a live action comic book, which makes Brendan Fraiser's zanyness a great choice as the lead actor. He is surprisingly competent as the kick ass action hero spewing enough one-liners to make Arnold proud. The role doesn't require a lot of ability, and he fills the shoes of the zany American hero well. All the characters (except the monster) are comic book type characters (e.g. the yeeee-haaa cowboy Americans, the bumbling coward brother, the weasel bad guy Benny, etc...).<br/><br/>
FINAL RATING: 8/10 The characters don't run that deep but they don't really need to because the story is interesting enough by itself. The great constant action, the excellent scenery, and very cool special effects make a good movie, but Vosloo as the Mummy is the real star here. Consider me impressed. <br/><br/>Noob Aalox"

","Death is only the beginning. My favorite  movie, this movie is both a thriller and a chiller. Rick O'Connel (played by Brendan Fraser) is the perfect hero especially because he's gorgeous. Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) plays the adventurous heroine. Though Rachel Weisz is beautiful I didn't like her much. I mean she was helpful and smart but was a kind of ditzy. You've got to admit a lot of the bad things that happened were her fault. I really liked her brother Jonathan ( John Hannah) though. I got a bunch of laughs out of him. Another character I found myself drooling over was Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr). Im-Ho-Tep probably couldn't scare the life out of you, but I do like the idea of the idea of the mummy (when immortal) being kind of good looking. The only thing you might want to close your eyes for is the bunch of leeches. Now THOSE can give you nightmares.<br/><br/>*********"

But, it borrowed too heavily from other movies and you've seen the same plot before. There is absolutely nothing original about this movie. It borrows, okay, steals from Indiana Jones, Stargate, Jason and the Argonauts, etc. Yes, the plot is completely predicable. You know who is going to live and die at the end of the movie after 30 minutes. But! It is a hell of a ride and is very enjoyable for what it is.

","This movie takes the place of Indiana Jones- which its 10 year absence is sorely missed. To replace that sense of wonder and adventure, the Mummy exceeds all expectations and is wonderfully filmed with great CGI special effects and computer graphics. The movie shows the great Egypt full of mystique and myth. A very funny and campy movie however- but it still never loses any ground on the fun factor. There is some parts in the film in which you can dose off, but otherwise it is a good film to watch and it will stick you to the screen. Brendan Fraser is a good action hero- but I would've preferred other actors like Nicholas Brendon or Matthew Perry to fill in the role because frankly, Fraser looks goofy and silly during his cameos and action sequences- maybe the producers and directors wanted it that way. Out of four stars- I give it a 2 1/2"

","This is a thoroughly modernized ""Mummy"" which benefits from all of the marvels of modern technology, (the film, that is, although the Mummy himself is a much more healthy and robust fellow than in the '30s original- once he has regenerated to fulfill his curse), making for an exciting, interesting and entertaining movie.<br/><br/>   The Mummy is much more of an adventure story (along the lines of the Indiana Jones films) than the tired, plodding retreads we have all come to expect from Hollywood these days.  The technical effects alone really make it quite worth watching.  The story, though familiar, is retold with imagination, wit and indeed some intellectual curiosity.<br/><br/>   Brandon Fraser comports himself very well as the adventurer/hero (although what he was doing with the French Foreign Legion, or a Cairo jail some years later, in the opening scenes is never really explained- but that's a minor detail).  The heroine is not just the helpless fussy female for comic relief (as with the ""Temple of Doom"" or those Michael Douglas movies with Danny DiVito); she is a scholar, and plays pivotal roles in the story and plot.<br/><br/>   The movie starts out in ancient Egypt, showing who the Mummy was (is) and why he was cursed.  The opening of the tomb, invoking of the curse, and prevention of the end of the world follow in short order. There are chases, narrow escapes and mysterious strangers; there are some surprises too, and the special effects (through gruesome, and heavily dependent upon insects) are remarkable.<br/><br/>   Rent it; it's good fun."

","The Mummy: ****<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" is breathtaking and captive. This is an action movie with a lot of brains and skill. Wonderful special effects and acting.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" tells the story of Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo) who was mummified back in the good old Egyptian days. Roughly 3,000 years later, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) takes Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her money-grubbing brother Jonathan (John Hannah) to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead. While reading the Book of the Dead, Evelyn accidentally unleashes Im-Ho-Tep out of his tomb. He is there to resurrect his dead girlfriend (Patricia Velazquez). Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) is the protector of the tomb. Him and the Maji are to make sure no one unleashes the creature. Oops.<br/><br/>
""The Mummy"" is summed up in one word: awesome. It is original (for a remake), fun, entertaining and holds on to the very last credit. Well, first credit. Most people don't watch them. Anyway, it's exciting and funny. John Hannah is hilarious as Jonathan. He has this look about him that helps his comedy. The movie has as much comedy as excitment. I think we have a new Indiana Jones of the '90's, and his name is Rick O'Connell."

"teejayniles2345","10","0","0","30 April 2001"," Take a Horror archetype and add all the new tricks
","This 1999 ""remake"" was a winning summer blockbuster due to its appealing non-stop plot and special effects.  Although its timeline seems a bit confused (was it 3000 years ago or 3000 BC?), this Hollywood formula flick takes elements from successful films of the 80's and 90's and goes full tilt with them.  The idea of taking and updating a Horror Film archetype has diverged in multiple directions with the Vampire/Dracula but the Mummy as fearsome archetype of the undead was never quite on such a level of the imaginative for studio projects.  The popularity of ""Indiana Jones"" however explains a lot of what this movie was also reviving for mainstream audiences.  The plot here however is designed for elementary school level archaeologists who like to pilfer each other's unsystematically gathered artifacts.  The fatal ""scarabs"" also owe a lot to the ""Alien"" who gets ""under the skin"" rather literally.  The heroine is quite differently a pawn of the hypnotic Imhotep; this script goes far afield from the reincarnation themes of the classic ""Mummy"" film of the 1930's.  Evelyn/""Evie"" seems to be a ""liberated"" librarian who also triggers the magical rejuvenation of the cadaver-mummy who's still rather ""gross"" just out of his sarcophagus-prison. Imhotep has an Achilles heel that is novel and interesting but the scope of his substantial powers evoke the Ark and Old Testament themes of the first Indiana Jones movie that Spielberg and Lucas collaborated on.  The makeup seems to move us away from the entombment sequence of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and toward the horrific extremes of decay and skin metamorphisizing. The lost city seems rather easily found by outsiders for having been lost with its precious treasures that are quite as unimportant as in Disney's film ""Aladdin.""  The film has some fun humor lines thrown by a minor character who's quite able to steal scenes of all sorts.  Whenever I see that character on screen, however, I remember him from the 80's winner: ""Four Weddings and A Funeral.""  All in all, THE MUMMY (1999) is a wild ride with a happy ending for a ""triangle"" that's about as unconventional as might be, given the original movie's premise about the ancient lovers' plight. Watch it with a full box of popcorn and look away if necessary (which is really quite at a minimum)!"

Focus seems to be a problem.  Many scenes loose clarity in background objects that blur and even with a calibrated high-resolution TV, colors were not crisp or fully displayed, remaining drab and subdued.  Sure, it is a dark movie, but either the proper equipment wasn't used or more likely it was just slapped together quickly to catch the dollar wave and no technical improvements were made in the production of the disk.  Even the dolby was poorly recorded.  Couldn't tell it was 5.1 at all. It sounded like the recordings were never mixed and improved in making the DVD sound as it was comes almost solely from front left, right and center speakers with a faint buzz in the rear speakers barely audible in some action scenes.

","In an age of movies that try to push limits, it is nice to have a movie that just tries to tell a story and pull it off well.  While there may not have been enough sex or blood-and-guts for some folk, I feel this is one of the best ""scary"" movies ever.  I prefer to be scared a la ""Rear Window"" -- what is imagined is better than what is seen.  ""The Mummy"" stirs up emotions while making one feel a part of the action -- or within the whirlwind of action as the Mummy runs amok.  Can't wait for the sequel.  Who cares if it wins no accolades?  As long as it delivers what the first did, I will watch it -- again and again."

","This movie is great fun from beginning to end.  It never takes itself seriously and the audience is only expected to go along with the excitement. In no way is it a remake of the 1932 horror classic.  That early story is just a springboard to bigger and better entertainment.  And infinitely more high-speed foolishness.  ""The Mummy"" (1999) has its share of horror, and without gore.  It also has action, adventure, comedy, suspense, villainy, visual beauty, a hero to cheer for and a heroine to die for.  (But the hero doesn't.)  The special effects by Industrial Light & Magic are terrific, although there may be one sandstorm illusion too many.  But then, it's Egypt.  Brendan Fraser is ideally cast: he's no longer the lovable simpleton of ""George of the Jungle.""  He has the skill and the screen presence needed to be a fine mock-swashbuckler, always ready with the throwaway smart-a(leck) quip.  Don't bother about holes in the plot; if there are any, no one cares.  The film's purpose is to give its viewers a fun-filled interlude, and it succeeds on every level.  Footnote: stay with it for the closing credits.  All by themselves they're a triumph of goofy design.  The movie is two hours of pure cinematic good times. 8 stars out of 10."

","This movie has become one of my favorites.  I used to stay up late to watch the old mummy movies when I was a kid.  Ever since then I've been intrigued by the whole ancient egyptian thing.  Now, this movie does get down right ridiculous towards the end, but if I wanted reality I would sit on my front porch and watch my neighbors mow their lawn (for free.)  As ridiculous as it gets, the acting is really good.  The humor is contemporary, and so out of place; but I'm willing to make that leap for the sake of a good laugh.<br/><br/>Here's were I start to spoil it a bit.  I really got to say that I thought the acting was really authentic.  I have never seen anyone stutter as convincingly as Rick when he was giving Evie the tools he stole - and the look on his face...he really looked nervous.  In fact the facial expressions were really bang on for nearly everyone.  The evil smile of Vasloo was perfect.  When he did the plane swallowing sand/body wave thing...that was wierd, but cool.  He was totally into it.  Like an evil dude would be.  In all fairness, The mumbled stutters Evie forced out when the claw guy asked her for the map sounded very real.  They could rival Rick's tool gift stutters.  Speaking of real, how do you make it look like someone is running into a wall full speed, head first? I don't know, but they do.<br/><br/>This movie had a nice amount of humor sprinkled throughout.  Some of the best lines you should hear are...""sounds like.....bugs.""  The facial really did it for me on that one.  I was surprised how funny Fraser could be.  The air kiss was a hoot.  ""That happens alot around here"" -was well placed. Other great lines are...""what's that God awful stench?-Oh"", also ""You don't have any children""-""I might some day"", and ""Wait here I'll go get help."" This is the kind of humor that, I (being intelligent yet silly) can laugh at over and over. They picked the right people for the roles in this movie.  Benny was a total weasel.  I hope I don't offend him, but this guy yelled weasel from his sandals to his hat.  His voice, his lines, his stance, his smile- he was the perfect weasel.  Jonathan (the brother) was great.  There wasn't a moment I didn't believe this guy.  Speaking of guys how many good looking men can you fit in one movie?  I counted at least four.  The magi leader was a babe. (Also, I appreciated that they spoke Egyptian were appropriate.)  Now if you're talking babe material- truthfully I first saw the movie because it had mummy in the title and I knew Fraser (God's gift to us women) was in it. But- the last four times I saw it were mostly for Vasloo.  Where did this guy come from and does he have any brothers?  Yow-za!  You gotta envy Evie when she has Rick(a modern John Wayne with a splash of Tom Hanks) and Imohtep (a gorgeous face on top of an 'ouch' body) fighting over her.<br/><br/>I heard about the sequal and I'm definitely gonna see it, but one thing...according to the films at the Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian), they don't remove your heart during mummification."

The walking Egyptian dead idea might have been spine chilling to Karloff's original audiences, but it's plain hammy now. The Mummy guys have taken this revelation and run with it, ending up with a gloriously hammy and lively movie. Brendan Fraser is perfect, a handsome action man who delivers every line with his tongue firmly in his cheek, and Rachel Weisz is ditzy without being too dumb.

","To paraphrase Roger Ebert in his review of this film, I have really no legitimate grounds on which to recommend this movie... except the fact that I liked it.  Yes, the dialog is cornball, most of the acting is unremarkable at best, and there's no emotional core to speak of.  But it doesn't matter, in this kind of film.  This is a film that only takes itself seriously in its amazing action sequences, and its visual effects, and even then it's often done in a tongue-in-cheek manner.  This is a film that knows it's not meant to be entertaining on more than the basest of levels, and it does that with flying colors.  This is the kind of movie where the actors are supposed to be second banana to the visual effects, and while I sometimes don't condone such films (the '98 Godzilla comes to mind) if they're successful enough in tapping into my sense of imagination and adventure, it can work. I mean, the scenes with the unformed Mummy himself, the guards that come out of the wall carving, or the giant sand storm are visually stunning and imaginative.  So much so that I really don't care that there isn't an original line of dialog in the entire film.

","OK I know, we've seen it all before - no originality prizes obviously, but what an exciting movie this is! Much has been said on this Indiana Jones 'borrowing', but one must overlook the problems this movie obviously has.<br/><br/>
However the point of a review is to do just that, so...Brendan Fraser is, it has to be said, no Harrison Ford. The quick wit is just not there, and that is how everyone could relate to Indiana Jones above all his fantastical heroics. Rachel Weisz is a wonderful actress wasted in this movie with bad casting and a bad script. John Hannah, also a very accomplished artiste, is similarly thrown away, with a character that mummification could perhaps be too soft to apply! Jerry Goldsmith's score is very Jerry Goldsmith. One wonders whether such a mature musician is trying to do too much these days, and it is films like this that suffer slightly, with the air of 'composing over breakfast' about it. The main theme is very nice, but a bit too similar to that of Dreamworks' PRINCE OF EGYPT, released a year earlier.<br/><br/>But enough! This movie works on the lowest, but most comfortable of levels. The effects are astonishing (sadly suffering on the small screen, although this is excused by the amazing array of extra features on the DVD version). The script is bad, but hilarious in places (""There is a curse on this chest"" - ""Curse my ass..!""), and Arnold Vosloo plays a very convincing 3000-year old villain.

","Before I posted my review of this film, I read all the other comments here. And the one thing that struck me as a common feature was ""plot holes"".   I must question - do you people even KNOW what a ""plot hole"" is?  Perhaps the story-line in this film was weak, but there were no plot holes - it was a cohesive story with every event discussed.  Were there a few ""leaps of faith""?  Sure, but then again, we are talking about resurrecting the dead here!<br/><br/>I am a Brendan Fraser fan.  His range is incredible.  His goofiness in films like ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Dudley Do-Right"" is endearing.  Yet, as shown in films like ""Gods and Monsters"", he can carry a serious film and be brilliant in it.  In ""The Mummy"", Fraser now proves his talent in action/adventure films.<br/><br/>Considering that the very purpose of this film - much like the original - was to suspend belief, I thought this remake was one of the best action/special effects films of 1999 (far better than ""Star Wars: Episode 1"").  More importantly, of the recent ""monster remakes"" (Dracula, Frankenstein), I found ""The Mummy"" to be the best.  The effects were astounding.  I will say this - between the 1999 films like ""The Matrix"", ""The Mummy"", ""Star Wars: Episode 1"" and ""The Haunting"", the effects films of 2000 and beyond have quite a feat to overcome to appear fresh.  Besides the astounding effects (which put 1998's ""Godzilla"" to shame), I felt that this film did have a story that was not only humorous, but upbeat.  There were a few scenes that created surprise (and if you were a child, you could have been scared - I heard as much from the children in the theater), but mostly the film was fun to watch.  The acting was perfect given the simplicity of the story.<br/><br/>Of course, this brings me to the story.  Was it too simple?  In many ways, yes, and this would be the film's only shortcoming.  The ""romance"" story was very simple, but then, that was not the main plot. There were some historical inaccuracies and character development was limited.  Of course, this whole adventure was supposed to take place over a series of days, not weeks, months or years.  Therefore, we learned all that was needed given our brief involvement as spectators in these character's lives.<br/><br/>I have since purchased the DVD version of this film and watch it at least once a week.  The DVD is filled with all sorts of ""goodies"" that make this film even more fun.<br/><br/>If you want a fun action film, ""The Mummy"" is it.  If you want a ""brilliant"" story, then wait until the end of the year when the studios release their Oscar winner-wannabes.  But for early summer fun, this film was perfect.<br/><br/>

Brendan Fraser played the heroic stereotype to perfection and the villain was remarkable.  Some of the other characters seemed not to be well-defined, but they all played their roles in the overall flick well.

Although the special effects are occasionally cheesy and threadbare by current standards, they are generally effective and do not distract from the fun.

"Adrian-34","10","0","0","7 April 2000"," The pros and cons of it
","Not since Boris Karloff has the mummy enjoyed such life.  The film is well written, directed and excellently cast.  Though I do have a few minor complaints they really did not inhibit, limit or damage the enjoyment of the film nor it's storyline for me.<br/><br/>One of the few short-comings in my opinion is Brendan Frasier's character. He seemed to be lacking a bit but I do not feel that this was due to Mr. Frasier's acting but instead due to the writing.  I think the character could have been a little more well rounded.  I would have liked to have seen bit more to his character and perhaps more into some of the other character's as well.  A little more depth would have made the film a lot more intriguing.  My only other complaint is regarding the mummy's ""bride."" When her character is introduced we see a powerful, strong and potent woman capable of anything for her passion.  However, she seems lacking after her several thousand year slumber in comparison to her lover.  She seems almost desperate, whereas I expected her to be of a more determined demeanor.<br/><br/>Otherwise the film is a superior story about the ancient horror monster, the mummy.  I was very pleased to see a film that had such magnificent effects that actually had a well rounded story.  Too often the effects, when of such quality, are the body of the film and the story is sacrificed.  Not so in this film.  The story is solid enough that the effects do not out weigh the story but serve to enhance it.  Though the obvious omnipotence of the mummy seems to destroy the credibility of the ending.  <br/><br/>All in all, the film is a great sure to be one of the finest, modern horror classics since Bram Stoker's Dracula.  If you are like me, not a mummy fan, I highly recommend that you give this film a try.  It is likely to change your perspective as it did mine."

Imagine my surprise when it quickly became one of my favorite movies ever.  There are very few movies that were ever as much fun to sit through and watch.  I watched it three times the weekend i bought it and never got bored.  The special effects helped move the movie along, but the movie had a story and a plot.  In the tradition of Indiana Jones and Jerry Bruckheimer flicks, this action/adventure is definitely worth viewing. You want to have fun at home, this is one way.  Go out and buy it."

","This movie was a movie you watch for fun, not for Historical fact, because there where Historical errors in this film.  I watched this and just overlooked the errors.  I'm glad I did, this movie was a little more gruesome then I thought it would be.  Not that blood is spurting everywhere but it could still make your skin crawl on certain scenes.  This film was slightly tongue and cheek.  I find the biggest part of that was around the end.  The humor when Rick O'Connell is killing a few undead people was a little detached from the feel of the movie, just a little to cartoonish but I still enjoyed it's cartoonish feel.  Overall I like the movie and really liked the visual effects.  The look of the Mummy was very believable as he walked around when he was just ragged flesh and bone and the sand wall he used to chase that small plane was really really good looking.<br/><br/>My review 7."

","If you forget the holes in the plot you could fit a pyramid through, then this is a galloping romp of an action film. Good natured, with plenty here & there to make you smile & once the mummy is brought to life things really get going.<br/><br/>For once there is actually a touch of comedy about Americans! Check out the battle on the Nile boat, where the priests try to stop the two expeditions from getting to Hamunaptra. John Hannah's line about the cowboys battling it out Western style, ""Oh, Americans!"" has to be a first for a US production & introduces a nice taste of irony, which was unexpected.<br/><br/>Also take a look at the DVD for the deleted scenes, especially the ""I used to know, him"" line.

","First of all...I liked it. When you think of this movie, you will probably be thinking that it will be totally scary. Well think again...this is just a more serious ""Abbot & Costello Meets the Mummy"" movie or simply just a rip-off of ""Indiana Jones"". Now that doesn't mean I am down on the film, I enjoyed it. I thought the special effects were pretty good, the acting above par and it was kind of cool to see Brendan Fraser in a slightly more serious role than some of his recent films. I always enjoy seeing people break into tombs of the pharaohs and thinking that they are going to get away with all the treasures...seriously...have we ever seen someone get away with it. My point exactly. So with this in mind, we see a group of people breaking into the lost pharaoh tombs and then we see 2 hours of them trying to get away from the demons they unleashed. My faults with the movie...okay the deadly locusts appear, then the sky darkens, and zombies begin to roam the Earth...but it is up to Fraser, Weisz, and an old pharaoh guard descendant to save the world. Wait a minute, where was NATO? Where was the U.S. Air Force? Now I realize that we could not get U.S. ground troops into the area all that quickly, but surely we could have supplied Fraser with a better weapon than a shot gun. Okay, now many of you are immediately going to say, ""but this took place in the 30s"" and NATO or the U.S. Air Force wasn't around then....my reply to that is ""so!"" I still think someone in the world could have helped them out....that's my point. I think everyone will enjoy this film and it is especially fitting that it came out just before Mothers Day. Bottom line....it's a good film, just don't get to ""wrapped"" up with details."

"Colonel Ted","7","0","0","9 February 2000"," A decent summer blockbuster
","Loathed by the critics, but a huge hit at the box office, this updating of the 1930's Karloff classic provides solid entertainment at the cinema. It's not as good as The Matrix (although the plot is easier to understand), but far better than The Phantom Menace, The Mummy owes more to Indiana Jones than Karloff. Fraiser plays French Legionnaire Rick O'Connell who is rescued from death by Evie (Weisz) and Jonathan (Hannah) Carnahan to help them search for the Lost City of Hamunaptra. Unfortunately they end up awakening The Mummy of the title (a CGI clad Vosloo) who naturally causes havoc. Sommers' script is rather flawed. There are a few too many jokes about smelly Arabs and for the most characterisation and a bumpy romance between Fraiser and Weiez has been sacrificed to the action. This is certainly no Lawrence of Arabia as well, as there is a distinct lack of atmosphere to the film. Hannah is badly cast as Evie's work shy brother. Although he does get quite a few laughs, he is never convincing as a stuck up toff. Frasier is charismatic enough to carry the film and makes a good hero, although he's not a patch on Harrison Ford. However any flaws are more than compensated by the action which is superb, thrilling and spectacular as Sommers piles on the effects, the explosions, and the fights. These include a sandstorm, thousands of bugs, a recreation of Plagues of Egypt, plus the CGI Mummy itself. It you check you brain at the door, then The Mummy is good harmless fun."

Reading another review I found out some interesting facts which are very true which shows this movie is very similar to the evil dead moive, first off Rick O' Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, was kind of like Ash from 'Evil Dead', a square-jawed hero who was there just to do the dirty work while the smarter characters solved all the puzzles. A shoot first, think later kind of guy. There was even a Book of the Dead in the film, as there is in 'Evil Dead', which when decrypted has the power to bring the dead back to life, again just like 'Evil Dead'. The mummified priests in this film took the place of the zombie's in 'Evil Dead', having been brought back to life their only goal was to destroy Rick and his friends.

Brendan Frasier provides you with what you expect from the lead in this caliber of film, and Rachel Weisz is stunning as the heroine/love interest/damsel in distress.  Its definitely big budget with some great special effects, however, sometime the effects are a little too much.  That is, with all the computer generated effects these days, the studio spent a lot of cash to still have certain things look incredibly fake.  Not a major breaking point of the film however.  Overall, ""The Mummy"" is good if your looking for a predictable story, ample action and have the desire to kill a few hours in some self indulgent fun.  I did think the film could have shed about 15 minutes or so but its bearable enough.  I also agree with other reviewers in that its nice too see a Mummy who is not lumbering after his victims at an ""overpowering"" 2 miles an hour.

But of course he won't go without being stopped. See the movie for the rest. :) The acting is good, with Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell, and several other good performances. The CGI is amazing, with movies you can see through and a huge, tasty, sand storm. All I can say is go rent this movie now, you won't be disappointed. Me, on the other hand, why Im already waiting for the sequel. Oh yeah!"

Historically accurate or not, it's one way to possibly attract viewers to Egyptian mythology. I'll admit, one thing I enjoyed was seeing how one of the co-stars was going to get bumped next, as opposed to the tiresome bullet-in-the-brain routine. The script wasn't great, but it hardly matters. I particularly liked Rachel Weisz and John Hannah as her bumbling brother.

Get a grip people, this wasn't supposed to be Citizen Kane, The Godfather or anything else.  I hate to compare it to Star Wars but folks, the acting is FAR worse and TWICE as hokey, yet still a good movie right? You weren't supposed to stand up and cheer, you were supposed to see some cool effects, and get some giggles.  It's a ""fun"" movie,  yes they still make those, not every movie is supposed to move you, make you think, vie for public office, fight a war, or... gasp... shoot someone or even worse.. yes...

The plot is NOT supposed to be believable, its fantasy, its NOT supposed to be thought provoking its supposed to be CORNY.  Corny isn't a bad thing in this movie its a plot development. I don't pick apart Star Wars saying,  yaknow... there really couldn't be fire in space since.. or Hey Superman is flying and we all know people can't fly!  Superman was a good movie, right?

I have to say I laughed hysterically through a lot of it.  I dont think it was supposed to have been a comedy though.<br/><br/>Brendan Frasier leads the cast as Rick O'Connell, an American who seems to be serving with the French Foreign Legion.  Frasier is well suited to the part, and shows surprisingly good comic timing with lots of deadpan deliveries of certain lines.<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz is the female lead, a somewhat clumsy librarian with an extensive knowledge of Egyptian history.  She is as beautiful as she is dull, her character not very interesting.  She has a couple good moments, and also delivers some perfectly timed humor.<br/><br/>Most of the rest of the supporting cast is just along for the ride, with Kevin J. O'Conner's Beni leading the way.  Youre actually happy to see this little weasel get what he deserves.<br/><br/>Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep is not that great a character either, which is not what you expect from the central theme of the movie.  He is far more interesting and unsettling as a computer generated skeleton than as a real actor.  <br/><br/>""The Mummy"" is a great comedy, and I see why it worked well at the box office.

","When I first heard about `The Mummy' I thought it would be one of Hollywood's overproduction movies that require a good cinema with Dolby surround sound, hi-tech projection machines and of course a big pack of pop-corn in order to enjoy the astounding special effects and the breathtaking actions scenes. Usually this kind of movies are depended on their Visual Effects because the screenplay is very poor. But when I saw the movie I realized that I was wrong. Mummy's story is depended on an ancient Egyptian legend about Hamunaptra `the city of the dead'. It is said that there, under the sand, it is buried for 30.000 years the ultimate evil, the mummy of an ancient priest who disobeyed the orders of the Pharaoh and fell in love with his wife. The movie has a fair screenplay with immediate responses that some times are really good and some times dead as dodo and boring. Brendan Frazer (you must remember his from `George of the jungle' or `God and Monsters') is playing his role quite good. However, the most powerful feature of the movie is the amazing scenes and the astounding Visual Effects (made by `Industrial Light & Magic': Star Wars Series). To sum up Mummy is a good choice to spend your Saturday night and watching it you may feel like watching an `Indiana Jones' movie. Rating: 5,9/10"

So, why don't we actually sit down and watch a movie with the intentions to relax, not to get all mad, when there's a book instead of scroll, or the mummy can see out of eyes that an almost blind man can't see out of. which I might add, that the mummy just needed some eyes, it didn't matter if there was anything wrong with them.

Think of this as being in the vein of 'The Rocketeer','Tombstone', 'StarGate', 'Anaconda' and 'Congo'.

Get rid of Brendan Fraser shouting at the mummy and don't emphasize the CGI effects, and it could have been much better.  From what I've heard, Clive Barker was originally asked to take part in this film, the screenwriting to be specific.  That would have been great.

","One reviewer picked the perfect title for his review, ""silly fun"", which summed this one up nicely.  And another reviewer did a good job of picking apart the plot holes.  The movie tries to expand on Indiana Jones' funny quips, to the extent that the script spends a ton of time on cracks and quips, reducing the story to silliness instead of the suspense that the Indy Jones movies had.  The hero even expresses this observation, about halfway through, when for the umteenth time some noisy spirit swooshes out of an object they are opening, and he says with a smirk, ""That happens a lot around here.""<br/><br/>So for those who like their creature features serious, they'd be better off renting Russell Mulcahey's ""Tale of the Mummy"", where the cast does take it seriously, although there isn't as much action or effects.<br/><br/>But The Mummy is fine for good silly fun. -Bob"

","I have some big problems with this movie.<br/><br/>It's not the overall jokiness of it all... although I wish it had been a little more substantial, given that it suggests that Christians, Jews and Muslims have been wrong about the whole afterlife deal, and that the world is controlled by animal-headed deities. That's a different issue.<br/><br/>I'm also willing to admit some of the FX were jaw-dropping. The wall of sand, for example. But there were other ""jaw-dropping"" moments, too -- for instance, the ""jokes"": my mouth hung open (wider than the Mummy's) in astonishment, but no laughter came out. Next, there's the appalling racism of the screenplay: the Egyptians are at one point compared (unfavorably) to their camels. The only time we really get to see the non-Anglo inhabitants of Cairo, they're shown as a mob of fanatic zombies. And don't even get me started on Beni... <br/><br/>Then there's the technical errors. Big ones. It's amazing that the equally shoddy ""Godzilla (1998)"" was torn to shreds by audiences for its every inaccuracy, while this movie wasn't. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>-- Brandon Fraser is wandering into the Sahara, with no horse, no water, nothing. ""The desert will kill him,"" says the mysterious Arab, watching from the cliffs. Next, a subtitle: Three Years Later. Brandon's alive in Cairo. No explanation is given for his miraculous survival. This is known as ""cheating"". The mysterious Arab pulls a similar stunt at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>-- Egyptian books. The ""codex"", our modern book with pages, covers and a binding, is a recent European invention. Egyptian ""books"" would have been papyrus sheets, not big volumes bound on the left!<br/><br/>-- The Mummy steals the eyes of a man who's nearly blind, yet somehow manages to see perfectly clearly.<br/><br/>-- The Plagues of Egypt?? Those were supposed to have been sent by the Old Testament God of the Hebrews, weren't they??<br/><br/>-- It's bad enough that they wasted the talents of Bernard Fox as pure Mummy-fodder, but... did they have to have him crash *exactly* on top of a spot of quicksand??!!<br/><br/>-- How is it that the wastrel brother, described in the beginning as an indifferent Egyptologist, suddenly reads hieroglyphics and hieratic fairly well? (And here's a minor quibble: I find it hard to believe these turn-of-the-century English types could read ancient Egyptian clearly and correctly enough for the Gods to understand...)<br/><br/>-- Simple question: where did those fully-saddled camels come from at the end?<br/><br/>-- Why does the mysterious Arab THANK Fraser et al. for helping to clean up the mess that they themselves created? You'd figure he'd chase them away and warn 'em never to come back, on pain of death. After all, look at all the people and historic monuments that have been destroyed because of those foreign grave-robbers!<br/><br/>OK, enough. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of a Circus Peanut: it seemed like a harmless bit of fluff, but left a really bad taste in my mouth."

","I was disappointed in this movie. I was expecting to see a remake of the 1932 (Karloff) and 1959 (Christopher Lee) versions, but instead got Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy. Director Sommers doesn't seem to know if he is making a horror, adventure or comedy film.<br/><br/>The special effects to be sure, are state of the art, however, the producers seem to have been going for quantity rather than quality in effects. The mummy character is evil to be sure, but is way over the top. He just didn't scare me. The other ""liberated"" mummys are too plentiful and cartoon-like to be believable. The plague of insects looks ridiculous and obviously computer-generated.<br/><br/>The hero, heroine and other assorted players don't seem to take the situation too seriously. With both guns a-blazing and a devil-may-care attitude, they look like refugees from the old Saturday matinee serials. And what was the point of the heroine knocking over library bookshelves in the context of the story. And the hero's escape from the gallows? The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford did the Indiana Jones thing much better. Karloff did the mummy character better in black & white and in 72 minutes in 1932. The Lee 1959 version was also superior and scarier.<br/><br/>I want my mummy back."

There have been a lot of ""Werewolf"" movies but not a successful remake of the original with Lon Chaney Jr. I bought this movie on VHS and still got a kick out of it.

Brendan Fraser's every move echoes Harrison Ford in some way.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with action/adventure movies in general, see ""The Mummy"" for a great laugh.

","For those of us who enjoy a good adventure movie and a good laugh, but burrow down into our seats when a movie gets too 'gory', The Mummy was a pleasant surprise!  I was dragged along and expected to only see half the movie, but was quickly engrossed in this wonderfully epic tale and amazed at the special effects so much, that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>The story tells a timeless tale woven around a beautiful country with a wonderfully rich history. Something to remember is that it is based around the mythology and beliefs of an ancient society, and you can't get better storylines than that.<br/><br/>Of course the actors played their part, by portraying action, adventure, horror, comedy and romance beautifully.  John Hannah was great (as always), Brendan Fraser showed he can do action and adventure as well as the next man, Rachel Weisz was also very good as the beautiful heroine. <br/><br/>
BUT Arnold Vosloo and Oded Fehr, not taking anything away from other cast members these guys were fantastic. I have to agree with 'catmom2' I definitely would like to see more of both these actors.  Arnold Vosloo, where have you been? His portrayal of the Mummy was magnificent, who in all his evilness still looked vulnerable, I have to admit to feeling sorry for The Mummy.  Oded Fehr, well I'm sorry for falling into the superficiality trap, but his dark and brooding good looks were definitely put to good use.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I would recommend to my friends, who enjoy a good story with enough action to keep you interested but not too much blood and guts, some great one-liners and comedy scenes that have you chuckling and of course the fluffy little romance story for those of us who think there's too little of it in the world today."

John Hanna is the comedy relief as the hapless sidekick who poses as a zombie to fool the bad guys, and Arnold Vosloo has a field day as the boss mummy Imhotep. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Sure, this movie is long on violence and short on plot, but it's a great film to watch in opposition to the regular action flick, so to speak. One thing's for sure, this is not the only movie where we're gonna see Brendan Fraser punch, kick, or shoot his way to the top of the best actor list."

","I think Roger Ebert got it right when he said that this film was as loud and obnoxious as the original Boris Karloff film was quiet and creepy. That is the absolute truth. In fact, this film has little to do with the 1932 film, and even littler to do with any other mummy film ever made, which got increasingly dreadful. I mean, who can really be scared of a slow-moving zombie who's tripping on his own bandages? This one, however, manages to bring the mummy genre up a few scales, and as a result, it's a harmless, entertaining trek.<br/><br/>This is the third film to have the title ""The Mummy,"" Karloff's and a 1959 Hammer film sharing the same title. Though it does feature armies of undead zombies, supernatural occurrences, and immense evil, it is quite difficult to label this film as a horror. Indeed, there's really no horror about it. Instead, it comes across as a fun, Indiana Jones-esque adventure yarn about Brandon Fraser and company battling the undead mummy, who kills his victims and sucks the life out of them, thus becoming more and more human. All this trouble starts when they open Imhotep's tomb and unleash his undead body...and that's basically the plotline.<br/><br/>Thin story aside, this movie is really just a series of endless action scenes, featuring one-liners and plently of breathtaking special effects. But that doesn't make it a bad film. In fact, it is quite a good one. It's the epitome of popcorn film, and while it might be brainless, that's okay. If these kind of films are done right, they are very fun and quite memorable. And they do it right, with great timing and a terrific performance by Brandon Fraser. And while it might not be up to par with Indiana Jones, who cares? It's quite a special effects, rollar coaster ride!<br/><br/>Leave your brain at the house and enjoy!<br/><br/>*** out of ****"

Cheers to the great special effects, but I couldn't help but feel I was watching a giant comic.

The Mummy himself regenerates too quickly, I'd rather see him in continual decay throughout the film. Goofy love story subplot, and I'm talking about the ""living"" characters. Only thing that help my attention was the sexy bald Imhotep (The Mummy pre-embalming and post resurrection) in his loin cloths.

Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O' Connell, a soldier of the legionare that decides to become a mercernary after a beautiful librarian name Eve(Rachel Weisz) and her bumbling brother Jonathan(John Hannah) release him from prison and tell him to get the treasure from Hamanaptra. I think that's how you spell it. None the less, as always, there's a bad guy in the movie, Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo) has been resurected by the dead from Eve and havoc is breaking loose all over egypt. With O'Connell's weasley friend Benny(Kevin J. O, Conner)leading a mercenary team, it is up to the two teams to escape the wrath of Imhotep and save the world before they die. The Mummy has great action, laughs, thrills and is one hell of a ride along the way."
"L. Lion","Null","0","0","5 August 1999"," Fraser & Weisz keep the wheels from coming off
","Undeniably goofy and seemingly overlong, The Mummy is nonetheless an enjoyable romp that manages to carry a good deal of kinetic energy into it's final fifteen minutes when the foolishness with CGI mummies running around, an unlikable and uninteresting villain, and a lack of suspense finally makes it crumble.  Throw-away comic lines, superheroics from Brendan Fraser, and an amazingly radiant Rachel Weisz make the film enjoyable.<br/><br/>First, the bad news:  the main villain, Imhotep (the mummy) played by Arnold Vosloo, is completely bland and uninteresting.  The film was much better when it was about a race between adventurers to find Hamunaptera, the city where the mummy is buried.  Well shot battle scenes, reliable banter well delivered, and interesting factions keep your attention and a smile on your face.  Then Vosloo shows up.  He also shows up in the beginning, in the 3-minute or so prologue to the 20th century action that explains who Imhotep was and why he was damned.  He's awful.  He looks like they were trying to get Billy Zane for this role and went for the bus-and-truck version, and then shaved his head.  He is supposed to radiate intelligence and evil, and radiates neither.  He detracts from every scene in which he appears.  He is almost totally indifferent to the human characters opposing him, as if not recognizing them as people.  Who directed this moron?  One scene where he manages to address Fraser's Rick as an equal and explain his motives clearly (and Ms. Weisz' expected fate) would have added much, although due to reasons of logic his character wouldn't speak English.  The movie's worst scenes are his or are based on his character's powers, save the sandstorm and the plane:  the scene with the Egyptian peasants in Cairo was not threatening and even a bit ludicrous.  By the time all the mummies began coming out of the walls, leading to a suspenseless and endless series of cartoon fight scenes, the wheels had well come off this film.<br/><br/>Second bad:  while exploring Hamunaptera, the adventurers are attacked by some 'good guys' who guard the mummy's tomb in order to save the globe. Just when it seems the adventurers are about to be overrun, these guys back off and issue a warning instead of finishing the job. By that time, a lot of blood has been spilled.  What's more, it's obviously just a plot device to explain why the guardians didn't stop the adventurers.  After all, if Imhotep isn't awakened, what are we going to get to watch, Weisz and Fraser taking tea?<br/><br/>Okay, now for the good.  John Hannah, whom I'd previously only scene as the gay survivor from Four Weddings and a Funeral, handles his throw-away quips well.  All of the character actors appearing and supporting roles (Hyde, Dunham, Avari, Johnson, Watkins) are good and add depth to the animosity between the adventurers.  Best of all, Fraser really can handle his Indiana Jones style role, and Rachel Weisz was radiantly beautiful without being a decoration.  Their chemistry was good and I liked seeing them together, fighting, arguing, and almost kissing.  The film as a whole (Vosloo being the exception) was exceptionally well cast.<br/><br/>Special effects are superb, and the fight scenes well staged and shot with great energy.  The film could have deteriorated into relentless stupidity but managed to hold the rails without careering off course.  I thought O'Connor's Beni character's death was too pat - I wouldn't have minded him surviving to continue his unctuous treacherous ways.  I laughed a lot during this film and enjoyed watching it."

Like DEEP RISING, Sommers include many elements from previous movies.  The mirage of Hamunaptra reminded me of Indie's passing through the second or third trap in INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.  There's also THE PRINCE OF EGYPT. Sommers injects the same brand of humor and comic relief like his previous movie.  This one is better though, the story is better laid out and the villain has a commanding presence.

At least the expression on the Americans just before they were sucked dry didn't express much horror and panic.<br/><br/>I cannot figure out whether this movie is intended as a horror movie or a bizarre comedy. It proved impossible to be both.<br/><br/>The special effects are well done technically, although the dissolving flesh of the mummy doesn't look like a part of him, but more like - well computer graphics.

On the other hand the sinking crashed aeroplane is hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie also contains a lot of ""factual"" errors that annoys me slightly. Why would Egyptian soldiers - even mummified ones, wear the crown of Lower Egypt? That would be heresy. And how is it possible to see the pyramids of Giza from the city of Thebes/Luxor?

","You have gotta admire the chutzpah of Universal in releasing the movie in this state. They should never have wrapped this Mummy. Unlike some of the artefacts, the movie as a whole looks decidedly unpolished, and one leaves the theatre feeling mildly entertained (only about 10 minutes of the film are actually boring), but with a sense that it could have been so much more if only a little attention had been given to the writing, editing and overall ambience.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in Barcelona where it's rated for kids age 7 and up. (It was rated as high as 15 years in some countries.) So, it seems only the Spanish appreciated its true target audience (and yes, Spain's version was uncut). It's a pity that the movie had to be quite as childish, wacky and simplistic as it was. But that's demographics for you. The cartoon-characterlike mummy was not the least bit chilling (although, not being a preteen, maybe I'm not qualified to comment). Imhotep? More like Impotent. However, a nice touch was to see Americans as arrogant villains for a change. Arnold Vosloo is better than I expected, however, as the human Imhotep, even if the only emotion he's asked to convey is sheer arrogance. I'd have preferred Billy Zane (to whom he bears a remarkable resemblance in some scenes), who may have brought more subtlety to the role. Rachel Weisz is competent enough, though she can't play drunk, and (strangely!) becomes noticeably better-looking as the film grinds on (she looks less tired than at first, anyone else notice?), though I'd have preferred Catherine Zeta-Jones (who wouldn't?) Brendan Fraser is, unfortunately, just plain bland and decidedly un-French. He looks too young, and not rugged enough, for this role. He's an excellent actor (e.g. Gods & Monsters) but just goes through the motions here.<br/><br/>Most of the glib one-liners failed completely, not just because I was watching the movie dubbed in Spanish (I understood about 95% of it), though I doubt the original US dialogue was much more scintillating. I'm afraid it's grade-school stuff, as usual.<br/><br/>On the effects (which of course is what the movie is all about), there's very little to say. They're effective (sorry), but not surprising. Unspecial f/x. The same effects, such as the scarab beetle swarms and skin bulging, are very overused. I wonder how much money that saved? After seeing an effect once, it has much diminished impact the second time. Which perhaps explains why I was noticing boom mikes, cameras (yes!) and other anomalous background things instead of being totally gripped by the action. I liked the opening panoramic scene of ancient Egypt more than the mostly mundane f/x thereafter.<br/><br/>While the film obviously doesn't take itself seriously (nor should it), the acting is mostly too camp (especially the effete Brit Jonathan and the nasty stereotype of the fat greedy Arab) to avoid oversilliness. That really diminishes the mystical and suspenseful atmosphere that the film should have derived from its lavish sets. As a result, the big money spent on production design was essentially squandered. The film has very little atmosphere and appears strangely sterile and subdued. You keep hoping it might pick up, but it never does, retaining a bland tone throughout; even the climax is unthrilling; an empty spectacle.<br/><br/>Conclusion: They should have spent a few million less on sterile sfx, hired some decent script doctors and donated the remaining millions to the preservation of GENUINE Egyptian cultural artefacts.<br/><br/>
(Oh, and I wonder how Imhotep could see anything throughout the entire movie, considering he stole the eyes of that American guy who could barely see the hand in front of his face without his glasses?)"

","The Mummy is a big box-office hit and it will be too in Holland, but is it a good movie? Say about the first 45 minutes are so bad, that they qualify to be ranked in the worst movies ever list. But when Brendan Fraser and crew unleash the mummy, action begins and you'll get a sort of an Indy Jones feeling. Then the movie turns to a action-pic with horror-effects. And then the movie really begins to be exciting. The end with a lot of mummies is actually really funny and good. So it is an exciting last hour but the movie is certainly not special and so isn't Brendan Fraser or the rest of the crew; the only one with a really good part is the South-African that plays the Mummy.

","This movie was really, really fun. I enjoyed it a lot. All that I wanted to see in this movie I found it with great pleasure for me. A lot of F/X, an epic plot (that's my debility, epic stories), funny characters (I laughed a lot with some ridiculous but efficient roles like Jonathan, Beni & one or two ""Fraserian"" stupidities that we are all accustomed) & 2 goddesses right fallen from the Olympus: Patricia Velazquez (Anck-Su-Namum)& Rachel Weisz (Evi). This was the first time that I saw this two beauties on the screen, & I was very amazed & drooling (as most of the male audience) with the introducing scene of Anck-Su-Namun. I just said "" Oh-m-y-G-o-d!"". She was absolutely perfect. But also Ms. Weisz has to be recognized as another fallen angel. She is perfect too. Returning to the male actors, I think Arnold Vosloo deserves the most of the credits. I know he was very helped with the whole set of FX on its role, but anyways I think he acted damn well so what the hell. He really looked like an Egyptian High Priest...I don't know if some people are agree with me but some actors have historical faces. I don't know if you know what i mean, but some people, only for their look, can interpret historical or ancient characters, & I think , as i said, that Arnold Vosloo really looks like an Egyptian prince or something, as well as Patricia Velazquez looks like an Egyptian babe too. Also I REALLY liked a lot the beginning of the movie, showing how was Egypt 3000 years ago. A really awesome scene. And I think that's all, but I have a question for myself: What could happen if we put Harrison Ford instead Brendan Fraser & some Afrika Korps Nazi fellas there...Could be this another Indiana Jones' movie? ""Indiana Jones & the curse of the mummy""? Who knows..."

","After seeing a string of disappointing blockbusters lately, it was with suspicion I let my partner drag me to the theatre. But was it worth it - YES!  This movie is over two hours long, packed with action, effects, humour, you name it.  Great - or shall we say terrifying? - villain; wonderful, funny heroes, and everybody (even the cat) has character.  The introduction sets the mood so well, I dare say it's one of the best I've seen in a very, very long time.  The effects do not jar, but complement the action beautifully.  The acting is adequate, and everyone seems to be having a good time.  Also, the story is carried through to an ending, and is not dropped halfway as in many other action movies of late (where one feels as if a deadline was reached, and the moviemakers were forced to scramble up a quick ending).<br/><br/>Okay, it may not be a classic; we've seen bits of the story before (Indiana Jones springs to mind here, as does Bram Stoker's Dracula) and the lines may be a bit hokey at times. Yet, the pace - once picked up - never drops, masking any glitches in the plot.  With a spectacular show like this, you will not care too much about the story.  This movie does not take itself seriously (thankfully!), and if you let yourself get caught up in the mood, you will leave the theatre with a big smile on your face, and a good, warm feeling inside.

"ChrisC-8","8","0","0","12 July 1999"," A review of a new take on the classic horror
","Back in 1932, The Mummy, starring Boris Karloff, had a quiet eeriness about it - it still does. I didn't know what to expect almost seventy years later when Universal released a modern update of the horror tale. With all the fuss over the latest computer generated imagery, I knew that it would either be another special effects laden summer blockbuster, or an exciting adventure in the tradition of Raiders of the Lost Ark. I suppose it was a bit of both, boasting some breathtaking effects in one of the best adventure films of recent years.<br/><br/>After the opening Universal globe dissolves into a desert sun - think back to the beginning of Raiders and the Paramount logo - we are introduced to Imhotep, played by Arnold Vosloo, in Ancient Egypt. When he is found with the pharaoh's mistress, he is mummified alive and sealed inside a coffin with flesh-eating scarabs while the mistress kills herself in hope that he will resurrect her. Sound unpleasant? It's a way of getting the audience's attention from the very beginning - that's for sure. Then we cut to the 1920's where ex-American Legionnaire, Rick O'Connell, a dashing Brendan Fraser, is being chased away from The Hidden City of Hamunaptra by black robed guards. Librarian, Evelyn, played by Rachel Weisz, and her money-grubbing brother, Jonathan, played by John Hannah, free O'Connell from execution years later in hope that he will lead them to the city. And indeed off they go, only O'Connell suspecting underlying evil, with the opposing explorers, among them Kevin J. O'Connor and Jonathan Hyde, hot on their trail. Of course when they reach the city, the mummy is unleashed and in turn he sets out to bring his love back from the dead, destroy those who stole the Book of the Dead from his chest and generally cause a lot of havoc and mayhem.<br/><br/>If all of this sounds a little silly, then you're right - it is. But it is the kind of light-hearted excitement a summer blockbuster should be. While the film doesn't offer too much in the way of character depth, Fraser comes across as a likeable hero, providing the brawn; Weisz is the respectable librarian-turned-adventurer, providing the brains; and Hannah plays the witty Englishman who provides most of the humour. Saying that, the humour doesn't always work and Fraser's over-the-top heroism is at times irritating. The art direction is worthy of mention, and when the director allows the camera to pull back over a scene, the film looks fantastic, perfectly recreating turn-of-the-century Egypt. Add to that Jerry Goldsmith's exotic and exciting score and you get the best period adventure in a long time. The Mummy isn't without fault, but with all the drivel Hollywood has produced over the last few summers, this is definitely worth a look."

""The Mummy"" was marketed as a horror/suspense/adventure-flick - not the silly slapstick-comedy it turned out to be.<br/><br/>Brendan Frazer may have been just right as ""George of the Jungle"", but he seems awfully misplaced here.

Get with it, guys.  The way that Colonel Rich O'Conell (Brendan Fraser) fought with two guns blazing at the same time looked like he just came from doing a John Woo film.  In fact, the clumsy way that he fought with two guns endearingly reminds one of Chow Yun Fat's antics from his first John Woo film, ""A Better Tomorrow.""  As well as him, many of the other characters, including the wimpy Jonathan, fought in the ""John Woo's double pistol style of Martial Arts"" throughout the film.<br/><br/>Secondly, there are the classic Hong Kong style shots of a mighty magical villain (Vasoloo) holding his arms in the air and commanding a horde of underlings to do his bidding beneath him.  The way that Imhotep summoned his underlings of insects and Godlike Powers comes straight from Hong Kong Horror Films like ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" ""The Bride With White Hair"" and other ""Hopping Vampire"" movies.  There is the heroe's desperate sword-to-claw stand against a horde of toothed horrors, as well as his futile attempt to fight the evil lord (Imhotep) himself bare handed.<br/><br/>Finally, there is that undeniable shot from ""A Better Tomorrow"" of the final stand of three men against a tide of endless enemy, each armed with double pisotls, a machine gun and a shotgun.  This technique has also been used in the disgustingly funny ""From Dusk till dawn.""<br/><br/>Overall, for it's admirable attempt at copying Hong Kong Action/horror Theatre, this is a great film to pass time with."

","The Mummy is a bit like how Indiana Jones might have looked if Hammer had made it with a big budget. Of course, it has rather more humour than Hammer would muster but it is an American summer blockbuster. What is surprising for a summer hit is that it is coherent and has a plot, albeit a simple one.<br/><br/>It is 4000BC and Egypt is mighty. A great pharaoh rules and beside him his concubine, whom none but the monarch may so much as touch. Ah! But envy, lust and greed conspire against the pharaoh and he discovers his beautiful concubine trying on the head priest for size. Oh but what's this? They love each other, they say. Tough, says the pharaoh. Oops, scratch one pharaoh. Then scratch one head priest and concubine at the hands of the vengeful bodyguards. But death is not enough for the head priest. He is cursed to be the living dead.<br/><br/>Still here, okay, jump forward to 1929, take one ex-foreign legionnaire just in from the desert with a treasure map showing the way to an ancient Egyptian necropolis, add one fresh faced, pretty English archaeologist and her roguish brother, and send them all off to find the loot.<br/><br/>Of course, other parties are interested in the booty and nobody knows that amongst the loot is the cursed tomb. Right next to the loot actually. So close in fact that it is mistaken for it and the silly lot open the head priest's sarcophagus. From here on in it is monsters, chases and, rather interestingly, plagues.<br/><br/>The gradual regeneration of the mummy from rotting corpse to general bad character at large is a triumph of computer work - no plodding baddie wrapped in rotting bandages here, you know. Brendan Fraser's character is a bit thin but he performs well enough. Rachel Weisz is very good but then her character has a bit more, er, character.

Then moves up to 1925 with a confusing war scene that started off without any reasonable reason. Up to this point the movie is still confusing.

","First let me preface this review, this is not, despite what some would have you believe, a horror film, it's purely an adventure film and should be viewed as such. Secondly, I've never seen the 1932 original, so as to just how similar the two films are I honestly don't know (although at a hunch I'd guess that the answer to that one would be 'not very').<br/><br/>Okay now let's get down to business. I must say right off that this film quite surprised me, I wasn't expecting it to be anywhere near as much fun as it was after seeing the trailer advertised over the last couple of months, it looked like just another of the recent trend of vacuous blockbusters, all effects and little charm or plot, we all know the films that fit into this ever expanding category, 'Godzilla', 'The Avengers', 'Batman And Robin' and 'Lost In Space' being some of the worst offenders in recent times.<br/><br/>However 'The Mummy' is not one of those films, in fact it's a Hell of a lot of fun, and while far from perfect it has a charm to it that carries everything through to the end with gusto. Like director Stephen Sommers previous film 'Deep Rising' this isn't deep (if you'll pardon the pun), it's just big dumb tongue in cheek fun, and all the more enjoyable for not trying to convince you that its any more than that.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers' direction is fine, but lacks a little something, a certain spark or energy that would elevate this film from 'very good' to 'great' fun. The script by Sommers, LLoyd Fonvielle and Kevin Jarre, and based on the original 1932 Mummy script by John L. Balderston, suffers a similar fate. It manages to sustain the fun throughout without ever really nailing it down perfectly.<br/><br/>Performance wise Brendan Fraser is quite well suited to this kind of role and is a very appealing lead, and is obviously having a ball with the role, while Rachel Weisz plays the slightly ditzy heroine well and John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Erick Avari, Bernard Fox, Omid Djalili and especially Oded Fehr and (for once quite effective) comic relief sidekick Kevin J. O'Connor also adding significantly to the overall fun of the film.<br/><br/>Also boasting some nicely handled cinematography by Adrian Biddle and some effective (and at times quite clever) FX, 'The Mummy' is big budget entertainment for the masses done well.<br/><br/>While it's not quite in the 'Indiana Jones' league, 'The Mummy' is quite an enjoyable film all in all and well worth your time and money, especially if you love a good adventure film.

The director and cast knew when to play for laughs, and the film never reached the 'looking at the watch' time like so many other films these days succumb too.

","There is a new Indiana Jones and his name is Mr O'Connell. The Mummy is an action/adventure/comedy in the best tradition of Saturday morning cinema and it does not miss a trick. A dash of horror/suspense will not have you white nuckled to your seat unless you found the episode in First Contact scary where Picard was chasing Borg through the darkened decks of his ship. This is strictly; tongue in cheek, rip roaring high adventure.<br/><br/>Eventually we will become blase about all these special effects especially if they continue to be thrown at us with the abandon present in this movie. I expected that I had seen most of the FX in the trailer but there were lots more. I expected to see perhaps a dozen undead monsters that were computer (re)generated but there were scores of them and all beautifully realised. I didn't expect to see our hero in a melee with those recently reanimated, wrong again. It's all very clever, I love it and I wonder how long it will be before a whole movie is created in the computer with the actors cut in from simple (and cheap) green room set filming.<br/><br/>Another thought occurs to me: are all the studios protecting themselves against the new Star Wars film? ""If Lucas is going to have lots of FX then we ought to too. Let's make our own FX filled movie so we don't get left behind."" So we are treated to Matrix one week and Mummy the next soon to be followed by Wild Wild West before The Phantom Menace has a chance to blow our socks off with its own computer wizardry.<br/><br/>Regardless of the motive for making this film it is a cracking way to spend a couple of hours in the dark.

The pace of the story, although well thought out, was hectic to especially cater for young/short attention spans and barely left time to create atmosphere or character depth. Brendan Fraser was surprisingly good in the lead role but we will have to wait a couple of decades to see if he compares to Harrison Ford. The role written for Rachel Weisz was not pc but I suppose nothing was in the 1920's.

","This is summertime fun as it used to be. It's a pleasant change to see a movie where the story and characters are not completely swamped by special effects. It's nice to meet familiar types again, deftly touched up for the nineties, but not so much to make them ludicrous in a 1920s setting: a hero who's smart but not smart-aleck, a heroine who seems fluffy but grows with the task in hand, a brother who's a charming wastrel not a cad, self-important opponents, and even two of the natives (who normally just serve as wallpaper) get their moment of glory,  the Curator with a valiant rearguard action usually reserved for some upstanding Yank, and the Tribal chief. We would have loved to see more of him, but somebody must have had a shrewd notion he would have walked away with the movie in the face of its official hero. The Mummy is just what I expected, an old-fashioned adventure yarn where you want to see well-known characters and situations. That's the purpose of genre movies, to deliver variations on a set theme, and the Mummy delivers in spades. Anybody who expected something else should blame Universal's marketing division. Why do they always get their strategies wrong?"
"Lil'Girl","8","0","0","20 June 1999"," Entertaining Silliness
","I suspect that nobody is supposed to take this film seriously as the film itself is suggestively tongue-in-cheek. If it had been a straight horror flick, I don't think I would have given it a second thought but as some reviewers indicated that the film was more of an adventure film a la Indiana Jones, I went along for the ride.<br/><br/>The Mummy has the feel of an old B-movie but certainly with a much bigger budget and more spectacular special effects. The introduction, which is silliness itself, contains some stiff, cheesy acting and narration, making the way for a whole range of comedic moments. The result is pure entertainment mixed with absurdity.<br/><br/>Particular credit must go to its cast, who looked like they were enjoying themselves during this rollercoaster ride: Brendan Fraser, with his goofy good-looks, was a delight, battling with mortal and undead villains. Rachel Weisz, was having fun looking like she was an expert in Egyptology and of course, John Hannah as her brother, showing uncanny timing for one liners.<br/><br/>I confess I had a good laugh out of this. I don't think anybody seriously thinks they're getting a history lesson out of this. If they do, well, they're in for a disappointment. Ultimately, the association with Indiana Jones is fairly minimal. The Mummy is first and foremost an adventure film exploiting bits and pieces of known history as it sees fit.<br/><br/>(A word on special effects in general: With the release of Star Wars, the Matrix and the Mummy, many have criticised the overemphasis of special effects above human actors and good storytelling. I think it is important to see special effects as much an art and a craft as any other forms of film making. Special effects are tools at the film maker's disposal and to be used according to how they would like to present their vision of something beyond the ordinary. There must be a place for all types of film making without this kind of constant barrage of censure of blockbusters. Each film should be judged on its merits - ie, the degree of success it attains in its execution. Comparing Her Majesty, Mrs Brown with something like The Mummy would be like putting apples and oranges on the same footing. This talk about High Culture vs Popular Culture has gone on for more than a hundred years and there doesn't look to be any resolution in sight. Incidentally, Shakespeare and Dickens were not elevated to their lofty status until after their time.)"

","""The Mummy"" is nothing more than a fun ride, that delivers all the chills and thrills as it should.  However, it's not an action film for which you need to leave your brain outside; the filmmakers paid attention to the rules, and stick to them.  In addition, they finally give us an action heroine who is not reduced to ""Screaming bimbo in need of rescue at the end.""  In fact, it's the female lead, and not the male, who ultimately defeats the big villain, in defiance of all previous film tradition.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing and seamless, with some see-through mummy effects that work very well, and a quartet of murderous zombies that evoke the memory of Ray Harryhausen, then go him one (or two or three) better.<br/><br/>On top of all that, the acting and casting in this movie is right on the mark -- Fraser, as always, is marvellous, and every minor character has that ""Gosh, I know them from somewhere"" but yet you don't feeling that is so essential to the genre.  (Kevin J. O'Connor is wonderful as a really, really snivelly nasty minor villain who you do and don't want to see get what he deserves -- and he also gives the constant impression of being someone more well known than he is.  He seems very familiar and yet (check his credits here) he isn't.<br/><br/>But, anyway -- ""The Mummy"" is worth seeing just as a real fun ride that goes one better than the original.

The Mummy is a determined recreation of those terrific Harrison Ford films and a successful one at that.<br/><br/>Director Stephen Somers was also responsible for the bomb Deep Rising which shows that we should allow one or two disasters from directors. He also directed the excellent Tom And Huck in 1995 which starred the brilliant Elijah Wood.<br/><br/>So who's the new Harrison Ford?  Why it's Brendan (Encino Man) Fraser. The Mummy has many of the elements of the Indiana Jones movies but in particular a similar, special, fun filled action formula mixed with a good dollop of semi religious mumbo jumbo.<br/><br/>In The Mummy's case the religiosity is to do with the ancient Egyptians, their tombs and their mummified ancestors.<br/><br/>As well as the good looking, funny Brendan Fraser as Rick, we have an attractive heroine Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), her bumbling brother Jonathon (John Hannah from Sliding Doors). The slimy link man Beni is played by Kevin J O'Connor.<br/><br/>The bad guy in The Mummy is dead. He's played by Arnold Vosloo, although in his digital form he's yet another George Lucas, I.L.M. creation.  He's scary then with a mouth that opens a full hands breath. And what comes out is not only breath and it's not pleasant.<br/><br/>By the way it was George Lucas who wrote the story lines for both of the Indiana Jones films. And Stephen Speilberg was the director.<br/><br/>So off our heroes go to find the ancient tomb at Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where the adventurers hope to find great treasures including The Book Of The Dead. But of course there's a curse on the book and on the treasure.<br/><br/>Sure enough when they get close to the goal the bad guys start to appear and some of this is pretty tense. It's also funny. There are some excellent sequences when some digital mummy warriors are having it out with their human adversaries. A head gets knocked off and the thing keeps swinging blindly with its sword.<br/><br/>Meanwhile with a sword in one hand and an ancient book in the other, a hero is trying to cast the right spell to stop the mummies. It's amusing and exciting.<br/><br/>And then there are the horrible scarab beetles who burrow into your skin and up into your brain, not to mention the seven plagues evoked on Egypt by the mummy. Locusts and  fireballs assault the land.<br/><br/>Romance might blossom between Rick and Evelyn, you'd expect this in this sort of movie.

","The story so far: Fraser and Weisz, together with some friends and a few rivals, visit the lost city of Hamunaptra in search of some buried treasure. Unfortunately, the city is also home to an ancient curse. They discover and revive Imhotep, a rather unfriendly corpse who, after being fully regenerated himself, plans to revive his lost love by sacrificing Weisz. What happens next? Well, if you've seen the Indiana Jones films then you know what to expect.<br/><br/>If done right, this could've been a very frightening Horror film. Writer/Director Stephen Sommers proved with last years' ""Deep Rising"" that he could successfully combine Horror and Comedy to create a fun, intense, and sometimes scary Adventure film. The difference with ""The Mummy"" is that the accent is on the Comedy and I'm not talking about a mild accent, either. This time the entertaining one-liners only succeed in diffusing the suspense he might've created. Why? Because they come one after another, without any breaks, even when the situation would seem better suited to silence. The thing I loved about ""Deep Rising"" and the similarly toned ""Tremors"" is that not only did they know when to keep the comedy coming, they also knew when to shut up. No such luck here. Instead of a fast paced monster movie we get the equivilent in the children's category; toned down violence and a few minor scares. This isn't the type of film I expected from the director who, just last year, had me on the edge of my seat while watching Treat Williams and Famke Janssen race through a flooded cruise ship on a waverunner mere meters ahead of a cluster of angry tentacles.<br/><br/>In closing, let me say that ""The Mummy"" wasn't the worst film. The one-liners were funny and I was certainly never bored, but this is a film that will appeal more to the preteen, early teen age groups. It reminds one of the days when parents didn't need to be quite so concerned about the films their children were watching. A Horror film for the young, if you will."

A few years from now the special effects will look as pathetic to us as the CG in Toy Story does today.

","I went in to this movie expecting a blockbuster, and that may have been what caused its downfall from my view.  The special effects were exactly what I was expecting if not more, keeping me enthralled and allowing me to ignore the gaps in the plot. It was obvious to me that more time was spent on the special effects then on any other aspect of this film.  Even with it's downfalls this film was an average movie without the special effects which makes it above average for the total package. I would recomend this as a movie to see, if only for the effects."

","Re-engineered for modern audiences, the tale of Imhotep comes alive with excellent special effects, awesome sets, and a good script.<br/><br/>Not just a simple re-make, the story has been updated and expanded, making for one excellent picture.  It could have done without some of the humorous one-liners, and Fraser's kooky expressions were slightly overdone, but perhaps that's just because I think a good horror film should focus on the dramatic elements.  I wasn't looking for a pseudo-""Raiders"".<br/><br/>However, the film stands well on it's own, and the addition of subtitles for the Egyptian dialogue was an excellent idea, and added to the overall atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>Very much worth seeing."

","So, I'll be seeing The Mummy for the seventh time this weekend.  For those of you who think that's over the top, it may be.  The first five times were at the insistence of my four-year-old daughter who has nerves of steel and came through unscathed.  I am looking for friends who haven't been fortunate enough to have seen it yet to provide me an excuse to see it again.    I should add that, although I watch movies over and over, in general (the ones I like), I rarely spend my money at the theater to do so.<br/><br/>Many deplore the current trend of blending humor and action and drama and, in this case, horror, and romance.  But I love a movie like that.  I like getting it all.  Some have compared it to the Indiana Jones movies.  There is some justification for that and I don't think it suffers by the comparison.  If it isn't as graphically violent or as gritty (and it's not), it benefits by the excellent advances in special effects (without being made by them) and by a lead character women might well prefer since he is clearly more interested in the girl than the treasures.  In tone and humor, it could also be likened, I think, to ""True Lies"" and ""Men in Black"", partially because of the mixes of horror, action, humor and/or romance and partially because of the excellent seamless effects that are part of the story rather than included just to impress.<br/><br/>It is not ""best picture"" material (more's the pity) because it is obviously too much fun.  It is fresh time after time, amusing and thrilling.

","The Mummy is an overblown, big budget B-movie. It is an exciting piece of entertainment. Brendan Fraser is solid in the lead role with the right amount of comedy and seriousness. Vosloo was very spooky as the Mummy, showing that he has the natural ability to play a heavy in a movie. The direction from Stephen Sommers was pretty tight all around, the film did linger from time to time, but overall was always interesting.

"thegreek","Null","0","0","8 May 1999"," THE MUMMY: It's A Wrap.
","Having just returned from seeing Universal's ""big-budget"" remake of THE MUMMY, the most remarkable effect the film had on me was its ability to make 14 completely good dollars disappear. Expecting to see a horror film, my friends and I were duped into seeing a weak, self-parodic COMEDY!<br/><br/>The trailers for this unfortunate miscreant seemed promising, hinting towards a dramatic Grand Guignol in the vein of BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA. Instead, writer/director Stephen Sommers recreates a Universal classic as a sophomoric conglomeration of Hollywood's worst cliches.<br/><br/>The film's opening is promising; Imhotep's dastardly deeds are presented against a convincing ancient Egyptian setting. Unfortunately, it seems that CGI effects are most plausible when used to recreate locations, rather than living beings. The Mummy himself, as he appears later in the film, is about as frightening as wet toast. Arnold Vosloo certainly looks menacing as the titular meanie, but the siren-song of CGI rears its ugly head once again. Apparently, the digital artists just can't resist using the new technology to stretch a character's face to ridiculous proportions. This is THE MUMMY, dammit, not THE MASK.<br/><br/>Also, instead of a traditional sturdy action hero, Brendan Fraser's Indiana Jones clone is merely a Bruckheimer-esque one-liner spouting bore. Rachel Weisz, while charming, is little more than a bookish twit; John Hannah, as her bumbling brother, does no better, and Bernard Fox is completely wasted as a besotted pilot. Perhaps worst of all is Kevin O'Connor, who comes across as a human version of ALADDIN's Iago; his dialogue is so moronic that one almost expects to hear it in the voice of Gilbert Gottfried. The obligatory band of American tough-guys, all unknowns, may as well have had ""EXPENDABLE"" stamped on their foreheads.<br/><br/>Sommers' ridiculous material sank what could have been a grand scream-fest. He seems to subscribe to the ""chemistry"" school of filmmaking. A pinch of ALADDIN, a pound of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, a hefty dose of ARMY OF DARKNESS (just wait until Imhotep's squad of commando-mummies leaps into the fray)...with its profusion of idiotic one-liners (and its PG-13 rating), THE MUMMY might better have been titled BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE EGYPT.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a good thing that the CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON remake is suspended in development limbo; if this is the best that Universal expects from its remakes, maybe the powers-that-be should try something radical, something no self-respecting Hollywood studio has dared to produce in years: SOMETHING NEW!<br/><br/>In short, THE MUMMY is a typical piece of Hollywood crap; the only curse it spawned was the one I uttered upon leaving the theater. If you're looking for a decent thriller, rent the 1932 Karl Freund original and ignore this miserable load of spunt."

"superman-8","8","0","0","3 June 1999"," Heh. Indiana Jones meets slapstick and camp. You gotta love it.
","The Mummy? If you only saw the previews for it, you'd think it was a SPFX-filled horror flick. If you go to see it, your perceptions will be adjusted to see that it's a SPFX-filled campy comedy-type filled flick *tinged* with horror. Think: Indiana Jones meets, oh, not quite the 3 Stooges, but close. It basically brings back the feeling of the campy Saturday afternoon ""horror"" flicks - with a lot more humor. Admittedly, some of the scenes were downright creepy - flesh-devouring beetles (that you never really see doing such, it's only 99% implied), ghouls crawling rapidly after the good guys - down the sides of the walls, that sort of thing. But this film is so peppered with 1-liners, staged comedic spills and the like, it's very difficult to take as a pure horror flick - or to stop your lips from splitting open in a hearty belly laugh. Brendan Fraser parodies Indiana Jones wonderfully - with more humor, smugness, and dare I say it, giggly attempts at romance. People might slam his performance, but I'd say it's as solid as Keanu ""Huh?"" Reeves in ""The Matrix"" (is that a bad thing to say here? I don't think so.) Rachel Weisz puts on a great performance as the slightly-off-kilter knowledgeable Egyptologist, and has a handful of priceless 1-liners and slapstick scenes in points...and Arnold Vosloo... well...for a pretty minimalist acting job, I thought his screen charisma and presence stood out pretty strongly. I'd second other people's thoughts here in that he looked a lot like Billy Zane in ""The Phantom"". He did! Able supporting cast, creepy opportunist-turned-darkside's-evil-henchman played aptly by Kevin O'Connor...great scenery, wonderfully designed sets...and did I mention the SPFX yet??? :) It all ends predictably enough, but it's an enjoyable ride - and one that will bring more laughs to your face than you expect. Dunno if it's worth buying on DVD, but plunk down your $X and see this movie - it's a nice piece of lighter fare which could balance out your diet of serious, grimmer stuff (Matrix) or larger-than-life wanna-be legends (Star Wars Ep. 1)...etc. Check it out."

There were a lot of original and exciting action sequences in the film and I also like that it was aware of itself at times.  For example, the scene where Evelyn and Jonathan open the book of the dead for the first time and slight wind blows over the camp fire, Jonathan's line being ""That happens a lot,"" is very clever.

It is reminiscent of the classic Hitchcock films that left the audience to fill in the gaps or not as they saw fit, while the story moved on with grace and dignity.

Why didn't someone dig this stuff up about 200 years ago. Oh, that's right, there was a map, wasn't there, but the cowboys have the map too. Where did they get that. There must be two maps. Then. of course, there is the mummy's mouth. Do you remember anything about mummy's having large mouths. Why does everyone who isn't alive have a large mouth? Why did they put the princess's body parts in the jars. What would have happened if someone had just blown away a couple of those jars. Where did that guy get the job guarding the secret city, and why is he so lousy at it? Why are those bugs there? What do they eat when they're just waiting around for tourists to show up at the secret city. How do you kill the dead--and do you really want to? Who is the mummy scared of--is it those same guys that came up and got the bad guys in ""Ghost?"" Why does Brendan Frazier get a couple of years in prison for killing about 600 Egyptians. I don't know--I have to say that if I watched this and never asked myself any questions, it's just silly enough to entertain--my son liked it and I respect his sense of joy. There are certainly a lot of things jumping out and hands touching shoulders during tense scenes. I know this whole thing is tongue in cheek and is supposed to mimic the 1940's B movies, but with a little more imagination it could have done this and been a pretty cool movie! Perhaps they could have even added a little suspense!"
"Aeria","Null","0","0","18 May 1999"," George of the Jungle parodies mummy movies
","They were trying to make a parody, right? The Mummy ends up parodying every monster movie ever made. The pacing, the dialogue, everything...very predictable. The dialogue and action sets us up, and then follows through with no surprises whatsoever. Nothing was scary; nothing was surprising. Everything from the bugs to the ""don't read the book!"" to the Americans and the Egyptologist getting it, to the end fight scenes and the sinking of the city...all set up...ugh! Why didn't they just send a telegraph instead...oh, wait, they did. I was more entertained by counting how many different plot points they gave away before they happened than the movie itself. The mummies weren't scary at all. They looked more like actors dressed up in rags doing the moonwalk. Also, when the whole audience breaks out in laughter when a poor extra gets vacuumed by the scarabs, then there's a severe problem.<br/><br/>The special effects and sets are great. The acting was acceptable, if you can stand George of the Jungle in Egypt. Fraiser made the movie comical, but I think the director, other actors, scriptwriter, etc. didn't realize how comical they were really being. If there had been an attempt to make this a parody, instead of an ""action/horror"" flick, it would have been much better.<br/><br/>So, if you have no intelligence and enjoy being beat over the back of the head with a board labeled ""PLOT"", then go see the Mummy. As for me, I'm going to go find the bottle named Alieve. Maybe it'll soothe my aching head."
"Movie-12","6","0","0","18 May 1999"," Never Convincing or Emotional, but with great effects. **1/2 out of ****
","""The Mummy"" is a clone of the ""Indiana Jones"" series that blends adventure with plot twists and first rate suspense. While ""The Mummy"" does accomplish a thing or two with a neat computer animated ""mummy,"" it just doesn't quite work. It's like the old saying goes that it is one thing to respect something, and it is another to like it. I do respect the filmmakers who were hard at work making this production, but something about it was almost repetitive and never truly convincing.<br/><br/>There is a story here, it often is unfocused and drifts off from a real point of view, but there is a story nonetheless. It follows the adventures of two brothers, a librarian, several researchers who seemingly have no recollection of consequences that evolve from their mistakes, and a couple other side characters that have no purpose in the film but to become a human victim of a non-human creature who will pick his prey one by one when they are separated from the rest of the clan.  See the formula we are up against; how can we care about the characters when we have already seen these so many more times before hand.<br/><br/>The director is Stephen Sommers, who obviously prefers to introduce his characters, then start right off with the plot. We know this because his last film, ""Deep Rising,"" also did the same with its story. I don't think this method quite works. It brings forth many unneeded characters, who in turn we know they will be killed in the order where the whimsy ones go first, then the side character whom we do not know their names; the typical horror film formal. ""The Mummy"" is definitely an improvement over the last movie he directed, but again, just isn't persuasive enough to actually be recommended by myself.<br/><br/>The setup takes too long for Sommers to setup. The narrator explains most of the ritualistic events to us at the beginning rather than show us, which makes it very hard to understand. The characters are well developed, while every one of them was obvious in their motives immediately. There are plenty that die, few that live, and a whole lot of boredom in the first twenty minutes while they are introduced.   And lets not forget the overwhelming, vast and good-looking desert in which much of film is shot in. The atmosphere is another great element in this movie, which is eerie and spooky, but never actually terror provoking.<br/><br/>Brendon Frasier was a good goof in ""George of the Jungle,"" ""Blast From The Past,"" and several other comedies he has been in the last few years. However ""The Mummy"" is supposed to be scary, suspenseful, and shocking, not comic. This is yet another example of an actor with humorous potential putting it to use when he is supposed to be quite serious. Frasier doesn't even come close with hitting the mark here, mimicking Harrison Fords sense of humor from ""Indiana Jones,"" he just does not have what it takes to be a serious actor.<br/><br/>""The Mummy's"" mummy was horrific in the most dastardly of ways. It was gruesome, scary and head tuning. I just wish that he looked like a mummy. For by the time this movie is over, the only mummy left to do the killing is a muscular actor in full flesh. Can't they even live up to the title?"

The special effects and sound track are excellent. However, unlike Indiana Jones it has weak acting, a tepid romance, and a script that is predictable, weak, and inconsistent.  A horror film should rely on atmosphere and a gradual heightening of suspense - as a genre it has become largely extinct.                  .<br/><br/>This film works as an excuse to go to the theater between ""The Matrix"" and ""Star Wars"".

The Mummy takes the viewer to a time when life was lived and wars were fought with simple means.

The acting was good, the comedic twists were well timed and well delivered by a surprisingly seasoned cast. The story gave itself a chance to develop, not rushing too quickly into the special effects that riddle the trailers. The effects are well placed and used only when necessary creating believability within the visual story.

The 1932 was slack-paced, and the chills there were the result of the slow reincarnation of the mummy.<br/><br/>Maybe that worked on audiences in 1932, but apparently today's audiences want less romance, more shocks and more special effects. Or maybe, today's filmmakers just lack the vision and imagination to do what filmmakers of yore, like Karl Freund and Alfred Hitchcock, were able to do.<br/><br/>The kid in me loves all-stops-out adventure movies with nifty special effects, especially when there is a treasure at the end of the journey.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this remake of the 1932 Boris Karloff horror-flick doesn't deliver on it's wonderful premise.

","The Mummy is not a terrible movie.  It's entertaining and enjoyable, especially after the first half-hour or so, which is rushed as if the director were in a hurry.  I'd much rather sit through a longer movie, as long as it's directed better than this one.<br/><br/>The acting is not bad: Fraser, Weisz, and Hannah deliver, although the three Americans and O'Connor are all given characters filled with stereotypes, and Vosloo is not all that scary.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is very good.  The cinematography is warm and wrapping, and the art direction beautifully and realistically sets the story in Egypt.  The visual effects and the makeup are astonishing, and with Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack, are by far the best things of the whole movie.<br/><br/>What lacks here is a solid story line.  Virtually all the characters are forced to pronounce obvious or ridiculous lines from time to time, and the only good things are the occasional jokes thrown in the plot just to make the audience laugh and maybe forgive the lack of a better screenplay.<br/><br/>The original was by far better than this one, and definitely scarier.<br/><br/>This movie set an opening record, but it's worth to watch only if you've got nothing better to do, nothing better to see, and nowhere better to go."

","We went to see ""The Mummy"" this evening. Without going into a review of the film, I will say that it was disappointing to say the least. Filled with special effects, there was more substance to the stale air in the tomb than there was to the poorly written script. The original, with Boris Karloff, while tarnished by its sometimes stilted dialogue, offered a far more believable plot and an Imhotep, who did not look like Darkman, but rather a mummified priest. True only to the original in name, Stephen Sommers' new film was nothing short of slapstick, thinly veiled in unlikely horror. The real horror was that I had to sit through it all. Rachel Weisz, the British actress who played Evelyn, is a striking beauty, who appears to be fairly much a newcomer to American films. I was hoping ""The Mummy"" would be filled with terror. Alas and alack."
"Mike-469","4","0","0","13 May 1999"," Not Worth Your Effort
","Overall, I was disappointed with this movie.  I know it's supposed to be mindless fun, but geez -- some parts were just stupid, even if you checked your brain at the door!  For example, after Rick and Evelyn are confronted for the first time by the giant, horrible mummy, Rick shoots at him a couple of times, and then runs out of the building.  Outside, when they are asked by others about the mummy inside, Rick just matter-of-factly goes, ""Oh, I took care of him.""  What??  Come on!  You'd think they'd at least run out panting or scared or something.  Another example: the whole group of characters spends a good portion of the beginning of the film on their way to Hamanaptra, an adventure in itself, as they lose all of their possessions, etc.  Finally, they get there, and you think that most of the movie is going to take place in this ancient scary place, far from civilization.  But after the scene I first described, the next scene shows them suddenly in a nice hotel in Cairo!  There's no explanation of how they got out of Hamanaptra, away from the mummy and the bugs, etc.  These inconsistencies happen throughout the film.<br/><br/>Also, the characters made too many wisecracks for my taste.  If you're going to put characters into implausible situations such as this, at *least* have them believe in what they're doing!  The wisecracks remind us of the weakness of the plot and prevent us from really getting into the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this movie a 4 out of 10, if only for some exciting moments and good special effects.  But don't be fooled -- this is in no way the ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" of the 90's."

","This is a modern ""B"" movie of the 40's and 50's mixed in with 90's style and effects.  Directed by Steven Sommers, who has worked with action before (THE JUNGLE BOOK ;1994;, and DEEP RISING). The film is about two teams, one led by the rip-roaring Rick O' Connell (Brendan Fraiser) who brings along a beautiful English archaeologist (Rachel Wesiz) and her often drunk brother (John Hannah).  The other team are greedy Americans who are led by Sommer's regular Kevin J. O'Connor and they bring along an Egyptolgist (Johnathan Hyde).  The two teams are trying to make it to Hamunaptra (the City of the dead) where it's loaded with tons of treasures. Once they reach the ancient city of the dead, they are warned by a traditional army to stay away from the city and to leave immediately. The foreigners don't really care, until they realized that they found the book of the dead, and once it's read, the dead priest, will rise and won't be stopped, until all who have awakened him are killed and till he takes over the world. This is a ""matinee"" movie, it doesn't mean that it should be only watched in the matinee, but it reminds you of a old-fashion action film.  Along the same lines as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it has plenty of mixutre of terror, action, humor, and of course, gross bugs.  The actors do a respectable ""B"" movie job, Brendan Fraiser stands out as a typical Sommer's action hero (if you've seen DEEP RISING, you'll know what I mean).  Rachel Wesiz plays a very pretty heroine, and John Hannah is the ""side-kick"" that the audience will be rooting for. This is an entertaining movie, it's no classic, but it is worth watching. It is very fast paced, and it does grab your attention throughout the two hour plus movie.  It's fun, and worth a look at.

","The Mummy is, at heart, an adventure serial from the 1930's, which means it is in the same genre as the Indiana Jones films.  While it never achieves the excitement and awe that those movies brought to the big screen, it has its moments.<br/><br/>The cast, for the most part, is outstanding.  Brendan Fraser plays another variation on his hunky-cartoony persona, swaggering and swashbuckling like an old pro.  Rachel Weisz is great as the feisty love interest, sort of a Lara Croft for the 1930's.  The chemistry between the two is real, and their dialog is witty and exciting.<br/><br/>Arnold Vosloo makes a somewhat disappointing mummy, however.  He never seems very menacing -- largely because he looks more like a high school math professor than a mighty lord of the undead, with his doe eyes and pudgy face.<br/><br/>Whether or not you like the special effects in the film will depend largely on how you feel about computer animation.  There are some shots, particularly of the mummy, that look like low-grade ""Hercules&Xena"" quality effects, a surprise since the effects were done by Industrial Light&Magic. Some of it works, some doesn't, and it all would have looked better with models and makeup (but I'm old fashioned).<br/><br/>Regardless, the movie is cheery, exciting, and fun.  There is an element of ""Army of Darkness"" style camp which is good for laughs, but it also delivers some  good old-fashioned thrills and chills.<br/><br/>No one will ever mistake The Mummy for a masterpiece -- it's too  slick, too post-modern, and at times embarrassingly silly (like the beginning, where characters stand around spouting plot exposition as if they're pitching us the movie).  But it's well worth the 6 or 7 dollars to see on the big screen."

","Obviously, advertising for the Mummy promises state-of-the-art special effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  I entered the theater with re-newed faith in the movie industry, as the last film I caught was 'The Matrix.' What did I find?<br/><br/>First of all, the special effects in the Mummy showed a complete lack of imagination.  How many times can they show a moving skeleton?  How many times can scarabs appear in swarms out of nowhere?  Or bees, or locusts? The mummy himself was pretty cool when he first came to life, I admit, but they could have done even more with his appearance, since you get to see him up close many times.<br/><br/>Aside from the effects, the central problem here is plot, or rather lack of one:  a cookie-cutter storyline, down to the last scene where the hero kisses the girl and they ride off into the sunset (though on camels here instead of horses).  I'll admit it was funny, very funny in parts, but I didn't go in expecting a comedy.  Movies like 'Scream' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' could pull off making you laugh, and placing you at the edge of your seat at the same time.  This movie completely fails at that, and comes off as a complete Adventure-movie spoof.  Even 'Tremors' was better at creating tension.  Because 'The Mummy' seems to be continually making fun of itself, you never feel the wonderful suspense that made movies like 'Speed' and 'T2' superior action flicks.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say the movie's greatest strengths come from the comedic writing, and Brendan (who is in no way responsible for this movie's shortcomings, by the way) continually beating the s**t out of this little twerp that keeps showing up at key turning points in the film.<br/><br/>If you must investigate the Mummy's curse, I suggest a matinee."

If The Mummy can be seen as a return to the style of the cheap B-movies, with the dimensionality of the characters and the simple plot, the cg effects are used tactfully to give The Mummy a B-movie feel."

"whitney-6","7","0","0","11 May 1999"," Good effects, fun characters, quite entertaining, never a slow moment
","This is a pretty good action/adventure film, the special effects were very impressive for the most part, although, nothing totally new, multiple bugs, sand storms, walking skeletons etc.  Brendan Fraser does a convincing job as the hero of the film, he's good looking, brave, ready for anything, but the guy is NOT the next Harrison Ford, though he does try. The most impressive part with respect to the main characters is that this movie is not a Brendan-fest.  The film spends enough time on ALL the main characters, and they all get developed past the point of being scenery. They even get to help fight the bad guy! Imagine! The plot of the movie moves right along, you get a brief background on the mummy, straight and to the point, you meet the main characters, and you're off.  No time wasted, which is just the kind of treat to have in this sort of movie.  If you go to the movies for entertainment, you will enjoy this, and have some laughs, if you go for enlightenment, give it up.  It's fun, it doesn't try to be a carbon copy of an Indiana Jones movie and even brings in a couple of surprises that you don't see coming. Girls who are looking for Brendan at his best will be a little let down this time around, he's not nearly as pumped and cut as he was for George of the Jungle, and we don't see as much of him exposed, but what can you do?"

","Maybe the commercials got me too hyped - or maybe I am just too excited about The Phantom Menace, but this film wasn't what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>Let's face it - they tried a bit hard to make it a 'PG-13' film.  This sort of film really needed the content and rating of 'R' before it would have shined.  The character slapstick was often 'too slapstick' to be funny (making it feel far too PG-13ish for what the trailers led me to believe) and while the occasional humor was appreciated, there was a bit much for a movie like this.<br/><br/>Glaring little things popping up also distracted me from the film (the obvious Small Pox vaccine scar and the 'desert nomad' having whiter teeth than me).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - the movie wasn't BAD. It just wasn't the hype.  The pre-title sequence in ancient Egypt are almost worth the price of admission and the FX won't make you gasp most of the time, but has some great treats.<br/><br/>

"Cavebear","5","0","0","11 May 1999"," A solid film, but you may want to wait until the video.
","In 1926 Egypt, a spunky librarian/Egyptologist (Weisz) saves the life of an American Foreign Legionnaire (Fraser) who claims to have been to Hamunaptra--the ancient Egyptian City of the Dead. She is looking for the book of Amon Ra, but finds a 3,000 year old mummy who's having a really rotten day.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that I'm really not fond of horror films. I generally stay away from movies that have the primary purpose of scaring the audience. So, what was I doing at THE MUMMY?<br/><br/>That can be answered in two words: Brendan Fraser. I have enjoyed Fraser's performances in past films and find him to generally be a likable character. Unfortunately, he was miscast as the lead character of Rick O'Connell. In a role that called for cool-headed stoicism, he came across as stiff and befuddled. I believe his ""Encino Man"" and ""George of the Jungle"" characters have rubbed off on him. He was monosyllabic to the point of muteness.<br/><br/>The script tried to give Fraser plenty of Arnold-esque throwaways to evoke laughter, but Fraser simply does not have Schwarzenegger's panache. Beyond a few mild chuckles, there wasn't much to evoke the campy feel that I believe the producers wanted. Fraser is affable, almost goofy, but he tried too hard to be hard-bitten when he should have accentuated his little-boy persona.<br/><br/>There was a distinct ""been-there-done-that"" aura surrounding this entire production. The set-pieces and sequences were strictly by-the-book thriller/action cliches ripped from countless other like-minded films. We have flesh-eating scarab beetles, ancient spells, American treasure-hunters, British intellectuals, a groveling evil sidekick, mysterious desert tribesmen, and lots of skeletal undead shuffling about.<br/><br/>I also found the effects and cinematography to be disappointing. I like to get a ""movie"" experience when paying for a theatre ticket, and THE MUMMY failed to deliver. Much of the film plays out in the claustrophobic labyrinth beneath Hamunaptra. While the lighting was always done well-enough to see the action, it would look much the same on a small screen as it did on the large. And the CGI mummy was stiff and mechanical. Especially in the full-body shots, it moved more like a stop-motion model than computer wizardry.<br/><br/>There were a few good scenes. One set of warrior mummies move with the grace and speed of giant cats. An old warrior gets a final chance at redemption and brings a lump to your throat. And there's some pretty good sword fighting in the climactic scene. In general, the supporting cast was solid, with decent acting jobs all around.<br/><br/>So, what did I really like about THE MUMMY?<br/><br/>That can also be answered in two words: Rachel Weisz. As the inept librarian, Evelyn, she simply sparkled. She was a bright, effervescent light in a gray film. She added color and levity to every scene and bubbled over with more personality than most of the rest of the cast combined. Her naivete layered over a harder core makes her one of the more interesting heroines to appear on the silver screen in some time. THE MUMMY is definitely worth a look see for her appearance alone.<br/><br/>But you may want to wait until the video is released.<br/><br/>Cavebear's ranking for THE MUMMY<br/><br/>Quality - 3: Solid, if unspectacular, film.<br/><br/>Appeal - 2: Nothing new or exciting to offer fans or non-fans of the genre, but should play well until the Stars fall on May 19. Then it will be (un)dead in the water.<br/><br/>Final ranking (Q+A): 5"

"sarab70","Null","0","0","11 May 1999"," Fun, but not art... And where are the Egyptians?
","I enjoyed this movie very much, although I think it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie (after the wonderful and creepy ancient Egypt scene) had me somewhat confused and even bored.  There were a lot of characters introduced, but we aren't given much information about any of them.  The Brendan Fraser character is in a shootout, dressed in some uniform gunning down hundreds of assorted horsemen in the middle of the desert.  I've learned through reading the reviews and production information that he was in the Foreign Legion - but were we supposed to guess that ourselves?  I guess that the editing of this movie just wasn't that great. We are also introduced to this 'Beni' character, who bothered me because I couldn't tell WHAT he was.  Was he supposed to be an Egyptian?  Again, through reading on the net I find out he was from Budapest (what a terrible accent).  Which brings me to another gripe - in this day and age, why weren't more, or ANY, for that matter, Egyptians used for any of the main characters?  Even the pharoah's main guardsman is of European descent.  I also was not as enamoured of the brother character, 'the drunken English fop'.  I just thought he was an annoying afterthought, although I see that many people loved him.<br/><br/>But enough of that.  I loved the mummy character - although I  had a hard time understanding why he was supposed to be so evil - he seemed like a sensitive romantic to me (other than the assassinating the pharoah thing). Brendan Fraser was gorgeous as usual - could we see some more chest please? I still wouldn't compare him to Harrison Ford as an action star though - there's still something missing, although it could be a fault of the script. And the librarian was beautiful and played her part very well.  I appreciated the no-gore policy of the film, but I still wouldn't take a child under 13 to see it.  Lots of decimated bodies, gouged-out eyeballs, flesh-eating giant beetles.  The special effects were GREAT.  In spite of what some others have commented, I thought the mummy's half-face and elongated jaw effects were fantastic.  Not to mention the sand wall thing.<br/><br/>A fun movie for a Saturday matinee, and I will be renting it on video."
"possum-3","Null","0","0","11 May 1999"," How dumb is DUMB?
","As an example of the obvious 'care' and 'thought' that went into this film: If resurrected, the mummy was supposed to gain the power of the Ten Plagues of Egypt, right?  But the illiterate scriptwriter overlooks one small fact: the plagues visited upon Egypt were brought down by the GOD OF THE JEWS, not by any of the Egyptian ones, so what they are asking you to believe is that an Egyptian priest, cursed by Egyptians and buried inkeeping with their customs, somehow gets the power of a Jewish diety?  Bizzare, and a good indication that thinking wasn't the biggest concern when they scribbled out this script ('Gee, we need something that uses a lot of special effects, cause that's all the idiots want...."")... ....to say nothing of the stupidity of cursing the guy anyway, if he's suddenly going to become that powerful.  Or didn't you 'think' of that??"
"iago-6","Null","0","0","11 May 1999"," Fun but Unfulfilling
","There are a lot of bad things about this movie, and a few good ones.<br/><br/>Good: The return to the jocular tone and goofball characters of the 30's monster films. I particularly liked the woman and her brother: it's refreshing to see characters who are not desperately begging us to think that they're COOL. It doesn't hurt that the woman looks like Kate Bush when she lets her hair down.<br/><br/>Bad: The movie takes a serious downhill turn once the Mummy is released, turning into a mind-numbing, senseless special effects fest. There is not ONE second of suspense in this film, and nothing the least bit scary. That's fine, but what the film replaces that with is: Special effects! Special effects that don't make sense! You get these plagues that just DISAPPEAR after the characters run from them a little bit. A swarm of Locusts! Then: They're gone! A hail of flaming stones! Then: it's over! A cloud of black flies! Then: they go away! It just doesn't make any sense, and doesn't really do all that much to advance the story, or even thrill the audience. I love special effects, but this movie really could have used LESS of them, and a whole lot more atmosphere. This would have been a much better movie had their budget been $40 million, rather than $80.<br/><br/>Good: Brendan Fraser, who can't quite cut the Indiana Jones thing, so he does something else, and turns himself into a likable, slightly unhinged surfer dude with a mean streak. Go Brendan.<br/><br/>Bad: The Mummy. It's not a Mummy, but a buffed-up corpse, and before you know it looks just like a guy. A not even slightly scary guy. At certain point the story threatens to turn into a Dracula story, with the Mummy turning into sand and slithering through keyholes and such. Great: but that's not a Mummy story. I want a slow walking Mummy who's wrapped in bandages. Oh well.<br/><br/>Bad: These beetles, who really have no bearing on the plot, who either devour people slowly over the course of 1,000 years, or quickly, in the space of a second, depending on the whim of the screenplay. Doesn't it seem to ANYONE in Hollywood that some things should make SENSE?<br/><br/>Bad: The haphazard plotting and absolutely shapeless screenplay. This film truly has an action climax every five minutes. I wonder if, in the mind of the director and screenwriter, this film makes even the least bit of sense. I know, it doesn't make sense that Mummies come to life and kill people after 3,000 years in the ground, but sometimes I begin to think that certain people in Hollywood are literally unable to tell a coherent story.<br/><br/>Good: The pervasive sense of goofy fun, and the lack or gore and violence. A lot of people are killed, but the camera turns away from real, on-screen violence, and is merely suggestive, using shadows and other tricks to convey what's happening. I personally don't miss seeing heads being ripped apart or bodies exploding.<br/><br/>Good: Those GOOFY acrobatic Russian-type guard mummies who show up near the end.<br/><br/>This is a fun, senseless, but frustrating and ultimately unfulfilling movie. I found it refreshing, however, to be in a LOW-TECH environment, where they aren't trying to download this or defuse that or decode this, and there isn't a laptop in sight. You'll get your two-hours worth, but as I said, I wish the filmmmakers had half the budget and were forced to resort to actual CREATIVITY!<br/><br/>--- Check out website devoted to bad and cheesy movies: www.cinemademerde.com"

","The Mummy was a pretty good movie, but there were some problems with it. First and foremost, it should have been rated R.  It could have been a much better movie had the creators tried to make it R instead of PG-13.  The intro was good, but I think a little more info about Imhotep's past would have been nice.  Also, what in the hell was Rick (the main guy) doing in the Middle East?<br/><br/> When I first heard about The Mummy, I heard that it WOULD be rated R, and that it would be a powerful epic, which is what I was hoping for.  The final story was pretty good but could have used some work (well, the director was also the screenwriter).<br/><br/>This movie had great potential for being a not so typical horror movie that actually had a plot, but it tripped and fell at the end.

"Ashton-4","Null","0","0","11 May 1999"," The Mummy: Campy Fun
","I saw The Mummy tonight also and I must say I enjoyed it immensely. The film has a great camp feel that most recent films of this type have not been able to capture. Some of the films of this genre try to take themselves too seriously and end up as unintentional bad parodies (Godzilla). Others make the mistake of trying to be too campy and forget that a coherent story is also necessary (The Avengers). Still others don't know which direction to go and fail miserably on both sides (Congo).<br/><br/>The Mummy on the other hand knows exactly what it is trying to be. A fun two hours with some thrills and laughs thrown in equal parts. Brendan Fraser borrows heavily from the Indiana Jones Book of Action Hero Acting, but is able to pull it off. He has an innate charm that allows you to believe his little throwaway lines and humorous threats. The real stand out in the film is John Hannah who plays the character of Jonathan. You may remember Hannah from the film Four Weddings and a Funeral where he played Matthew (he is the one who delivers the eulogy at his lover's funeral). This role is a complete departure from that one and he hams up the screen in every scene. I got to the point where I was looking forward to what he would say whenever some new danger came looming onto screen. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well; they all seemed to know not to take the material too seriously.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect by any means, but it wasn't trying to be. I enjoyed it for what it was, a fun two hour romp that was scary sometimes funny a lot of times, and didn't bother spending too much time on the little details like character development or continuity. Sure there were plot holes big enough to drive a herd of camels through, but anyone attempting a serious critique of this film is missing the point.<br/><br/>I wish studios would make more films like this and stop trying to knock the ball out of the park on every film. Not every film has to be the biggest and best ever made. Some films serve well when they entertain an audience and give you your money's worth. Movie going does not always have to be a life changing experience. I believe this weekend's box office figures support the theory that there is a market for this type of film if done well. It was a brilliant move for Universal to release this film when it did. The Mummy serves as a nice intermezzo before this summer's blockbuster feeding frenzy.<br/><br/>In the grand scheme of movie making I give The Mummy a solid 'B', but for hitting its target and not trying to be something more than it is I give it an 'A'."

The movie was, however, anything but a disappointment.<br/><br/>The best way to describe this movie would be to make comparisons to the Indiana Jones movies.  In fact, this could easily have been a continuation of that series.  The hero was very Indy-Like (with some dashes of Han Solo and the hero from Romancing the Stone) with a good dose of humor thrown into the Macho Hero act.  There is the beautiful damsel (actually the brains of the outfit), the incompetent tag along, and the mysterious band of strangers.  All in all, well cast and appropriately acted.<br/><br/>There are some good action sequences, great light hearted banter, and no nudity or blood.  The deaths, although sometimes nasty, are bloodless. Most of the special effects budget seems to have been spent on the mummies themselves (pay close attention to how them in the later action sequences) but there are a few good ""biggies"" in the movie as well.<br/><br/>If you are looking for hard core horror, this is not the movie for you.

Matrix was so good with such incredible effects and a good story, that I was hoping such innovation had become standard - that the next big release would also be able to match it.

","Admit it. The Mummy is one of the most derivative,predictable, and unoriginal movies around. It uses every old plot device and cliche from a hundred adventure movies, and stuffs them into two hours of special effects...but does it REALLY well. It's a lot of fun to watch, as long as you can get past that simple fact. There really isn't anything in this movie we haven't seen before, but we've probably never seen it done quite this well.<br/><br/>It's very much in the spirit of the Indiana Jones movies (heck, Brendan Fraser really just plays Indy in a different job...and without a hat). I admire Brendan Fraser as an actor, and his performance is definitely one of the best things about The Mummy. The effects were nice too, but personally, I don't think digital effects have gotten to the point where you can make a fully CG character that doesn't look at least a little bit like a cartoon, so the effects didn't impress me all that much.

","""The Mummy"" kicks off the summer movie season with a bang, and it is everything you would expect from a Hollywood summer blockbuster: big, loud, expensive, and not a shred of intelligence. Not that that's always bad thing.<br/><br/>""The Mummy"" combines the plotlines from the ""Indiana Jones"" movies with all the typical horror movie cliches. You get five people pitted against the most awsome and supreme power in the universe, and do they stand a chance? Even without seeing the movie you can answer that. In terms of being a horror movie, it delivers a few good scares and some genuinely skin-crawling moments (especially if you are afraid of bugs).<br/><br/>The story starts in ancient Egypt, where the lover of the pharoah's wife is put to an extremely nasty death. Three thousand years later, a group of scholars go out in search of ""The Book of the Dead"", which is hidden under the lost city dubbed the ""City of the Dead"". They employ the help of a convict (Brendan Fraser) who has been there before. Big suprise, they have some competition. A group of American treasure hunters (looters, actually) are also looking for the lost city. Well, they find the book and unwittingly bring the dead mummy to life, and he goes out into the world to regenerate and to resurrect his long-dead mistress. If he succeeds, the world is doomed.<br/><br/>This movie is standard action/adventure, the script is weak, the overacting is painfully obvious, and the attempts at humor wash over you after the first 30 minutes. But not that you'd notice, there is enough special effects here to distract anyone from the films technical weaknesses. But I have to admit, it was entertaining. The Mummy's rotting corpse in the glow of the moonlight is enough the scare the hell out of anyone.<br/><br/>It is one of those movies you can only see on the big screen, but it is not a movie I'll be seeing again."

","As a BIG fan of the big-budget, hi-gloss, Hollywoodized, action-adventure, I have to say that, after salivating over the candy-like previews for weeks, The Mummy was gross disappointment on a grand scale.  Unless you count the amazing contradiction present here, there's really nothing special about this film. The acting was sub-par at best. The lack of even the most base character development eliminated my concern for them and therefore the ""horror"" scenes seemed both typical, far-fetched and inconsistent at the same time.<br/><br/>Lots of little discrepancies (no Africans, no blood, infinitely loaded guns, sewer systems in the desert, collapsing pyramids...), plagued this film. The CG, which is undoubtedly superb in it's own right, was WAAAY overdone and looked really bad on-screen.  There is such a thing as too much.  I remember thinking at one point, ""This looks more like FMV cut in a video game than a movie.""  Arnold Vosloo (Imhotep) didn't even (re)appear until nearly the middle of the movie.  On the plus side, I think the best performance was done by Beni, a snivelling little weasel played by Kevin J. O'Connor, who became Imhotep's minion and had the best lines of all. Rachel Weisz did a decent job with her role as well.  Frasier was stiff, out of place and apparently, completely indestructable.  The same, however, can NOT be said about the Mummy.  Better off rented."

","Quite possibly one of the poorest movies I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few in my time<br/><br/>What an all too simple story. It's a weak excuse to throw some special effects around which surprisingly weren't that good. When I saw in the credits that ILM was doing them I was ready to be blown away. Mediocre is what comes to mind when I think of the effects. A few of them are impressive but when it comes to ILM most people expect eye-popping as a standard. In one scene, the mummy who is slowly regenerating, has scabs and scars on portions of his face. For some reason they were unnecessarily computer generated. And to make it worse, they seemed to floating off his face as the effects personnel did a poor job matching the shape of the scars to the mummy's face. Quite a few times there are thousands of bugs, be it scarabs, locusts, or flies buzzing or crawling around. The sheer number is a bit impressive but what distracted me was that the bugs were shiny for some reason forcing me to realize that they were in fact computer generated.<br/><br/>The movie's script is filled with one-liners that just aren't funny. It doesn't help when most of them are said by the leading man Brenden Frasier who for the entire movie either needs cough medicine because his voice is forcefully scratchy or curls his lip as if he had some peanut butter stuck to the front of his teeth.<br/><br/>In addition to a poor movie, it didn't help that I was surrounded by the most annoying people...ever. At countless points, two gentlemen in front of me burst out loud with an ear-splitting laugh just screaming of stupidity. It wasn't only at the parts where the movie tried to be funny either. When one of the characters just simply got on his camel, they burst out loud with a roar of a laugh rocking back and forth in their seats. And just for the record, many other people besides me were angry at these men (oafs?). Two people behind me got up during the middle of the movie after another one of the idiots' laughs. Coincidence? I think not...<br/><br/>I would much rather have stayed home staring at a blank wall for a couple of hours than have gone to this trash.

","This film has a lot of nostalgic associations and thus many find it a lot less entertaining than they had thought- which is what I also think of the Mummy. It is a decent diversion and has some good funny moments but as a whole it isn't a very good film. The Mummy is pretty silly stuff. But that's okay when you consider that, beneath all the action/adventure and horror trappings, it's actually a comedy. Think of a big-budget, high profile effort in the vein of Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness with less camp and better special effects. The film never takes itself seriously, and neither should we. It's a good thing it is funny because, as a thriller, it's an underwhelming effort. I suppose there are times when The Mummy makes an attempt to get the adrenaline pumping, but it never tries too hard. In the end, it's the self-mocking aura that save this film from being a waste of two hours."

","While serving in the French Foreign Legion, an American by the name of ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendan Fraser) manages to survive a ferocious battle at the site of the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra which had been lost under the sands of the desert for thousands of years. While there he discovers a box which contains a key of some sort. But rather than stay there and investigate any further he becomes extremely uneasy about the place and leaves the city as soon as possible. A few years later the key is stolen from him but as luck would have it the new owner, ""Evelyn Carnahan"" (Rachel Weisz) comes to him while he is in prison and asks him to lead her and a small party to this lost city. Since he is about to be hanged he readily agrees if she can convince the warden, ""Gad Hassan"" (Omid Djalili) to free him. Although she manages to do just that they soon find that they aren't the only ones looking to find Hamunaptra. Neither do they realize the evil presence that awaits them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining film which was nominated for several awards, most notably in the categories of best sound and visual effects. Additionally, it was also nominated for a Saturn Award for ""Best Fantasy Film"". To that point, I should mention that--unlike most ""Mummy films"" produced previously--this particular movie contains quite a bit more action than the others which diminishes the overall horror aspect to a great degree. Even so, I found this to be an enjoyable movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

But the events play out with plenty of action, danger, and pretty well timed comedy.<br/><br/>The cast is too notch, Brendan Fraiser at his height, personally I thought he would have been the next Indiana Jones.

","The original version of ""The Mummy"" from 1932 was one of a series of monster movies made famous by Universal Pictures. Directed by Karl Freund, and following in the footsteps of the likes of Todd Browning's ""Dracula"" (1931) and James Whale's ""Frankenstein"" (1931), it was a horror classic about a mummified Egyptian priest called Imhotep who was inadvertently brought back to life after an archaeologist reads an ancient spell, and then prowls the city of Cairo intending to revive his lover, the Princess Ankh-es-en-amon. It was a hit, and it became one of several movies that make up the Universal Monsters franchise.<br/><br/>65 years later, because the revivals of different movie monsters were becoming hits in the '90s, the studio decided to remake the original 1932 film, only instead of having it a straight-up horror movie, they take the Indiana Jones route and made it a swashbuckling adventure movie. As a result, we have a movie that's more of an original work than a direct remake of a black and white movie from the 1930s.<br/><br/>3,000 years ago, the high priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) suffers a fate worse than death as punishment after desecrating the tomb of Anck-Su Namun (Patricia Velásquez), wife of Pharaoh Seti I and Imhotep's lover. The punishment: live mummification and the worst of all Egyptian curses where, if brought back to life, would unleash hell upon all of the land, plagues and all. Unfortunately, 3,000 years later, two teams of treasure hunters set up a digging site in the lost city of Hamunaptra and come across Imhotep's sarcophagus, and the book of the dead (not to be confused with the one in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy). One night, one of the treasure hunters, a librarian named Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) decides to give said book a read. Bad idea, as the book contains the passage that brings Imhotep back to life. Imhotep's revived, he still wants to bring back his lover Ankh-Su Namun, and everyone's screwed. So it's up to our ragtag team of heroes, which include Evelyn, her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), and Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) to reverse the curse and save the world.<br/><br/>Whether you think the history behind Ancient Egypt or figures like Ankh-Su Namun or Imhotep are accurate or not (fun fact: it's not even close) is irrelevant for a movie like this. What matters is that this is is an adventure flick done in the style of Spielberg and Lucas' ""Indiana Jones"" franchise. Yes, the plot can get pretty silly at times and the main hero of the picture, Rick, is more of a wisecracking jackass best suited for an action comedy. That's also not to mention that some of the CGI hasn't really aged that well since the movie's release in 1999. However, for your standard adventure movie fare, ""The Mummy"" is a fun movie in its own right, and a lot of the effects seen in the movie were groundbreaking for the time, so I gotta give credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>The movie reached #1 at the box office upon release, and the director of the film, Stephen Sommers, has stated in an interview that a day after the movie was released in theatres, Universal Pictures contacted him over the phone and said ""We need another one!"". Thus, the film spawned two sequels: ""The Mummy Returns"" in 2001, and ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" in 2008. A video game would also be made and published by Konami in 2000, and yes, even an animated television series would be released. As for the movie itself, it's still a fun romp to watch, and with the new re-imagining already released in theatres this year starring Tom Cruise, it would definitely be worth seeing this film again before going to see that one, and even if the newer one sucks, at least you have this one and the original 1932 film to keep you company."
"stormhawk2020","10","1","2","14 May 2017"," Action-packed adventure film
","I remember being terrified when I first watched this when I was just a kid. As I've grown up, there are still a couple of things, mainly the scarabs, that make me cringe. The use of Egypt mythology was a strong point of this film as it includes Egyptian gods, curses and even some of the 10 plagues of Egypt. I admired the performances of both Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz, especially how their relationship develops over the course of the story. The supporting roles from John Hannah, Kevin J.O Connor and Oded Fehr were also highlights as their performances very easily stood out, just like the main characters. However, for me, Arnold Vosloo's role as the cursed Imhotep was the spotlight of the film as his performance alone created a strong sense of horror and power. Even though there were a couple of good laughs, I felt that this film could've been better without attempting to be funny. Overall, The Mummy is one of my personal favorite Universal films to come out within the last 14 years and I feel tops off anything that the later sequels can give to the audience."
"generationofswine","9","1","2","25 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. If anyone actually bothers to read my reviews probably knows how often I go off on how horrible and unnecessary remakes are...but the last Mummy movie was in, what, 1959? 40 years is enough time to wait. I mean, unless you're remaking Citizen Kane, Ben Hur, The Godfather, than a gap that long is appropriate. It's fair to remake a movie after four-decades, I was 19 when this one came out and my dad was 6 when the last one came out...so long as you aren't remaking a masterpiece, that's long enough to be kosher.<br/><br/>The original Mummy wasn't a masterpiece, but it was fun, especially since it didn't age as well the 1932 version and even that, due to age, isn't exactly spine chilling any longer.<br/><br/>In fact, because of the age and the lack of special effects and how fake a lot of it looks by today's standards, both the 32 and the 59 versions seem more campy than creepy.<br/><br/>And the 1999 The Mummy keeps that in mind. It opts to go more for laughs and an adventure feel than real horror, but it keeps the time period creating a brilliant homage to the original and the warped perspectives modern audiences have on the horror movies that became campy cult classics.<br/><br/>The result is a child friendly movie that adults can enjoy, but one that goes beyond that. The Mummy 1999 is throw back enough to entertain any cinephile if for no other reason than the dual references.<br/><br/>It makes for a nice release, the tension vanishes and, from the start the audience understands that they are in for a fun adventure with elements of horror, rather than a film that is going to take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>It makes for a light-hearted and fun film that's enjoyable for all ages. It's certainly worth your time for pure escapism if nothing else."
"mark.waltz","7","1","2","28 May 2016"," Everybody loved their mummy!
","Practically every classic film utilizing a theme of ancient Egypt or the invasion of their fabulous temples has been lovingly ripped off and spoofed in this completely delightful sword and sandals adventure. Starting off much like the 1932 Karloff horror film and its Hammer remake, it takes on a non-stop ride into comedy and adventure as the scenario moves from the ancient setting flashbacks to the 1920's. Old Maria Montez camp favorites are joined together with the many comedy spoofs of the genre, whether it be Wheeler and Woolsey's ""Mummy's Boys"" or ""Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy"". There's even a bit of ""Land of the Pharaohs"" as the giant tomb closes up just as it had for Joan Collins in that 1955 camp classic.<br/><br/>You will be happy to know that this is completely family friendly with little to give nightmares even though there are some insinuations of horrific things taking place off camera. Perhaps the only thing that might give some viewers the heeby- jeeby's are the flesh eating bugs, but nothing is shown, only implied. Universal remade several of their classic horror films, and while this isn't the modern classic of ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", it makes up for the over-done ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"".<br/><br/>The always refreshing Brendan Fraser may be a poor man's Indiana Jones to some, but he is a charming and irresistible rogue who is rescued from hanging by Egyptologist Rachel Weisz , agreeing to escort her to the valley of the kings where she intends to find the valuable treasures dating back to the reign of Pharaoh Seti I. Unbeknownst to them, the mummy awaits, cursed to the worst fate after murdering the Pharaoh after seducing his wife. The torment that he faces is nothing compared to what the invaders of his tomb will endure.<br/><br/>This moves by at a speedy pace thanks to the often Three Stooges style comedy. Mixing old style Saturday matinée fun with modern technology works wonders to keep this afloat, and it is a film lover's dream for good old fashioned thrills mixed with updated styles. Nothing to really criticize here even with a few clichés here and there. Some of the highlights include a chase between a giant moving walk of sand (complete with mummy face) and the small aircraft piloted by veteran character actor Bernard Fox, and the march of Pharaoh's mummy guards who only seem to be missing the ""March of the Winkies"" theme from ""The Wizard of Oz"". This is one of the rare occasions where I look forward to the sequel, if not the remake due in 2017."

","In this film, placed in the twenties, an American with a mysterious past will help a British librarian in love with Ancient Egypt to explore an Egyptian ruin, but they end up waking up a mummy that threaten to destroy the world. Few people know that this film is the remake of a classic horror film of 1932, with Boris Karloff in the role of the mummy. The film is directed by Stephen Sommers, who also wrote the script along with Lloyd Fonvielle. It has the participation of Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and Arnold Vosloo.<br/><br/>The mummies and their curses are part of movie horror paraphernalia since the dawn of cinema, but were eventually pushed aside for decades. This film, though not of terror but of adventure, made a redemption of these elements and brought again the mummies to the cinema. And there are hundreds of them. The film is excellent, it's very fun, has no dead moments and makes an intelligent use of the mysteries of Egyptian civilization to thicken the suspense in the plot, that is lightened by several moments of humor. The performance of the cast was also very good and the soundtrack, although not particularly surprising or memorable, do very well her role. The special effects and makeup deserves a special positive mention, as well as computerization and digital resources, because they knew perfectly how to enrich the film without dominating the attentions.<br/><br/>This film is funny, smart without becoming inaccessible to the general public, and has suspense and some strong scenes, without being too strong for kids. So, it's a great family film, suitable for almost all ages and to see in almost any situation."

"MaximumMadness","9","1","2","20 August 2007"," A silly, fun and visually exciting adventure...
","I remember back in 1999 (Eight years ago when I was about 11-years-old) when I went to see ""The Mummy"" in theaters. When the film opened to the vast spread of the city of Thebes, as a sphinx was being constructed and hundreds of people crowded the square, I knew I was in for something special. <br/><br/>The film (directed and co-written by Stephen Sommers) has since become a fixture in my DVD collection. A movie I watch anytime I am bored and in need of a good jolt of excitement. Sure, the dialog can be silly, and the story isn't the greatest, and there is the occasional plot-hole or two, but it is still a completely enjoyable adventure that I personally believe will stand the test of time.<br/><br/>We begin with the back-story... High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is having an illicit and highly forbidden love-affair with the Pharoh's beloved mistress. After murdering the Pharoh, she takes her own life and Imhotep goes about the task of resurrecting her. He is caught and condemned with the worst of all ancient curses, being mummified alive with the prophecy that should he ever be brought back, he will have power over the desert, invincibility, and the ability to control the 10 plagues of Egypt. (First Question/Possibly Plot Hole: If the curse is so bad, why not just use another one that isn't so risky?)<br/><br/>Flash forward several thousand years to the 1920's. Adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) is saved by beautiful Librarian Evelyn (Rachael Weiz), who hopes to use O'Connell's knowledge of an ancient and legendary city to be the first to officially discover and explore it. There is also her silly brother Johnathan (John Hannah), and several other characters who join them (including O'Connell's old friend Benny, played by Kevin J. O'Connor) during the course of the adventure. Also, the super-cool, tattoo-covered character Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) appears occasionally, to try and convince O'Connell and the others to stop what they are doing and leave. <br/><br/>We all know what happens next. It turns out this lost city (Hamunaptra) is the resting place of Imhotep. And before you know it, he is brought back through the recitation of a dark passage from the fiendish-looking ""Book of the Dead."" And so the story propels forward, as Imhoptep stalks several of the disposable, treasure-seeking sub-characters who helped free him. Why? Because he needs to kill them and ""suck 'em dry"" to regenerate his form from mangled mummy to studly guy in a bikini. (Why is he in bikini bottoms anyways, other than to show off his form and look imposing?) <br/><br/>After this, it becomes the classical story of ""rescue the damsel in distress (Evelyn), who is going to be a human sacrifice in an evil ritual""... a plot we've seen before. O'Connell and Johnathan are joined by Ardeth Bay (who is a Magi destined to protect the world from evil) to stop the evil beast once and for all.<br/><br/>Sure, it may sound familiar. It might even seem familiar at times when you watch it. But the magic behind the movie is the fact that director Sommers is able to take formulaic plots (Damsel in Distress; Evil Badguy stalking victims) and generic characters (The silly one; the fat, gross one; the smart-yet-greedy one) and inject them skillfully with life and quirks that make them seem much more real than other similar films.<br/><br/>Also notable is the lighthearted nature of the film, which has abundant (yet not overpowering) jokes throughout. This lets us know the direction Sommers wants to take... not that of a straight-forward horror, but rather more of a fun and thrilling adventure. Think ""Indiana Jones"" with more special effects and creepy creatures and you'll know what he is aiming for.<br/><br/>And on the special effects... they were absolutely fantastic when the film was released, and unlike anything I had ever seen... And now, in 2007, it is safe to say that they have aged very well and still look quite good. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, there are a few plot holes... Well, more gripes than plot holes, that annoyed me. For one, why do only five plagues occur when there were in fact 10 that haunted the lands? (Other than of course to save money on expensive visual effects and screen time) Also, why do the bad guy's cronies (pretty much just a bunch of other mummies) seem strong and powerful at first, then turn into slow, silly wimps when they encounter O'Connell? (Of course just to benefit the plot, but still annoying.) But overall, I think people will be having too much fun to notice, or even care, about these small problems.<br/><br/>I personally love this film (And to a lesser extent, I enjoy the sequel ""Mummy Returns"" and spin-off ""Scorpion King"" quite a bit) and I still would recommend it to any fan of movie looking for a fun, fast and great adventure!"

","For centuries, greedy adventurers and gold-seekers sought the ancient Egyptian city of Hamunaptra. This hidden metropolis of myth and legend is the rumored resting place of the wealth of the pharaohs. What none of them know is that Hamunaptra is also the housing for the cursed Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo).<br/><br/>More than 1,000 years before Christ, Imhotep is caught in an affair with the pharaoh's mistress, Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velazquez). Even though Imhotep escapes, Anck Su Namun is not so fortunate. Determined to resurrect her, he and his priests violate her tomb in Hamunaptra but are apprehended before they can finish. In addition to being mummified alive, Imhotep is also condemned with the most terrible of ancient curses. The catch is that if he is ever released, he will become ""a plague upon mankind with power over the sand and the glory of invincibility."" A secret society maintains vigil over the ruined city in order to keep him sealed in his eternal prison.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1923 Cairo, where American Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), a former visitor to Hamunaptra, is to be hanged. Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) discover his past and secure his life in exchange for his escort to the city. Carnahan is not interested in treasure, but instead wishes to unearth the book Aman-Ra. As an Egyptian-speaking librarian, she is drawn not by its solid gold cover, but its historical merit. There is a rival band of Americans guided by O'Connell's old comrade Beni (Kevin J. O'Connor), the frontrunner for weasel of the decade. He carries amulet bearing every major religious symbol and possibly one or two he made up. When he runs into trouble, he holds each one in the air and utters a prayer in that language.<br/><br/>The procession that arrives at Hamunaptra consists of nine named characters. The plot I described above all takes place in the first twenty minutes of film, but nearly an hour goes by before the mummy makes its appearance. The premise of the movie is all about rules and more rules, but the writers avoid audience confusion by taking painstaking care to establish them, as well as using repetition to solidify them in our minds. My second viewing revealed even more connections that I missed the first time. It is imperative that the viewer be educated in this film, and the writers' skill gives the Hamunaptra set an uncanny life. When Imhotep arrives, the viewer is prepared but not impatient.<br/><br/>There is also a nice marriage of mood and function. O'Connell is the type of hero with eyes in the back of his head, and the movie correctly treats his action scenes with an appropriate level of absurdity. Director Stephen Sommers does a fine job achieving the right tone from the script, which he also wrote. The movie is not short on creative yet droll devices for the heroes to survive, including a moment of genius when Jonathan pretends to join a crowd chanting Imhotep's name. There is also a running gag on how far the mummy's jaw can open.<br/><br/>The all-important special effects are exquisite and still look strikingly good eight years later. One particularly impressive effect is a face-bearing sandstorm that is chasing an airplane. The gunner relentlessly fires the mounted gun into the storm creating a snake of miniature sand explosions. Vosloo spends most of the film as some combination of Imhotep's sinewy skeleton and revived skin and flesh. The skeleton has a wide range of facial expressions and looks realistic when it moves. At one point a scarab crawls out of a hole in his neck and into his jaw, and he eats it. There is also the appearance of some of the Biblical plagues, although I think the biblical hailstorm was falling ice, not basketball sized meteorites. ""The Mummy"" is at its core an action movie, and ultimately lives or dies by it, so quality special effects are essential.<br/><br/>The stunts are as well, and the delivery does not disappoint. Several of them are good enough wow even the most experienced action fan, especially during a scuffle with the crumbly stone soldiers.<br/><br/>The cast was mainly comprised of accomplished stage actors. All fill their assignments well, Weisz in particular. Vosloo does not speak a single syllable in English, but still impresses. All elements come together to take a complex world of rules and make it bona fide entertainment, so ""The Mummy"" ranks as an eight out of ten."

","To start off with, this movie is not strictly speaking a horror movie. That is not to say it does not have horror elements to it, but they are, in a way, secondary to the main focus of the film. This is an action-adventure, comedy, love story. Brendan Frasier shines as the American ex-foreign legion soldier who knows the way to Hamanauptra, an ancient city, fabled to hold the treasure of the Pharaoh Seti I (father of Ramses the Great) Rachel Weisz is Evelyn Carnahan, a librarian turned archaeologist who has found an object that will open the book of Ra, an ancient text with occult powers. The rest of the cast are all excellent also, as the humor, the horror, and the adventure become a roller-coaster ride of adventure. It is ""Indian Jones meets King Tut"" in a way. I give it a rousing 10."

An interesting aspect here is the usage of the ancient Egyptian language. In a way, it seems a little silly casting Brendan Fraser as hero Rick O'Connell, given that he previously starred in movies like ""Encino Man"" and ""Airheads"". But he does some good work with the role. Rachel Weisz, as Evelyn Carnahan, doesn't exactly overshadow him, but has her own role in everything. John Hannah, as Evelyn's goofy brother Jonathan, is mostly there for comic relief. Oded Fehr, as Ardeth Bey, starts out looking like a bad guy, but turns out to be a good guy.

I highly recommend this film whether or not you're a Brendan Fraser fan as this is a definite change of direction for his career. I, quite frankly, did not consider him an action/adventure actor until I saw ""The Mummy"". He's a far more versatile actor than I had previously thought. Rachel Weisz was very good (this was the first film of hers I had seen), and Patricia Velasquez did surprisingly well for being a prior supermodel.

","Is this shakespearian plotting and epical choices ? Not really... Is this Academy-Award worthy deep thought method-acting, drama and dialogue ? Ahem, not really either. Interesting because of its correct portraying of ancient Eqyptian culture and life ? Hardly<br/><br/>But - what this IS, is pure, undiluted, fast paced and witty adventure cinema at its best. Leave real world sensibilities and belief in established facts at the door, please, lean back and enjoy ! ""The Mummy"" is a pure cliffhanger movie (in the Indiana Jones tradition, but definitely not a cheap rip off a la ""Quartermain"" ), with mystic mumbling, firefights, beautiful women, terrible curses and pretty nice places to venture through ( many of these thanks to spotless CGI ), with an ancient and cursed mummy being accidentally reawakened in the 1920ies by a crew of slightly careless, if amusing archaeologist/tomb-robbers - who now have to put the bunny back into the box, or rather the mummy back into the sacrophagus.<br/><br/>
Great panoramic shots and landscapes (making you want to jump into the next flight to Egypt) , nice - fast but not breathless - editing and a moody soundtrack provide an excellent setting. The CGI effects on the walking corpse and its special tricks are pretty decent, especially for a late 1990ies flick.The cast of (among others ) Brendan Frazer, Rachel Weisz (simply beyond comparison ), John Hannah and more or less mummified Arnold Vosloo seemed to have had a blast of a time, especially with the bantering dialogue ( simply check the memorable quotes section  ) as well as personal interaction  and immersing themselves into the setting.<br/><br/>And despite this being a ""monster-horror"" movie by default, the ""Mummy"" actually travels far more on the power of it's verbal sparring, true situational comedy and rather smart allusions to other genre favourites (like someone uttering ""Bugs ? I hate bugs !"" while rappelling down into an ancient Eqyptian ruin... ) then on it's appeal as a ""shock-horror"" flick scaring the audience witless. Call it a cliffhanger with moments of horror ( no gore, though, but some frightening concepts ) and some suspense - or better call it THE cliffhanger - IMHO this has yet to be surpassed in this genre ( yes, including IMHO the Indiana Jones triology ).<br/><br/>worth every cent - unless you wanted to spend the evening in miserable brooding"
"Feather_of_Ma-at","Null","1","2","27 February 2003"," An utter blast!
","""The Mummy"" is an awesome action flick and one of my favorite movies. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. It has all the elements for a great, fun popcorn flick: humor (plenty of it!), action (plenty of that, too!), and special effects. It also has a touch of suspense and spookiness that makes it even more enjoyable. The acting overall was great, the one small downside being that Brendan Fraser spoke in a monotone part of the time, but that's just a minor nitpick. Everyone else was stellar. I especially loved Rachel Weisz in the drunken librarian scene.<br/><br/>Two big highlights for me were the special effects and the score. The special effects I thought were quite impressive. Imhotep's step-by-step regeneration was well done, and the sandstorm definitely deserves a mention. I also liked the score, especially Imhotep's theme. The great music, I think, is one of the things that was sorely missed in the sequel.<br/><br/>I have to mention just one thing about ""The Mummy"" that bugs me: a few errors regarding the ancient Egyptian information in the movie. The main one that always makes me cringe is when Evelyn is telling Rick about mummification and she informs him that ""...they took out the heart as well."" This is incorrect. The ancient Egyptians left the heart in the body, as they believed that it, not the brain, was the center of thought and emotion and that it would be needed for the body to be resurrected in the next world. (I'm sorry if someone's already brought that up; I didn't have time to read through all the comments!)<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend ""The Mummy."" It's an extremely fun, fast-paced, entertaining movie! I give it 4 and a half out of 5 stars."

"chrisbrown6453","7","1","2","17 June 2002"," Well, thanks to The Mummy, the 1999 summer movie season officially arrived with a bang.
","The Mummy is your typical special effects movie. It's got good looking stars, great special effects, a plot that is there to move the special effects along, and you leave the movie feeling a little bit dumber than when you went in. <br/><br/>The movie opens 3000+ years in the past. The Egyptian priest Imhotep is put to death in the most inhumane way possible. But for some reason, if a person is put to death in this way, if for some reason he manages to come back to life, at any point in the future, he'll have the powers of a God. So why even give him that chance? Why not kill him in a little bit nicer way and not give him the chance to come back as a God? That's what I was thinking. So anyway, as you may have guessed, in 1925 a group of treasure hunters and archeologists stumble upon the tomb of the priest, and manage to bring him back to life. He then reigns terror upon the people and brings with him the 10 plagues. But with the help of a cat and a book Brendan Fraser and his crew manage to save the world, and get some treasure at the same time.<br/><br/>
The one thing to remember when going to see this is that there is a lot more comedy involved that you may expect. It almost seemed at times that they wanted to do a parody of Indiana Jones films. So while it wasn't really scary, it did have a lot of humor. And like I said before, plot isn't really the reason to go see this movie. I went because of the special effects and the scenery. What I really thought of this movie was that it was a low-rent Indiana Jones film. Indy has better acting and a better story and a little more adventure. This one had pretty faces, some adventure, and good special effects. I for one am a fan of Brendan Fraser, even if other people aren't. Absent George of the Jungle and Encino Man, all of his films have been pretty good, no matter what anyone says. And he plays his character well here too. He does subtle humor very well. The leading lady, Rachel Weisz was attractive in a strange sort of way. Something is wrong with her face, I just couldn't figure out what. And the rest of the cast did their stock parts well. You knew pretty early on in the film who was there to die and who was going to live. <br/><br/>The special effects were good as well. The problem with special effects these days is that we've pretty much seen them all. The trick is making them a little different. A movie like The Matrix takes special effects to a new level. In The Mummy, they use sand as their little difference. I don't recall seeing a movie use sand as their special effect before, and this one pulled it off well. The creature effects were pretty good, but reminded me of the Evil Dead movies at times. What I did like were the sets that were used. I thought they looked pretty cool. The opening scene looked amazing, even though they were using CGI to create it. The only real problem I had with the movie was that it slowed down in a lot of places. They would rev up the engines for a few minutes, and then slow it down. I realize that special effects movies are expensive, so they can't have these huge effects all the time, but it is possible to keep the energy level up without using effects, and I wish they had done that a little more.<br/><br/>
So overall The Mummy was entertaining if slow at times. The special effects were good and a little different that normal. The faces are pretty and the scenery is cool, so if you're looking for a movie that won't make you think and will deliver a good time, this is one to see."

","On the audio commentary by Stephen summers, he remarks that they're halfway into the movie and they have yet to re-introduce the title character, and he isn't even revived for another 20 minutes. A good chunk of this movie deals with them digging around an ancient city and discovering things. therefore, this movie gets a little boring, and actually, having seen the Mummy Returns FIRST, I was dissapointed on how Evelyn's character was portrayed in this Movie. In the Mummy Returns, she's a strong, sword-wielding Kick-ass who's able to take care of herself. in the Mummy, she's portrayed as a clumsy cliched damsel in distress. And with the Mummy Returns, the ending had me cheering in my seat, The Mummy left me saying ""oh WOW.""

","There's little to like about ""The Mummy"" especially after the letdown I felt when going to see it. While the trailer was extremely intriguing the plot fell way short of expectations. The cardboard cutout characters were flat and lifeless. The actors were picked merely to fit set molds, including the witty adventurer, the ever degraded middle-easterners and the damsel in distress. Plot points and foreshadowing were even part of the dialogue, a sure sign of an attempt at ""PG-13"" campiness which sadly will only be appreciated by those 13 and under.<br/><br/>The special effects are good, but not as good as I would have expected and they certainly do nothing to save the rest of the film which was barely a step above unwatchable. The movie is a barely disguised Keystone Cops adventure which might have been slightly more interesting if it weren't for truly different and interesting films that have already been made like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""The Fifth Element.""<br/><br/>I suspect the masses will enjoy this movie in large numbers because it seems most are programmed to like movies that have expensive trailers, computer-generated special effects and enormous budgets...the current defining principles of Hollywood. So see ""The Mummy"" if you must but prepare to be disappointed."

They happen to find some fat Brit with an RAF biplane to help them out.  Two good guys can't fit so they are tied on the end of the plane.

","I remember seeing the previews for this movie, and never once was there any indication how silly it was.  The previews indicated only the promise of great special effects and a good horror movie.  There was something about what people were saying (or not saying) that made me wait.  Now I know what it was.  This version of The Mummy didn't take itself seriously enough to be classified as a horror movie.  I just cannot understand why anyone would want to produce such fluff when it could have been so much more.  The special effects were great, but they seemed completely out of place every time yet another moment of levity was introduced.<br/><br/>The IMDB genre for The Mummy is Adventure/Action/Thriller/Horror.  This film takes itself so unseriously that it qualifies itself as none of those. Every great special effect and piece of cinematography is ruined by the silly dialogue.  This film could have been a classic, but instead it was ruined by its ridiculous tendency to insert a silly piece of slapstick or dialogue every chance it had.<br/><br/>I suppose that is why I disliked this film so much.  It's not what the film was, it's what the film wasn't that I can't get over.  Had the cast been given a serious script, the mood of the film would have seemed right, and I could have truly gotten into it.  Instead, every time I even started to try to immerse myself, it got silly and ruined it for me.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine why anyone I know would look forward to a sequel to this film.

","The major thing that I didn't like in this movie is the way it presents Ancient Egyptians and their civilisation. They present them like people who were worshipping evil and exercising black magic. Totally wrong. Ancient Egyptians were lively people, who believed in Good and loved good life. In fact their whole life was considered as a fight against the forces of darkness and the chaos. They were preserving the bodies of the Pharaohs and other important people, so that they could live in a sense forever.<br/><br/>Of course, the resurrection of a dead to a deadly beast is a potentially very good starting point for a horror/action story/movie. But this is not enough. It is easy to spoil everything if you are careless about the details. And I explain. The city of Hamunaptra is totally fictitious. There was never such a city, and especially a city of the Dead. Priest Imhotep (later the mummy) is the bad, evil guy. But in the Ancient Egyptian history there is a priest Imhotep, who was considered a very wise man and he did many things for the benefit of Egypt (unfortunately, I don't remember right now many details about him). Later, his fame was such that he was even worshipped as a god. Definitely, the choice of the name was awkward. Close to the end of the movie, the Book of the Dead is being used, presented as a secret book of black magic. Although there IS a Book of the Dead, it has nothing to do with the way it is presented in the movie. In fact, the Book of the Dead accompanied every Pharaoh, it has been found and it is a guide for the dead Pharaoh about how he will be judged by the Gods in the other world and other things. It has nothing to do with black magic. Concerning the second book the heroes use, that does not exist even by name. And all these strange names of the Gods, where have they found them? Non of them exists in the Egyptian mythology!<br/><br/>If you don't know anything at all about Ancient Egypt, these things will pass unnoticed. You might even like them! But seriously, if you have read something about Ancient Egypt, then you notice them, and they are very annoying, spoiling much of the fun. The movie refers to another, Hollywood Egypt, not the real one. And since the movie fails to have a realistic background, it fails to entertain (at least it failed with me).<br/><br/>But these are not the only drawbacks of the movie. Brendan Fraser is not convincing as an action hero, Rachel Weisz tries unsuccessfully to be the female and for the rest...<br/><br/>So, to conclude, you might ask if I didn't like anything in this movie at all. Not quite, after all I gave it a 3. The effects were amazing, maybe the only decent thing in this movie. I think that they are the main, if only, making it such a success. Therefore, the only one that deserves full credit, are the Silicon Graphics."

"Spleen","8","1","2","1 November 1999"," May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the computers of ILM
","Okay, so it wasn't a horror movie.  GOOD.  Why would anyone want to inspire horror?  Lust, pity, fear, joy, excitement, fascination, anxiety ... I can see the point of arousing THOSE psychological states, but what's so great about nausea and repulsion?  Horror, indeed.<br/><br/>I must admit `The Mummy' doesn't arouse much lust, pity, fear, et cetera, either; moreover, it's stupid, which is more of a problem when the early scenes promise a minimal level of intelligence that the rest of the film fails to deliver.  (I have little patience with the turn-off-your-brain-and-enjoy crowd.  Anyone who would voluntarily turn off his brain deserves the consequences, including not remembering to turn it on again afterwards.)<br/><br/>How stupid is it?  Well ...  The desert between Hamunaptra and Cairo is crossed several times, sometimes with camels, sometimes without - and, of course, Sommers forgets which side of the desert he left the camels on. Hamunaptra was built so that the Pharaoh, by pulling a lever, could pull the entire city underground.  But why is the lever smack bang in the MIDDLE of the city?  What good was it to anyone there?<br/><br/>And so on.<br/><br/>All the same, I recommend it.  It's not as stupid as it looks.  Before the mummy awakes it's reasonably consistent, reasonably well written, and, most importantly in this kind of desert-fermented cheese, it looks and feels good.  There's sand, there's Egyptian stuff all over the place, there's burnished gold, there's high priests ... it all satisfies a deep human need. We don't see nearly enough of the paraphernalia of the Ancient World on the screen.  Even Rome went out of fashion decades ago.  (Why, I wonder?)  So all in all I'm glad `The Mummy' exists.  It's not the best of its kind, but at least it's there.  And it's not just the content of the imagery.  The sunny wide-screen photography really is first class.<br/><br/>That is, until some fool steps in and plasters computer-generated images over the top.  By Thoth they look awful.  A computer-generated plague of flies is no improvement at all on sprinkling pepper over the negatives; the decaying mummies themselves seem to be knitted out of a kind of featureless grey wool; the scarabs look like they escaped from `Toy Story'; and that quicksilver (or whatever it was) is such a hoary and ineffective old computer effect that a group of friends can spend an entertaining couple of hours compiling a list of all the movies that feature it.  What is it with these computer-generated effects?  Are directors these days even ALLOWED to make movies without them?  Is there a law I don't know about?<br/><br/>Grump, grump, grump.  Anyway, even taking THIS into account, I enjoyed the movie.  I liked it so very much that I wish I could have respected it as well."
"Jason-38","3","1","2","7 October 1999"," The video game as cinema equals a bad movie and boredom.
","It's difficult to hate THE MUMMY, it's just impossible to respect it. You can't damn it out of hand, like Francis Coppola's vulgarization of DRACULA (formally titled BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA for some reason that escapes the understanding of people who have actually read the book). THE MUMMY does not come from a consistent literary source. So, you can't accuse it of purporting to be something that it's not. If you prefer the 1932 Karloff/Karl Freund Mummy or 1959 Hammer version with Cushing/Lee/Terence Fisher, then it's simply a matter of taste. You can't argue taste.<br/><br/>The problem is that this movie bearing the same title leaves a very bad taste. It insults its audience by playing to the lowest common denominator. The script seems to be the work of many hands. That might account for the many inconsistencies in story telling logic. The style (if that is the word) of the acting and directing is basically TV sit-com.<br/><br/>The special effects are much too obviously CGI. In their own way, they are just as artificial as the special effects of earlier generations that utilized optical printing with traveling mattes (with obvious matte lines) and/or rear projection. The problem is that our eyes become educated over time. The stage illusionist's trick that dazzled us as small children seems hopelessly coy to us a adults. The same thing is true of some of the techniques that ILM has developed over the past 20-odd years. Whatever film stock they choose, pixels look like pixels.<br/><br/>Ultimately, special effects are no substitute story telling with a consistent point of view and characters who involve us emotionally. THE MATRIX, another movie that is basically a video game, does have a point of view; characters with at least some emotional life; and a unified approach to expressing a reasonably consistent point of view. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT makes up for what it lacks in production values with intensity; an interesting point of view; and even a certain degree of novelty. THE SIXTH SENSE gains its power by being first and foremost a story about human beings.<br/><br/>The makers of THE MUMMY have no real idea of what they want to accomplish, hence the kitchen sink approach to story telling. It's anything for a cheap thrill. The end result is just plain cheap, despite the budget. Turning this into third rate Indiana Jones was a no brainer for the film makers, not that they have exhibited much in the ways of brains. For instance, anyone who has actually read the Book of Exodus (all right, or seen DeMille's THE TEN COMMANDMENTS) knows that the plagues of Egypt were inflicted by the Hebrew God. Therefore, it follows logically that they cannot be unleashed by the gods of ancient Egypt. Not that logic, taste, or intelligence ever mattered to the people who unleashed this mess.<br/><br/>Without a script that has a shred of human feeling, there isn't much for the actors to do but react to ""blue screen."" The result is just plain embarrassing. To use that tired old film school expression, didn't the film makers ever seriously consider giving the characters an ""arc.""<br/><br/>A word to Brendan Fraser, if you happen to be reading: You have been blessed with a career that is granted to very few young actors in any era. You possess a very rare combination of gifts. You are the best farceur/leading man to emerge in films since Kevin Kline & Cary Grant. You are a solid dramatic actor, as proven in SCHOOL TIES and GODS & MONSTERS. You are potentially the best action movie hero of the New Millennium. You have the golden opportunity to work as long as you want to work. Just please, use your gifts and your apparent intelligence with keener judgment in future. It could be a very bright one.<br/><br/>By then, this dismal affair will just be a dim memory of youthful indiscretion.<br/><br/>To anyone who hasn't actually seen this mediocrity: If you are desperate to find some way to waste two hours of your life, believe me, there a much better ways to do it."

","Action packed and good to the last drop, ""The Mummy"" for 1999 was a thrill-ride full of action, special effects, horror, and yes...comedy.  If you liked the Indiana Jones adventures, you're going to LOVE ""The Mummy""<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser did well as his role of Rick O'Connell.  Cocky though brave, he made the perfect ""hero"" of the story<br/><br/>Rachel Weisz portrayed a headstrong and very knowledgeable (even if a little clumsy) Evelyn.  She doesn't take herself too seriously, though knows what she wants and just how to get it.<br/><br/>John Hannah..FUNNY to the bone.  From his sudden (and funny) entrance to the end, he  provides humor and charm to the film.  Delivering lines with the same effect as Harrison Ford in the Indiana Jones films, he kept me smiling. Playing Evelyn's older brother, Jonathan, Hannah gave me my only LOL moment of the film, a little over an hour into the movie.  I'm not known for more than a few smiles while watching a movie, but Hannah's comedic touch almost brought tears to my eyes when he goes out to get the car ready for the others and is confronted by some nasty looking villagers.  Trust me....Brilliant.<br/><br/>A 2-hour tour of beautiful scenery and tons of scenes that make you cringe, laugh, gasp, and sit at the edge of your movie theatre seat, ""The Mummy"" is worth the price of admission."

Also, I couldn't be afraid of him no matter how hard I tried.  Everything he did seemed justified. I would have probably acted little differently.

There was a lot of cliffhanger moments and the pace of the action was very frantic, especially in the second hour of the film.  The plot is pretty basic and has been done before in other mummy movies, but what distinguishes this film is the wonderful special effects and photography. Industrial Light and Magic did a great job with the computer graphic effects. The thousands of beetles, called scarabs, are particularly frightening as thousands of them devour a body in just a few seconds.<br/><br/>The heroine, Rachel Weisz, is very nice to look at and is very appealing. Brendan Fraser does a great job and has a lot of funny one liners in the film. Arnold Vosloo makes a great mummy and has a very ominous appearance. He is perfect in his part.<br/><br/>All the sets and props are wonderful and show where part of the 80 million dollar budget was spent.The desert photography was very beautiful, and the effect of the desert sandstorm flowing over the cliffs was particularly impressive.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a fun exciting way to spend two hours, and if you like old fashioned adventure movies, your time will be well spent"
"Blake_Petit","7","1","2","7 May 1999"," B-Movie script + A-Movie FX = GREAT MOVIE!
","""The Mummy"" is great! Sommers took bits and pieces from all the classic monster movies (and some bits from more recent films,) mixed it in with a dash of Indiana Jones and turned out a movie that is just plain FUN. It's not a groundbreaking movie and it won't unseat ""Citizen Kane,"" but it sure as heck unseats 90% of the monster movies Hollywood has ever turned out. It's been so long since Universal did something of this caliber that I wanted to cheer throughout the movie. Fraser was great as O'Connell, a hero that felt more like Han Solo than anything else, and really proved his diversity as a actor. Likewise, Rachel Weiz had an incredibly cute ""bookish"" quality about her that made her absolutely PERFECT. She's that small-town librarian that doesn't realize how desirable she is and, while her and Fraser's story runs very predictably, since this is basically a resurrection of the classic monster movie, you shouldn't have a problem with it.  Go in, don't be afraid to laugh, don't be afraid to scream, just be prepared for a thrill ride that is well worth the price of admission."

Like Rick O'Connel (Brendan Fraser) said, ""Rescue the damsel in destress, kill the bad guy, save the world.""  I don't want to reveal the plot, but really, that's how it is.  I think this movie was more like a comedy mixed with action: Jonathan (John Hannah) was pretty stupid, but funny, and also, Fraser's character had some pretty good one-liners.

"Leofwine_draca","4","1","3","30 August 2016"," CGI roller-coaster ride for kids
","As the latest overblown big-budget remake hits our cinema screens, once again I despair at the direction Hollywood is taking. If it's not making cheap, sentimental dross, then more likely than not the new offering will be a film full of CGI effects and nothing else. And THE MUMMY falls into this latter category amiably enough, not being bad enough for me to rant on endlessly about the faults, just being boringly average and entertaining enough on a superficial level for me to moan about the state of the world these days.<br/><br/>Forget about the original MUMMY film for a start, as it had Boris Karloff in it. Karloff was an actor. A real, true, actor. Sadly there is little acting in this film, and what there is instead is atrocious comedy filler which is recycled and totally lame in concept. The 'actors' are required to run around and react to various pyrotechnic or computer generated effects, and that's exactly it. There is little plot, with the film merely being a string of action sequences, so many that it's hard to label this film horror at all.<br/><br/>The 12 certificate means there is virtually no blood in the film, so the deaths are not very good, and those which are left to the imagination are the most effective. A variation on the black slime from THE X-FILES turns up in the form of a flesh-burrowing scarab beetle in an amusing scene, but the effects of the beetles never look for a moment convincing - they look like exactly what they are, computer graphics. The ten plagues are understated (a fountain runs red to show 'rivers running with blood' - talk about disappointing) and merely an excuse for more special effects, briefly done. The action scenes are probably the best thing the film has to offer, and Fraser leaping about firing two handguns is enjoyable enough.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the mummy itself is most disappointing. The original form is fine, but then some idiot had to give it eyes and a tongue so it could talk, ruining the effect. The mummy makes scary faces like it's in a Disney film, so that also ruins any frights there might have been. It's just ludicrous and downright embarrassing. The regeneration moments are okay, but Arnold Vosloo is not exactly a frightening person, and his naked torso and eye make up just make him look like a drag queen in his/her finest silk dressing gown.<br/><br/>Which leads me on to the acting. Rachel Weisz is a bad actress and therefore well suited to this film, she fits in nicely. Worst of all she's British, and her grating accent soon becomes apparent. Look, nobody speaks English like this and the portrayal borders on stereotypical. John Hannah is a bit better as a timid, weak coward type, and to be fair I found myself liking him. Brendan Fraser is also okay as the brainless Indiana Jones-type explorer, and he's good in the action scenes. The rest of the characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes and not worth bothering with. The special effects are pretty bad, with Vosloo's stretchy jaw being the worst offender. Gosh, it's ridiculously bad! The beetles are fake, and only the sand faces are effective. Stephen Sommers, with this and DEEP RISING, shows himself to be a competent director, but I only wish he could get better material and steer himself away from these FX-filled bloaters. Then perhaps he might make something interesting. THE MUMMY is a bit enjoyable in a loud, superficial, disengage the brain kind of way, but otherwise it's sorely disappointing, much as you would expect from Hollywood these days. And something of an embarrassment all round. And this was a hit? What's the world coming to?"
"johnnyboyz","6","1","3","30 March 2011"," Extravagant and sprawling romp through some fairly familiar, but involving, territory which encompasses upstanding protagonists; end of the world plots and slight romances.
","The Mummy will begin in that old fashioned, mythical manner in that an off screen narrator verbally informs us of a legacy of events which prelude the body of the film; the tone that of an old storyteller, even fable-like in its sounding as the oral informing us of a time gone by and actions which happened is put across. It's an opening slice of narration that might just as well as seen its scripture begin with the line: ""Once upon a time, long ago, there was a great warrior....."" Stephen Sommers' film will go on to flit manically from tone to tone and from content to content; a harmless, teen-aged orientated throwaway action flick one minute, a rather hardened and somewhat full on horror piece venturing into territory you just do not initially entrust it will go anywhere near, the next. His film is a romping, old fashioned escapade through adventurous territory and old fashioned mythical sensibilities; a film with a foot in the science fiction, what with its content linked to characters able to bring people back from the dead and flesh eating monsters that do not exist; horror and post-Indiana Jones action adventure.<br/><br/>The aforementioned story of the opening loosely goes on to describe a forbidden romance set in an alternate ancient Egypt between the then Pheroh of that time's partner and one of his entrusted high priests named Imhotep (Vosloo), something that leads to her arranged death and the sentencing of the priest plus his aides to live mummification, a process loosely described by one of the leads a little later on as something not particularly pleasant if we weren't already familiar with such things - although, it does beg the question as to whether it's even possible to actually be alive during said process for anything beyond that of about two seconds.<br/><br/>Fast-forward from ancient Egypt to the same nation in the 1920s and enter the lead, an American mercenary named Rick O'Connell (Fraser); a brave man, a man with the ability to take control of a hostile situation as he leads a band of men against some aggressors at a protected burial site; to use an array of weaponry with consummate ease and who additionally sports an array of meal insignia on his tunic suggesting experience and expertise within this field – he is the ultimate warrior of the age, a modern-day action man eventually going up against the cursed; blood thirsty values and mindsets of that of the ancient. Also in Egypt, and not so far away, is Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz); an educated English woman working in a library whom outlines her credentials and skills to her employer purely for out benefit when he challenges her. She's a little pit perky; a tad goofy because of the mess she makes at her workplace and the manner in which she makes it, at one point having to balance precariously on a ladder.<br/><br/>Her laid back and often amusing brother, named Jonathan (Hannah), then brings into her possession an artifact which could spell some serious archaeological ramifications. Following the obtaining of an imprisoned O'Connell, given he is vital to where it is the artifact will lead them, the trio set off for the deeper; sandier and more barren spots of Egypt to uncover greater truths about the trinket it turned out Jonathan stole from O'Connell, a trinket which is more broadly linked to that of the opening ancient Egypt-set story. What will come to form between Evelyn and Rick is a lightly played but fun enough romance beginning with O'Connell dismissing the moment he kissed her from behind his barred jail window as something which ""seemed like a good idea at the time"" because he was ""about to be hung"".<br/><br/>On the journey with them, but in opposing camps, are some greedy American treasure hunters whom enjoy their gunfights along with their own English academic, who's sexist, and led overall by the weaselly, one-time buddy of Rick's named Beni (O'Connor). The two troupés rolling along dusty; desert terrains to orchestral bursts of orchestral music, MacGuffin in hand, as the sun beats down and the treasure lies out there somewhere, is quite good fun at the best of its times; although Rick's ongoing and somewhat inexplicable feud with Beni is hardly the stuff of Blondie and Tuco. One thing leads onto another, the eventual resurrecting of Imhotep spelling disaster for the rest of everyone as he wrecks his revenge on the world he still sees as the one that forbade his genuine love for another. The film engineers into a race against time against the seemingly indestructible villain, the moment he's got all his bits and pieces together to complete the resurrection ritual the moment spelling disaster for all.<br/><br/>Sommers' film is good fun in the long run. It is the sort of film that has its characters crack jokes and break one-liners in the face of an apocalypse, and in light of people formulating angry views on characters constantly outrunning explosions or things that they ought not be able to in films of this ilk, actually has a scene in which it sticks around to see what happens to the poor bastard unable to get away from the proverbial danger: the result is less than pleasant. The film is not without flaw, but it's difficult to get too angry over a piece as self-aware as The Mummy is of the old fashioned, spirited romp that it is. Look at the scene in which the protagonist even identifies his quest as one in which rescuing the damsel in distress; defeating the villain and saving the world must be achieved so as to attain parity, labelling it ""the usual"". With a well-sewn romance manoeuvred into the film and a great deal of threat persistently looming over proceedings; The Mummy is a decent, enjoyable little B-movie adventure which above most other things, is at least refreshingly honest."

","THE MUMMY (1999) ***1/2 Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, Arnold Vosloo, Jonathan Hyde, Oded Fehr, Omid Djalili.  Fabulous special effects laden remake of the classic horror flick with a 90's tongue-through-cheek twist.  Fraser makes an appealingly tough yet goofy hero as an adventurer (sort of Indiana Jones lite) who teams up with a hottie British Egyptian interpreter/museum clerk (Weisz in a plucky turn) and her boozing brother (Hannah in a dry, comic go) in search for a long buried city of the dead that instead unleashes 3,500 year old cursed spirit of Imhotep (Vosloo) whose vengeance must be satisfied!  The visuals and plenty of good natured humor mixed with some at-times eerily effective scary jolts makes for a giddy, guilty pleasure.  And watch out for those nasty, flesh-eating scarabs(!)  HANG ON!"
"Amazing Blair","2","1","3","9 May 1999"," What a waste!
","The 1999 version of 'The Mummy' was a big waste of time, effort, and money. Sure, the effects were first rate. The location, the costumes, the cast -- no problem there. But did they have to settle for a sitcom-level story?<br/><br/>The absolute cheapest element of film making is the story, and with only some (virtually free) story changes, this movie could have been great. The writer-director, Steven Sommers, chose instead to copy only the most overblown and childish aspects of Spielberg's work and let the story come afterwards, if at all.<br/><br/>Example: At one point the heroes, pursued by evil minions, wreck their yellow roadster and escape down a manhole. In the next scene, they're zooming away in the re-incarnated roadster. The Mummy himself couldn't work that quickly.<br/><br/>But worse were the mugging, the predictability, the one-liners, and the endless rain of bullets. Brendan Fraser even adjusts a mirror by shooting at it from across a room. No, I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>Remember the previews? They showed only serious action/adventure; that's what I expected to see. As you can imagine, my hopes were dashed, wrapped, desiccated, and entombed. Don't share that fate! This is one movie to miss."
"Destin","2","1","3","8 May 1999"," What a waste of two hours...
","This movie is just a shame. Nothing about it is even remotely entertaining. It's not scary, and it's not even campy enough to be funny in an Anaconda-esque way. The writing and directing are fit for a straight-to-video flick, yet for some reason millions of dollars were fed to this loser. Somehow, even the expensive sets, costumes and ILM computer effects seem low-rent. So what killed this flick? Maybe it's the characters, one of whom knows how to read heiroglyphics, studies ancient Egyptian cities, memorizes mummy's curses, but has never heard of Pharoah Seti I. Or maybe it's that the initial Egyptian set looks more animated than the ones in Prince of Egypt. Maybe it's that the mummy looks different in every shot, as they switch from dummy mummy to computer effect without checking for similarities. Maybe it's the idiotic bald-dude villain you see ten times more than the mummy. Maybe it's the fact that this bald guy roars like a lion. Maybe it's that no one ever looks like they've been told ""hey, there's a scary computer mummy dude in this shot, so look frightened."" Maybe it's the ""army of the undead"" at the end, who gain and lose weight at random (depending on whether they're obvious guys in suits or obvious digital effects), lurch around like decomposing Jerry's kids and are far less visually effective than the skeletons from Army of Darkness, which cost less than half as much. Maybe it's that I could count down precisely to every predictable, tired ""jump-scene."" Maybe it's the THREE ""funny-drunk"" scenes. Whatever it is, I'm very sorry I wasted two hours on this movie. Forget everything you've heard about this being a Raiders of the Lost Ark clone. There's no way the two movies share even the tiniest bit of DNA."

The movie tried both to be spooky and funny but failed on both accounts. The mummy was stupid and the main characters were boring stereotypes, the female lead was especially annoying. The script is very bad and the direction is not good either.

You should not be able to look at all of the characters in scene one and be able to accurately predict who is going to die and when it will happen. I could. The movie is unbelievably predictable.

The effects were nice, and had the potential to be horrifying. But this movie could never figure out what it wanted to be. Were they trying to take themselves seriously? In some parts, yes. In others, no. Was this supposed to be horror? adventure? camp/comedy?<br/><br/>Turns out, it was none of the above. Probably because the actors were not sure either. From the scooby-doo footprints on the ship to the ""Thriller""-like mummy priests this movie reeked of camp. Except someone forgot to to tell the Mr. Frasier. The scenes go from Indiana Jones spoofs to Indiana Jones rip-offs in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>If you liked Godzilla, you'll love this movie. If not- go rent Boris Karloff's mummy.

Imhotep was a real pharoah, but he was by no means evil and didn't require stolen body parts to exist.

"ThomasDrufke","3","1","4","6 June 2017"," Death is Only the Beginning
","It's always difficult for brainless action movies to hold up over time. It's incredibly rare that such films can stand more than a decade or so without feeling too silly. The Mummy, which was made nearly 2 decades ago, definitely falls under this category. With a dumb script, exaggerated acting, dated CGI, and a dopey tone, 1999's version of The Mummy is a cable movie at best.<br/><br/>It's amazing to see how far this series has come, from the intellectual 1932 film to the blockbuster action 2017 feature, it's clear that this is a property that people are interested in no matter the genre it forms. With that said, if a film titled 'The Mummy' never manages to offer a single scare or thrill, there's something seriously wrong with the direction. ""But that's not the direction they wanted to take with the movie"", some may say, well then make the film you intended at least a little bit entertaining. I had heard this film wasn't to be taken seriously, but to show no respect or knowledge for the source material at all feels disappointing to say the least.<br/><br/>The acting is abysmal. Some of it can certainly be contributed to the dialogue they were given and perhaps the direction as well, but the line delivery here is just brutal. I know Brendan Fraser isn't particularly regarded as Oscar caliber, but Rachel Weisz definitely is. To see all them do such poor work is more than difficult to watch. But I think this can all come back to the tone established by director and writer, Stephen Sommers. The lighter, goofier tone is clearly purposeful, but it only works if you buy into the characters. I always bring up the Fast & Furious as examples for these types of films because they succeed in making over the top action movies without sacrificing the dynamics between their central characters. The Mummy doesn't do that one bit.<br/><br/>I think one of the things that does work is Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score. Not only does it harken back to the days of John Williams' heroic theme for Indiana Jones, but it actually complements the action quite well. It's just too bad I didn't particularly care for the action that was going on anyway. Overall, this film displays a serious lack of awareness in tone, humor, and writing, even if some of the action provides brief swashbuckling fun amidst a great score. The Mummy is forgettable.<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>-Tone<br/><br/>-Rough acting & writing<br/><br/>3.8/10"

It has equal parts action, comedy, adventure and romance. But what I really love is the mummy himself and his seemingly unstoppableness. You are more invested in the movie because of the difficulty of the situation. Whatever, this movie is awesome.

"paulkresearch-gen01","5","1","4","17 March 2011"," Formulaic and half-hearted
","Oh dear! Perhaps the genre has seen too many serious attempts in the past for any producer to contemplate another. If we grade the handling of the subject and its commitment, regarding either Abbott and Costello or the Marx Bros Meet the Curse of the Pharoah at 1, to Indiana Jones at 10, this film comes in at about 4. I found myself disenchanted at the lack of any form of intellectual content, with minimal lip-service being paid to the scholarship in Egyptology. The characters are largely pantomime, with stereotypical roles and attitudes. Spoof-laden, most of the scenes are (I hope, intentionally) played for laughs, an especially irritating strategy which undermines all attempts to make any convincing characterisations - not that there are any genuine attempts, or characters, for that matter. The pace of the film is generally too fast, a feature which also contributes to its overall superficiality. Top marks for securing the services of Jerry Goldsmith, however. The music is truly worthy of a much greater film."

","One feature of many modern action films that I dislike a lot, specially in Hollywood films, is that they always put a buffoon (or several) in their films (Fortunately there are films like Syriana or Babel). In ""Episode I"" it war Jar Jar Binx. In the mummy it was John Hannah (And Brendan Fraser sometimes). I have nothing against a bit of humor, but you should know where and when to make use of that humor unless you want to break the drama and the action atmosphere. Specially when you use childish humor.<br/><br/>I found this film to be a really bad one. Very good special effects, very spectacular, and I have to admit it was entertaining, but I would eliminate some of the characters, like Jonathan Carnahan. Sorry if I think that clowns are better for the circus than for action films.<br/><br/>The only really good thing of the film is Rachel Weisz, which is really impressive (And I am not talking about the acting)"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","4","29 December 2009"," ""Wait, what? That makes no sen... ooooh... preeetty...""
","Before I begin this, you should know that I don't care for Indiana Jones either. I caught(not by choice) one of the old ones, and I could not tell you which of them it was. Uh... it had spiders... oh, and a scene in a plane that I believe inspired the lyrics of at least the chorus of a song by Aqua, the short-lived Danish pop phenomenon. So, on to this pile... at this point, the flicks Sommers was... putting, let's go with that... out were still intolerable(of what I've seen by him, only G.I. Joe did not physically hurt me to sit through). He needs to stay far away(I'd be willing to sign a petition to enforce that, can we get a court to issue a powerful restraining order, maybe?) from classic horror films, because, as should be no secret to anyone who's seen him do a pathetic attempt at it, *he lacks even the most basic level of understanding of the genre*. Is *anyone* scared by anything in any of these? He can't build suspense or tension, and he refuses to commit to any creature enough to make it menacing. I haven't watched the original, from 1932 and starring Boris Karloff, but I am certain it is superior to this. Frankly, this is idiotic. It is not funny, it is not entertaining, and it is not engaging. Every single character is obnoxious(a couple are offensive Middle Eastern stereotypes, as well), and what few personality traits they do have are all wildly unappealing. Are we supposed to care about these people? I can imagine their own families not wanting anything to do with them. The effects(and yes, they are fairly well-done(meanwhile, this was made when The Matrix was, so it could have been better) though there are too many of them, and it ceases to be dramatic) are *clearly* the focus here, evidenced partially by the fact that these morons literally *stand in place to gawk at them when in imminent danger*, destroying a lot of the sense of potential peril. Why are the monsters all so utterly inept? Yes, yes... it's a cinematic convention that they have to suck when attacking the leads, however, these seem *completely* useless. In general, this is extremely over the top. The score is another example of that. Evelyn falls for Rick, for no other reasons than that he's there, he's Caucasian and he's not related to her by blood. The action is not all that exciting. That's not a mummy, anyway; it's a decomposing body that has risen from the dead... anybody who knows their supernatural lore will tell you immediately that that's a *zombie*. Seriously, if they thought the old bandage look was silly, then why did they make a movie of the monster at all? This is not entirely devoid of interesting bits. And Oded Fehr, arguably the strongest charismatic screen presence, was certainly cool to see again. He was the best part of this for me. There is mild and occasionally disturbing violence, and brief partial nudity in this. The DVD contains two commentary tracks(one with the director and editor, and one with Fraser) that aren't half bad, a handful of short things that show you the different elements of the visual effects, three storyboard to final film comparisons, a few deleted scenes, a photo montage and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of Stephen and/or adventure. 6/10"

","As is, sadly, too often the case, the promotional previews of this pic contained practically all that was worth watching. There are some lovely moments, nice effects, good sets, and you've seen all that once you've seen the 'come-on' sequences!<br/><br/>There were special effects- tho' not much of an advance on Harryhausen's classics of nearly 20 years vintage, and there were some nice sets. The story itself is, of course, well known to cinema-goers thanks to the whole sequence of 'Mummy' features produced over half a century ago, but what is depressing is that a re-treaded story got such a tired treatment. Even copying what was done in the past, the atmosphere that was then evoked is entirely dissipated by a lack of vision: the film has no clear direction.<br/><br/>'Half-hearted' is a key phrase for this movie, & 'confused' the key word. There is a half-hearted attempt to be sexy, but not too much (because, presumably, we don't want the teens barring from the cinema). There is a laughable attempt to be scary/shocking which just does not do the business. Talking of 'laughable', the attempts at humour in this are frequent and pitiful: more suited to a costume soap on afternoon TV than a movie anyone would want to see! (Some of the sequences on a boat on the Nile were like someone attempting to do a comedy western on the set of 'Showboat'!)<br/><br/>Money has clearly been spent, some of the scenery and sets are impressive, and there are passages of 5-10 minutes which have much promise. Sadly, that promise is all you get.<br/><br/>What a shame! Here is story so meaty and cinematically promising that I could certainly see why it merited (at least one) re-make. Love, damnation, resurrection, bloodshed, exotic locations and 2 historical time frames offer so many possibilities. So many wasted possibilities. Like 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' a few years before it, 'The Mummy' takes a gothic narrative with enormous possibilities and wastes it. What a pity! <br/><br/>The waste is- arguably-  all the greater here because, whereas the early 'mummy' films work very well indeed, there has never yet been a satisfactory and faithful filmic adaptation of Dracula (which always strikes me as really odd, for I have never encountered a book more suited to- almost designed for- cinematic expression).<br/><br/>Don't go see this.

I will simply note that it has a considerable number of holes.  It had potential, but fell far short.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers, who most recently brought us the inane Deep Rising, has made that film look like a masterpiece in comparison to The Mummy. As the writer/director, he deserves the most blame for this catastrophe, regardless of box office receipts.  Perhaps Sommers should get some writing advice from Tarantino if he wants to be witty, or at least competent.<br/><br/>This film attempted to rely on the popular one-liner, but Brendan Fraser was not the man to pull it off.  ""Clever"" he is not.  I've seen this film compared to the Indiana Jones films, Big Trouble in Little China, and other great adventure films.  However, Fraser cannot live up to the stars of these great movies.  He did not have the timing to carry the lines.  However, I cannot place all the blame of Fraser as he had a miserable script to deal with.<br/><br/>I don't know how anyone could possibly enjoy the banter between the characters and the off-timing one-liners which Fraser dispenses far too frequently and with far too little ability.  I was painfully reminded of Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin, to give you an idea of how bad it truly is.<br/><br/>The film reminded me of ""Army of Darkness"" in many ways, but without the skill and flair Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell brought to that film.  The creature effects were quite similar, with the initial mummy creature looking something like the ""evil Ash.""  Also, the attempts at humor and witty one-liners were similar as well.  However, you'd be much better off watching ""Army of Darkness,"" for it is by far the superior movie.  As for comparisons with the Indiana Jones films, I will not even dignify them with a response.<br/><br/>The Mummy is not worth your time or money.  I would suggest going to see this movie ONLY if you are so into effects that you can overlook the plot, script, acting, and all other aspects of the film.  The effects are truly the only redeeming quality, and even they really aren't anything new. Save your money.  I wish I had."

Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep is neither scary or interesting and his interactions with the protagonists drags on for too long without any coherence or suspense. The one bright spot in terms of character is the talented Rachel Weisz. But there is very little she can do working with a very thin script.

A wonderful story and one of the most magnificent tales ever told in my opinion. But, to my regret, this review will be a lot less favourable than the ones I did for the 1932 version.<br/><br/>First of all, actor Arnold Vosloo had the unrewarding task to follow into the footsteps of the greatest actor who ever lived....Boris Karloff played the mummy in the original version and to his style and appearance can never be lived up to. In another great Ancient Egypt-story, Christopher Lee portrayed a mummy as well ( he was called Kharis, if I'm not mistaken) so being a worthy follow-up to those 2 screen legends, Arnold Vosloo fails enormously. In fact, he's not a very well known actor at all, I only recognized him from the inferior Darman sequels. That was negative element number one, but so far...I hadn't lost all hope yet. No, that happened when the CGI came along... Such a shame...this version is obviously made for a complete other kind of audience. Young people mostly, I think...the computer generation. I'm not that old or something but I prefer the old-fashioned make-up effects a lot more.

The mummy ( especially in his most early phase of decomposition ) is laughable and some of the most unrealistic things I ever saw....Furthermore: the sandstorms, the bugs, the servants of Imhotep etc, they're all a waste of money. One look in the eyes of good old Boris Karloff and you're frightened a 100 times more. The whole traditional story of Imhotep is explained in the first 5 minutes and the last 10...all what's in between is a useless story about treasure hunters looking for the lost city of Hamunaptra and ""Americans vs British""-jokes... There are a lot more ( smaller ) aspects about this movie that bugged me, too. For example, the huge amout of comedy in it. I love a good oneliner from time to time but this is just way over the top. I don't have much to say about the acting performances. Brendan Frasier is one of the few actors that I don't care about at all. I don't think he sucks nor do I think he's good. Neutral guy in my opinion. He did make a lot of bad films, but I don't think he was ever to blame for it. I did like Airheads in wich he starred, but in that one Steve Buscemi totally steals the show. I don't care much about Rachel Weisz neither...she looks cute from time to time, that's all. <br/><br/>Now, this review could be taken as very positive too. If you like modern horror with an overload of CGI, instead of good plot twists...I highly recommend it. If you've got any sense of tradition or myth, avoid it. Stephen Sommers totally wasted a piece of true art here. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse than this, he comes along with the Mummy Returns. I still hate myself for watching that...The Mummy was bad, the Mummy Returns was a complete disaster. My humble opinion...2/10"
"nlytnd_1","1","1","7","20 March 2013"," One of the worst, if not the worst movies I've ever seen
","I guess I'll keep it brief. For one, I barely even remember it at this point, as I've blocked out much of this traumatic experience. I saw this in the theater at the time of it's release.<br/><br/>The style of dialogue was so horrendous, which I detected 5 minutes into the movie. Similar to a cartoon or a comic book. Very slapstick and not funny at all (it's probably fair to say that it's unanimously not funny). It's the worst of all worlds. It doesn't take the serious route, moderately serious route, or even a route that's capable of producing at least 1 chuckle, rather a route of a complete garbage. Why would you even take a slap stick cartoon route with such a gargantuan movie budget? Well, I guess they got the last laugh, because this movie somehow made a fortune. Obviously, that's all they were going for, which is understandable and fine, but I would imagine most directors would want to make something they were proud of as well... not Stephen Sommers and his ridiculously bad filmography proves it. A complete Schlock director. <br/><br/>This movie may as well have taken the special effects and flushed it down the toilet. It's the equivalent of writing am energetic comedy act and giving it to Ben Stein to perform. Of course that would have some potential to have reverse laughter. Unlike other movies that rank as the worst of all time (The Room, Troll 2, The Wicker Man etc), which are funny and worth watching because they are so bad, The Mummy is a 100% painful viewing experience. So, the Mummy is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen and I've consistently held that position ever since watching this piece of garbage. <br/><br/>Perhaps this is a good movie for kids 10 and younger, but it's probably an insult to even their intelligence. <br/><br/>It's difficult to harp on actors for being crappy under such bad direction and horrendous dialogue, but with that aside they are ridiculously bad. I'm a fan of John Hannah by the way and he doesn't stand out as being good or bad from what I remember... but the bad guy, the chick, Brendan Fraser and everyone else, words can't describe it. I particularly remember how stupid their facial expressions were.<br/><br/>Here is my only spoiler and it wins the award for dumbest scene in the movie, from what little I remember of it. Basically, the bad guy conjures up a tornado and is chasing Fraser (and perhaps others) through the desert with it. As the tornado's about to take him out, the chick standing next to the bad guy (with a really lame facial expression, which she notoriously does throughout the movie) kisses him on the check. This distraction causes the tornado to dissolve and causes the bad guy to get an extremely lame facial expression as well (I can't even describe the facial expressions, because I've never seen anything like it before in my life). So essentially, this quick witted act saved Fraser from certain death. Anywho, it's stupid crap like this that causes this movie to kill brain cells. If you're going to kill brain cells I recommend smoking crack instead of watching this piece of crap, at least you'll get some pleasure in return."

","I completely understand people seen this back in 99 and been blown way by it. Even tho it relies heavily on CGI in some parts (mostly the Mummy stuff). It's still pretty good, the effects pretty much hold up, I mean it isn't as jaw dropping as it might have been 20 years ago, but still, I give them credit for the cinematography and production design here, the movie was made back in a time when movies were trying to figured out how much they should rely on CGI, and I think this one nailed it, it has a great mixture of CGI and great sets, and special effects. And this is probably never going to change much, it will have this re watchability for years to come.<br/><br/>The story tho, it's a bit basic. Again, I can understand it being great back in 1999, but some parts of it, like the lady who falls for the big hero, and they finally get together at the end, aren't exactly that appealing nowadays. Plus, I didn't buy their chemistry.<br/><br/>Finally, I just think that the finale feels a bit drag out, the movie feels longer than it actually is. 1h40 to 1h50 it's a range that might have made the movie a couple scores better for me.<br/><br/>Just to point out some weird stuff that bothered me:<br/><br/>So, you commit a crime, a terrible one, and your punishment (besides the eternal suffering) is... to be immortal and indestructible?<br/><br/>3000 years guarding the tomb... so when outsiders show up, messing around and going into your sacred place, you give them a warning (""you have until tomorrow to leave or you'll die"") and then proceeds to leave and let them unsupervised while there is a possibility someone might awake ancient immortal monster you devoted your entire life to prevent from scaping? What? And this is actually a main turning point in the entire film, and it's such a lazy way out, that transforms those cool ninja-like soldiers into some dumbass that failed miserably in the one thing they devoted their lives to.<br/><br/>Overall tho, the movie is fine, it has some great action scenes, the Mummy effect holds up pretty well even today, and I like Fraser as the lead, he is charismatic. I just feel like the fact I'm seen it 20 years after, when audiences have changed that much, and we've seen the same beats in a movie over and over again, that the movie's storyline most likely lost some power if you compared it with the power it had when it first came out in 1999.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","2","17 January 2014"," Like sand through your mind.
","""The Mummy"" is a movie that only lingers in your mind for about ten-minutes. You go in, you see the sights and when it's over you give it about ten minutes before it leaves your mind completely. It's bright and loud and flashy but there is nothing really to hang on to.<br/><br/>The movie begins in ancient Egypt as Im-Ho-Tep (Arnold Vosloo) is punished for having slept with the Pharaoh's mistress. He is mummified, put into a coffin with flesh-eating beetles and buried in the sand for 3,000 years.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the 1920s and in the midst of a war, a foreign legionnaire named Rick joins that quest of a librarian named Evelyn and her brother to find Hamunaptra nicknamed 'The City of the Dead' (I tried to imagine that printed on a highway sign followed by a detour signal). They hope to get the Hamunaptra before opposing adventurers and also Im-Ho-Tep's descendants who are trying to keep him from being brought back to life.<br/><br/>The characters all serve basic functions. Rick is the Indiana Jones-style roguish hunk whose job it is to get everyone past the pitfalls and woo the heroine. Evelyn (the beautiful Rachel Weisz) is one of those experts on Egyptian lore and can explain the meaning and history of every artifact that she touches. Her brother Jonathan is one of those tag-along characters who is there to give clever little comments.<br/><br/>As for Im-Ho-Tep himself well he isn't much more then a good looking guy standing around in rags throwing the hero against first one wall then that next. I did like some touches that the script gave him like the fact that he fears cats because they were the guardians of the underworld (having been told that I would have bought out an entire pet store before proceeding). I was also thankful that, for once, a creature reborn after many centuries didn't speak English.<br/><br/>Stephen Sommers directed the movie and has taken this road before. He made a similar (but better) live action version of The Jungle Book in 1994. That movie was along the same lines but it had a little more meat then 'The Mummy'.<br/><br/>I have a requirement for movies like this: Is the movie giving me more than I paid for? Example: The elevator and subway scenes that book-ended the main story of 'Speed'. Those were elements that I didn't expect but was grateful for. 'The Mummy' doesn't fit that requirement. Unlike movies like 'The Relic', 'Anaconda', 'Near Dark' and 'Deep Blue Sea' there just aren't any fun surprises here.<br/><br/>** (of four)"
"Clockwork-Avacado","6","0","2","4 November 2013"," Indiana Jones meets Hellraiser, but with better actors
","Totally disregard any previous ""Mummy"" films before going to see this. Not because this is the definitive effort, but just for the simple reason that this has nothing to do with any of them. It's a family-friendly version, with a lot of rather unnecessary CGI throughout, and far more gags than genuine shocks. It's your standard action/adventure movie, and yet, it still is reasonably entertaining. But the biggest disappointment of all, is the fact that there isn't really a mummy in the entire movie. Instead, in a plot exactly lifted from Clive Barker's original ""Hellraiser"" movie, we have a decomposing, cursed man who must drain his victims dry, to rebuild himself physically. Not exactly original.<br/><br/>What does make rather a nice change, though, is the fact that both our leads are capable and seem to be having a lot of fun, rather than the po-faced posing we're so used to seeing in movies these days. Brendan Fraser is a capable and solid enough hero, who, despite his constant dry quips, is not at all arrogant, and has a quiet believability to him totally unlike your average action hero. Rachel Weisz, back before the dark days of ""Constantine"", is charming and talented, and there is a great chemistry between the two of them that keeps the movie alive. The vast swathe of other characters, largely comic grotesques, range form John Hannah's likable buffoon, to Kevin J O'Connors' weaselly little git. Connor manages to get even more and more annoying in each scene, and whilst he isn't the only thing wrong with this movie, cutting him out entirely would improve this movie no end.<br/><br/>Arnold Vosloo is a fairly by-numbers villain, who adds little beyond a certain imposing physicality to the role, although he does look good in the role. His love interest, though, Patricia Velasquez, is phenomenal, and if ever there was a woman worth suffering a living death for, it must just be her. Velasquez has less than five minutes screen-time, but makes her presence acutely felt, with her elaborate, painted on costume, the most visually stunning element of the entire movie.<br/><br/>The story putters along, with some impressively staged action scenes, with great stunt-work throughout. It's just a shame that the horror content wasn't half as good as the stunt-work, because then we'd have a proper ""Mummy"" film. Instead, rather than being at all creepy, all the supernatural elements are handled with heavy CG. Vast biblical plagues are realised effectively enough, but the over-the-top nature of most of the CG threats - plagues of millions of beetles you can escape by side-stepping, plagues of locusts you can avoid by staying indoors, huge walls of sand, etc - aren't written compotently enough to be exciting. The main problem is the old chestnut of the all-powerful villain, who somehow gets defeated. They've amped up Imhotep's powers so much, that he's a supernatural entity who can do anything with a thought - so how does he get so easily defeated? Lesson learned here - don't give your villain unlimited powers, or else we'll just be massively disappointed when he finally gets beaten, and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>There is a strong comedy quotient in this movie, where tension is never allowed to be built up, without immediately being diffused by a joke, or someone making light of the situation. It creates the jaunty, entertaining tone, but, unlike most movies, it doesn't go away as the stakes get higher. Our characters make jokes, and are engaged in comic set-pieces right up until the very end. The more fun tone is fine to begin with, but it gets a bit tiresome towards the end, when things should be getting a lot more serious.<br/><br/>Dramatically, ""The Mummy"" is heavily flawed. The CGI is far too over-used, the threat amped up to totally unrealistic proportions, which only succeed in being faintly disappointing. But, Fraser and Weisz are good leads. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a very traditionalist soundtrack, which largely goes un-noticed in the chaos. The first half is fun, reasonably exciting, heavily action-packed, and funny without being silly. Sadly, the end gets rather flat, and the build-up we've had, where we're waiting to finally see the mummy, is rudely shattered by a rather shoddy piece of CGI.<br/><br/>To be honest, it could have been a lot worse. It's very casually entertaining, made for audiences with a short-attention span, who laugh at gag after gag because they don't have the patience to follow a plot, or sustain an atmosphere. It's rubbish compared to the Hammer movie, but, compared to today's blockbusters, there's something charmingly human about it all."

","It's not easy to separate the adventures of the blandly named ""Rick"" and the true movie adventurer Indiana Jones, but since Indy hadn't an excellent adventure since 1989 (and probably never will again,) this will do.<br/><br/>The Mummy was actually a really fun ride. And that's all it is. Don't look for depth, for any amount of seriousness or even memorable characters – aside from the mostly absent title character, that is. Despite my first paragraph, it's best to avoid thinking of the superior Dr. Jones serials and just have fun. And, sure, it's silly – sometimes overly inane and the movie was way too convoluted; SEE: the opening novel-sized narration shots to set-up the background story. Oh, and some of the special effects not only don't hold up today, but were questionable back in 1999.<br/><br/>AGAIN it's just a thrill adventure that requires you to leave your brain at the door. For, it has all the elements of old westerns, romantic slapstick of decades past and the horror elements of the original Mummy films of the 1930s.<br/><br/>Adventurer Rick stumbles upon the city of the dead and years following, is taken in by a librarian and her brother to retrieve old books and other artifacts. None of them truly believe the old Egyptian myths of the undead being able to be resurrected and, of course, that's what's about to happen.<br/><br/>""The Mummy,"" or High Priest Imhotep, does come back (eeeeventually – it really does take the movie a long time to (re)introduce the title character) and besides completely restoring his body to flesh and inadvertently causing Biblical plagues, his main mission is to also bring back his lovely adulteress.<br/><br/>Reluctantly, Rick and the Gang vow to stop him because of some ""legend"" that hell would be on Earth. Actually, I think that was just to cause more tension in the film because other than words, that didn't seem like it would happen.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, park your brain, let loose, laugh a lot, avoid the normal criticism people like me would normally write about and you'll have a good time. Rick is absolutely no Indy and the movie is certainly no Raiders, but since there were only two (out of four) solid Indiana Jones flicks, this is a good companion piece."

","Every time I go to my grandparent's house one of two movies is always on TV, The Godfather and The Mummy. Two very different movies but let's talk about The Mummy. An ancient, evil, mummy comes back to life to revive his dead girlfriend while terrorizing Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weisz, I'm OK with that. The Mummy is an entertaining experience and goes down as one of my favorite movies as a kid.<br/><br/>In the beginning there is a prologue showing Prince Imhotep and Anck Su Namun and their forbidden love story in the ancient city Hamunaptra. It is really interesting and the visuals of ancient Egypt and the story really sucked me in. I love a good prologue and the opening scenes to this movie were strong. Characters were introduced well with their first impressions. Imhotep is a clever villain. O'Connell is the level headed, strong, leader. Jonathan is the witty idiot who provides comedic relief, and Evy is the beautiful genius. The characters are cliché but for the goal of the movie it works. The plot is basic, acting is OK, and the special effects/action scenes are above average. The Mummy, for 1999 was a good movie but it is easily forgotten.<br/><br/>Brendan Frasier plays Rick O'Connell and this is the best performance of his career, and that really isn't saying much. He is the standard superhuman who can do anything. He is smart, strong, handsome, and everything somebody wants in a hero. He wasn't a mindless action star because this isn't an action movie, thank god, so he has character development and is way different from the beginning compared to the end. He has his one-liners, he has his witty comments and funny moments, and sometimes they work really well, and sometimes it's painful to watch. When he first sees the mummy he freaks, says something stupid, shoots it in the face, and runs. That didn't work whatsoever. It was a typical one-liner that makes the hand smack the forehead. Then there is a moment where he yells at another mummy and it is his battle cry. The mummies respond and the look on his face was great before he runs away. I loved it, I laughed and it worked. <br/><br/>Halfway into the movie we leave the desert and move to Cairo. This is where I expected the movie to slow down and become really boring, but it didn't. I loved most scenes in Egypt with the bugs that eat people and the digging in then tombs. That is all interesting to me and I almost wanted to go back. In Cairo, the movie gets really good because Imhotep needs to regenerate and seeing him slowly become human again, and by human I mean having skin and not a decaying corpus, was really cool and scary. The visuals of the ½ man ½ mummy were really cool. I love the visual of a bug crawling across his face and it crawls into a hole in his cheek and Imhotep just bites down and eats the bug, brilliant. <br/><br/>For the entire movie I was waiting for when I would get taken out of the experience and would be turned off, and that was the plane scene with Winston. He was a pointless character with a meaningless plot point. I know why he was in the movie and it does make sense but I just hate it. The whole scene with the giant sandstorm was just so stupid. I watched it just loathing it and wanting it to end as soon as possible. Then it just ends in the worst way possible. I won't spoil but if this scene was cut out the movie would have been no different. <br/><br/>For my favorite character it is a split between Beni and Jonathan. Beni is the weasel who works with the devil to save his own life. He even admits it. ""It is better to be at the right hand of the devil then in his path."" Every time I saw him I was waiting for somebody to kill him. There is no way he can possibly live and I was waiting for the bullet to the head, or the sword in the stomach, or even the mummy tearing him to shreds. Needless to say his character is very entertaining; we feel emotion towards him and is the wildcard in the movie. Jonathan is just straight up funny. He is dumb but had flashes of brilliance. He is kind of a sidekick but I enjoy seeing him on screen and his charisma adds a nice charm to the movie. This isn't a good movie without Jonathan or Beni in it.<br/><br/>Overall, The Mummy is a good movie. It isn't a classic, but it isn't awful either. I liked the movie and every time it's on I will watch it. I can hop in at any point and have fun watching it. There is really nothing special about it, positive or negative. The CGI and special effects weren't groundbreaking. The acting won't win any awards, it's just a fun movie to watch and enjoy it for what it is. As for a grade, it's tough. It isn't good enough for an Honorable Mention, but isn't bad enough for an A For Effort. It is somewhere in the middle. I know, The Mummy gets the WillyT Recommendation. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants a decent movie to watch with friends and enjoy the story and action. Don't expect the best movie ever but don't expect garbage either. Just expect The Mummy."

","It's taken me 13 years to watch this movie because, basically, I didn't like the original version! Of all the ""classic"" Universal horror movies, I thought 1932's ""The Mummy"" was the weakest. Aside from a great performance by Boris Karloff, it just wasn't that good. Universal knew how to make good horror movies, but what they so often did so right, they so totally failed at with ""The Mummy."" It wasn't exciting, it wasn't fun and it wasn't frightening. A horror movie, to be a horror movie, has to have at least one of those three things going for it. And, since remakes generally aren't as good as the original, I avoided this one like the plague until now. I'm pleasantly surprised, in that I actually thought this was marginally better than the 1932 version.<br/><br/>What went wrong in 1932 did not go wrong in 1999. This movie was exciting - it was packed with action and had some great effects. This movie was fun - it had a tongue in cheek quality to it, and the performances (especially from leads Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz) captured that tongue in cheek quality perfectly. And, at times at least, it was frightening. At least Imhotep was a ghastly, frightening being - not at all like the Imhotep of the original, who could have walked down the streets of Cairo with no one knowing who he was or thinking there was anything strange about him! So a lot of the problems were fixed, and made this pleasant watching.<br/><br/>It was not, however, without problems. Essentially, it went a bit overboard. In particular, the last half hour - featuring all of Imhotep's mummified and dessicated but re-animated priests was a little bit ridiculous, and I have to confess that the point at which they appeared was the point at which my attention started to wander. The opening, which featured a helpful journey back to ancient Egypt and explained how Imhotep got into this position, was also perhaps a wee bit too long, but it didn't cause me to wander. Those mummified priests in the last half hour didn't work for me.<br/><br/>When the last half hour of a movie causes you to lose a bit of interest - that's a problem. Overall, I enjoyed this, and I did think it marginally better than the original. For the 1932 version, I awarded a 5. Since this is - in my opinion - marginally better - 6/10."

An excellent cast and decent script gives an entertaining array of believable characters that enjoy some excellent on-screen chemistry, particularly between the characters portrayed by Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiss. The locations/sets are well-chosen/designed and look very realistic, and input from real-life experts lends a pleasing reality to when the actors are speaking in ancient Egyptian.

I have no idea if they are historically accurate, but when it comes to a movie that was made for entertainment, I don't really care about historical accuracy.<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie were the main characters. I certainly do not blame it on the actors, they can only work with what they have. I think that if after watching the story of the mummy in the beginning and getting to know the characters I am rooting for the mummy hoping that he gets all he wants and kills everyone, than there is a problem.<br/><br/>While I think that Brandan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are great for the movie like this, but I feel no chemistry. Also they created too many idiot character. That brother, played by John Hannah was completely useless. He was there for comic relief and yet was not funny at all.<br/><br/>That was another problem I had with the movie. They tried too much to be funny. I knew already that this won't be a horror movie, but I was hoping for adventure. I have nothing against comic relief in adventure movies (as long as it is funny), but in the one they just tried too much to be funny. And they were failing, stupid one liners didn't do it for me.

"gentendo","3","0","2","1 October 2008"," I'm not a big fan of Mellow Dramas
","Society seems to be drifting further away from buying into the classical mellow dramatic structure, whether in theater or film. Its structure is too predictable, exaggerated and mundane for an ever increasing and intelligent world that starves for realism, or at least parody. It shouldn't be a surprise, then, why films such as The Dark Knight or Enchanted are coming out and breaking those classical conventions in order to give audiences something newsomething fresh. We're moving away from the classical structure and progressing into the hybrid worlds of both morally ambiguous and farcical mellow dramas.<br/><br/>Although The Mummy stayed fairly true to the mellow dramatic structure, there were certain parts that seemed to hint at more farcical interpretations. In other words, it seemed as though the filmmakers were comfortable in making fun of the film itself. For example, when eerie sounds of wind or moans would seep through an open window, Brendan Frasier's character would poke fun at how he expected things like that to happen: ""That seems to happen a lot around here,"" he says mockingly. By doing so, he confirms a predictable convention in mellow drama that audiences have been spoon fed for far too long. The result: people laugh and don't take the genre quite too seriously. Another progressive move away from the classical structure comes when Rachel Weisz' character foretells the demise of the unfaithful sidekick, Beni: ""People like you always get their come uping's,"" she says, as if to confirm the tragic outcome of all villains in mellow dramas. These two scenes (and I'm sure there were others) depict socially progressive movements away from the cliché elements of mellow drama, and do so by playfully mocking the overall style of the film.<br/><br/>Culturally regressive elements in the film deal with how both women and Arabs are portrayed. If memory serves me correct, I believe Rachel Weisz is one of the only female characters in the entire film. She is depicted as being clumsy and inferior; one not on equal playing ground as the men. Her clumsiness is demonstrated in the beginning when she knocks over an entire library of books, and her inferiority is shown when smug comments are thrown her way by certain gold diggers: ""Don't worry; they have a woman on their side. They can't get too far."" She also fits the classical mold of the damsel in distress; one that is helpless by herself and needs a hero to save her. All of these ideas reflect an age unknown to the generation we, today, live in. That is, today women hold much higher statuses and are even, in some cases, more capable than men than displayed in this film. Arabs are portrayed in two lights. In one sense, they are depicted as being traitors to their friends, as shown when Beni betrays Frasier; and in another sense, however, they are shown to be heroes; such as the relationship between Frasier and the Magi, who, at first, seems to be obstacle for Frasier, but later becomes his protecting warrior. The portrayal of Arabs, then, is split down the middle; reflecting them as both socially progressive heroes and culturally regressive traitors."

Imhotep then sets about resurrecting his ancient love Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) & spreading his evil throughout the world...<br/><br/>Written & directed by Stephen Sommers this is a big budget remake of the black and white version of The Mummy (1932) & I actually much prefer this film over the original. The script is very different to the original & in reality only the central Imhotep character & the title remain, while the original was pretty slow going horror this is a big fast & furious overblown action adventure that's as comparable to an Indiana Jones film as it is to any horror film. There's plenty of action, fights, shoot-outs, CGI special effects & huge set pieces. It's a very enjoyable ride & the film provides good entertainment, I though it was perhaps a little slow at times as it's almost an hour before Imhotep is resurrected & that side of the film kicks in. The film never takes itself seriously which is fine I suppose but I thought there was maybe a bit too much family orientated comedy relief. If your looking for big budget action & CGI effects then you could do a lot worse than The Mummy.<br/><br/>Director Sommers does a decent enough job, there's plenty of flashy special effects & camera trickery. The action scenes are well shot as are the horror elements although it was clearly aimed at a fairly young audience.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 The Mummy is as well made as you would expect & has that Hollywood polish to it. According to the IMDb the Nile scenes were shot in Surrey in England! Not that you'd ever know it unless you were told... The acting was OK although I thought Kevin J. O'Conor as Benni became very annoying.<br/><br/>The Mummy is a good big budget action adventure that will entertain most. A bit shallow & maybe there's not a whole lot to it but it's good fun, definitely worth a watch & I can't really see anyone not enjoying it to some extent.

","Colorful, old-fashioned, full of adventure. Yes, all these describe this big-budget re-make of the old Universal flic; what a difference 67 years make. A box-office winner, this capitalizes on the current FX capabilities to display almost anything one can imagine (as long as you have the money): wanna show a locust invasion? No problem. A 'living' sandstorm? Okey do-key. Essentially a horror comedy, the minor horrific elements are offset by a tongue-in-cheek attitude; probably the creepiest sections for the audience have to do with the marauding hordes of beetles that scour the insides of the burial grounds and have a tendency to get under your skin. The monster of the title (played by South African actor Arnold Vosloo, who has no English lines) is more like a force of nature, with many supernatural powers, who needs to feed off the life-essences of various victims to regenerate himself, uh, itself. The movie has some great on-location desert photography, with the whole thing having a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" feel to it. So, why doesn't it rate higher with me? There is a word, I believe it's 'derivative,' which can also be used to describe this romp. When ""Raiders.."" came out in the early eighties, it was fairly original, even tho it was based on old-time serial pics. By the late nineties, this scrambling from one peril to the next is not. This is also a primary example of computer FX used to such excess that nothing resonates with any real impact on the viewer. Since the story is set in the 1920s, I could hear in 1999 the wheels turning in Hollywood executive heads regarding a sequel set in modern times. But, that didn't happen - the sequel moved ahead only a few years, to even better grosses. Now, THAT'S Hollywood. Uh, The Mummy Returns Again?"
"jboothmillard","5","0","8","23 June 2005"," The Mummy
","I assume this is a remake of the Boris Karloff or Christopher Lee films, with a clone of Indiana Jones and some familiar faces, from director Stephen Sommers. The film begins with the love story between High Priest Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) and Anck Su Namun (Patricia Velasquez) broken by murder of the Egyptian king, and their deaths. Then it is 1923, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) fighting in the French Foreign Legion along with treacherous Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is hired by Egyptologist Evelyn ""Evie"" Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah) to lead them to the city of Hamunaptra after finding an ancient map and key. They get there, along with another team, including Dr. Allen Chamberlain (Titanic's Jonathan Hyde), Mr. Henderson (Stephen Dunham), Mr. Daniels (Corey Johnson) and Mr. Burns (Tuc Watkins). The bad news is that after reading part of the ""treasure"", The Book of the Dead, ""Evie"" releases the Mummy of Imhotep, and he will not stop till he has all jars containing the organs of his love, and from the people who have them getting their energy (skin). When he gets all his skin and jars, he is now the ultimate curse on the world, and unless Rick, Jonathan and knowledgeable Medjai Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr) can stop him, he will sacrifice Evie to bring his love back to life. Also starring Erick Avari as Dr. Terrence Bey, Omid Djalili as Warden and Titanic's Bernard Fox as Captain Winston Havlock. The story may be cheesy, but the special effects, including the Mummy, the scarabs and the curses on Egypt are cool. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Rachel Weisz was number 18 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses. Worth watching!"

","A director is suppose to get better with every movie, not worse. So how did Stephan Sommers go from the wonderful adventure/horror movie ""The Mummy"" to the terrible ""The Mummy Returns"" to the unwatchable ""Van Helsing?"" I have a theory: Everything was in perfect balance in the first half of ""The Mummy"". Branden Fraser, was the perfect adventurer, Rachel Weisz was the perfect bookish librarian who blossoms into an alluring dessert flower with just one costume change. (I thought veils were suppose to cover up beauty not enhance it). Casting in general was perfect. Take Oded Fehr, the chief guardian of the place with his intense looks and great baritone voice. You just knew women were going to pick up on his charisma. Best of all, a great feeling for the creepiness that was ancient Egypt. Last but not least, the best musical score from Jerry Goldsmith that makes everything jell. Then the movie took a wrong turn. It became more special effects and less great adventure storytelling. This was not a fatal mistake because of the great forward momentum of the story. Yet some of the creepiness was evaporating as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" type skeletons were taking over the story. Still, everything was so good, all was forgiven. What the director should have learned from that movie was that too many special effects and too little plot and character development were the wrong formula. So what do we get in ""The Mummy Returns"", 70% special effects to a weak story. Then in Van Helsing, its 90% special effect and no story anyone would care to follow. If he can make a great fun film like the Mummy, he has the talent to redeem himself."

","I was averse to seeing this movie for whatever reason, but I ended up seeing the second half of it a few years ago, and just managed to track down the DVD and watch it. I actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit. Fraser was excellent in the role, the supporting cast held up their end of the bargain. Mostly what I would note about this film is that it does an admirable job of using conventions of the ""pulp"" genre while putting enough modern touches into it to make a modern audience feel at home. Some of those -- particularly I remember my distaste at Fraser using a machine gun against the mummies -- are rather off-putting, but in general the film is reminiscent of ""Indiana Jones"" as far as evoking the old H.R.

","Fun, but dumb. That's how I'd pretty much describe The Mummy. Stephen Sommers has done some wild b-movies in his time (Deep Rising) and was a great choice to write and direct this remake of the old 1930s Universal horror show. Though I must stress that very little of this film is original.<br/><br/>Basically it's an Indiana Jones rip-off with bits of Evil Dead and Hellraiser thrown in. Clichés are abundant and stereotyped, stock characters make up much of the supporting cast. Not only do we get a fair English maiden and a bumbling Brit designed to make the yank look cool but there are also gung-ho cowboys, stuffy professors, a cowardly weasel traitor (who really gets what he deserves) and a slimy slob prison warden. Argh! There's no real point in complaining about this as they're just supposed to be easy identifiable characters for younger audiences to appreciate.<br/><br/>There isn't really much scary about The Mummy, which is what the original was all about. Which brings me to the main problem of the film. I'm-ho-tep (played by the wicked-cool Nicolas Cage doppelganger Arnold Vosloo) is not really a bad guy. Everything he does is for love. Hardly the worst villain in history. In fact the greedy folks excavating his tomb, jeopardising the lives of everyone else for the sake of money are far worse, morally.<br/><br/>The action is exciting and some of the plot elements, however copycatted, are imaginative and clever. The 2 hour+ running time seems to fly by. It may be unoriginal but there's still more heart in The Mummy than in rubbish like Underworld.<br/><br/>The DVD has a great looking 2.35:1 anamorphic picture with even better Dolby 5.1/DTS sound.

One of the most depressing facts about this film is that it became a worldwide box office smash. Either I'm out of touch when it comes to choosing an entertaining film, or people the planet over are perfectly happy to be ripped off by films like this that have not a fresh idea in sight.<br/><br/> As Indy rip-offs go, this one is at least an improvement on Richard Chamberlain's appalling Allan Quatermain flicks. The plot is the same plot that has always been used in mummy movies: adventurers awaken the mummified corpse of an ancient Egyptian. To add spice to the proceedings, this particular mummy has the power to wipe out mankind, unless the heroes can figure out a way to stop him - which proves a tad tricky as he's invincible! The characters are pretty much lifted from stock, with all of the following present and correct:<br/><br/>1). a fearless wise-cracking hero.<br/><br/>2). a spunky heroine.<br/><br/>3). a British buffoon (along for comic relief).<br/><br/>4). a totally invulnerable, superhuman baddie.<br/><br/>5). a sneaky ethnic traitor.<br/><br/> The Mummy moves at a fast enough lick to keep you interested, but never once is it genuinely exciting. Fraser's hero is a boring cardboard cut-out who can handle even the most lethal danger with a quip... how are we supposed to feel tense when the quest to save mankind is in the hands of such an infallible hero?

But if it were anyway above average, then it would beat this one hands down. Because what we are presented with is a poorly acted, special effects laden, and rather cartoony, hopelessly unconvincing movie. Now I'm not one of those critical snobs who believes that all movies should try to be cinematic masterpieces, but this is just plain childish for the most part.<br/><br/>
But there is that one saving grace that only barely manages to lift it out of the dross- the computer effects. That was probably the sole intention of reviving this old film. But in fairness to it, the luscious landscapes and beautifully created computer generated images do compensate for some things, but not enough. <br/><br/>The one bad thing that stands out amid the rest is the acting. Brendan Fraser was a blindingly bad choice as the film's hero. Mainly because he just isn't serious enough for the part. Rachel Weisz is OK for her part as a clutz, but does tend to overact in the worst possible way. John Hannah was yet another bad choice as yet another form of comic relief. He attempts to be funny but only succeeds in being excruciatingly annoying. Arnold Vosloo takes on the bad-guy role of the title. He's OK but it would have better had he been replaced by a CG mummy. <br/><br/>Another very bad thing is the way that the film goes for cheap and rather childish jokes instead of solid shocks and genuine scares. It lowers the overall effect to make it seem far too much like a comedy than anything else. <br/><br/>The visual effects only barely make `The Mummy' anything to recommend.

Not since The Last Crusade have I seen an adventure movie so enjoyable and immensely likeable.  <br/><br/>To keep the film from ever getting boring, Sommers wisely delivers a wide variety of action sequences.  There are massive gun battles (the opening is spectacular), chases (on foot, car, and even airplane), and swordfights.  So much of it is so thrilling, it's hard to decide which action scene is the best (perhaps the opening gun battle or the sandstorm or the climactic sword battle against the mummies).  The special effects are outstanding and Arnold Vosloo as the mummy Imhotep makes for a genuinely imposing villain. <br/><br/>
Most importantly, though, the characters are likeable and a lot of fun. Brendan Fraser makes for a dashing action hero, Rachel Weisz is an appealing heroine, and John Hanna is hilarious as Weisz's inept brother.

We need more heroine´s like Evelyn Carnahan.<br/><br/>John Hannah and Oded Fehr also did a great job, not to mention Arnold Vosloo.<br/><br/>So it wasn´t like the old Mummy movies - so what - it´s a new movie, and it´s perfect in it´s own rights. It´s not horror, it´s adventure.<br/><br/>""The Mummy Returns"" does fail to focus too much on special effects but it´s still a good, fun movie. Besides we already know the characters and love them. The plot was a bit confusing but still works. It would work better if there was a Mummy 3 to come.<br/><br/>The Mummy is certainly popular and all I can say is I can´t get enough of it, it´s just a fun, entertaining movie... honestly, what else do people need?"

","I just saw this on TV - thank God I didn't pay good money to see it on video or in the theatre.  I like a silly movie now and then, but silly movies don't have to be stupid - in fact, they can benefit a great deal from an underlying intelligence and sharp wit. But this....pfffft. I was hurling abuse at the TV screen most of the time. It is unbelievable how many mistakes there are in the film: Thebes is in the south of Egypt, and there are no pyramids around it. And what was that stupid desert battle at the beginning? In 1923, Egypt was already under colonial (British) rule, and the main fighters for her freedom were Egyptian politicians of the Wafd party, dressed in Western-style suits and wearing red tarboushes - very, very few Egyptians dress, then or now, the way they did in this movie, all turbans and ""dresses"". No European would have been thrown in an Egyptian prison then; foreign residents in Egypt enjoyed the privileges of not being subject to Egyptian law for years. The museum of antiquities does not look anything like it does in the movies, and moreover was known then not as ""Mathaf el-'Athaar"" but as the Antik-khana, as Egypt's Turkish-speaking royal family then referred to it. And the actors' Arabic was appalling! What are these horrible accents? They can barely make themselves understood to anyone who *does* speak it. The Tuareg, the desert tribes mentioned in the movie, live in the western part of the Sahara, nowhere near Egypt.<br/><br/>
But worst of all is the racial stereotyping: most of the Egyptians are drawn as cartoonish villains, greedy, cruel and stinking. What rubbish. No wonder this film didn't last a week in Egyptian cinemas.<br/><br/>I would have laughed a lot more if there had been more authenticity (the heroine is, after all, a budding Egyptologist as well as being half-Egyptian), and if it had a little (a lot?) more respect for the history and culture of the people it was so blithely milking for millions of dollars... I wish the studios would remember that not all those in their audience are ignorant people who would believe & enjoy any trash they may care to throw at them. And I have a lot less respect for all the actors who took part in this fiasco, too."

"Rebochan","Null","0","1","29 March 2002"," Pathetic
","I was thoroughly let down by this movie.  I couldn't even enjoy it for it's camp value.  Campy horror is when you're supposed to be scared by the monster and you can clearly see the zipper on the back of the suit.  Once you get computer-generated beetles crawling under people's skin, looking genuinely real, it's not campy, it's just sick.<br/><br/>The plot involves a group of extremely stupid people going into the city of the dead, Hamunaptra.  There's semi-geeky Evie, her goofy and greedy brother Jonathan, and there's our ""hero"" Rick, played by Brendan Fraser.  He apparently thinks he's Harrison Ford, because he keeps acting like a rip-off of Indiana Jones, made worse by the fact that Fraser cannot act.  Evie despises Rick, which you know means by the end of the film they'll be passionately in love with each other.  There's a group of five typically rude and extra stupid Americans that decide to race our heros to the tomb. Between these two groups of stupid people, they unleash Imhotep, a head priest who was mummified alive and cursed so that if he were ever awakened, the world would suffer ten plagues.  By now the stupid people are becoming overwhelming, so the movie starts killing them off one by one.<br/><br/>This movie seems to have spent a lot of time plotting gruesome deaths for it's characters.  I can just imagine a meeting of the screenwriters, where they're all trying to outdo each other with the most sickening idea that won't go over a PG-13.  They probably spent more time on this than the rest of the plot.  Well, that and writing aciton sequences that are more laughable than thrilling.  Also, hundreds of innocent people are killed or hurt by all these plagues, and while our heros are ""good"" for going after the mummy, why does the movie never address that their actions had such far-reaching consequences?"

","In ancient Egypt high priest Imhotep is having an affair with Anck-su-namun, the mistress of his Pharaoh Seti.  When discovered Anck-su-namun kills Seti but both she and Imhotep are captured.  Anck-su-namnun kills herself but Imhotep is caught and mummified alive.  In 1923 adventurer takes Egyptologist Evelyn and her brother Jonathon to the city of the dead.  While searching for the Book of the Living they accidentally release Imhotep who plans to bring Anck-su-namun back to life and to rule the world from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>This is very much of a mix between Sam Rami's Evil Dead and Raiders of the lost ark - Raiders of the Undead, if you will.  However it never reaches the level of those.  The plot is so full of holes that even when played tongue in cheek it's still hard to swallow.  The film moves very fast through a large number of action scenes and you never really get the chance to notice the holes until it's finished.  The action scenes are well handled and the special effects are really impressive.<br/><br/>Fraser is not a great action hero - he's a great actor, but here he just has to be a wise-cracking hero.  Weisz is pretty dire, she doesn't have much to do and takes her role way too seriously.  Hannah deserves to have better roles, but at least he knows to mess around for the whole film.  Vosloo is good and the support cast are OK.<br/><br/>Although the film's all a bit loud, but it's good fun throughout and there's much to enjoy.  Overall it's just another Hollywood blockbuster - loud, brash and clumsy, as long as you don't expect anything more then you won't be disappointed."

","MORD39 RATING:   0  out of  ****<br/><br/>About 16 years ago a certain Freddy Krueger came on the scene and tarnished the horror film. Thanks to his Don Rickles Style of wisecracks, the genre has never recovered.<br/><br/>Several years after that we were give TERMINATOR 2. Although the film managed to be good, we saw the true blossoming of a quick and easy way to produce special effects: CGI graphics. While it was okay for T2, who could know that this ""morphing"" would become the rule for nearly every horror and science fiction movie to follow?<br/><br/>This practice has reached its peak in the God-awful ""remake"" of THE MUMMY. It's filled with silly humor and computer graphic effects, and it's a disgrace to all horror films from the silent era to this very day. The characters are morons, the film is never serious, and the mind-numbing excesses of sfx just made me bored beyond endurance. I didn't know what I was watching during the entire film, but I suppose that's supposed to be the way it works. I must be wrong (hah!) because the movie was an enormous success, and a sequel is on its way (I won't see it).<br/><br/>MTV has gone ballistic in THE MUMMY. It's suitable for 14 -year-old's of all ages. A quick glimpse of this, a flash of that......and what is it all about?<br/><br/>The actual ""mummy"" (again note the use of quotation marks) is a computer-generated corpse/ghoul. It doesn't look like any mummy I've ever seen (in the movies or at museums). When it actually opens its moronic mouth and starts to SPEAK(??!!??) in a typically demonic-like tone, I give up.<br/><br/>And who was the bald guy supposed to be? And why does he open his mouth about twelve stories (thanks to CGI) and how does he have that ability? I know the real answer...just to blow away the audience with endless computer effects tricks to justify their overpriced tickets.<br/><br/>The horror genre is dead. It's been on its way for at least the past 15 years. THE MUMMY (1999) is a mindless mesh of mush...all laughs, all stupidity, total chaos, no point. It cannot touch the Boris Karloff 1932 original, the Hammer 1959 version, or even WE WANT OUR MUMMY (with The Three Stooges)."

","I don't often actually go to the cinema to see a film, i usually wait till it comes out on video, but when i do go, few films actually blow me away. After seeing The Mummy, i left the cinema with very much the same feeling i had after seeing Fight Club. It was a feeling of astonishment, and total satisfaction, like i said, the film blew me away. I was literally speechless when i left the cinema.<br/><br/>I'm not saying the mummy is the greatest film ever, because after having watched it well over 50 times by now, i know this is not so, but what amazed me was how efficient and how enjoyable the film was. Not many films leave me feeling the way the mummy did.<br/><br/>I was already a fan of Stephen Sommers' earlier film Deep Rising (1998), but i didn't expect that he could follow up with such a treat.<br/><br/>The acting is great, everyone involved effectively sends up their characters. Brendan Fraser is the perfect goofy hero, putting himself up there with Bruce Campbell and the like. He has made a seamless move into the blockbuster territory. Rachel Weisz is pretty good, but pretty unspectacular as the love interest (I can think of many young actresses who could just have easily played the role), but it is refreshing to see a British actress given a major role in a hollywood film. Which brings me on to another fellow Brit, John Hannah, who can't fail but be excellent in everything he turns his unique talents to (remember the funeral scene in Four Weddings?). Arnold Vosloo came as a surprise, I remember him from Hard Target (1993), but unfortunately very little else. I find this surprising as he is a very striking actor, with great ability. He has very little to say in the film, but dialogue is only half of acting. His screen presence added a lot to the film, and i hope to see him in a lot more. The real star of the show though, is the criminally underated Kevin J 'O'Conner. He plays the main comedy relief, and is just so excellent at it. His performance seems so effortless (Even though he plays a bad guy, that is meant as a compliment) and like Vosloo, he adds a lot to the film.<br/><br/>The script, like Deep Rising, spends a lot of time poking fun at itself, and the main thing is, it doesn't take itself too seriously. There is a great deal of intelligent humour, intertwined with belly laughs, which is a winning formula for a blockbuster.<br/><br/>The main thing in any film of this type though, is always the special effects, which are near perfect. The scarab beetles are superb, the sandstorm absolutely gobsmacking on the big screen (the shot where the plane flies towards the camera, with the sandstorm appearing over a cliff in the bakground then crashing down mere feet in front of us blew me away), the undead mummies at the end of the film, as well as the warrior mummies were expertley rendered and animated, paying homage to the work of Ray Harryhausen, and the main Mummy itself, before regenerating was quite a lot like the termintator, but still very impressive. Some of the digital makeup on Vosloo, was a little sloppy, and a few easy to spot green screen shots, are the only glitch in the effects.<br/><br/>What the film does lack is a sense of atmosphere, which is a great shame, because a lot of effort has been put into the sets, so much so, that at times you do feel like you're in a studio. A very predictable storyline, and ending is another flaw with the film, but these are only minor defaults, because the film is not about story, it's about fun.<br/><br/>If you want two hours of pure old fashioned Indiana Jones inspired hijinks, then check this film out. It won't be to everyone's tastes, but what is?<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5"

The special effects are excellent, but they never overwhelm the human aspects, such as the heartstopping pulchritude of British beauty Rachel Weisz or the chemistry that evolves between her and leading man Brendan Fraser. The minor characters are also very well handled. While the plot is fairly straight-lined, there are some pretty good lines. For instance, when a polyglot would-be victim importunes the ancient Egyptian monster in a variety of languages, brandishing the corresponding religious symbol of each, the mummy ignores all until he gets to Hebrew. ""Ah, the language of the slaves,"" he says, sparing the man's life, ""You may be useful.""<br/><br/>Kids, don't try to pick up too much Egyptian history from this tale.

","A good film with some fantastic sfx.....but what was missing? Perhaps a bullwhip, fedora and Harrison Ford?<br/><br/>This film was blatently written to be Indy 4 (or should have been).  There were characters such as John Hannah who could just as easily been Marcus Brody from the Indy trilogy.<br/><br/>The American team that they were competing against could have been the Nazi's from the other films.<br/><br/>Other 'trademarks' were the occurance of the ""swarm"" (snakes, bugs, rats and now scarabs).  To top it all off, at the end there was even the classic Indy dive under the door.<br/><br/>Other than that a good film, but I was just waiting for the ""de de de da, da de da"" (doesn't work without a sound card) :-)"

","I was unsure if this film was meant to be a comedy or an action movie. In the event it was neither. The two main characters were awful. The special FX were good and the mummys stole the film! All in all, this is a silly film with bad acting and good special effects, best suited to 10 year old boys. It was also a bit sexist and racist. I gave it 5/10. Go see The Matrix instead."
"Jorgen-8","4","0","1","27 June 1999"," Not worth seeing
","""The Mummy"" is an unfocused piece of work. Not knowing which genre to settle in, it turns from the purest action/adventure in  typical Indiana Jones-style to a hack'n slay-fest with ""Army of Darkness"" as the closest point of comparison. Unfortunately this is not a very successful attempt; Brendan Fraser is neither a Ford nor a Campbell, and Weisz doesn't add much spice to the screenplay  Hannah and O'Connor are fresh breaths of air but nothing more. Also, the special effects were, in my opinion, somewhat overrated and don't quite succeed in adding that special touch which a film of this orientation demands. Overall - this is not an above average film."
"Math Wiz","4","0","1","18 June 1999"," Very suspenseful, high action
","I think that ""The Mummy"" is a very good movie. It is very suspenseful and is packed full of action. It has some parts in it that are sort of creepy, but that's what you should expect by the title of it. Some little kids might be scared by some parts of it. Overall, I think it had a very good story and I recommend it."
